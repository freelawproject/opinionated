(collectively, \"defendants\") appeal from order entered 20 January 2005\n   denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration, and from order entered 28 September 2004 denying in part defendants' motion to compel and granting in part Fannie Lee Tillman's and Shirley Richardson's, on behalf of all others similarly situated (collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), motion for protective order. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs are North Carolina borrowers who obtained financing from or through defendant Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. (\"Commercial Credit\"). Plaintiffs asserted a class action suit against defendants in the Vance County Superior Court in June 2002 and alleged defendants acted unlawfully in connection with mortgage loans defendants made to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs complain Commercial Credit sold them single premium credit insurance they did not need or want without disclosing such insurance was optional, and that Commercial Credit was the beneficiary of the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Credit insurance was purchased by plaintiffs in connection with their mortgage loans and benefits are paid to the lender if a covered event occurs. Credit insurance coverages include: (1) credit life, which pays off the loan in the event of the borrower's death; (2) credit disability, which makes the monthly mortgage payments if the borrower becomes disabled; and (3) credit involuntary unemployment, which makes the monthly mortgage payments if the borrower becomes involuntarily unemployed. Single premium credit insurance requires the borrower to pay the entire expected term of coverage at the time the mortgage loan is closed. The up-front premium is financed as a part of the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs' loan agreements contain an arbitration provision. The provision is contained in an outlined box with the heading:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    \"READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS CERTAIN OF YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN REDRESS THROUGH COURT ACTION.\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The arbitration provision provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon written request by either party that is submitted according to the applicable rules for arbitration, any Claim, except those specified below in this Provision, shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with (i) the Federal Arbitration Act; (ii) the Expedited Procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"Administrator\"); and (iii) this Provision, unless we both agree in writing to forego arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This provision excludes two types of claims from arbitration: (1) \"Any action to effect a foreclosure to transfer title to the property being foreclosed;\" and (2) \"Any matter where all parties seek monetary damages in the aggregate of $15,000 or less in total damages (compensatory and punitive), costs, and fees.\" The provision further provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    No Class Actions/No Joinder of Parties.\n   </em>\n   You agree that any arbitration proceeding will only consider Your Claims. Claims by or on behalf of other borrowers will not be arbitrated in any proceeding that is considering Your Claims. Similarly, You may not join with other borrowers to bring Claims in the same arbitration proceeding, unless all of the borrowers are parties to the same Credit Transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The arbitration provision requires the party initiating the arbitration to pay the first $125.00 toward arbitration costs. Commercial Credit agreed to pay \"all other costs for the arbitration proceeding up to a maximum of one day (8 hours) of hearings.\" It further provides, \"All costs of the arbitration proceeding that exceed one day of hearings will be paid by the non-prevailing party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The arbitration agreements gives either party the right to appeal the arbitrator's award to a three-arbitrator panel \"which shall reconsider\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   any aspect of the initial award requested by the appealing party.\" The appealing party is required to pay the costs of initiating the appeal. The non-prevailing party is required to pay all costs, fees, and expenses of the appeal and may be required to reimburse the prevailing party for the cost of initiating the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration in the Vance County Superior Court\n   and was heard on 16 December 2004. The trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law and denied defendants' motion. Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred by: (1) concluding plaintiffs could avoid the agreements to arbitrate because of the alleged costs of arbitration; (2) concluding the parties' arbitration agreements were unenforceable because it precludes class actions; and (3) imposing a \"mutuality\" requirement on arbitration agreements that does not exist under North Carolina law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    III. Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   An order denying defendants' motion to compel arbitration is not a final judgment and is interlocutory. However, an order denying arbitration is immediately appealable because it involves a substantial right, the right to arbitrate claims, which might be lost if appeal is delayed.\n   <em>\n    Burke v. Wilkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11204567\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/131/687/#p688\">\n    131 N.C.App. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=507%20S.E.2d%20913\">\n    507 S.E.2d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A dispute can only be settled by arbitration if a valid arbitration agreement exists. The party seeking arbitration must show that the parties mutually agreed to arbitrate their disputes. The trial court's findings regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement are conclusive on appeal where supported by competent evidence, even where the evidence might have supported findings to the contrary. However, the trial court's determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration is a conclusion of law that is reviewable\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Revels v.

The Commercial Credit arbitration clause, as written, exposes borrowers to prohibitively high arbitration costs. The arbitration clause exposes consumers to arbitrator fees, based upon the AAA average for North Carolina, of $1,225.00 per day\n   <em>\n    after the first eight hours of hearings.\n   </em>\n   For example, a three-day arbitration with an arbitrator charging the average AAA hourly fee in North Carolina could cost a borrower $2,450.00 plus costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator charged the high end of the range in North Carolina, a borrower could face arbitration fees of $4,760.00 for a three-day arbitration, plus costs and attorneys' fees. (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   5. Defendant's arbitration clause provides for a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal from the initial arbitration proceeding. The\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal would be to a three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration clause contains a fee-shifting provision with respect to costs of that\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal. That is,\n   <em>\n    the party that loses the appeal\n   </em>\n   \"shall pay all costs, fees, and expenses of the appeal proceeding\" even if that party had won the initial arbitration proceeding. Thus, a consumer seeking to vindicate her rights through the arbitration process faces the prospect of paying not only arbitrator fees for the initial arbitration proceeding exceeding eight hours, but also much greater costs associated with the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal. For example, a two-day appeal could cost a borrower $7,350.00 in arbitrator fees alone, with a three-arbitrator panel charging the AAA average arbitrator fee. These appeal costs would be borne by a borrower even if the borrower had prevailed at the initial arbitration proceeding. (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to litigation costs, the trial court found:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   15. Based upon the 1998 North Carolina Bar Association Economic Survey, the most recent survey published, the average hourly rate for attorneys working on litigation matters such as this is between $150.00-$250.00 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   . . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   19. To successfully prosecute a complex case, including a class action such as this one, a law firm would likely need the assistance of expert witnesses. The hourly fees of experts in the fields of economics, lending practices, and credit insurance can range from $150.00 to $300.00 per hour, plus expenses. In complex cases, litigation costs and expenses, including deposition costs, travel expenses, and expert witness fees, can easily run into thousands of dollars. The class action mechanism allows persons with relatively small claims to pool their resources and have those litigation expenses and costs shared among all class members. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   6. The fees and costs associated with both the initial arbitration proceeding and any appeal to a three-arbitrator panel are beyond what would be incurred by a civil litigant in the court system. These fees and costs may deter a substantial number of consumers from pursuing valid claims. The cost-shifting (\"loser pays\") provisions of the arbitration clause further serve as a substantial deterrent to consumers attempting to pursue claims against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs' counsel filed an affidavit in which he stated, \"In complex cases such as this, costs and expenses advanced by our law firm can total more than $150,000.00.\" Plaintiffs argued to the trial court that the costs involved in arbitrating their claims \"represent a cost that would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be incurred in civil court.\" Plaintiffs argued that if this case were tried in civil court it would be certified as a class action and the costs of the lawsuit, if it was successful, would be shared among the class members and taxed against defendants. This arrangement \"places the risk associated with the case on the law firm.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   North Carolian State Bar Revised Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.5(c) (2006) (\"A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee\n   is prohibited by paragraph (d) or other law.\"). Even though plaintiffs may sign a contingency agreement with their attorneys, they are still liable for the\n   <em>\n    costs\n   </em>\n   of the litigation. The State Bar ruled in RPC 124 (January 17, 1992) (\"RPC 124\") that \"an attorney may never ethically agree to be ultimately responsible for the costs of litigation.\" An attorney cannot agree with his or her client to bear all or some of the costs of litigation. Under the arbitration agreements, after paying the $125.00 initiation fee plaintiffs are only liable for the costs if the arbitration exceeds \"one day (8 hours) of hearings.\" The costs of filing suit in the North Carolina superior courts is $95.00. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A-305 (2005). Plaintiffs' counsel stated in his affidavit that advanced costs and expenses could total more than $150,000.00. The costs plaintiffs would bear for litigation would likely be higher than the costs they would bear for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs also failed to address or quantify the costs of litigation associated with this lawsuit if they\n   <em>\n    were not\n   </em>\n   successful in the superior court or the costs of an appeal. Their argument solely focuses on the costs of arbitration only if the arbitration exceeds \"one day (8 hours) of hearings\" and plaintiffs were the non-prevailing party and sought a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal. Plaintiffs costs comparison between arbitration and civil litigation also presumes plaintiffs would be the non-prevailing party in arbitration and would be the prevailing party in litigation. This argument is an \"apples to oranges\" comparison. Plaintiffs also failed to equate the time and costs between a \"bench trial\" and arbitration hearing, both lasting up to eight hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument is premised upon the same kind of \"risk\" of prohibitive arbitration costs the Supreme Court addressed in\n   <em>\n    Green Tree Financial.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs failed to fairly measure the costs of arbitration \"against a baseline of the claimant's expected costs for litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bradford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142549\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/549/#p556\">\n    238 F.3d at 556, n. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Speculative assertions . . . do not constitute competent evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    MCC Outdoor, LLC v.

Upon\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, the trial court's conclusion that plaintiffs would be deterred from bringing their claims against defendants due to the class action\n   waiver is erroneous in light of the express arbitration provisions and plaintiffs' assertion of claims under N.C.

The Commercial Credit arbitration clause used in North Carolina since February 12, 1996 is one-sided and lacks mutuality, in that it preserves for the lender the right to pursue almost all claims it would choose to pursue in civil court while denying that right to borrowers in most instances. The arbitration clause contains exceptions for foreclosure actions and claims in which the amount sought, including costs and attorneys' fees is under $15,000.00. This portion of the clause preserves for the lender the only remedies it would be likely to assert against borrowers - foreclosure and collection actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The trial court's order cites cases from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, the Supreme Court of Tennessee, the Supreme Court of Arkansas, and the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia to support its conclusion.

Under North Carolina law, \"mutuality\" merely requires consideration on each side of a contract. Mutuality does not require that each of the contract terms must apply equally to both parties to be enforceable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20S.E.%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Want of mutuality is merely one form of want of consideration. But a single consideration may support several promises; it is not necessary that each promise have a separate consideration. Hence, a covenant which imposes obligations upon one party only may be enforceable if it is part of an entire contract which is supported by a sufficient consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=147%20S.E.%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Likewise, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 79 (1979) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   If the requirement of consideration is met, there is no additional requirement of:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (a) a gain, advantage, or benefit to the promisor or a loss, disadvantage, or detriment to the promisee; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (b) equivalence in the values exchanged; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   (c) \"mutuality of obligation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Even under a \"mutuality of obligation\" analysis, we fail to see how the exclusions in the arbitration agreements are not mutual. The language of the arbitration provision states, \"The following types of matters will not be arbitrated. This means that\n   <em>\n    neither one of us\n   </em>\n   can require the other to arbitrate.\" (Emphasis supplied). The first exclusion covers claims \"where all parties seek monetary damages . . . of $15,000 or less.\" This exclusion applies equally to both plaintiffs and defendants. If defendants had asserted a lawsuit in civil court for damages of $15,000.00 or more against plaintiffs on their promissory notes, plaintiffs can compel defendants into arbitration under their agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The second exclusion from arbitration for \"[a]ny action to effect a foreclosure to transfer title to the property being foreclosed\" is also mutual. Neither party can force the other to arbitrate such a claim. Further, the fact that the North Carolina superior courts have \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over any action affecting title to land is a good reason to exclude foreclosure actions from arbitration agreements.

Because the findings are necessary for a full understanding of the issues before this Court, I recite them here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   1. Plaintiffs, Fannie Lee Tillman and Shirley Richardson, filed this putative class action lawsuit pursuant to Rule 23 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure on June 24, 2002. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of borrowers who obtained loans from Defendant Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. (now known as and hereinafter referred to as \"CitiFinancial Services, Inc.\" or \"Defendant\") and who were sold single-premium credit insurance by Defendant in connection with their loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   2. Single-premium credit insurance (\"SPCI\") is a type of credit insurance sold by a lender to a borrower in which the borrower is charged the entire insurance premium at the time the underlying loan is originated, with the premium being financed into and over the life of the loan. As a result of the premium charge being financed, the loan principal is increased by the amount of the premium charge, and the borrower pays interest on the increased principal, including the insurance premium, for the entire life of the loan. Furthermore, the increase in loan principal leads to a concomitant increase in certain loan costs such as origination fees and points. With the passage of the North Carolina Predatory Lending Law, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 24-1.1E, it has been unlawful to finance the premium costs of single-premium\n   credit insurance since July 1, 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   3. Plaintiff Fannie Lee Tillman obtained a loan from Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. (hereafter \"Commercial Credit\") on September 22, 1998. Ms. Tillman's loan included single-premium credit life insurance with a premium costing $1,058.80 and single-premium credit disability insurance with a premium costing $1,005.95. The amount financed in connection with this loan was $18,253.68, with $2,064.75 attributable to single-premium credit insurance. The interest rate on the loan was over 15%. The loan proceeds were used, in part, to pay off another Commercial Credit loan which had been originated eight months earlier, in January 1998. Ms. Tillman was also sold credit insurance, with premiums costing $1,799.95, in connection with the earlier Commercial Credit loan. The interest rate on the earlier loan was over 20%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   4. Plaintiff Fannie Lee Tillman has limited financial resources. She works as a sewer at Wayne Industries in Archdale, North Carolina, and her take-home pay is approximately $258.00 per week after taxes. She has worked at Wayne Industries for roughly 18 years, and the $8.50 hourly rate she currently receives is the most she has earned at that job. Ms. Tillman receives $285.60 per month in pension benefits from her deceased husband's employer. She receives $1,063.00 per month in Social Security benefits. Ms. Tillman has no other sources of income. Ms. Tillman's most significant asset is her home in High Point, North Carolina. That home is worth approximately $60,000.00 to $65,000.00 and is encumbered by a first and second mortgage with balances which are roughly equal to the value of the home. Ms. Tillman is 66 years of age. She completed the seventh grade but then had to begin working full-time to help support her family. Ms. Tillman does not have a retirement plan or any significant savings. The balance in Ms. Tillman's checking account is typically under $100.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   5. Plaintiff Shirley Richardson obtained a loan from Commercial Credit on 4 June 1999. The amount financed in that loan was $20,935.57, with $4,208.75 attributable to single-premium credit insurance. The interest rate was over 15%. In connection with that loan, Ms. Richardson was charged $1,871.54 for single-premium credit life insurance, $1,109.49 for single-premium credit disability insurance, and $1,227.72 for single-premium credit involuntary unemployment insurance. Ms. Richardson had received two prior loans from Commercial Credit, and both of those loans included single-premium credit insurance. Those prior Commercial Credit loans were originated in October 1997 and April 1998; Ms. Richardson was charged $3,782.96 for credit insurance premiums in connection with those loans. With her June 4, 1999 loan, Ms. Richardson was also charged $499.95 for a \"Home Security Plan.\" She was not told what that product or service is at the time of closing or at any point thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   6. Plaintiff Shirley Richardson has few economic resources. Ms. Richardson works full-time in the medical records section at Murdock Center in Henderson, North Carolina, where she earns $12.70 per hour. She also works part-time at the Louisburg Group Home as a direct care aide, earning $12.00 per hour during the 10-15 hours per week she works that job. Ms. Richardson, who is 52 years of age, had $2,523.25 in her retirement account as of the date of the hearing of this matter. Ms. Richardson lives from paycheck to paycheck, and after paying her monthly bills often has no money in her bank account. Ms. Richardson's most significant asset is her home in Henderson, North Carolina, which is encumbered by a first and second mortgage. Ms. Richardson has substantial outstanding credit card debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   7. CitiFinancial Services, Inc. is a subprime lender which typically loans money to borrowers, such as Plaintiffs Tillman and Richardson, with impaired credit who oftentimes would not qualify for financing at lending institutions primarily making loans in the prime, or conventional, lending market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   8. Since February 12, 1996, CitiFinancial Services, Inc. has included an arbitration clause in its loan agreements. Prior to that time, Defendant's loan agreements did not contain an arbitration clause. . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   9. The Commercial Credit arbitration clause is a standard-form contract of adhesion. The borrower is given no opportunity to negotiate out of the arbitration provision, and CitiFinancial Services, Inc. would not make a loan if the loan agreement did not include the arbitration provision. The loan documents, including the arbitration provision at issue, were drafted by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   10. Since the time CitiFinancial Services, Inc. began including an arbitration clause in its loan agreements, the lender has made more than 68,000 loans in North Carolina. During that time, CitiFinancial Services, Inc. has pursued lawsuits in civil court against more than 3,700 borrowers in North Carolina, including over 2,000 collection actions and more than 1,700 foreclosure actions. Defendant has been able to pursue claims in civil court by virtue of two exceptions within the arbitration clause, which Defendant drafted, for (1) foreclosure actions and (2) matters in which less than $15,000.00 in damages, including costs and fees, are sought. The average amount in dispute in matters in which CitiFinancial Services, Inc. pursued legal action against North Carolina borrowers is under $7,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   11. Since the time CitiFinancial Services, Inc. began including an arbitration provision in its loan agreements, there have been no arbitration proceedings in North Carolina involving CitiFinancial Services, Inc. and any of its borrowers. Since introduction of the arbitration clause, no North Carolina borrower has requested arbitration of any dispute with CitiFinancial Services, Inc., nor has CitiFinancial Services, Inc. demanded arbitration of any dispute involving any North Carolina borrower. The only legal redress sought has been the collection and foreclosure actions pursued in civil court by Defendant against its borrowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   12. The only persons present at the loan closings involving Plaintiffs Tillman and Richardson were Plaintiffs and a Commercial Credit loan officer. Ms. Tillman and Ms. Richardson were rushed through the loan closings, and the Commercial Credit loan officer indicated where Ms. Tillman and Ms. Richardson were to sign or initial the loan documents. There was no mention of credit insurance or the arbitration clause at the loan closings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   14. Plaintiffs Fannie Lee Tillman and Shirley Richardson entered into contingency fee contracts with the attorneys representing them. The contingency fee contract is typical of such agreements. The contingency fee agreement entered into by Plaintiffs provides that their attorneys will not be entitled to any fee unless there is some monetary recovery obtained on behalf of Plaintiffs, either by way of settlement or verdict. The agreement further provides that the law firm representing Plaintiffs shall advance the costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   15. Based upon the 1998 North Carolina Bar Association Economic Survey, the most recent survey published, the average hourly rate for attorneys working on litigation matters such as this is between $150.00-$250.00 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   16. . . . . The only realistic means by which persons in the position of Plaintiffs can prosecute their claims is by entering into a contingency fee agreement with lawyers willing to advance the costs and expenses of the litigation and with the law firm assuming the risk that there might be no recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   19. To successfully prosecute a complex case, including a class action such as this one, a law firm would likely need the assistance of expert witnesses. The hourly fees of experts in the fields of economics, lending practices, and credit insurance can range from $150.00 to $300.00 per hour, plus expenses. In complex cases, litigation costs and expenses, including deposition costs, travel expenses, and expert witness fees, can easily run into thousands of dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The class action mechanism allows persons with relatively small claims to pool their resources and have those litigation expenses and costs shared among all class members. The class action device provides a means by which consumers with modest damages claims can obtain representation by competent counsel with sufficient resources to afford protracted litigation in complex cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The trial court also made the following findings, portions of which are disputed by defendants:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   13. The compensation rates for American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") arbitrators in North Carolina range from $500.00 to $2,380.00 per day. The average daily rate of AAA arbitrator compensation in North Carolina is $1,225.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   17. Plaintiffs asserted claims for relief under Chapter 75 of the North Carolina General Statutes, contending that Defendants' sale of single-premium credit insurance in connection with real estate loans constituted an unfair or deceptive trade practice or act in or affecting commerce. Plaintiffs seek damages based upon the amount of premiums charged for those credit insurance products. In most cases, the premium charges for single-premium credit insurance sold by CitiFinancial Services, Inc. were under $5,000.00 per loan. Plaintiff Fannie Lee Tillman was charged $2,064.75 in single-premium credit insurance premiums in connection with her September 22, 1998 loan; Plaintiff Shirley Richardson was charged $4,208.75 for single-premium credit insurance with her June 4, 1999 loan. The relatively modest damages claimed by Plaintiffs make it unlikely that any attorneys would be willing to accept the risks attendant to pursuing claims against one of the nation's largest lenders, even with the prospect of a treble damages award and statutory attorney's fees. It would not be feasible to prosecute the claims of the named Plaintiffs and of putative class members on an individual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   18. Defendant's arbitration clause contains features which would deter many consumers from seeking to vindicate their rights. These features include the cost-shifting (\"loser pays\") provision with respect to the initial arbitration proceeding to the extent it exceeds eight hours, the cost-shifting provision associated with the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   appeal from that initial arbitration proceeding, and the prohibition on joinder of claims and class actions. The prohibition on class actions and the cap of $15,000.00 on the value of claims that can be pursued outside of the arbitration process designed by Defendant makes it unlikely that borrowers would be able to retain lawyers willing to pursue litigation against a large commercial entity, such as CitiFinancial Services, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Based on these findings, the trial court determined the arbitration clause to be unconscionable and denied defendants' motion to compel arbitration. Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \"Although arbitration is favored in the law, in order to be enforced, the underlying agreement must first be shown to be valid as determined by a common law contract analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

Although any one of these factors, standing alone, might withstand judicial scrutiny, the trial court concluded that \"[t]he combination of these factors, taken on the whole, render the Commercial Credit arbitration clause unconscionable.\" In separately rejecting each ground as a basis for the trial court's decision, the majority fails to recognize or address the combined impact of these three factors on the fundamental fairness of the contracts at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   With regard to the costs of arbitration, the majority rejects the trial court's conclusion that the costs of arbitration would be \"prohibitive\" as unsupported by the evidence. The majority overlooks numerous key and uncontradicted findings by the trial court, however, and misapplies the law to the case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For example, the majority complains that \"[p]laintiffs . . . failed to address or quantify the costs of litigation associated with this lawsuit if they\n   <em>\n    were not\n   </em>\n   successful in the superior court or the costs of an appeal.\" However, as recognized by the majority and expressly found by the trial court, plaintiffs entered into a contingency fee contract with their attorneys. The contingency fee contract provides that \"no attorney's fee will be charged Client at any time unless and until a recovery is obtained from Creditor.\" The agreement further provides that the law firm representing plaintiffs shall advance the costs and expenses incurred in prosecuting the action. Thus, under the contingency fee contract, if litigation was not successful and plaintiffs recovered nothing, they would owe no attorneys' fees. Under such a scheme, plaintiffs' attorneys bear the risk of any unsuccessful litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The majority cites\n   <em>\n    Bradford v. Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142549\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/549/#p556\">\n    238 F.3d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556 n. 5 (4th Cir.2001), as authority for the proposition that \"an appropriate case-by-case inquiry must focus upon a claimant's expected or actual arbitration costs\n   <em>\n    and his ability to pay those costs,\n   </em>\n   measured against a baseline of the claimant's expected costs for litigation\n   <em>\n    and his ability to pay those costs.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142549\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/549/#p556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The majority fails to recite the extensive findings made by the trial court which were unchallenged by defendants, detailing plaintiffs' extremely limited financial resources and their inability to pay the costs associated with arbitration. Indeed, the trial court found that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   [t]he only realistic means by which persons in the position of [p]laintiffs can prosecute their claims is by entering into a contingency fee agreement with lawyers willing to advance the costs and expenses of the litigation and with the law firm assuming the risk that there might be no recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In addition, the majority's selective reference to\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   omits language immediately following the statement quoted above: \"Another factor to consider in the cost-differential analysis is whether the arbitration agreement provides for fee-shifting, including the ability to shift forum fees based upon the inability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11142549\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/549/#p556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The arbitration agreement here provides for no fee-shifting based on plaintiffs' inability to pay - just the opposite.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bradford,\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs here presented substantial evidence, and the trial court found, that they were unable to pay the arbitration fees and costs, and that the arbitration clause contained features, such as the cost-shifting provision, that would deter many similarly-situated consumers from seeking to vindicate their rights. Such deterrence is evident from the uncontradicted fact that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Since the time CitiFinancial Services, Inc. began including an arbitration provision in its loan agreements, there have been no arbitration proceedings in North Carolina involving CitiFinancial Services, Inc. and any of its borrowers. Since introduction of the arbitration clause, no North Carolina borrower has requested arbitration of any dispute with CitiFinancial Services, Inc., nor has CitiFinancial Services, Inc. demanded arbitration of any dispute involving any North Carolina borrower. The only legal redress sought has been the collection and foreclosure actions pursued in civil court by Defendant against its borrowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The trial court also found that the \"average daily rate of AAA arbitrator compensation in North Carolina is $1,225.00.\" The trial court concluded that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Commercial Credit arbitration clause, as written, exposes borrowers to prohibitively high arbitration costs. The arbitration clause exposes consumers to arbitrator fees, based upon the AAA average for North Carolina, of $1,225.00 per day after the first eight hours of hearings. For example, a three-day arbitration with an arbitrator charging the average AAA hourly fee in North Carolina could cost a borrower $2,450.00, plus costs and attorneys' fees. If the arbitrator charged the high end of the range in North Carolina, a borrower could face arbitration fees of $4,760.00 for a three-day arbitration, plus costs and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiffs also presented substantial evidence of the expected costs of litigation and their ability to pay such costs. The trial court made detailed findings therefrom which supported its conclusions of law. I therefore disagree with the majority's conclusion that the trial court erred in finding the costs of arbitration to be prohibitive for these plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The majority also finds fault with the trial court's conclusion regarding lack of mutuality and the one-sided nature of the arbitration clause. After the majority cites and relies upon cases from the United States Courts of Appeal of the Third, Fourth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, and the appellate courts of Illinois, Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, and Texas, the majority chides the trial court for failing to cite to North Carolina precedent. The majority then applies an appellate decision from Maryland to the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The majority unfairly characterizes the trial court's conclusions regarding the one-sidedness of the arbitration clause as \"applying a requirement of mutuality to the arbitration agreement that is contrary to North Carolina law.\" The trial court, however, never concluded that the contract terms contained in the arbitration agreement had to apply equally to both parties to be enforceable. Rather, the trial court properly concluded that the one-sidedness and lack of mutuality of the arbitration clause was one factor in determining that the contract was unconscionable. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   where provisions in a contract are \"so one-sided that the contracting party is denied any opportunity for a meaningful choice, the contract should be found unconscionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Brenner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8564464\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/302/207/#p213\">\n    302 N.C. at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20S.E.2d%20206\">\n    274 S.E.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Here, the trial court found that \"CitiFinancial Services, Inc. is a subprime lender which typically loans money to borrowers, such as Plaintiffs Tillman and Richardson, with impaired credit who oftentimes would not qualify for financing at lending institutions primarily making loans in the prime, or conventional, lending market.\" The trial court made further findings detailing the inequality of the bargaining power between the parties as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   9. The Commercial Credit arbitration clause is a standard-form contract of adhesion. The borrower is given no opportunity to negotiate out of the arbitration provision, and CitiFinancial Services, Inc. would\n   not make a loan if the loan agreement did not include the arbitration provision. The loan documents, including the arbitration provision at issue, were drafted by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   10. Since the time CitiFinancial Services, Inc. began including an arbitration clause in its loan agreements, the lender has made more than 68,000 loans in North Carolina. During that time, CitiFinancial Services has pursued lawsuits in civil court against more than 3,700 borrowers in North Carolina, including over 2,000 collection actions and more than 1,700 foreclosure actions. Defendant has been able to pursue claims in civil court by virtue of two exceptions within the arbitration clause, which Defendant drafted, for (1) foreclosure actions and (2) matters in which less than $15,000.00 in damages, including costs and fees, are sought. The average amount in dispute in matters in which CitiFinancial Services, Inc. pursued legal action against North Carolina borrowers is under $7,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   11. Since the time CitiFinancial Services, Inc. began including an arbitration provision in its loan agreements, there have been no arbitration proceedings in North Carolina involving CitiFinancial Services, Inc. and any of its borrowers. Since introduction of the arbitration clause, no North Carolina borrower has requested arbitration of any dispute with CitiFinancial Services, Inc., nor has CitiFinancial Services, Inc. demanded arbitration of any dispute involving any North Carolina borrower. The only legal redress sought has been the collection and foreclosure actions pursued in civil court by Defendant against its borrowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Based in part on these uncontradicted findings, the trial court concluded that the arbitration clause was\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   one-sided and lacks mutuality, in that it preserves for the lender the right to pursue almost all claims it would choose to pursue in civil court while denying that right to borrowers in most instances. The arbitration clause contains exceptions for foreclosure actions and claims in which the amount sought, including costs and attorneys' fees, is under $15,000.00. This portion of the clause preserves for the lender the only remedies it would be likely to assert against borrowers - foreclosure and collection actions. A foreclosure action, coupled with or preceding a collection action for any shortfall, is all Defendant would need to enforce its rights under the real estate secured loans against its customers. Defendant has pursued such actions more than 3,700 times against North Carolina borrowers since the arbitration clause has been included in Defendant's loan agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   This conclusion is fully supported by the trial court's unchallenged findings of fact and should be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The majority nevertheless asserts that the arbitration clause is perfectly mutual because the exclusions \"apply equally\" to plaintiffs and defendants. This assertion completely fails to acknowledge that only defendants would have any interest in pursuing most actions under the exclusions. Quite obviously, plaintiffs would never be in a position to bring an \"action to effect a foreclosure.\" The fact that plaintiffs could not be forced to arbitrate such an action is therefore of no benefit whatsoever to plaintiffs and entirely to the benefit of defendants. Likewise, the exclusion of actions worth less than $15,000.00 is of most benefit to defendants, who have regularly used the exclusion in their collection actions. Plaintiffs meanwhile are faced with the difficulty of finding an attorney willing to pursue a claim where relatively modest damages are at stake. The \"mutuality\" found by the majority is therefore illusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Finally, the majority takes issue with the trial court's conclusion that \"[a] prohibition on the right to join claims and participate in class action lawsuits is a factor to be considered in determining whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable.\" The majority asserts that, in accepting plaintiffs' position that the preclusion of class actions deters them from bringing claims against defendants due to the modest damages at stake, the trial court \"ignore[d] the fact that the consumer protection statute underlying plaintiffs' claims provides for the recovery of\n   plaintiffs' costs and attorney's fees[.]\" The trial court, however, specifically found that \"[t]he relatively modest damages claimed by Plaintiffs make it unlikely that any attorneys would be willing to accept the risks attendant to pursuing claims against one of the nation's largest lenders,\n   <em>\n    even with the prospect of a treble damages award and statutory attorney's fees.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Thus the trial court specifically considered the possibility of the statutory recovery of costs and attorneys' fees and nevertheless found that the preclusion of class action would make it difficult for plaintiffs to enforce their rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The majority cites numerous cases from other jurisdictions in which the courts have upheld arbitration clauses which contained class action waivers. The majority acknowledges that these cases are not binding on this Court. Moreover, in many of the cases cited by the majority, the claimants' arguments were rejected because they failed to offer any evidence regarding the financial burden arbitration would pose.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Livingston v.
