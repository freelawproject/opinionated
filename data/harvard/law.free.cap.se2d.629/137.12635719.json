Haigwood on 8 October 2003 in Superior Court, Wayne County, upon jury verdicts finding defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree murder. On 21 December 2004, the Supreme Court allowed defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals as to his appeal of additional judgments. Heard in the Supreme Court 14 November 2005.\n </opinion>\n <attorneys id=\"p-8\">\n  Roy Cooper, Attorney General, by William B. Crumpler and Amy C. Kunstling, Assistant Attorneys General, for the State.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-9\">\n  Thomas K. Maher, Chapel Hill, for defendant-appellant.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-10\">\n   EDMUNDS, Justice.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Linwood Earl Forte was indicted for three counts of first-degree murder, three counts of first-degree rape, three counts of first-degree burglary, attempted first-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, first-degree arson, and burning of personal property. The charges were consolidated for trial, which began on 8 September 2003. At the close of the evidence, the charges of attempted first-degree murder and burning of personal property were dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 30 September 2003, defendant was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder. The jury recommended a sentence of death for each conviction and the trial court entered judgment accordingly. The jury also found defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree burglary and three counts of first-degree rape. The court arrested judgment on two of the first-degree burglary counts and sentenced defendant to four consecutive life sentences for the remaining burglary and rape convictions. Finally, the jury found defendant guilty of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, for which he received a twenty-year consecutive sentence, and first-degree arson, on which the court arrested judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant appealed his capital convictions to this Court and we allowed his motion to bypass the Court of Appeals as to his other convictions. We conclude that defendant's trial and capital sentencing proceeding were free from prejudicial error and that defendant's sentences of death were not disproportionate. However, we vacate the trial court's sentencing on the non-capital charges and remand for a new sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State's evidence showed that defendant committed three sets of offenses in Goldsboro. As to the first, in the early morning of 26 May 1990, seventy-year-old Eliza Jones was found in her bed, bruised, scratched, and struggling to breathe. She was suffering from oxygen deprivation as a result of strangulation and later recalled being choked and fondled by a man who had awakened her. Trauma to both her vagina and rectum indicated that she had been sexually assaulted after losing consciousness during the attack. Sperm was detected in vaginal and rectal smears and on the fitted sheet on Ms. Jones' bed. No perpetrator was identified at the time, so the evidence containing\n   the sperm was placed in frozen storage at the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) for possible future use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to the second offense, on the morning of 14 July 1990, police found the body of seventy-nine-year-old Hattie Bonner in her bed. She had died as a result of being both manually strangled and suffocated with a pillow. Vaginal swabs revealed the presence of sperm, and hairs and fibers were collected from the body. As in the Jones case, the evidence was retained by the SBI because investigators did not have a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, on 6 October 1990, the Goldsboro Fire Department responded to the home of seventy-eight-year-old Alvin Bowen and seventy-five-year-old Thelma Bowen. The house and an automobile in an adjoining carport were burning. Firefighters discovered Mr. Bowen's body on a bed and Mrs. Bowen's naked body lying face down on the floor nearby. Although both bodies were burned, an autopsy indicated that each had been killed before the fire started. Mr. Bowen died from stab wounds to his neck and chest, while Mrs. Bowen died from strangulation. Evidence suggested that Mrs. Bowen had been raped, and sperm was present in a vaginal smear. Firefighters discovered a trail of accelerant leading from the Bowens' bedroom through the house and out to the burning vehicle, where a gasoline can was found on the front seat. Again, the evidence was preserved in the absence of a suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Analysis of the DNA samples obtained in each of these incidents indicated that one person was responsible for all three attacks. During the 1990s, defendant was incarcerated on other unrelated charges and his DNA was recorded in the SBI database. In 2001, after defendant had been released, his DNA was matched with the DNA recovered from the unsolved cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 30 April 2001, defendant was working at a poultry processing plant. Several SBI agents and Goldsboro police officers approached defendant at work and asked if he would accompany them to the police station for an interview. Defendant was told that he was not under arrest and could return to work after the interview was completed. When defendant agreed, the officers gave him a ride to the police department. Defendant was not advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Once at the police station, the officers informed defendant that his DNA had been matched to the evidence in some unsolved cases and asked him to explain his involvement in the crimes. Defendant told police that during the late 1980s through 1990 he used crack cocaine heavily. He recalled going to a house he thought was his own, kicking in the door, and having \"sex with the woman inside.\" Defendant also stated that one night in 1990, he went into a residence near a school in Goldsboro where he drank beer and smoked cigarettes. He said he did not recall having sexual intercourse with anyone or any confrontation inside the house, but he could not remember what happened because he was high on crack and had blacked out while inside the house. He added that he may have dropped a lit match on his way out, and he remembered noticing the following day that the house had burned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant then agreed to ride with several of the investigators and point out the locations he had just discussed. Defendant first directed them to Eliza Jones' former address. Once there, defendant said that this was the place where \"the woman was not killed.\" He next took them to a vacant lot where the Bowens' home had stood before it burned and told the officers that this was where he drank beer and smoked cigarettes in the house. Finally, defendant led the officers to another vacant lot where Hattie Bonner's home had been. He explained that at this location, he entered the residence, had sexual intercourse with the lady inside, and choked her until she became unconscious. He recalled seeing yellow crime scene tape at the residence the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The police returned with defendant to the police station, where defendant agreed to provide blood and hair samples. For the first time, defendant was advised of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. One of the officers who was giving the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings asked defendant if he wanted to answer any more questions at that time. When defendant answered \"no,\" the officer asked defendant what he meant. Defendant responded that\n   he was tired and would answer more questions after he had a chance to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While defendant slept for several hours at the police station, one of the officers typed a statement based on the information defendant had already provided. When defendant awoke, he said he \"felt like talking some more.\" The investigators re-advised defendant of his rights, and defendant affirmed his willingness to continue. He reviewed the typed statement and signed it. Defendant then answered several additional questions asked by the officers, indicating that he knew right from wrong and that he had not been under duress at the time of the crimes, although he added that he had not been in \"the right frame of mind\" and \"was under the influence of drugs.\" The blood drawn from defendant on 30 April 2001 was analyzed by the SBI laboratory and found to match the DNA from the three 1990 crime scenes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additional evidence will be discussed below as necessary to address specific issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    GUILT-INNOCENCE PHASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant first contends that the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce certain SBI reports as substantive evidence because the law enforcement investigator who prepared the reports did not testify. The investigator in question, SBI Special Agent D.J. Spittle, did not participate in the investigation of the assault on victim Eliza Jones. However, as to victim Hattie Bonner, the evidence showed that Deborah Radisch, M.D. conducted an autopsy on 15 July 1990. Dr. Radisch provided vaginal swabs and smears to Officer Karen Laboard, who submitted the evidence to the SBI laboratory. As a serologist at the SBI laboratory in 1990, Agent Spittle would receive samples of blood and bodily fluids sent to the laboratory for analysis, examine the samples and identify the fluids, and then refer the material to other investigators in the laboratory for further analysis. His records reflected both the results of his investigation and his disposition of the evidence. After receiving and analyzing the serological evidence in the Bonner case, Agent Spittle on 27 November 1990 passed along to SBI Special Agent Michael Budzynski the evidence relating to sperm from the vaginal swabs and smears. Agent Budzynski determined that the DNA in the samples matched the DNA recovered in the Jones case, then preserved the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As to victim Thelma Bowen, an autopsy was conducted on 6 October 1990 by Frances Owl-Smith, M.D., who collected rectal and vaginal swabs that she provided to the police. The police submitted these samples to the SBI laboratory. Agent Spittle received and examined this evidence, then turned it over to Agent Budzynski on 27 November 1990. Agent Budzynski tested this material for DNA, noted that it matched the DNA in the samples recovered in the Jones and Bonner investigations, then preserved the evidence. In 2000, Agent Budzynski conducted a new DNA analysis of the evidence in all three cases and entered the updated results in the SBI computer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On 30 April 2001, the blood sample obtained from defendant by the Goldsboro police investigators was delivered to Agent Budzynski by SBI Agent Mark Nelson, who had been present when the sample was taken. Agent Budzynski determined that the DNA in defendant's blood matched to near certainty the DNA recovered from the Jones, Bonner, and Bowen crime scenes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Agent Spittle left his employment with the SBI in 2001 and did not testify at defendant's trial. His reports were introduced into evidence through Agent Nelson, who had been Agent Spittle's supervisor in the 1990s. The court admitted the reports into evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(6). Defendant argues that the introduction of the reports, containing both analysis results and chain of custody information, violated his constitutional right of confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, defendant argued only that the evidence was inadmissible under the rules relating to hearsay. After defendant's trial, the United States Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Crawford v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004), that admission at trial of testimonial evidence made by a non-testifying person violated the defendant's confrontation rights unless the declarant was currently unavailable to testify and\n   the defendant previously had the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    at 53-54, 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at 1365-66, 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at 194, 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, defendant was unable to cross-examine Agent Spittle. Therefore, we must determine whether his reports are testimonial statements that are inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    Crawford.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   declined to provide an overarching definition of \"testimonial\" evidence, it did give general guidance, along with some specific instances of evidence that is testimonial. \"Whatever else the term [testimonial] covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In enunciating its holding, the Supreme Court pointed out that an evil it was seeking to suppress was the danger inherent in having damning evidence admitted without being tested through cross-examination. \"Involvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse - a fact borne out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 56 n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1367 n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   196 n. 7.

The substance of witness Aiken's testimony was that the North Carolina prison system could securely house defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During the State's cross-examination of Aiken, the prosecutor elicited the following testimony:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. Can you tell the jury what kind of exercise people get to do when they are in maximum security like playing basketball or other activities?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A. They get to play basketball. They get to have noncontact sports but understanding is [sic] that you are playing with other dangerous people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Q. Other than basketball, what other type of exercise activities can prisoners do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Well, most of the weightlifting equipment have [sic] been moved out of the prison system but inmates can be involved with basketball as well as handball and sometimes volleyball.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. And there's the issue of entertainment. I guess the prison tries to keep prisoners entertained or distracted to some degree. Will Mr. Forte get some of that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   A. It's all in relationship to his behavior. Also what is allowed. The type of so-called recreation/entertainment is in direct relationship to his custody and supervision, which will always be in a maximum security environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. Which would include what?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Which would include being able to go to religious programs, that is, people coming in; singing groups, as an example.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. Go ahead, give us more examples. You have a lot of experience in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A. It's fairly limited in a maximum security environment because you don't let everybody come in and go out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   You do have some people that come in to provide lectures in relationship to how to improve your behavior, some people that have made mistakes in the past and was [sic] able to come back and share with people. Examples of that being Chuck Colson and his religious crusade coming in and providing religious worship for the inmate population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   You will find that mostly in a maximum security environment that \"entertainment\" is focused more on volunteers and people from the religious environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Q. Television?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A. Some have television, yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Q. Radio?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   A. Radios, yes. Of course, those are very closely supervised. And one additional thing is canteen. They can buy certain things off the canteen. That's considered as a privilege also. Visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Q. So they can go to their canteen store and get them a candy treat, things like that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   A.

Here, defense counsel\n   questioned Aiken as to the structure of the prison unit to show that defendant could be securely housed there without incident. The State responded by cross-examining Aiken about the particular conditions of that housing. The State's line of questioning was not outside the bounds of permissible cross-examination, nor was there any indication that the questions were not asked in good faith. There was no error, let alone plain error, in allowing this cross-examination to take place. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We now turn to the State's closing argument regarding the prison amenities.

The prosecutor's remarks are consistent with these prior holdings. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant further argues that the trial court erred in not acting to prevent the State from making other improper closing arguments during the sentencing proceeding. Specifically, defendant claims that it was improper for the State to argue that Mrs. Bowen's awareness of her husband's murder before her own death made her murder especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Defendant also contends that a portion of the State's argument was intended to make the jurors feel personally responsible for any injury defendant might cause if he were sentenced to life in prison instead of death. Defendant did not object to these arguments at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We begin by addressing the State's comments about Mrs. Bowen. The trial court submitted to the jury various aggravating circumstances for each of the three murders at issue. In the case of Mrs. Bowen, one of the aggravating circumstances was that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. In support of that circumstance, the State argued that the jury should:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [t]hink about the evidence you saw at that scene. Think about where you saw Thelma Bowen on the floor. Think about the fact that Alvin Bowen had been murdered in the bed, the way he was. He never had a chance. He was struck and struck and struck with that knife in the bed, barely able to get his hands up to defend himself. Where did this blind lady go? She didn't go right out the door, her bed right there at the door, right next to the door. She went after Linwood Forte to try to save her husband, to try to save him from the knife plunging into his body. She was blind, elderly. She's aware of what is going on to her husband. She might not know every detail but she knows he's being attacked. She can hear muffled screams with the pillow put over his face. She knows something horrible is going on. She's fully aware of impending doom that was going to be suffered by her husband and she's got to be aware of what is coming for her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Because defendant did not object to this portion of the closing argument, we review for gross impropriety.\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219899\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/355/117/#p133\">\n    355 N.C. at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=558%20S.E.2d%2097\">\n    558 S.E.2d at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   During closing arguments, \"[a]n attorney may, . . . on the basis of his analysis of the evidence, argue any position or conclusion with respect to a matter in issue.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1230(a) (2005). \"[C]ounsel\n   are given wide latitude in arguments to the jury and are permitted to argue the evidence that has been presented and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from that evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The fact that Mr. Bowen was killed in his bed suggests that he was attacked first. Apparent defensive wounds to his hands indicated that he struggled with his assailant. Mrs. Bowen's body was found on the bedroom floor. This evidence reasonably implies that, although she was blind, Mrs. Bowen heard the attack on her husband and left her bed in a doomed attempt to help him. Consequently, the argument was not improper. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   We now turn to the final challenged portion of the State's closing argument. The prosecutor told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Your responsibility is a solemn one. Your decision will take strength. You know what your duties are. Some time down the road, some time in the future, you may pick up a newspaper and may see on TV or hear some radio broadcast that today Linwood Forte, the triple murderer, serial murderer from Goldsboro, North Carolina, that killed three elderly victims in 1990 was executed in the prison system of the state of North Carolina. When you hear it, you're going to have to deal with it. You have to live with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Let me tell you something else. By the same token, you may hear on TV or may read in the newspaper, hear it on the radio that today Linwood Forte, triple murderer, serial killer from Goldsboro, North Carolina, killed a correctional officer in the Department of Correction, killed a doctor, killed a nurse, killed a secretary, murdered an administrator. And if you hear that, you're going to have to live with that, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As before, defendant did not object to this argument, and we review it now only to determine if the argument was so grossly improper that the trial court erred by not intervening\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu.\n   </em>\n   Read in context, we find nothing improper about the State's argument. The prosecutor stressed to the jurors that there would be consequences no matter what they decided in this case and that they had a duty to reflect on their decision and take their responsibilities seriously. This argument did not violate the limitations of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1230(a) and did not necessitate the trial court's intervention. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Finally, defendant argues that, in sentencing him on the non-capital offenses, the trial court erred in considering a factor in aggravation that was not found by the jury. Specifically, defendant was convicted of burglary and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury in the Eliza Jones case. Sentence was imposed under the Fair Sentencing Act, which applied because the offenses were committed in 1990. The trial court found two aggravating factors, that defendant had prior convictions punishable by more than sixty days confinement and that the victim was physically infirm. The only mitigating factor found by the court was that, prior to arrest, defendant voluntarily acknowledged wrongdoing in connection with the offense to a law enforcement officer. The court found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and imposed aggravated sentences for each crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Although the trial court properly could consider defendant's prior criminal history, we conclude that it erred by increasing defendant's sentence beyond the presumptive range by finding that the victim was physically infirm.\n   <em>\n    Blakely v.
