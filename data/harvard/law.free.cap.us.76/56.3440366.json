As matter of fact, rebellious districts were brought under the control of the government in different parts of the South at different times, and in April, 1865, the armies of the rebel generals Lee and Johnston surrendered; their surrender being followed by that of Taylor\u2019s army, on the 4th of May, and by that of Kirby Smith\u2019s, on the 26th of the same month. \u2022 With this last-named surrender, all armed resistance, in the least formidable, to the authority of the government ceased, and, as <em>matter of fact, </em>the rebellion was prostrate, though rebel cruisers continued their depredations on our commerce, and though there were, in Texas and else<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>where, some wandering bands of robbers. Still, after Kirby Smith\u2019s surrender, May 26th, 1865, intercourse, commercial and other, between the inhabitants of the different sections, began to resume itself; trade opened, more or less, on its ancient basis, remittances were made, debts were paid or compromised, and bills of exchange were drawn between the inhabitants of the two sections.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">The courts, which, in each section, had been closed to the inhabitants of the other, were soon opened, in form at least. The Court of Claims assumed jurisdiction of eases under the Abandoned Property Act, and between the termination of actual hostilities and the date fixed by the court below as the legal suppression of the rebellion (20th August, 1866), thirty causes were commenced in that court under the act, and jurisdiction of them entertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">In this court, the causes pending at the beginning of the war to which inhabitants of the States in rebellion were parties, and which had been suspended and postponed from term to term during the continuance of the war, were, at the December Term, 1865, by the order of the court, called and heard in their order on the calendar, or on special days to which they were assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">Post-offices were reopened;<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the letting of contracts for mail service throughout the rebellious States resumed;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and the revenue system extended throughout the same States.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">The Federal courts, too, were reopened in the insurrectionary districts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">But notwithstanding all this, the late rebellious States were not politically restored to the Union, nor were many of them so restored till long afterwards.

And the complete <em>stains ante bellurn </em>was not yet visible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-10\">So far as executive recognitions of the date when the rebellion was to be assumed to have been \u201c suppressed \u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>concerned, the government issued three proclamations, one dated June 13th, 1865,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> in relation to the suppression of the rebellion in Tennessee; auother, dated April 2d, 1866,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> in regard to the suppression of the rebellion in the States of Georgia, <em>South Carolina, </em>Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Florida; <em>and the third, dated August 20th, </em>1866,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> <em>declaring the rebellion suppressed in Texas, </em>\u201c <em>and throughout the whole of the United States of </em>America.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">And an act of Congress, passed March 2d, 1867,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> declared that a previous act of Congress, passed June 20th, 1864,<footnotemark>||</footnotemark> to increase the pay of soldiers in the army, should be \u201c continued in full force and effect for three years after <em>the close of the rebellion, as announced by the President of the United States, by proclamation bearing dale August 20th, </em>1866.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">In this state of enactments, proclamation, and fact, one Anderson, a free man of color, possessed of real and personal property, by occupation a drayman and cotton sampler, and a resident of Charleston, South Carolina, preferred, on the <em>bth of June, </em>1868, to the Court of Claims, under the provisions of the already-mentioned \u201cAbandoned Property Act\u201d of 1863, as it was familiarly styled, a claim for the residue of the proceeds of some cotton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">Twenty days after Anderson preferred his claim to the Court of Claims \u2014 that is to say, on the 25th June, 1868\u2014 Congress passed a law,<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-8\">\u201c That no plaintiff, or claimant, or any person, from or through whom any such plaintiff or claimant derives his alleged title, claim or right against the United States, or any person interested in any such title, claim, or right, shall be a competent witness in the Court of Claims in supporting any such title, claim, or right.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-9\">When the matter came on afterwards to be heard, Anderson proved this case (proving it, in part, by two persons, the one named Fleming, and the other Doucen, who resided within the insurrectionary district, and from whom he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>bought the cotton), the case, to wit, that he had bought part of the cotton in the early part of the war, and the rest in the autumn of 1864, before the evacuation of Charleston by the rebels; that on the 5th March, 1865, the military authorities of the United States being now in possession of Charleston, he reported it to them, and that on the 5th of April following, it was removed, under their direction, from its place of deposit to the Charleston custom-house, whence it was shipped to New York, and there sold for the United States, and the gross proceeds paid into the treasury; the net proceeds amounting to $6723. ' The loyalty of Fleming and Doucen, from whom the cotton was purchased, was not proven, but that of Anderson was, and that he had never given any aid or comfort to the rebellion, or to the persons who were engaged in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">In the Court of Claims, the counsel for the government urged four principal grounds of objection to the allowance of the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">1st.

S. Hale, special counsel, for the United States:</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-10\">1. Was Anderson\u2019s claim, which was preferred on the 5th of June, 1868, preferred at any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-11\">The question when a suppression of the rebellion was made is a question of the actual termination of the war, and one distinct from the political question of the continuance of the lights of war, after the termination'in fact of hostilities. The true test of the existence of civil war was tersely stated by Grier, J., speaking for the court in the <em>Prize Cases</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cWhen the regular course of justice is interrupted by revolt, rebellion, or insurrection, so that the courts of justice cannot be kept open, <em>civil war exists,\u201d </em>&amp;c. The test of its termination is logically the same. When the armed organization against the government has ceased to exist, wheu the courts of justice are no longer prevented by violence, there is no longer civil war, and the rebellion is suppressed. Now, after the surrender of Kirby Smith, armed resistance to the authority of the United States ceased, the civil war was ended, and the rebellion suppressed, as <em>matter of fact. </em>In the universal speech of the people, \u201c the war was over.\u201d This is an historical fact, of which this court will take judicial cognizance. Their own proceedings and the call of their docket show it. But the fact is part of public history, and universally known. From that date, all claimants were entitled to sue in the Court of Claims, under the act of 12th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>March, 1863, and at the expiration of two years from that date (26th May, 1867), their right to sue terminated. Tho claim was therefore too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">The various proclamations of the President did not create the condition of peace, but were executive recognitions of the fact that peace was restored, just as the actions of the courts were judicial recognitions of the same fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">But if executive action is requisite to establish the fact of the suppression of the rebellion, then the proclamation of April 2d, 1866, does it as respects South Carolina; and the cause of action having arisen in that State the statute began to run whenever the rebellion was suppressed <em>there. </em>If this is so, the claim is still too late.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">As to the act of Congress of March 2d, 1867, its object was not to determine the end of the rebellion, either for judicial or legislative purposes, but to fix a definite time when the additional pay given to soldiers by the act of 20th June, 1864, should terminate. And it does not, in terms, fix 'the end of the rebellion; but fixes the desired day by recital from \u201c the close of the rebellion, <em>as announced by the President\u201d </em>&amp;c. To give to it the effect of fixing the close of the i\u2019ebellion for the purposes of the Abandoned aud Captured Property Act, or for any other judicial or legislative purpose, would be to give it an effect not contemplated by Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">2. The loyalty of Fleming and Doucen, who sold the cotton to Anderson, is not proven. They resided in South Carolina, and such residence fixes on them, in the absence of proof of loyalty, rebel character. Sales by them, under the act of July 17th, 1862, are \u201c null and void.\u201d Nor is the act of 1862 repealed by the Abandoned and Captured Property Act. These acts are to a limited extent <em>in pari materia, </em>and are so far to be construed by the aid of each other. But in their principal scope they relate to different subjects, provide for different ends, aud contain no provisions inconsistent with each other, so that both cannot stand. The proof of ownership required under the latter act is of necessity lawful ownership, as well under the act of 1862 as under all other subsisting laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>But this is no longer an open question in this court since the ease of <em>McKee </em>v. <em>United </em>States.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The language of the court is:</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\"><em>\u201c </em>This statute prohibited a person occupying the position A.

To overcome this resistance, and to carry on the war successfully, the entire people of the States in rebellion were considered as public enemies; but it is familiar history that there were many persons whom necessity required should be treated as enemies who were friends, and adhered with fidelity to the National cause. This class of people, compelled to live among those who were combined to overthrow the Federal authority, and liable at all times to be stripped of their property by the usurped government, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>objects of sympathy to the loyal people of this country, and their unfortunate condition was appreciated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">During the progress of the war it was expected that our forces in the field would capture property, and, as the enemy retreated, that property would remain in the country without apparent ownership, which should \"be collected and disposed of. In this condition of things Congress acted. While providing for the disposition of this captured and abandoned property, Congress recognized the status of the loyal Southern people, and distinguished between property owned by them, and the property of the disloyal. It was not required to do this, for all the property obtained in this manner could, by proper proceedings, have been appropriated to the necessities of the war. But Congress did not think proper to do this. In a spirit of liberality it constituted the government a trustee for so much of this property as belonged to the faithful Southern people, and while directing that all of it should be sold and its proceeds paid into the treasury, gave to this class of persons an opportunity, at any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion, to bring their suit in the Court of Claims, and establish their right to the proceeds of that portion of it which they owned, requiring from them nothing but proof of loyalty and ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">It is true the liberality of Congress in this regard was not confined to Southern owners, for the law is general in its terms, and protects all loyal owners; but the number of Northern citizens who could, in any state of the case, be <em>bond fide </em>owners of this kind of property was necessarily few, and their condition, although recognized in the law, did not induce Congress to incorporate in it the provision we are considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The measure, in itself of great beneficence, was practically important only in its application to the loyal Southern people, and sympathy for their situation doubtless prompted Congress to pass it. It is in view of this state of things, as it is the duty of a court in construing a law to consider the cilcumstances under which it was passed and the object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>be accomplished by it, that we are called upon to apply this particular provision to the facts of this case. The loyalty of the claimant is not questioned, but his ownership, in the sense of the law, of the property in dispute is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">It is not denied that he purchased the property in good faith for value, and with'no purpose to defraud the government or any one else; but it is said the persons from whom he bought resided in South Carolina, were presumed to be rebels, and were, therefore, prohibited from selling.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">This is an attempt to import from the confiscation law of July 17th, 1862, into this law, a disability which it does not contain. If this could be done, but very little benefit would accrue to the loyal people of the South from the privilege conferred on them by the law in question. It is well known that nearly all the Southern people were engaged in the rebellion, and that those who were not thus employed furnished the exception rather than the rule. Few as they were, the necessities of life required that they should buy and sell, and, equally so, that their trading should be free and unrestricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">This condition of things Congress was aware of, and if it had been its purpose to limit the privilege in controversy to the loyal citizen, who happened to acquire his property from another person equally loyal, they would have said so. But Congress had no such narrow policy in view. Its policy in the matter was broad and comprehensive, and embraced within its range all persons who had adhered to the Union. It treated all alike, and did not discriminate in favor of the person who could trace his title through a loyal source, and against him who was not so fortunate. It did not consider the loyal planter, who raised his own cotton and rice, as entitled to any more protection than the dweller in the cities and towns who lived by traffic, and bought where he could buy the cheapest.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The confiscation law, however, was not intended to apply to a person occupying the status of this claimant. The purpose which Congress had in view in passing that law was very different from that which induced it, in the Captured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and Abandoned Property Act, to extend a privilege to the loyal owner. The confiscation law concerns rebels and their property; was intended as a measure to cripple their resources; and, in so far as it claims the right to seize and condemn their property, as a punishment for their crimes, recognizes that certain legal proceedings are necessary to do so. But by the act in question the government yielded its right to seize and condemn the property which it took in the enemy\u2019s country if it belonged to a faithful citizen, and substantially said to him, \u201cWe are obliged to take the property of friend and foe alike, which we will sell and deposit the proceeds of in the treasury; and if, at any time within two years after the suppression of the rebellion, you prove satisfactorily that of the property thus taken you owned a part, we will pay you the net amount received from its sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The two acts cannot be construed <em>in pari materidl. </em>The one is penal, the other remedial; the one claims a right, the other concedes a privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">It is said the vendors of the cotton were incompetent witnesses by reason of the 4th section of the act of June 25th, 1868, which declares that no plaintiff or claimant, or any person from or through whom any such plaintiff or claimant derives his alleged title, claim, or right against the United States, or any person interested in any such title, claim, or right, shall be a competent witness in the Court of Claims in supporting any such title, claim, or right.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">There are three classes of persons who are, by this section, prohibited from testifying. The claimant cannot testify, nor can the person who, after a claim has accrued to him against the United States, has sold or transferred it to the claimant, nor can any one who is interested in the event of the suit. Doucen and Fleming, the immediate vendors of Anderson, are not excluded by this rule. They were not interested in the suit, and in no sense did Anderson derive his claim against the United States through them. They .never had any claim against the United States, because when the property was taken it belonged to Anderson, and it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>only after the property was sold that Anderson\u2019s claim even to the proceeds attached. If the property <em>in transitu </em>from Charleston to New York had been lost, no claim could arise under the law in favor of Anderson against the United States, his claim being contingent upon the proceeds of the property finally reaching the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">But the point most pressed in the argument against the right to recover in this case relates to the limitation in the law. It is contended that the claim was barred by this limitation, as it. was not preferred until the 5th of June, 1868. It is, therefore, necessary to determine when the time for preferring claims commenced, and when it ended. The words of the statute on this subject are,, that any person claiming to be the owner of abandoned or captured property may, at any time within two years after the suppression o!: the rebellion, prefer his claim to the proceeds thereof in the Court of Claims. There is certainly nothing in the words of this provision which disables a person from preferring his claim immediately after the proceeds of his property have reached the treasury, and there is no good reason why a different interpretation should be given them. On the contrary, there is sufficient reason in the nature of the legislation on this subject, apart from the letter of the law, to bring the mind to the conclusion that Congress intended to give the claimant an immediate right of action. The same motive that prompted Congress to grant the privilege to prefer a claim at all, operated to allow it to be done so soon as the property had been converted into money. If in the condition of the country, it was known that the Union men of the South, as a general thing, would be unable to prosecute their claims while the war lasted, still it w-as recognized that some persons might be fortunate enough to do so, and to meet the requirements of their cases the right to sue at once was conferred. In the progress of the war, as our armies advanced and were able to afford protection to the Union people, it was expected that many of them, availing themselves of the opportunity, would escape into the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>lines, and be thus in a condition to secure the rights conceded to them by this statute; and the history of the times informs us that this expectation was realized. To impute to Congress a design to compel these people, impoverished as they were known to be, to wait until the war was over before they could institute proceedings in the Court of Claims, would be inconsistent with the general spirit of the statute, and cannot be entertained. If, then, the right to prefer a claim attached as soon as the money reached the treasury, when did it expire ? The law says two years after the rebellion was suppressed; but the question recurs, when is the rebellion to be considered suppressed, as regards the rights intended to be secured by this statute ? It is very clear that the limitation applied to the entire suppression of the rebellion, and that no one was intended to be affected by its suppression in any particular locality. It might be suppressed in one State and not in another, but the citizen of the State that had ceased hostilities was in no better or worse position in this regard than the citizen of the State where hostilities were active. The limitation was not partial in its character, but operated on all persons alike who are affected by it; was dependent on the solution of a great problem, and an interpretation of it which would prescribe one rule for the people of one State, and a different rule for those living in another State, cannot he allowed to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The point,\u201d therefore, for determination is, when, in the sense of this law, was the rebellion entirely suppressed. And in this connection it is proper to say, that the purposes of this suit do not require us to discuss the question \u2014 which may have an important bearing on other cases \u2014 whether the rebellion can be considered as suppressed for one purpose and not for another, nor any of the kindred questions arising out of it, and we therefore express no opinion on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"AJe8\">The inquiry with which we have to. deal concerns its suppression only in its relation to those persons who are within the protection of this law. It is argued, as the rebellion was in point of fact suppressed when the last Confederate general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>surrendered to the National authority, that the limitation began to run from that date. If this were so, there is an end to the controversy; but did Congress mean, when it passed the statute in question, that the Union men of the South, whose interests are especially cared for by it, should, without any action by Congress or the Executive on the subject, take notice of the day that armed hostilities ceased between the contending parties, and if they did not present their claims within two years of that time, be forever, barred of their recovery ? The inherent difficulty of determining such a matter, renders it certain that Congress did not intend to impose on this class of persons the necessity of deciding it for themselves. In a foreign war, a treaty of peace would be the evidence of the time when it closed, but in a domestic war, like the late one, some public proclamation or legislation would seem to be required to inform those whose private rights were affected by it, of the time when it terminated, and we are of the opinion that Congress did not intend that the limitation in this act should begin to run until this was done. There are various acts of Congress and proclamations of the President bearing on the subject, but in the view we take of this case, it is only necessary to notice the proclamation of the President, of August 20th, 1866, and the act of Congress of the 2d of March, 1867.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On the 20th day of August, 1866, the President of the United States, after reciting 'certain proclamations and acts of Congress concerning the rebellion, and his proclamation of 2d of April, 1866, that armed resistance had ceased everywhere except in the State of Texas, did proclaim that it had ceased there also, and that the whole insurrection was at an end, and that peace, order, and tranquillity existed throughout the whole of the United States of America. This is the first official declaration that we have, on the part of the Executive, that the rebellion was wholly suppressed, and wm have shown, in a previous part of this opinion, that the limitation, in its effects on the persons whose rights we are considering, did not begin to run until the rebellion was suppressed throughout the whole country. But. we arc uol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>without the action of the legislative department of the government on this subject. On the 20th day of June, 1864, Congress fixed the pay of non-commissioned officers and privates, and declared that it should continue during the rebellion; and on the 2d day of March 1867, it continued this act in force for three years from and after the close of the rebellion, as announced by the proclamation of the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Congress, then, having adopted the 20th day of August, 1866, in conformity with the announcement of the President, as the day the rebellion closed, for the purpose of regulating the pay of non-commissioned officers and privates, can it be supposed that it intended to lay down a harsher rule for the guidance of the claimants under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act, than it thought proper to apply to another class of persons whose interests it equally desired to protect. In order to reach this conclusion, it is necessary to ascribe to Congress a policy regarding the statute under which this claim is preferred foreign to the views we have expressed concerning it. Besides, it would require us to construe two acts differently, although relating to the same general subject, in the absence of any evidence that such was the intention of the legislature. If we are right as to the motive which prompted Congress to pass the law in question, and the object to be accomplished by it, it is clear the point of time should be construed most favorably to the person who adhered to the National Union, and who has proved the government took his property, and has the money arising from its sale in the treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">As Congress, in its legislation for the army, has determined that the rebellion closed on the 20th day of August, 1866, there is no reason why its declaration on this subject should not be received as settling the question wherever private rights are affected by it. That day will, therefore, be accepted as the day when the rebellion was suppressed, as respects the rights intended to be secured by the Captured and Abandoned Property Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The point taken that the court below was not authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to render judgment for a specific sum, but only to determine whether the claimant was entitled to receive the proceeds of his property, leaving it for an officer of the treasury to fix the amount, cannot be sustained. To sustain this position, would require us to hold that for this class of cases Congress intended to constitute the Court of Claims a mere commission. This court will not attribute to Congress a purpose that would lead to such a result, in the absence of an express declaration to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It is proper to say, in conclusion, that the ease of <em>McKee </em>v. <em>United States</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cited as an authority against the claimant\u2019s right to recover, has no application whatever to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Judgment aeeirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-17\"> 8 Wallace, 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
