That statute gives such a preference to the claims for wages of \u201claborers and mechanics\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Supreme Court of this State has never passed on the question as to whether a bookkeeper is entitled to preference under the statute. On the question as to whether a bookkeeper is a laborer under similar statutes in other jurisdictions there is apparently about an equal division of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Words and Phrases, 1st and 2nd Series, under title \u201cLaborer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is fundamental that a statute such as this giving a preference to one class of creditors of an insolvent over others is to be strictly construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The term laborer in common usage connotes one who does manual or physical labor and not one whose work is principally mental. In that sense a bookkeeper certainly is not a laborer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">If the term laborer as used in our statute were intended to include a bookkeeper it would have to be interpreted as including all employees, and if the legislature had intended that, it would have used the word employees rather than \u201claborers and mechanics\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The receiver is advised that the claim of a bookkeeper is to be classified as a general claim and is not entitled to a preference under Sec. 5939.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
