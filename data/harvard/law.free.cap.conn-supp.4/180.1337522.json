This claim is based on tbe premise that the hiring was for a period of one year only and since that term ended on December 14, 1929, the three-year term during which the defendants had agreed hot to solicit plaintiff\u2019s customers came to a close on December 14, 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Plaintiffs contend that even though that be so, the continued operation of the restraining covenants is insured under another clause of the written agreement which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">\u201cIf within one year from the termination of this employment, the Party of the Second Part reenters the employ of the Party of the First Part, such employment shall be under the same terms and conditions as herein stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether this clause applies to the particular situation disclosed here, which is one where \u201cfrom December 14, 1928, to March 26th, 1936, the defendant sold and delivered ice for (plaintiff Ice Company),\u201d etc., etc. That its principal purpose has to do with other contingencies reasonably within the contemplation of the parties would not necessarily make it ineffective in so far as the events here under consideration, however, are concerned..</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Reduced to its elements the defendants' claim is that while, if their respective covenants be valid, they are bound not to solicit their employer\u2019s customers or engage within the specified territory in a competing business for a term of three years after being employed in such territory for but one year, nevertheless, if they continue in plaintiff\u2019s employment in such a,capacity, for a term of three years they are quite free to venture forth after the expiration of four years from the date of employment to purloin its customers and lure away the good will of its business within such territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Such an obviously unreasonable interpretation should not be given the agreement of the parties unless it is unavoidable</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The answer to it is available in the context of the restraining covenants. These do not purport by their terms to come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>into effective operation only at the expiration of the one-year period of employment specified in the hiring clause of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">They become operative upon the defendant\u2019s \u201cleaving any employ of the Party of the First Part\u201d and \u201cafter leaving the employ of the Party of the First Part\u201d. This means that though the defendants respectively agreed to work for the Ice Company for a period of one year, if they left at any time before the expiration of that period or were discharged for cause, they would become immediately subject to the restraining provisions of their respective covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">And so, also, if they extended the agreed period of employment continuously beyond one year, then when it did end, their agreement to refrain from soliciting their employer\u2019s customers or competing with it, within the specified territory would immediately come into operation and remain so for the period of three years next thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">This is so because while the term of employment is so fixed at one year the commencement of the period of restraint is not stated to begin at the expiration of that period but \u201cafter leaving the employ\u201d, whether that be at the end of the first year or the end of a later one forming such a continuous period of employment as is alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">It appears that the temporary injunction prayed for in each case ought to issue under a penalty of $3500. in each case, but, as the defendants are entitled to a full hearing on the merits which not inconceivably may result in material modification or dissolution of such temporary injunction, the same shall not issue until the plaintiffs in each case have filed a bond of the form and intendment as appears in Practice Book, p. 290, with surety to be approved by the undersigned in the sum of $3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
