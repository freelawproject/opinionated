Both are grantees of the same grantor. The plaintiff\u2019s deed is of a later date than the defendants and his property is bounded partly upon the defendants\u2019 property in the description and partly on \u201cthe highway\u201d. It is neces' sary then to first fix the defendants\u2019 bounds and the highway mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">When the defendants took title two maps were prepared by the grantor, picturing the property. One was affixed to the defendants\u2019 deed, the other filed with the town clerk. The probabilities are that they were identical and this is further borne out by other evidence in the case. The maps met a fate that seems more than coincidental. The one on file with the town clerk disappeared from the record book in which it was pasted. The one attached to the defendants\u2019 deed was, it is claimed partly burned while in transit of the mails. Peculiarly enough the part of it which should show the highway as claimed by the defendants has been destroyed. (See Def. Ex. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">As interesting as fiction it further appears that while the town clerk\u2019s copy was still in his files a lawyer searching the title, made a copy of the map which is in evidence as Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. G. Its similarity with what remains of the burned map, the absence of interest and the integrity of the lawyer making' the copy, combined with other evidence in the case satisfy me that it is substantially a true copy of the two original maps.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Taken with the other evidence in the case it shows that the \u201chighway\u201d claimed by the defendants as that mentioned in their deed was no more than a foot-path occasionally used as a cart path and that the real \u201chighway\u201d is that designated \u201cPublic Highway\u201d in the lawyer\u2019s copy, (Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. G) and in the defendants\u2019 map (Def. Ex. 7) but only shown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>part in the latter exhibit. It further appears that the mutual Doundary of the party leaves this highway at its junction with the road marked \u201cPrivate Road\u201d on Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. G, and follows this road as indicated on said exhibit. Based upon this exhibit the plaintiff's lawyer has prepared a map, Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A, which it is found, so far as the issues and the relief sought in this case are concerned, to be sufficiently accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The action is for damages for trespass and the plaintiff asks equitable relief by way of injunction. It is found the trespass was comrur ed and that the plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief. Vue evidence of damage is slight and the trespass was committed under a claim of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff is directed for $250.00 damages. As to equitable relief the trespass set up in the complaint is that the defendants and their agents blocked a common right of way to the plaintiff\u2019s property which way has been identified as the way marked \u201cPrivate Road\u201d on Plaintiff\u2019s Ex. G; and committed various acts of trespass on the plaintiff\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The defendants arc enjoined against entering and trespassing upon the plaintiff\u2019s land as depicted in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A, and against obstructing said Private Road along the plaintiff\u2019s property as shown in said map under a penalty of $500.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
