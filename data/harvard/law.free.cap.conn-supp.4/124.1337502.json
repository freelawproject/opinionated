The Court could not have so found, nor can it disturb this finding. The jury had the right to determine the extent of the general damages and those special damages that were reasonable. It is my opinion, having found for the plaintiff and having seen the parties and heard the claims affecting the question of both general and special damages, the jury returned a fair and adequately compensatory verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The motion to set aside the verdict is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
