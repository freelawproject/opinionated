The damages are alleged to have been produced as a result of a collision between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s automobile and one operated by the defendant. In Paragraph Three of the cross-complaint the defendant has undertaken to specify the rate of speed at which he at the time was operating his automobile, which speed is alleged to have been \u201cat about the same speed as is 'customary for traffic so operated at this point\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The evident purpose of this allegation was to lay foundation for a claim that the speed of said automobile was reasonable under the circumstances existing at the time and place in question, but whether it was or was not reasonable depends upon all of the circumstances, one of which is the rate at which it was in fact traveling. The mere fact that it was traveling \u201cat about the same speed as is customary for traffic so operated at this point\u201d is not informative unless the speed of such traffic is known. In other words, the allegation concerning the rate of speed of the defendant\u2019s automobile does not fully disclose what that rate was.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">For the foregoing reason the plaintiff\u2019s motion to make Paragraph Three of the cross-complaint more specific by stating the miles per hour at which the defendant was operating his automobile at the time and place alleged is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
