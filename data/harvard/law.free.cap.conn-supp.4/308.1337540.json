It further alleges that there had been defalcations by an employee both after May 17, 1934, and also during the term of the prior bond which latter defalcations had not been discovered during the time limited in the former bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">It is clear, therefore, that this action is not brought as claimed by the defendant under two separate bonds, that is the bond issued by the defendant and the bond issued by The Metropolitan Casualty Insurance Company which had been assumed by the defendant. Rather it is an action brought upon a single contract to wit: the bond issued by the defendant plus the rider thereon. The complaint therefore states but a single cause of action and should not be separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The motion to separate is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
