Cum. Supp., Section 1661C; Smith vs. Furness, 117 Conn. 97, 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The plaintiff received serious injuries. To see and observe her gives a far better story of their extent than relating them. It will be'many months before their effect will be dissipated. The special damages approximate $1400. In order that fair and adequate compensation may be received by the plaintiff, let judgment enter for her to recover from both defendants $8000.00.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
