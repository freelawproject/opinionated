The actual apprehension and turning over of the accused to the authorities is a service of a greater degree of benefit to the State, than the mere giving of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">In the matter of Stephan Kelly, 39 Conn., 159, at page 161, our Supreme Court said: \u201cThere is doubtless a distinction between being the means of detecting and convicting the guilty, and making discovery and giving information so that the guilty may be tendered to <em>justice </em>and convicted, but the reasoning by which such a distinction is made palpable is too subtle and refined to be practically useful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACS\">In 86 A. L. R., 575, at page 579, Lewis vs. Petroleum County, in the annotations the first case cited under the heading, \u201cReward for Discovery and Giving of Information\u201d, is the Kelly case, just cited, 39 Conn., 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">An examination of the annotated cases would seem to warrant the conclusion that the words, \u201cInformation,\u201d \u201cDetection,\u201d \u201cApprehension,\u201d \u201cArrest,\u201d etc., including the words, \u201cDiscovery\u201d and \u201cConviction,\u201d are to be liberally construed, so that the general purpose and intent of such statutes may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">It would reduce the incentive if, by means of a narrow construction, one were deterred in his efforts to function under the ordinary understanding of the meaning of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">It therefore appears that these petitioners have so acted as to bring themselves within the terms and the meaning of Section 5963.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The accused was, apparently, finally apprehended, after a course of conduct which indicates a general disregard for the rights of others, and it may be that his capture averted a serious situation in that community.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">An order may be entered, that the sum of eighty dollars ($80.00), be paid to and divided among the petitioners equally.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
