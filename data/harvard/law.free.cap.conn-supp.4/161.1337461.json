It is difficult to conceive of a proceeding in Court that would not be either a civil or a criminal proceeding. Many proceedings are held before the Court that are neither actions nor suits nor prosecutions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The word \u201cproceeding\u201d is as broad a word as may be used. An examination of the derivation of the word indicates that it is anything that moves forward; and so this word has been applied to business and affairs of many kinds. The matter of disbarment to which reference is made is not an action or a suit or a criminal prosecution. It is a proceeding \u201csui generis\u201d. In re Peck, 88 Conn. 447, 453. It has been char' acterized as a \u201cproceeding\u201d by our Supreme Court. In re Peck, supra; Grievance Committee vs. Broder, 112 Conn. 263. It is not a criminal proceeding. In re Peck, supra. The right to practice the profession of the law is one limited by statute to certain persons given such right by the state in accordance with statute law. It is a civil right. Proceedings for the disbarment of a man who has been accorded the right to practice such profession concerns such civil right and is a civil proceeding. The derivation of the word \u201ccivil\u201d and the many meanings accorded to this word is an interest' ing subject for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The accused claims that it is to be presumed that the statute is only applicable to one who attempts to influence a witness to testify falsely, even though the word \u201cfalsely\u201d does not appear in the statute. If this be so, \u2014 and it is not necessary to decide the question \u2014 then it follows that an in' formation in the words of the statute is subject to the same presumption as the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The motion to quash the information is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
