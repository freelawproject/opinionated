The present case involves the latter duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Much of the activity of the modem camp occurs beyond the confines of the camp property. For instance, overnight hikes are taken to Mt. Washington or Mt. Mansfield; canoe trips to distant lakes and rivers. If <em>injury </em>occurs, what <em>is </em>the test or measure of liability? It is difficult of clear general statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s injury came from perhaps the most common cause of all, \u2014 stumbling or slipping and falling over or off a rock. Had the boys been on a hike with a camp leader, scrambling over these very rocks, and this injury occurred, it <em>is </em>hard <em>to </em>believe there would be liability. The gravamen of the charge here is that the councillor did not report the boy\u2019s absence to headquarters, or did not himself organize a searching party. If there was negligence in this respect, was it a substantial factor in causing the injury complained of?</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">This boy ran away from camp. He left with a companion during the dinner hour, at noon, without the permission or knowledge of the tent leader, and in direct violation of the rules and regulations of the camp, and went to a log hut located on a cliff on land beyond the camp property. This hut had been built by previous campers many years before, and camp members, accompanied by councillors, had been allowed to go there upon certain occasions each year. On the way up the hill, the plaintiff dropped his sweater, and while going back for it slipped or stumbled and fell four or five feet and was injured, \u2014 fortunately not seriously. The fall was such as any lively boy might well suffer while climbing over rocks, and certainly this defendant is not liable for his misstep or stumble. The only \u25a0 negligence alleged in the complaint is (a) \u201cThat said cliff so located within the confines of its camp was dangerous and might cause injury to members.\u201d This was not within the confines of the camp, \u2014 and almost everything in the surrounding woods and mountains, ponds and streams \u201cmight cause injury\u201d to boys, (b) \u201cSaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>cliff was not surrounded by a guard rail or any form of protection and did not have any warning sign thereon.\u201d How impossible it would be to protect all the cliffs, pitfalls, ponds, holes, blowdowns and rocks in the surrounding territory so that they could not possibly injure' a runaway boy! Suppose it could be done, and signs plastered all over the countryside telling of possible danger. Imagine a boys\u2019 camp thus equipped \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t climb this tree\u201d- \u2014 -\u201cLook out for this rock\u201d \u2014\u201cHold onto this guard rail\u201d- \u2014 -\u201cKeep out of this water\u201d\u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t run away.\u201d It would be a boys\u2019 camp \u2014 but without boys. Even \u201csissies\u201d wouldn\u2019t go there!</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s only cause of complaint has not been alleged. Assume the councillor was negligent in not reporting the boy\u2019s absence, thus possibly starting a blind search, \u2014 would it have been of avail? The plaintiff must prove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, negligence which was a substantial factor in producing the injury. There is no such proof here.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Camp owners and managers do owe an important duty of reasonable care, both in relation to camp property and to supervision and control of camp members, but there is no evidence that any duty which was a substantial factor in, producing this injury has here been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Judgment is for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
