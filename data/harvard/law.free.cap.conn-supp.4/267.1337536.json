Fritz, deceased, late of New Haven, are not sub' ject to inheritance tax. The portions of the estate involved are monies paid to the widow of the deceased by virtue of two certain trust agreements, executed and delivered by the deceased during his life. Certified copies of these trust agree' ments are in evidence and marked Exhibit A and Exhibit B. Each of the trust agreements must be considered in its en' tirety in reaching a conclusion of this case. I, therefore, append copies of the trust agreements hereto and make them a part of this memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The statute governing this matter is Chapter 83 of the Public Acts of 1927 and the pertinent part of the statute is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">\u201cAll gifts of such property by deed, grant or other conveyance, made in contemplation of the death of the grantor .or donor, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of such grantor or donor, shall be subject to the tax herein prescribed\u201d. Considering Exhibit A, we read,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">\u201cWhereas it is the desire of said Fritz .... to ar' range for the sale and transfer of stocks .... in case of his death .... and avoid the necessity of negotiating therefor with the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">It appears that the sale and transfer of the stock were not to take place until after his death. It appears that Fritz agrees to pay the premiums on the policies of insurance and that the trustee \u2014 not his wife or his estate \u2014 is the beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>therein. The certificates of stock though delivered to the trustee, are endorsed in blank, and Fritz retains the \u201csole right and authority to vote the shares of stock\u201d. The agree' ment is not for all time, but is to terminate upon the death of Fritz \u2014 or his two associates \u2014 or at the end of ten years, if all survive so long; and, in the latter event, Fritz\u2019 stock is to be returned to him by the trustee. Upon the. death of Fritz, the trustee is to collect the insurance on his life and pay it to his widow or his estate. Also upon his death, before the death of either of his associates, his associates are to pay to the trustee, for payment to his widow or other person, a sum of money equal to the difference between the value of his stock and the proceeds of the insurance policy. There is fixed the method of determining the value of his stock, not at the date of the contract, but at the date of his death; and the reason of said method appears. Upon the death of Fritz the trustee is to deliver cash to the \u201cwidow or other person\u201d and the stock to the associates of Fritz after they have paid for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Here is property owned by Fritz delivered by him to a trustee for a period limited to ten years, or, by his decease, or the decease of one of his associates, whichever first occurs. He retains voting control. At his decease the stock is to be converted into cash and delivered by his trustee to his widow or estate. This grant of cash by Fritz to his widow or estate was obviously made in contemplation of his own death and intended to take effect after his death. Fritz died within the period of ten years and before either of his associ' ates and there has been paid to his widow, in accordance with the terms of Exhibit A, $8,509.49. This sum is subject to inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Exhibit B is a trust agreement between Fritz and two associ' ates relative to the stock owned respectively by each of the three. The intention as set forth in the trust agreement is \u201cto arrange for the sale and transfer of the stock of either in the event of death, to the survivor, and avoid the necessity of negotiating therefor with decedent\u2019s estate\u201d. Here is con' templation of death and an admission that the stock will be a part of decedent\u2019s estate at his death. In the event of Fritz\u2019 death, his associates are to pay to his widow or his estate, $4,000. plus insurance premiums and then, after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>death, the certificates of stock are to be transferred to his associates. By whom? Under the law by the executor of his will or the administrator of his estate. When Fritz; dies the stock is a part of his estate, which he has contracted, shall at his death, by such executor or administrator, be transferred for money to his associates. He dictates in the trust agreement to whom the money shall be paid and does not direct that it shall be paid to his executor or administrator. It cannot be \u2014 -it is not reasonable or logical \u2014 that the payment of an inheritance tax may be thus avoided. The contract is not unlimited. It is limited to ten years or to the death of Fritz; or one of his associates, whichever first occurs. Fritz; claims ownership in the stock so long as he lives and agrees with his associates not to sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or suffer or permit his ownership in his stock to be in any way affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">This trust agreement is a grant or gift of property made in contemplation of the death of the grantor or donor and intended to take effect in possession and enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor or donor. Of the property considered in Exhibit B, $4,000. is taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Blodgett, Tax Commissioner vs. Guaranty Trust Company of New York, et al, 114 Conn., 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Bryant, Executrix vs. Hackett, Tax Commissioner, 118. Conn. 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">I have considered all of the claims of the appellee and the citations submitted in support of the same. My views as to these claims are in general, but without specific argument, above set forth. As claimed by the appellee, it was undoubtedly the intention of Fritz; and his associates to hold their stock in status quo so long as they all should live and agree that the stock of the one of the three first to be deceased, should be purchased by the two survivors, at a price easily ascertainable, without negotiation or litigation. But this is beside the point. The question here to be determined is whether the money agreed to be paid for the stock is taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">These two trust agreements, Exhibit A and Exhibit B, were not sales. The limitation of ten years, the retention of control of the stock, the termination of the trust agreements by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the death of one of the contracting parties negatives such a construction of the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">The appeal from probate is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">It is adjudged and decreed that property to the extent of $8,509.49 set forth in the trust agreement dated May 1, 1928 by and between Gustave G. Frits, George S. Hawley and Henry F. Keller and The Bridgeport Trust Company, and property to the extent of $4,000. set forth in the trust agree' ment made May 1, 1928 by and between Gustave G. Frits, George S. Hawley and Louis Keller, are subject to Connects cut inheritance tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">EXHIBIT \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into at New Haven, Connecticut, this 1st day of May, 1928, by and be' tween' GUSTAVE G. FRITZ and GEORGE S. HAWLEY, of said New Haven, HENRY F. KELLER of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and THE BRIDGEPORT TRUST COMPANY, a banking corporation of said Bridgeport, hereinafter called Trustee, WITNESSETH:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">WHEREAS it is the desire of said Frits, Hawley and Keller, who are the sole owners of the common stock of Frits Hawley, Incorporated, a Connecticut corporation located in said Bridgeport, to arrange for the sale and transfer of the stock of either of them in case of his death, to the survivors and avoid the necessity of negotiating therefor with the de' cedent\u2019s estate;</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">NOW, THEREFORE, the life insurance policies on the lives of said Frits, Hawley and Keller, appearing in Schedule A of this agreement are herewith delivered to said Trustee, the Trustee having been named beneficiary thereunder and the stock certificates, more particularly described in Schedule B of this agreement, endorsed in blank, are herewith transferred and delivered to said Trustee; and the Trustee hereby ac' knowledges the receipt of all of said policies and certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The said Frits, Hawley and Keller agree to pay the prem' iums on said policies of insurance as they fall due and to save the said Trustee from any obligation to make such payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The Trustee agrees that the said Frits, Hawley and Keller during the continuance of this agreement shall have the sole right and authority to vote the shares of stock formerly standing in their respective names, the certificates of which are now held by the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">If the said Frits,. Hawley and Keller are all alive ten years from the date hereof, then this agreement shall terminate by lapse of time-and after the Trustee has received its compensation for services in connection with this agreement said stock certificates and all of said insurance policies shall be returned to said Frits, Hawley and Keller respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Upon the death of either of the parties hereto, the Trustee shall forthwith collect all the money on the policies of insurance upon the life of the decedent and pay said money with the other payments hereinafter mentioned to the widow of the decedent, or if there be no widow' then to decedent\u2019s estate, or to such other person as he shall have designated by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The survivors jointly shall also pay to the Trustee for payment to said widow or other person, \u00e1 sum of money equal to the difference between the value of the stock formerly held by the decedent, as determined in the manner hereinafter stated, and the proceeds of the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The value of the stock of the decedent shall be its book value as shown by the annual financial statement of the Company prepared by its accountant on the last preceding December 31st, except as to the items of \u201cFurniture and Fixtures\u2019\u2019 and \u201cSecurities held as Investments\u201d; the value of the item of \u201cFurniture and Fixtures\u201d being arbitrarily agreed upon as Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.), and the item of \u201cSecurities held as Investments\u201d to be the market value thereof at the date of the decedent\u2019s death and so determined by the Trustee. This provision is made because the last financial statement might show the \u201cFurniture and Fixtures\u201d item entirely written off or of no value, while the parties hereto agree that the actual value is Nine Thousand Dollars ($9,000.); and because the value of \u201cSecurities held as Investments\u201d is subject to fluctuation and the actual market value at the date of decedent\u2019s death is readily determinable by the Trustee. These values for the two items only are therefore substituted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the values appearing in the last financial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Upon the payment as aforesaid by the Trustee to decedent\u2019s widow, or other person, of the proceeds of the life insurance policies and the cash hereinbefore referred to, said Trustee shall forthwith deliver to the survivors in equal portions, all of the common stock formerly held by said decedent in Frit? \u20ac\u2022? Hawley, Incorporated, to belong to the survivors absolutely, and this trust agreement shall thereupon terminate, the poli' cies of insurance on the life of the survivors also being re' leased and returned to said survivors.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The parties hereto do by these presents bind themselves and their respective heirs, executors, administrators and as' signs, to the faithful performance of this agreement, and agree that the Trustee shall deduct or charge against them or their estate, and that they will pay in equal portions its reasonable fees and expenses as Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The parties hereto agree at all times to execute any other papers and perform all other acts that may be necessary or convenient in carrying out the purposes of this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have hereunto set their hands and seals at New Haven, Connecticut, the day and year above written.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Gustave G.
