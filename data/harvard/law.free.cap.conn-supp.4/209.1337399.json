That the marriage of the defendant, Statia Berk Chetela!, to the defendant, Bernard Plaski, at San Diego, Cal., on June 27, 1932, is null and void;</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">2. That the purported decree of the First Civil Court, Ciudad Juarez, State of Chihuahua, Republic of Mexico, made on or about January 16, 1933, did not affect the marriage status of plaintiff and defendant, Statia Berk Chetelat, because said court was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">3. The marriage entered into between the plaintiff and defendant, Statia Berk Chetelat, at Manchester, Conn., on July 1, 1929, still subsists and the plaintiff and said defendant are legally husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">A decree may be entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
