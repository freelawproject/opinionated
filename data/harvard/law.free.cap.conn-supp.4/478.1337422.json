They leave a distinct impression that either there must have been much more testimony on the material points or if there was not, then there should have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Under Practice Book, Sec. 256 the court has power \u201cwhen it appears necessary to protect substantial rights of a party\u201d to order a transcript of all of the evidence. It is felt that the court should examine the complete transcript in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Rather than put the state to the expense of this, it is requested that counsel for the claimant produce and have certified the complete transcript, unless the financial circumstance of the claimant is such that this would be a burden on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Decision on the instant appeal will be delayed until this transcript is filed with the clerk or until the court is advised by claimant\u2019s counsel that his client\u2019s financial situation is such that the court should order the transcript.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
