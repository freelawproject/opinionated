In paragraph \u201c11\u201d of the complaint it is specifically alleged that the action is based upon statutory liability and not upon common law liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">In paragraph \u201c2\u201d of the demurrer appear two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It is claimed that this defendant is not statutorily liable to the plaintiff. General Statutes, Section 1420 provides \u201cAny person injured in person or property by means of a defective road or bridge may recover damages from the party bound to keep it in repair . . .\u201d This statute is broad. No distinction is made as to state, county, town, city, corporation or individual in determining the party bound to keep a road in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">General Statutes, Section 1411, is as follows: \u201cTowns shall, within their respective limits, build and repair all necessary highways and bridges . . . except when such duty shall belong to some particular person . . .\u201d The Statute lays a conditional duty and responsibility on towns. The Statute recognizes that the duty may devolve on \u201csome particular person\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">That the City of New Haven has the duty as to its streets that under the statute devolves upon the Town of New Haven \u2014that the presence of snow and ice on a sidewalk may constitute a defect in the highway \u2014 may be assumed without stopping to cite the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Finally we are laced by a Special Act of the Legislature,' passed in 193?, the pertinent part of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">\u201cSec. 3. The duty of keeping sidewalks in said city free from snow and ice shall be upon the adjoining property owner, and said city is authorized to make suitable ordinances relating thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Here then we have General Statutes, Section 1420, giving the right of action; General Statutes, Section 1411, recognizing that a person, and not a town or city, may have the duty to repair highways; the Special Act, declaring that in New Haven such duty devolves upon the adjoining property owner; and paragraph \u201c11\u201d of the complaint claiming liability of this defendant under General Statutes, Section 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The constitutionality of such statutes as the Special Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>here in question may not have been specifically raised in this State; nevertheless similar acts have been considered and ah lowed force by our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Wladyka vs. Waterbury, 98 Conn. 305; Krooner vs. Waterbury, 105 Conn. 476; Stevens vs. Nelligon, 116 Conn. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Moreover, \u201cit is encumbent upon any Court, in the consid' eration of an attack upon the constitutionality of a legislative act, to approach the question with great caution, examine it with infinite care, make every presumption and intendment in its favor and sustain the act unless its invalidity is clear.\u201d The State vs. Muolo, 119 Conn. 323, 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">This demurrer has been argued both orally and by brief with thoroughness. While not overlooking various claims made by counsel for the plaintiff and this defendant I do not consider it expedient to discuss at length the claims made.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The demurrer is overruled on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">DEMURRER</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">of the Visiting Nurse Association of New Haven</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The defendant, the Visiting Nurse Association of New Haven, demurs to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">1. The complaint does not allege that this defendant caused the defective, dangerous, uneven and slippery condition of the sidewalk referred to in paragraph 5 and 6 of said complaint, nor did it allege that this defendant placed or caused to be placed on said sidewalk, the accumulation of ice, snow and slush mentioned in said paragraph 5 and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">2. The defendant, the Visiting Nurse Association of New Haven is under no liability to the plaintiff by reason of the injuries alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, whether by virtue of statute or otherwise; and if any statute be considered to impose liability upon said defendant, the Visiting Nurse As' sociation of New Haven, said statute is a violation of Article 1 of the Constitution of Connecticut, and particularly para' graph 1 and 12 thereof, and of the 14th amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America; and said statute is unreasonable, arbitrary, and void; and no liability to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>plaintiff for the facts alleged in the complaint results there' from.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The Visiting Nurse Association of New Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"A6f\">THE DEFENDANT,</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">By Watrous, Hewitt, Gumbart Corbin,</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Its Attorneys.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
