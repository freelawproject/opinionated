The statutory requirements necessary to the validity of these deeds were admitted by the tenant to have been complied with, except in regard to the person to whom the assessments were made. These assessments were made in 1884 and 1885, respectively, to John O. Bradford, a resident of the State of New York, who acquired title to the, property in 1862, and retained it until his death in 1879. A <em>% </em>the dates of the assessments, there was in this Commonwealtl no record of his death; no probate proceedings had been insti tuted upon his estate; there was no evidence that the assessors had received any notice of his death; and the title stood in his name at the registry of deeds. The tenant was in possession of the land on May 1, 1884, and also on May 1, 1885. The demandant contended that, the assessments having been made to Bradford, the person appearing of record as the owner of the land, he should be held to be the true owner thereof for the purposes of assessing and collecting the taxes, and .that the assessments to him were consequently valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\">The judge ruled that, inasmuch as Bradford was dead, no valid assessment could be made to him, and directed a verdict for the tenant; and the demandant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-12\"><em>J.

Taxes on real estate shall be assessed, in th\u00e9 city or town where the estate lies, to the person who is either the owner or in possession thereof on the first day of May.\u201d Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 13.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The natural and obvious meaning of the word \u201cperson\u201d is a living human being. When the statutes speak of a person who has died, they speak of him as a \u201c person deceased,\u201d or a \u201cdeceased person.\u201d A dead man cannot be the owner of property. We see no reason to suppose that the statute above cited intends to use the words \u201c persons \u201d and \u201c owners \u201d in any other than their usual sense. The clause first cited was designed to meet the cases where real estate has been conveyed by deeds which are not recorded before the first day of May. The subsequent sections of the statute make provision for assessing the estates of persons who have died before the first of May. Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19. Undoubtedly it will sometimes happen that the assessors will fail to receive information of the death of a former owner of real estate, but the statutes provide for such a contingency by giving them the right to reassess the taxes to the person who is taxable. Pub. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7\u00a7 79, 80. We are therefore of opinion that the assessments of the taxes upon the premises in question for the years 1884 and 1885 to John O. Bradford, who died in 1879, were illegal, and that the Superior Court rightly directed a verdict for the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> See St. 1889, c. 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
