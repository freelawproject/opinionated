Because the said indictment does not sufficiently allege that Worthen T. James, the person to whom the alleged false pretences were made, sold and delivered the property mentioned therein by reason of said false pretences, nor that said false pretences were the inducement for said James to part with said property. 2d. Because said false pretences, as alleged, show that they were an inducement merely to the giving of the mortgage, and that the obtaining of the said property is too remotely connected with said false pretences.\u201d <em>Dunbar, </em>J., overruled the motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">At the trial, James testified that the defendant came into his store in Boston on November 20,1885, and upon being told that he could not have more goods on credit because of the amount of his previous indebtedness to James, stated that he had property, and that he would give him security, and finally agreed to give him a mortgage on the horses, wagon, and harness; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the defendant represented that he was the owner of such property, and that it was free from incumbrances; that the defendant thereupon gave him a mortgage upon the property, and he delivered to him the beer in packages as recited in the indictment ; and that he believed the statement made by the defendant relative to the ownership of the property, and was induced by such representations to deliver such beer to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">It appeared in evidence, that the horses, wagon, and harness were not the property of the defendant, as he at the time of the making of the representations knew. It further appeared in evidence, without objection, that the defendant subsequently obtained from James other property which he did not pay for, and that, when asked by James if he wished to pay for the goods, the defendant said, \u201c No, let them go in on the mortgage.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">On cross-examination, James testified that, in letting the defendant have the beer, he relied on the defendant\u2019s \u201c statements and the mortgage, \u2014 the mortgage was the security \u201d; and that the bargain which he made with the defendant was that he should take the mortgage for three hundred dollars, which was to include one hundred dollars already owed him by the defendant, and two hundred dollars\u2019 worth of goods which the defendant was to take as he might wish them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">There was also evidence tending to show that James had been warned by the true owner of the property mortgaged not to deal with the defendant with reference to it, as the property did not belong to him, but belonged to such owner-.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-8\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that the evidence adduced did not support the false pretences charged in the indictment; but the judge declined so to rule, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">The defendant also asked the judge to instruct the jury, among other things not material, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">\u201c2. If the jury find that, before the making of the false pretences, James knew, or had means of knowing, that said property was not the defendant\u2019s, this indictment cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-11\">\u201c 8. If the jury find that, before the making of the alleged false pretences, James believed the said property to be the property of the defendant, so that the making of the alleged false <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>pretences was merely a restatement of wliat James previously believed to be true, then this indictment cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">\u201c4. If the jury find that the bargain in which the alleged false pretences were made, and its object, were to secure James for a past debt and a future credit, then the defendant cannot be convicted under this indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\"><em>\u201c 5. </em>What passed between the parties by parol in relation to the title to the property merged afterwards in the mortgage, and the evidence, show a mere breach of covenants in the mortgage, and unless the jury find that some other false pretences were made besides those to which the covenants in the mortgage relate, the defendant cannot be convicted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-7\">The judge gave the second request, omitting the words \u201c or had means of knowing\u201d; the third, adding the words, \u201cThis is necessarily so, because, if James believed the property to be owned by the defendant .previous to the statement relied upon, James could not have relied upon the statements\u201d; and the fourth, adding the w'ords, \u201c If the defendant, at the time such representations were made, obtained any of the property charged in the indictment from said James by reason of the alleged false, pretences, the indictment might be sustained.\u201d The judge declined to give the fifth instruction requested, and upon that subject instructed the jury that the defendant could not be convicted by reason of breach of the covenants in the mortgage; but if they found that the defendant made the false statements relied upon, he would not be less liable because those statements were afterwards reduced to writing in the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-8\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-9\"><em>W.

The motion to quash the indictment was properly overruled. The allegation that the goods were obtained by the false statement, on the part of the defendant, that he was the owner of certain property upon which he gave a mortgage to the seller, one James, thereby inducing him to part with his goods, was a clear and sufficient charge of' obtaining goods by false pretences. If, after this false pretence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>that the defendant was the owner of the property to be mortgaged, the mortgage was given, even if the goods would not have been delivered to the defendant but for this fact, the false pretence was the direct, and not the remote, means by which the goods were obtained. If the seller had not believed in this pretence, he would have deemed the mortgage worthless, and would not have parted with his property. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>115 Mass. 481. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>11 Allen, 233, it was held that one who obtains money by means of false pretences that he owns certain personal property, which he mortgages to the lender as security for the loan, could properly be convicted of obtaining money by false pretences. The fact that in the case at bar the goods were to be obtained from time to time, and not all at once, can make no distinction between the cases, as the false pretence was a continuing one, and applicable to each delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. The ruling requested, that the evidence did not support the charge of false pretences as laid in the indictment, should not have been given. In distinct terms, the witness James testified that he parted with the goods on the strength of the statement made by the defendant, and also on the \u201c statements and the mortgage,\u201d which, in substance, was saying that he relied on the mortgage because of the statements of the defendant which preceded or accompanied it. These statements the jury have found to be false pretences. If James parted with his property solely on the strength of the security of the note and mortgage, that is, independently of these statements, they were instructed to acquit the defendant. For similar reasons, the fifth instruction requested should not have been given. While the defendant was not to be convicted by reason of the covenants in the mortgage as to the ownership of the property, if he in fact made the false statements relied upon to induce the seller to part with his property on the security of the mortgage, he would not be the less liable because they were subsequently reduced to writing therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">3. The instruction, that the indictment could not be sustained if James, the seller, had the means of knowing that the property was not that of the defendant, should not have been given. He was entitled to rely on the statements of the defendant, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>not further put upon his inquiry as to a motive which was within the knowledge of the defendant, and as to which he himself knew nothing. If he knew that the defendant was not the owner, the instruction as given was that the statement could not be deemed a false pretence. Nor is any such case presented as that which exists where parties alike know whether an affirmation is true or false, being equally cognizant of, or personally connected with, the facts to which it relates. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Norton, 11 Allen, 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">4. The fourth instruction requested by the defendant was given. The addition that, if the defendant, \u201cat the time such representations were made, obtained any of the property charged in the indictment from said James by reason of the alleged false pretences, the indictment might be sustained,\u201d was correct. It compelled the Commonwealth to show that some definite portion of the property charged in the indictment had been obtained by the alleged false pretences. This was all that was necessary to sustain the indictment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>4 Met. 43. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>115 Mass. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
