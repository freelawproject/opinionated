Graham: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">\u201c I do hereby agree that for and in consideration of the sum of fifteen hundred and seventy-five (1,575) dollars, to be paid me upon the satisfactory completion of the following system of heating to be established in your new mills, located at the N. E. cor. of 19th and Hamilton Streets, Philadelphia, Penn., as follows, viz.: to furnish and set up (no foundations included) in complete and first-class working order, one steam fan, having an engine affixed thereto of 6| X 7 inch cylinder of first-class workmanship and material; together with a heater containing a sufficient and ample quantity of one-inch wrought-iron steam piping, properly applied on the inside of a wrought-iron casing, all of which to be erected in proper working order in such portions of the buildings, where found most convenient for the establishment and where directed by yourself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-8\">\u201c The system of heating to be entirely dependent upon the exhaust steam from your engine at an indication of 40 H. P.. and to be of such construction as to readily as well as easily heat or raise the temperature, at any point or portion of the entire buildings into which heat from said heater may be conducted, to the temperature of seventy degrees (70\u00b0) Fahr. in the coldest weather that may be experienced; and further, that the application of said system is to avoid any back pressure upon the mill engine, or not increase any that may exist when my heater is attached, and that the erection and construction of the vertical pipes (we have arranged for one line of pipes from the vertical standpipes already 12\" decimeters and shall not attach any more unless found necessary, as explained to you, they being the only kind required) shall be executed in accordance with the plans and specifications prepai-ed by myself and under my personal supervision and direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-9\">\u201c Further, the entire work is to be finished within eighteen (18) days from date of this contract, either by permanent or temporary means; if temporary, no extra charge whatsoever to be made, excepting such charges on the temporary machine as regards freight to and from our works, and clearing up. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>is further declared, and distinctly understood, that in the event of my not being able to properly heat every portion of the buildings as hereinbefore provided for, and in accordance with the requirements as above set forth, upon a ten (10) days\u2019 notice from youi\u2019self, to the effect that the buildings are not being properly and sufficiently heated, and I cannot so heat it in ten days thereafter, I shall and will at my own expense remove all the machines and appurtenances belonging to the system, leaving the entire mill in a condition equal to that prior to the introduction of the same. In this event, no charges of any kind will be made by me on account of any of the aforesaid work; it being distinctly understood that the providing of the entire system is to be done at my own risk absolutely. In the event of the system proving satisfactory, and conforming with all the requirements as above provided for, the sum of $1,575 as above provided for to be paid me, after such acknowledgment has been made by the owner or the work demonstrated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">\u201c Gardner C. Hawkins.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C. J., there was evidence that the plaintiff made the offer contained in the above agreement, and that the defendant accepted such offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The defendant contended that all the words of the contract were to be taken into consideration in its interpretation; that, in addition to the other requirements of the contract, the system of heating must prove satisfactory to the defendant; and that not till the satisfactory completion of the system and its proving satisfactory to the defendant was anything due to the plaintiff; and the defendant offered evidence, not only that the system would not and did not do the heating as guaranteed, but that it did not prove satisfactory to the defendant, and that it had not been completed satisfactorily to him, and such acknowledgment had never been made by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-8\">The judge ruled that this contract did not come within the scope of the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>113 Mass. 136, and similar cases, and that if the plaintiff had fulfilled his contract in the other particulars required, he was entitled to recover, notwithstanding the dissatisfaction of the defendant; that under the contract the plaintiff was not bound to make the system satisfactory to the defendant, and that evidence on that point was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>immaterial; and that the trial should proceed on the theory that the satisfaction of the defendant was substantially eliminated from the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that the temperature of the different stories of the defendant\u2019s mill, which was one \u201chundred and ninety-six feet long by fifty feet wide, and seventy-five feet high, varied, and that the temperature near where the hot air entered the rooms was higher by several degrees, in some instances as much as ten degrees, than in the more remote portions of the rooms, the hot air being introduced into the rooms at only one place, at the end of each room.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">The judge gave no instructions to the jury on the question of satisfaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-8\"><em>A. Hemenway \u00bf- F. L. </em>Washburn, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-9\"><em>S. </em>Lincoln, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b305-10\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">The only question in this case is whether the written agreement between the parties left the right of the plaintiff to recover the price of the work and materials furnished by him dependent upon the actual satisfaction of the defendant. Such agreements usually are construed, not as making the defendant\u2019s declaration of dissatisfaction conclusive, in which case it would be difficult to say that they amounted to contracts, <em>(Hunt </em>v. Livermore, 5 Pick. 395, 397,) but as requiring an honest expression. In view of modern modes of business, it is not surprising that in some cases eager sellers or selling agents should be found taking that degree of risk with unwilling purchasers, especially where taste is involved. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>113 Mass. 136. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Cranage, </em>39 Mich. 49. <em>Wood Reaping &amp; Mowing Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>50 Mich. 565. <em>Zaleski v. Clark, </em>44 Conn. 218. <em>McClure Bros. </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>58 Vt. 82. <em>Exhaust Ventilator Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, Milwaukee, &amp; St. Paul Railway, </em>66 Wis. 218. <em>Seeley </em>v. <em>Welles, </em>120 Penn. St. 69. <em>Singerly </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>108 Penn. St. 291. <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Belfield, </em>2 C. B. (N. S.) 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">Still, when the consideration furnished is of such a nature that its value will be lost to the plaintiff, either wholly or in great part, unless paid for, a just hesitation must be felt, and clear language required, before deciding that payment is left to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>will, or even to the idiosyncrasies, of the interested party. In doubtful cases, courts have been inclined to construe agreements of this class as agreements to do the thing in such a way as reasonably ought to satisfy the defendant. <em>Sloan </em>v. Hayden, 110 Mass. 141, 143. <em>Braunstein </em>v. <em>Accidental Death Ins. Co. </em>1 B. &amp; S. 782, 799. <em>Dallman </em>v. <em>King, </em>4 Bing. N. C. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">By the written proposition which was accepted by the defendant, the plaintiff agrees, \u201c in consideration of the sum of fifteen hundred and seventy-five dollars, to be paid me upon the satisfactory completion of the following system of heating ... in your new mills, ... to furnish and set up, ... in complete and first-class working order,\u201d certain things. Then follow conditions, tests, and other undertakings. Then \u201c it is further declared . . . that in the event of my not being able to properly heat every portion of the buildings .... in accordance with the requirements as above set forth,\u201d upon ten days\u2019 notice \u201cthat the buildings are not being properly and sufficiently heated, and I cannot so heat it in ten days thereafter,\u201d the plaintiff will remove the machines at his own expense. \u201cIn this event, no charges of any kind will be made by me on account of any of the aforesaid work; it being distinctly understood that the providing of the entire system is to be done at my own risk absolutely. In the event of the system proving satisfactory, and conforming with all the requirements as above provided for, the sum of fifteen hundred and seventy-five dollars as above provided for to be paid me, after such acknowledgment has been made by the owner or the work demonstrated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The last words \u201cor the work demonstrated,\u201d offer an alternative to the owner\u2019s acknowledgment. They imply, that, if the work is demonstrated, it is satisfactory within the meaning of the contract, although the owner has not acknowledged it. The previous words, \u201c and conforming with all the requirements,\u201d tend the same way. The ten days\u2019 notice contemplated is not a notice that the owner is dissatisfied, but that the buildings \u201c are not being properly and sufficiently heated,\u201d and the right to give it is conditioned upon the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cnot being able to properly heat every portion of the buildings,\u201d etc. Taking these phrases with the test prescribed, that the system is \u201c to readily as well as easily heat or raise the temperature at any point . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>to the temperature of seventy degrees (70\u00b0) Fahr. in the coldest weather that may be experienced,\u201d etc., we are of opinion that the satisfactoriness of the system and the risk taken by the plaintiff were to be determined \u25a0 by the mind of a reasonable man, and by the external measures set forth in the contract, not by the private taste or liking of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
