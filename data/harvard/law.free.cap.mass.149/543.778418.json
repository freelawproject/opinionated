Early in 1885 the Washington Mills proceeded to wind up its affairs, and discharged its employees, at which time the plaintiff had in his hands $10,194.28, as the residue of funds which had been deposited with him by successive treasurers of the relief society, and which he desired to pay over to those entitled thereto. At the last meeting of the board of government of the relief society, held on June 25, 1884, and duly called, the following vote was passed: \u201cVoted, on motion of Mr. Ezra Cox, that, in case of a dissolution of the corporation, the fund of the relief society be put into the hands of the Ladies\u2019 Union Charitable Society, in trust, the principal to be invested, and the interest therefrom to be applied to the support of free beds in their hospital, for the benefit of the operatives of the Washington Mills, or their successors, preference being given to the former operatives; in case none apply, then the free beds may be used for the benefit of others deserving them.\u201d The Ladies\u2019 Union Charitable Society maintains a hospital in Lawrence for the relief of the people of that city and others.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">The Washington Mills Relief Society was a voluntary association, formed, as its \u201c regulations \u201d state, \u201c for the purpose of extending aid to the sick and to those who may meet with accident while employed here.\u201d By its \u201cregulations,\u201d which were the only articles of association, \u201cEvery individual employed by the Washington Mills corporation at Lawrence must be a member of this society. Membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>will cease on leaving the employment of the Washington Mills.\u201d The corporation was to pay \u201c three dollars weekly to its funds,\u201d and each member was to pay \u201c four weeks\u2019 contributions on entering, and three cents a week thereafter,\u201d the contributions of the members to be \u201cmade every pay-day, at the time of receiving their wages, to the paymaster, who shall forthwith hand over the same to the treasurer of the society.\u201d The regulations further provided, that \u201cthe weekly allowance'to sick members shall be two dollars\u201d; that the allowance may be continued ten weeks; and that it shall then be reduced one fourth, and may be extended twenty weeks longer, \u201c provided that no member shall receive more than fifty dollars in any one year, except by a vote of the board of government.\u201d No member was entitled to aid \u00a3\u00a3 who shall not have regularly contributed for at least eight weeks, and been employed by the Washington Mills for the same length of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We have stated enough of the regulations to show the purpose and scope of the association. It was a voluntary association for the mutual benefit of its members, and cannot be held to be a public charitable institution. To constitute a public charity, there must be an absolute gift to a charitable use for the benefit of the public. In this case the contributions of the members were not gifts for a charitable use for the benefit of the public, but they were payments for their own advantage, and were in the nature of premiums for insurance against sickness and accidents. Each member paid a regular fee or assessment, and in consideration thereof he became entitled to a certain benefit in case of sickness or accident, as a personal right. He could enforce this before the tribunal provided in the regulations, viz. the directors of the Washington Mills, and if no such tribunal had been provided, he could enforce it in a court of law. <em>Dolan </em>v. <em>Court Good </em>Samaritan, 128 Mass. 437. <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Samson </em>Lodge, 102 Ind. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">No private person can maintain an action to enforce the exercise of a public charity in his favor. As is stated in <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Federal Street Meeting-house, </em>3 Gray, 1, 50, \u201cA public charity, in legal contemplation, is derived from gift or bounty; . . . but where a fund is derived from rates and assessments, being in no respect derived from bounty or charity, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>not charitable. So a subscription by a benefit society, for mutual relief, is to a private, and not a public charity, and does not require the intervention of the Attorney General.\u201d See <em>Old South Society </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>119 Mass. 1, 24. <em>Saltonstall </em>v. <em>Sanders, </em>11 Allen, 446, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The contributions of the members were not in their nature, and were not intended to be, gifts for a general public use, but were for tile advantage of the members only. <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Easton Beneficial Society, </em>73 Penn. St. 362. <em>Bangor </em>v. <em>Rising Virtue Lodge, </em>73 Maine, 428. <em>Donohugh\u2019s appeal, </em>86 Penn. St. 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">It is true that the contributions by the corporation were of a different character, but they did not change the general scheme or purpose, and they were, we think, gifts to a private use, and not to a public charity.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">We are, for these reasons, of the opinion that this is not a case of a public charity, in which, under the doctrine of <em>cy pres, </em>we can by a decree devote the funds which have accumulated to a public charitable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The society was in operation for about seventeen years, and a fund amounting to about ten thousand dollars had accumulated, when it came to an end by the dissolution of the Washington Mills corporation. The next question is, In whom is the title to this fund?</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">It was a voluntary association of peculiar character. The corporation was not a member, but practically it had, by virtue of its right to change its employees, the power to change the membership of the society and of the board of management. The members generally had no vote or voice in the management of its affairs, which were controlled by a \u201c board of government,\u201d chosen annually <em>\u201c </em>by and from the superintendents and overseers.\u201d In effect, the assessments of the members and the contributions of the corporation were placed in the hands of this \u201cboard of government,\u201d for certain purposes prescribed in the regulations. They had no right to apply them to any other purpose. The legal title to the fund was in them, but they held it upon the trusts prescribed. When the corporation was dissolved, the society ceased to exist and the trusts failed. The regulations made no provision for such a contingency, and we think that the board, after the failure of the trusts, held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>fund, not for its own benefit, but for the contributors and donors as a resulting trust. <em>Easterbrooks </em>v. Tillinghast, 5 Gray, 17. <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>120 Mass. 524. 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">If the corporation had contributed the whole of the funds, not as a public charity, but for the support of this particular society during its life, it would seem to be very clear that at the death of the society the accumulated fund ought to go to it by way of a resulting trust. No one else could present any claim to it. The principle is not changed because the contributors are in fact very numerous. We are therefore of opinion, that at the extinction of this society the board of government held the fund in question for the benefit of all the contributors, and that, they are entitled to it, each in proportion to the amount contributed by him. The amount contributed by the corporation is not precisely fixed, but it appears to be about five per cent of the whole amount. It is entitled to this proportion, and, if the parties desire it, the case may be referred to a master to determine the exact amount. We are not able to see any ground upon which its claim to the whole of the fund can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">In dealing with the question of the disposition of the residue, it is necessary to refer to some further facts which exist in the case. At a meeting of the board of government of the relief society held on June 25,1884, it was \u201c Voted, on motion of Mr. Ezra Cox, that, in case of a dissolution of the corporation, the fund of the relief society be put into the hands of the Ladies\u2019 Union Charitable Society, in trust, the principal to be invested, and the interest therefrom to be applied to the support of free beds in their hospital, for the benefit of the operatives of the Washington Mills, or their successors, preference being given to the former operatives ; in case none apply, then the free beds may be used for the benefit of others deserving them.\u201d The board of government now desire to carry out this vote. Personal service in this suit was made upon several of the former members of the relief society, who appear and announce that they each and all disclaim any joint or several right, title, or interest in said fund adverse to the rights of said Ladies\u2019 Union Charitable Society, acquired by the vote set forth in said bill, and request that said fund be decreed to said charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>society under the terms of the vote aforesaid. Notice by pub lication was served upon all who have been members of the relief society; no one appears, and as to them the bill has been taken <em>pro confesso. </em>The defendants, who have been defaulted, must be deemed to have abandoned their claims to the fund, or to have assented to the disposition of it according to the above vote. As to the residue, after paying the corporation its proportion, the board of government hold the legal title, and have the assent of all parties equitably interested that it may be paid according to its vote. We see no reason why it may not do so, and discharge itself of all responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We cannot agree with the argument that the board of government had the power under the regulations to dispose of the whole of this fund. The powers given them \u201c to decide points of dispute, and manage the internal affairs of the society,\u201d were intended to apply to the ordinary business of the society and the management of its prudential affairs, and do not extend to the disposal of the funds in any other way than those prescribed by the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"AG3C\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
