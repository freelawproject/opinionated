Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, which so far as material was as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The plaintiff testified, in substance, that in June, 1884, one of the horses was bought for her by her father, Russell T. French, with money he owed her previous to her marriage; that the other horse was bought by her father in December, 1884, and was given to her by him ; and that the wagon was purchased for her in June, 1884, by her father, with her money. On cross-examination, she testified that the wagon was purchased with money which her father owed her previous to her marriage, and was for use in her husband\u2019s business. She admitted that she was not present in person at any of the purchases, and did not pay any of the money in personand that she permitted her husband to use the horses and wagon in his business as he pleased, she paying neither for the care nor for the repairs of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-5\">Russell T. French testified that the plaintiff and himself went to one Britton of Stoughton, and one of the horses was purchased by him for her, the money being paid by her; that he could not tell whether a bill was then given ; that subsequently on three different occasions he gave money to the plaintiff, and accompanied her to Britton when she paid the same to him; and that he could not give the dates nor the amount paid each time, except that the last amount was about sixty dollars. Two receipts were produced, which he testified were given to the plaintiff on those occasions, for the money paid at the time of the respective receipts. One of these receipts was dated at Stoughton, May 7,1887, and signed by Britton, and recited that he had \u201c received of Mrs. Dora C. Brooks twenty-five j-g-ff dollars on acct. of bay horse \u201d; and the other, also signed by Britton, was also dated at Stoughton, July 25,1887, and recited that he had \u201c received of Dora 0. Brooks fifty-four dollars, balance due on bay horse.\u201d The judge admitted these receipts against the defendant\u2019s objection, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">French also testified that in the same year he purchased of Britton the other horse, giving his note for .it, which he subsequently paid, and that he gave the horse to the plaintiff. A bill of sale, which French testified was given to him for the horse, for the price of which he gave his note, although he did not testify whether it was received by him before or after the payment of the note, was admitted by the judge, and was as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>follows: \u201c Stoughton, Mass., Dec. 10th, 1886. Mrs. Dora C. Brooks, To L. G. Britton, Dr. Livery, Sale, and Feed Stable. One bay horse, $120. Ree'd payment, L. G. Britton.\u201d The bill of exceptions did not recite that the defendant objected to the admission in evidence of this bill of sale, or alleged an exception to its admission. French also testified that he purchased the wagon in question, for the plaintiff, of one Clark, and that a bill of sale was given to him by Clark for money paid for the same by him, which bill was as follows: \u201c Brighton, June 30th, 1887. Dorah C. Brook, bought Clark, one two-horse wagon, one hundred dollars. Paid, S. C. Clark.\u201d The plaintiff offered this bill in evidence, and the judge admitted it against the defendant\u2019s objection, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">The plaintiff did not offer either Britton or Clark as a witness to testify as to the receipts or bills of sale, nor account for their absence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-7\"><em>H.

There was evidence that each of the receipts was given when the money was paid, and apparently the receipted bill of sale of the wagon was delivered when the price was paid. If it be doubtful when the bill of sale of the horse was delivered, it is enough to say that it does not appear that any exception was taken to the admission of this. When receipts and bills of sale are delivered as parts of a transaction, they may be admissible to show the intention of the parties to the transaction, so far as the intention expressed in the papers tends to qualify or char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>aeterize fclie acts done. The papers are a part of the <em>res gestee. </em>We think that the receipts and bills of sale in this case were competent evidence tending to show the person for whom the purchases were made and the money was paid.
