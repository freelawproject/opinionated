The defendant objected to the introduction of this record, but the judge admitted so much of it as showed that the defendant appeared in. court and pleaded guilty, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-12\">There was nothing in the record showing where the liquors, for the illegal keeping of which the defendant pleaded guilty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>were kept, whether in the house on Pleasant Street or elsewhere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-3\">The government then introduced evidence that on July 20, 1888, the defendant carried on business at the house on Pleasant Street, and there was no evidence that he had any business elsewhere. Subsequently, the defendant testified in his own behalf, and it was then admitted that when he pleaded guilty he had this place in Pleasant Street in his mind, and that his business was there on July 20, 1888.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-5\"><em>J.

Standing by itself, it would not be sufficient proof, because his admission by the plea does not identify the place where the liquors were kept. But the government offered evidence tending to prove that the place where he kept liquor for sale on July 20, 1888, was the same tenement described in this complaint; and, further, the defendant, being a witness in his own behalf, testified that the place described in the complaint was the place occupied by him on July 20,1888, and which he had in his mind when he pleaded guilty. The record thus supplemented by other proof was competent, and sufficient to justify a verdict of guilty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>97 Mass. 595. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hazeltine, </em>108 Mass. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
