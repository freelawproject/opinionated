The defendant\u2019s counsel then put this question to him: \u201c Why did you carry that billy ? \u201d The judge excluded the question, and to this ruling the defendant excepted. The defendant was then asked, \u201c Did you carry that billy for the purpose of assaulting Harvey ? \u201d This question was admitted, and the defendant replied in the negative.
