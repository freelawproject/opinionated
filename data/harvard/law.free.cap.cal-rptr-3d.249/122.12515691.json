The entity that controls most of Rivera's assets, Jenni Rivera Enterprises, LLC (JRE), entered into a nondisclosure agreement with Rivera's former manager, Pete Salgado, that restricted his disclosure and use of certain personal information about Rivera and her family. Alleging Salgado breached that agreement by disclosing information to the producers and the broadcaster of a television series based on Rivera's life, JRE sued Salgado and the program's producers for breach of contract, interference with contract, and inducing breach of contract. JRE also sued the program's broadcaster for interference with contract and inducing breach of contract. The defendants filed special motions to strike under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court denied the motions, and the producers and broadcaster appeal those rulings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The producers argue JRE failed to demonstrate a probability of success on the merits of its causes of action. We conclude JRE satisfied its burden to demonstrate a prima facie case, with reasonable inferences from admissible evidence, that the producers had knowledge of the nondisclosure agreement before taking actions substantially certain to induce Salgado to breach the agreement. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's order denying the producers' special motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The broadcaster makes similar arguments regarding JRE's case in chief, but also argues the First Amendment provides a complete defense because JRE's causes of action arise out of the broadcast of matters of public interest. Although First Amendment protection for newsgathering or broadcasting does not extend to defendants who commit a crime or an independent tort in gathering the information, it is undisputed the broadcaster did not know of the nondisclosure agreement at the time it contracted with the producers to broadcast the series, and JRE did not show the broadcaster engaged in sufficiently wrongful or unlawful conduct after it learned of the nondisclosure agreement to preclude First Amendment protection. Therefore, the First Amendment protected the broadcaster's use and broadcast of the information in the series, and we reverse the trial court's order denying the broadcaster's special motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Salgado Signs a Nondisclosure Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rivera, born Dolores Janney Rivera, died at age 43 with five surviving children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After her death, Rivera's family and heirs created JRE to own and manage Rivera's intellectual property and publicity rights. Rivera's sister, Rosa Rivera Flores, asked Salgado and others in Rivera's \"inner circle\" to sign nondisclosure agreements intended to prevent them from capitalizing on Rivera's fame by disclosing sensitive and potentially embarrassing private information. According to Flores, Salgado signed the nondisclosure agreement in September 2013 in her presence, and she signed the agreement on behalf of JRE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Among other things, the agreement provided: \"Recipient [Salgado] shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of JRE ... all information, knowledge, and data relating to or concerned with their respective operations, business, financial affairs and personal affairs, including but not limited to personal affairs of [Rivera] ... ; and Recipient shall not disclose or divulge any such information, knowledge, or data to any person, firm, or corporation ... except as may otherwise be required in connection with the business and affairs of JRE provided that JRE or its designees provide written\n   authorization prior to release ....\" The agreement also stated the Recipient may not \"use for [himself] or others, disclose or divulge to other[s] including third parties, confidential information ... includ[ing] without limitation any and all information and/or data related to the business and personal affairs of [Rivera].\" The agreement stated its provisions remained \"applicable after the termination of the agreement for any reason whatsoever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Producers Make a Television Series About Rivera\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March 2016 a company owned by Salgado entered into a coproduction agreement with BTF Venture S.A. de C.V., the parent company of BTF Media, LLC (BTF), and with Dhana Media, Inc. to develop, produce, and deliver television programming (the Series) based on an unpublished manuscript by Salgado titled \"Her Real Name was Dolores\" (the Coproducers Agreement).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of the signatories to the Coproducers Agreement represented and warranted that the Series, its development, production, and delivery would not contain \"anything or be handled in such a way as to cause or constitute a violation of any third party's rights.\" The signatories also represented and warranted they had not entered into any agreement that was inconsistent with the provisions of the Coproducers Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2016 Flores learned from press releases that Salgado was working with Univision Communications Inc. and Univision Networks &amp; Studios, Inc. (collectively, Univision) on a television series called \"Su Verdadero Nombre Era Dolores\" (\"Her Real Name Was Dolores\"). One of the press releases stated the Series \"reveals the true woman behind the music and the headlines as told by her former manager, a man she publicly referred to as her fifth brother, Pete Salgado.... [F]ans will get Pete's previously untold perspective\n   on the woman he knew.... Salgado ... promises to reveal the uncensored and fascinating life story of the real woman behind the music, glamour and fame.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Also in May 2016 BTF signed a term sheet with Univision to develop, produce, and broadcast the Series. The term sheet stated the Series would be \"based on a currently-unpublished book (Book) written by [Salgado] based on the life of singer [Rivera].\" The term sheet required BTF to deliver 26 episodes for the Series in four installments from January 9, 2017 to January 30, 2017 and anticipated Univision would begin broadcasting the Series no later than January 16, 2017. The term sheet required Univision to pay BTF in installments as well, beginning 10 days after execution of the term sheet and ending upon final delivery of all episodes. BTF agreed in the term sheet to report to Univision at least semimonthly on various aspects of the production, and BTF represented and warranted that, among other things, each episode of the Series would not infringe the contractual rights of any third party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On September 8, 2016 Univision announced it had commenced production of the Series. A press release stated the Series would be \"based on the book written by executive producer Pete Salgado, who worked closely with [Rivera] in her last years of life and promises to reveal many secrets.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   By late December 2016 production was complete, and Univision planned to begin broadcasting the Series in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    JRE Sends Cease and Desist Letters and Files Two Lawsuits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly after discovering Salgado was involved in the Series, JRE sent Salgado and the Producers a cease and desist letter dated June 3, 2016. The letter included a copy of the nondisclosure agreement JRE claimed Salgado signed and asserted the agreement prevented Salgado from disclosing information regarding Rivera's business, financial, and personal affairs. The letter accused Salgado of breaching the agreement by making disclosures to Univision and other third parties, asked Salgado to inform the Producers and Univision they were not authorized to create a television program based on confidential information about Rivera supplied by Salgado, and demanded Salgado refrain from further using information he agreed not to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Salgado responded later that same day by claiming the nondisclosure agreement attached to the cease and desist letter was \"a poorly executed forgery.\" Through his attorney, Salgado stated that he did not sign the nondisclosure agreement and that someone must have \"cut out or copied his signature from another document and pasted it onto the signature block.\" The Producers did not respond to the cease and desist letter. In response to Salgado's letter, JRE stated through its attorneys, in a letter also delivered to representatives of the Producers, that JRE had the original nondisclosure agreement with Salgado's signature on it and that a witness could identify the time and place Salgado signed the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 12, 2016 JRE filed a complaint against Salgado and the Producers alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty against Salgado and interference with contract and inducing breach of contract against the Producers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   JRE's allegations in the complaint acknowledged Salgado's claim that the nondisclosure agreement was a forgery and stated that JRE had hired a forensic document examiner who opined the agreement \"was unquestionably signed by Salgado.\" \"Nonetheless,\" JRE alleged, \"Salgado continues to engage in his illicit conduct to this very day by continuing to disclose protected information about Ms. Rivera and her family.\" (Emphasis omitted.) JRE alleged the Producers also \"continue[d] to intentionally induce Salgado's breaches and interfere with JRE's agreement with Salgado, to this very day, through their production and development of the Univision series-which includes the ongoing disclosure by Salgado of Ms. Rivera's confidential information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   JRE alleged that the past and future wrongful conduct by Salgado and the Producers \"devalued the information and inhibited JRE's ability to utilize some or all of the information about Ms. Rivera and her story for the benefit of JRE and, most importantly, Ms. Rivera's children. For example, the wrongful conduct has devalued opportunities for an authorized book about Ms. Rivera or an authorized television show about Ms. Rivera.\" JRE sought damages, equitable relief, and punitive damages in connection with the cause of action for interference with contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Also on September 12, 2016 JRE sent Univision a copy of the complaint against Salgado and the Producers and the attached nondisclosure agreement. Univision responded on September 23, 2016 and reiterated Salgado's claim the nondisclosure agreement was a forgery. On December 28, 2016 JRE sent Univision a copy of a December 21, 2016 restraining order the trial court issued against Salgado. The restraining order enjoined Salgado from violating\n   the terms of the nondisclosure agreement, including by disclosing information protected by the agreement or using such information for himself or others. In its letter accompanying the restraining order, JRE asserted Univision \"has and continues to interfere with the [nondisclosure agreement] and induce its breach. As the [trial court] has made clear, any reliance on Salgado's unfounded assertions about his signature's authenticity is unreasonable given the strong evidence of the validity of the [nondisclosure agreement].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Series premiered on Univision on January 15, 2017, and Rivera's sister confirmed her belief the Series included information known only to Rivera's family, Salgado, and a small number of individuals\n   who were not involved with the Series. On February 6, 2017 JRE filed a complaint against Univision for interference with contract and inducing breach of contract. The complaint alleged Univision knew of Salgado's nondisclosure agreement no later than September 12, 2016, but continued to induce Salgado to \"disclose secrets covered by the [nondisclosure agreement] by providing him with a financial incentive to disclose such secrets, a platform to disclose such secrets, and the prestige of serving as an executive producer on a television show broadcast on Univision in which he could air such secrets.\" JRE alleged that, as a result of Univision's alleged \"actual and ongoing breach or disruption of the contractual relationship between JRE and Salgado,\" JRE was entitled to actual damages, restitution, disgorgement, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Producers and Univision File Special Motions To Strike\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Producers and Univision filed special motions to strike the complaints under section 425.16. In the first step of the section 425.16 analysis, they argued the complaints arose from protected activity because developing, producing, and broadcasting a television series are acts in furtherance of the right to free speech. In the second step, the Producers argued JRE could not show a probability of prevailing on the merits because the Producers did not have knowledge of the nondisclosure agreement \"before the development of the Series\" or before BTF entered into the term sheet with Univision. The Producers argued they \"could not have\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     intended\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to induce a breach of a then-unknown contract.\" The Producers argued that, once they learned of the existence of the nondisclosure agreement, they did not know whether it was authentic or enforceable. They claimed that, after receiving the June 3, 2016 cease and desist letter, \"Salgado signed a notarized affidavit under penalty of perjury declaring that: (1) he never signed the NDA [nondisclosure agreement]; (2) there is no agreement restricting him from discussing his personal and professional dealings with Ms. Rivera; and (3) the signature on the NDA provided by [JRE's] counsel to [the Producers] did not belong to him.\" Thus, according to the Producers, even if JRE could ultimately prove the nondisclosure agreement was legitimate, JRE could not show the Producers intended to\n   induce a breach of contract because the Producers \"subjectively (and reasonably) believed Salgado's representations that no valid contract existed.\" The Producers also argued their conduct could not have caused Salgado to breach the nondisclosure agreement because the Producers' allegedly wrongful conduct occurred after Salgado had allegedly breached the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Univision argued JRE could not show a probability of prevailing on the merits because JRE had not shown the Series included confidential information provided by Salgado, Univision did not know about the nondisclosure agreement \"at the time [Univision] negotiated and entered into the license agreement in May 2016 with BTF,\" there was no evidence Univision interfered with Salgado's nondisclosure agreement, and California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act ( Civ. Code, \u00a7 3426.1 ) (UTSA) and the First Amendment barred JRE's tort claims against Univision. Univision argued the First Amendment provides blanket protection for the publication or broadcast of truthful information about a matter of general public interest like the Series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In response to both motions JRE did not contest the defendants' showing that JRE's causes of action arose from protected conduct under the first step of the section 425.16 analysis. JRE argued, however, that section 425.16 requires only a\n   prima facie showing of \"minimal merit\" and that JRE had produced sufficient admissible evidence to satisfy that standard. JRE argued that, even if the Producers and Univision did not know about the nondisclosure agreement at the time they entered into contracts relating to the production of the Series, they had notice of the agreement no later than June 3, 2016 and September 12, 2016, respectively, and they induced Salgado to breach the agreement and interfered with it throughout the production. For example, JRE argued Salgado continued to breach the nondisclosure agreement\n   after the Producers and Univision had knowledge of the agreement because the Producers paid Salgado for his continued involvement in making the Series, Univision continued to provide financing for producing the Series, and both the Producers and Univision agreed to credit Salgado as a co-producer of the Series.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In support of its argument that Salgado continued to use and disclose confidential information to the Producers and Univision after they had knowledge of the nondisclosure agreement, JRE pointed to Salgado's admission in an affidavit that his manuscript was not complete as late as August 2016, the Producers' concession that they \"expended considerable time and financial resources developing and producing the Series\" after May 2016, and the BTF term sheet with Univision, which provided for ongoing payments to BTF (and indirectly to Salgado) throughout the production. Based on this and other evidence, JRE argued the trial court could reasonably infer that Salgado used and disclosed confidential information in connection with the production after the Producers and Univision had knowledge of the nondisclosure agreement. JRE responded to Univision's First Amendment and UTSA defenses by asserting that the First Amendment did not protect Univision from liability for \"infringing upon [JRE's] contractually-granted rights\" and that the disclosures by Salgado were not \"trade secrets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Following separate hearings on the special motions to strike, the trial court denied the motions to strike JRE's causes of action for interference with contract and inducing breach of contract. The Producers and Univision timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Section 425.16\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"A strategic lawsuit against public participation ... is one which 'seeks to chill or punish a party's exercise of constitutional rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of grievances.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Contreras v.

The Producers concede they received the letter at that time. They argue, however, that JRE failed to present evidence showing they knew of the nondisclosure agreement \"when they began developing the Series\" and that any subsequently acquired knowledge is not relevant to JRE's causes of action. JRE's causes of action, however, are not limited to conduct that occurred when production of the Series began. Under the terms of the nondisclosure agreement, Salgado had a continuing\n   obligation not to disclose or use confidential information about Rivera. In addition, JRE submitted evidence the Producers knew of the nondisclosure agreement and its likely authenticity before or very soon after production of the Series began in September 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Producers suggest they cannot be liable for inducing any breach of the nondisclosure agreement that occurred after the first time JRE claims Salgado breached the agreement, which may have occurred as early as February 2016, when Salgado met with the Producers and Univision. But successive causes of action for breach of contract may arise from a single contract with continuing obligations.

The evidence in the record suggests the Producers agreed to many of these \"enticements\" before they knew about the nondisclosure agreement. But once they knew of the agreement, the Producers' continued payments to Salgado were a substantial factor in bringing about Salgado's continued breaches. To determine whether JRE made the minimal showing of causation sufficient to establish a prima facie case, we need only ask whether Salgado would have continued to cooperate with the production and marketing of the Series had he not continued to receive payments and assurances of a platform from which to publicize and exploit confidential information about Rivera. The most reasonable inference from the evidence is that he would not. And, as stated, while the Producers' continued performance of their contractual obligations to Salgado may have been legally justified under the circumstances, the Producers did not assert this affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Producers argue JRE cannot show their actions were a substantial factor in bringing about Salgado's alleged breaches because Salgado allegedly breached the agreement by writing an unpublished manuscript about his experiences with Rivera, would have breached the agreement anyway, and repudiated the agreement before the Producers allegedly induced him to breach it. For the most part, these arguments fail because they do not take account of the continuing nature of Salgado's obligations under the nondisclosure agreement and his repeated breaches of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Producers suggest Salgado had already breached the nondisclosure agreement before they began production of the Series by drafting an unpublished manuscript of a book about his experiences with Rivera. Merely drafting the manuscript without sharing it with anyone, while possibly a breach of Salgado's obligation not to \"use\" protected information, would not result in any damages to JRE. It is a fair inference from the evidence, however, that Salgado breached the agreement for the first time no later than May 2016, when BTF and Univision signed the term sheet, which required BTF to deliver a copy of\n   Salgado's manuscript to Univision \"[p]romptly\n   following the full execution of this Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Salgado's unauthorized disclosure of the manuscript containing confidential information about Rivera did not render future disclosures of different information or to different audiences not actionable or immune from liability, either as a breach of contract or as the basis for interference with contract.

Taking the Producers' argument to its logical end would preclude JRE from recovering from Salgado (not to mention the Producers) for damages caused by Salgado's far more damaging disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the same reason, that Salgado may have breached the nondisclosure agreement in the future by publishing his manuscript does not mean the Producers' actions were not a substantial factor in bringing about the disclosure of Rivera's secrets to a national broadcast audience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, the Producers argue Salgado never intended to honor his obligations under the nondisclosure agreement and disavowed those obligations by (1) representing and warranting he was not bound\n   by any contract that would impair his involvement in the Series, (2) signing a notarized affidavit to that effect, and (3) continuing to deny he ever signed the nondisclosure agreement. The Producers' arguments do not establish, as a matter of law, their actions were not a substantial factor in bringing about Salgado's alleged breach of the nondisclosure agreement by disclosing and using confidential information for the purpose of producing, marketing, and broadcasting a \"tell-all\" story about Rivera. While Salgado may have found other partners to facilitate his alleged breaches of contract had the Producers not been involved, JRE made a showing of minimal merit on the element of causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   As discussed, JRE alleged the Producers' interference with Salgado's nondisclosure agreement negatively affected the value of the information protected by the agreement and the ability of JRE to use the information for its purposes. JRE further alleged the Producers' interference limited JRE's economic opportunities to publish a book or produce or sell a television show or series about Rivera containing the information. The Producers did not argue in their special motion to strike that JRE could not make a prima facie factual showing of its damages. The trial court did not address this element in its ruling, and the Producers do not argue on appeal that JRE did not make a sufficient prima facie showing on damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The First Amendment Bars JRE's Causes of Action Against Univision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Unlike the Producers, Univision argued in the trial court the First Amendment barred JRE's causes of action because the Series was \"a truthful account of a newsworthy event about a public figure.\" The trial court disagreed, concluding JRE met its burden to show at this stage of the proceedings Univision's actions constituted an \"independent tort\" that was not protected under the First Amendment as \"routine reporting techniques.\" (\n   <em>\n    Nicholson v.
