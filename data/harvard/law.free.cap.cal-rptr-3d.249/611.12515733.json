The gas leak continued for months, causing damage to thousands of residents of the area, and generated a great deal of litigation. In addition to civil lawsuits brought by affected residents and businesses, the District Attorney for Los Angeles County filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint against SoCalGas (defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The resolution of the criminal charges by a plea agreement generated further litigation by residents of the Porter Ranch community (petitioners\n   here). In the plea agreement, defendant pleaded no contest\n   to a charge of failure to immediately report the release of a hazardous material, and obtained dismissal of other charges, including a count alleging the discharge of air contaminants. Petitioners, numbering more than 7,000, sought to set aside the plea agreement and obtain restitution under the California Constitution, which gives victims the right \"to seek and secure restitution from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the losses they suffer.\" ( Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b)(13)(A).) At the sentencing hearing, the trial court considered petitioners' written submissions, oral argument and testimony, but denied their motion to vacate the plea and require restitution. Further litigation in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court was likewise unsuccessful, leading to a petition for writ of mandate in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We hold that the Victims' Bill of Rights in the California Constitution (art. I, \u00a7 28 ), as amended in 2008 by Proposition 9 (Marsy's Law or section 28 ) does not authorize a victim to appeal from a judgment or order in a criminal case. Section 28\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   require the court in every case to order restitution to crime victims \"from the persons convicted of the crimes causing the losses they suffer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)(13)(A).) And section 28\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   authorize a victim to enforce the right to seek and secure restitution (along with many other enumerated rights) \"in any trial or appellate court with jurisdiction over the case as a matter of right,\" and further requires the court to \"act promptly on such a request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (c)(1).) But nowhere does section 28 state or imply, nor does its history suggest, that a victim may enforce his or her right to restitution by direct appeal from a criminal judgment or order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Instead, in those rare cases where the trial court fails in its duty to order restitution from the convicted wrongdoer to the victims of the crime, the victims may do what petitioners have done in this case: seek a writ of mandate. This is consonant with section 28, and at the same time does not interfere with \"the public prosecutor's exclusive discretion in the conduct of criminal cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Dix v. Superior Court\n   </em>\n   (1991)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2358779\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/53/442/#p451\">\n    53 Cal.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20834\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201063\">\n    807 P.2d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Dix\n   </em>\n   ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, however, the trial court did not fail in its duty when it refused to order restitution for all losses caused by the gas leak. We reject the contention that the release of air contaminants was \"encompassed in\" the reporting failure of which defendant was convicted. We also decline to extend the right to restitution to dismissed charges that are \"transactionally related\" to the crime of which defendant was convicted. And although we find no error in the trial court's conclusion that there was no evidence or proffer of evidence to establish that defendant's failure to report the gas leak for three days was a substantial factor in causing the harm victims suffered from the gas leak, for\n   the reasons set out below we do remand for a hearing on whether petitioners can prove damages from the three-day delay in reporting the leak, as charged in the criminal complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We note as well that no injustice results from any of the legal conclusions we have reached. Petitioners continue to have recourse against defendant in numerous pending civil suits and class actions, in a civil court specifically designed to handle complex proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Background and the Criminal Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SoCalGas owns a massive natural gas storage field in Aliso Canyon, near the Porter Ranch community. On October 23, 2015, a leak of natural gas began from a\n   well at the Aliso Canyon facility. The leak continued for months, and was finally successfully controlled in February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 2, 2016, the district attorney filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint against defendant, alleging violations of the Health and Safety Code and other state and county regulations. There were four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Count 1 alleged that, from October 23 to October 26, 2015, defendant failed to report the release of hazardous material, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 25510, subdivision (a), \"to the California Emergency Management Agency and to the unified program agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Counts 2 and 3 alleged failures to report the release of hazardous material, during the same period, under Los Angeles County Code section 12.56.030 and title 19 of the California Code of Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Count 4 alleged that, from October 23, 2015 to the present (February 2, 2016), defendant committed the crime of discharge of air contaminants, in violation of Health and Safety Code section 41700, subdivision (a), by discharging natural gas or its components.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A few days after the complaint was filed, attorneys representing many of the victims of the discharge notified the district attorney's office that they sought restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 17, 2016, defendant waived arraignment and pleaded not guilty to all four counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 12, 2016, the district attorney's office notified attorney Paul Kiesel that a proposed plea agreement had been reached with defendant to settle the criminal complaint. (Mr. Kiesel had been appointed as liaison counsel for the thousands of plaintiffs and 86 law firms involved in 157 coordinated civil suits and class actions filed against SoCalGas over the gas leak.) Mr. Kiesel was informed there would be a pretrial conference the following day. He said he would discuss the matter with co-leads of the plaintiff steering committee, and would send a representative from leadership to the hearing. He was not consulted about the terms of the plea or given advance notice of the terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Plea Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 13, 2016, the proposed settlement agreement was submitted to the trial court and its terms were read into the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under the plea agreement, defendant pleaded no contest to count 1, \"for failing to timely report the natural gas leak to the proper authorities, specifically the California Office of Emergency Services ... and ... the Los Angeles County Fire Department.\" The parties acknowledged that any\n   subsequent violation of Health and Safety Code section 25510 \"may be charged as a felony.\" Other terms were:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court would impose the maximum fine of $75,000 ($25,000 per day of violation) in exchange for the plea to count 1. The court would also impose state penalty assessments \"currently estimated to be approximately $232,500\"; $246,672.88 for response costs; and \"all mandatory fines and fees as required by the court, including any restitution fine to the State Restitution Fund.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant agreed to comply with six other terms and conditions, all to be completed prior to sentencing. \"In total, SoCalGas will be required to pay\n   and commit approximately $4,004,172 to $4,304,172 to fully complete and satisfy the complete terms of this settlement agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Provided the terms of this Agreement are complied with by SoCalGas,\" the district attorney agreed to dismiss the remaining three counts of the complaint at the time of sentencing. And \"[g]iven that all of the terms and conditions of this agreement will be required to be completed at or prior to the date of sentencing,\" the district attorney agreed not to seek or require probation as a condition of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After discussion and questions from the court, the court accepted defendant's plea of no contest to count 1, and signed the settlement agreement. The court set the matter for sentencing on November 29, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Proceedings After the Plea\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 18, 2016, attorneys for victims filed a request for withdrawal of the plea agreement. They pointed out victims have a constitutional right to be heard, and a right to restitution under section 28. They contended the district attorney failed to notify or confer with them before entering the plea agreement, and the plea should be withdrawn. They requested a hearing to consider their claims for restitution \"before the court sentences SoCalGas or accepts the plea agreement.\" They contended a sentence without an award of victim restitution is invalid, and the court has discretion to retain jurisdiction to provide for full restitution to the victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On November 7, 2016, the trial court issued a minute order stating the victims \"have standing to be heard and express their views concerning the negotiated disposition at the sentencing hearing.\" The minute order stated that on November 29, 2016, \"the court will hear input, comments and objections by victims, and further argument by the parties before proceeding with the sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On November 22, 2016, defendant opposed the request for withdrawal of the plea agreement. Defendant contended, among other things, that a third party has no right to compel or control the prosecution of an offense, and that\n   restitution was not available on the only count of which defendant was convicted. The district attorney also opposed the request for withdrawal of the plea agreement. The district\n   attorney argued the victims had a right to be heard at sentencing, and a right to lawful restitution, but that count 1 was the only crime from which a victim could receive restitution and there were \"no natural direct victims of Count One.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The victims filed a reply, arguing they were entitled to restitution for the failure to report conviction because failure to report an emission cannot occur without an emission, so count 4 was \"transactionally related\" to count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Sentencing Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Four attorneys, plus Mr. Kiesel as liaison counsel for plaintiffs in the civil actions, appeared at the sentencing hearing, representing more than 7,000 victims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court stated that \"the whole point of the hearing today was to allow people who wish to be heard to be heard about their concerns with regard to victim restitution as an issue in the case.\" The court recognized it had \"an independent duty to make an order which satisfies the interests of the victim and protects the victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The four attorneys presented arguments to the court on behalf of victims, and six victims also addressed the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the victim statements and argument, the court imposed the agreed sentence and dismissed the remaining counts. The court explained governing principles of prosecutorial discretion and control of the case by the parties to the litigation. While the victims had the right to be heard at the sentencing hearing to express their views on the propriety of the negotiated disposition, they had no right to intervene in the negotiated disposition itself. \"So really this boils down to whether the prosecutor has properly exercised their discretion, whether the court should approve the disposition finally.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court concluded that \"in the final analysis ... the People have not abused their discretion. They actually did something quite constructive to move forward immediately with protective measures, which have been accomplished ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court issued a detailed written order, including a finding that the prosecutors complied with their duty under Marsy's Law to give notice to the victims prior to the taking of the plea; that it could not\n   impose a\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   waiver\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (under which a dismissed charge may be considered at sentencing on charges to which the defendant has pleaded guilty) because a defendant's\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   waiver must be voluntary; and there was no basis for restitution under count 1 because the delay in notification \"did not cause the damage occasioned by the leak.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The court concluded: \"The District Attorney's Office has chosen terms that include proactive, extensive and costly repairs, hiring of additional personnel, testing, monitoring, and inspection and safety protocols, all funded by the defendant moving forward into the future for the general protection of a vast number of citizens in the Northern San Fernando Valley .... [T]he Court is persuaded that the District Attorney has acted to protect the greater public interest to achieve a result that protects not only the potential direct victims in this case, but the larger general citizenry, and does so by agreement thereby avoiding\n   costly and protracted efforts at achieving the same remedies through the courts with civil, eminent domain, condemnation, or injunctive relief litigation.... Count 4's dismissal is warranted without a\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   waiver in such circumstances, in the exercise of the People's discretion, and the Court is well within its reasoned discretion to approve this settlement in light of the immense overall public benefit to be derived thereby.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Postsentencing Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On December 28, 2016, the victims filed a notice of appeal to the appellate division from the judgment of conviction and from the denial of their request for restitution. The next day, the victims filed a petition for writ of mandate, asking the appellate division to set aside the trial court's order denying direct victim restitution. A few days later, the appellate division denied the writ petition \"on the ground the victims have an adequate remedy at law via their direct appeal from the order denying restitution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On August 7, 2018, the appellate division issued an opinion concluding the victims lacked standing to appeal the order, but had a right to seek a writ of mandate. Treating the appeal as a writ petition, the court denied it. The court held (1) there was no right to restitution under count 4, because defendant was not convicted of that crime; (2) there was no right to restitution under count 1 based on its \"transactional relationship\" to count 4; and (3) as for count 1, the victims did not establish \"that any economic losses they sustained resulted from the criminal conduct for which defendant was convicted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On September 21, 2018, the victims petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the appellate division to vacate its opinion and to remand\n   the matter to the trial court \"for a proper hearing on restitution.\" We issued an order to show cause why petitioners are not entitled to the relief requested in the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We now deny the petition in part and remand to permit petitioners to prove damages stemming only from the three-day delay in reporting the leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Direct Appeal Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As stated at the outset, we conclude the California Constitution does not authorize a direct appeal by a victim from a judgment or order in a criminal case. Section 28 authorizes a victim to enforce his or her right to restitution in trial and appellate courts, but does not specify enforcement by way of direct appeal. The right to appeal is ordinarily conferred by statute, and to date has been conferred only upon the parties to an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   While the voters could authorize a right of direct appeal by constitutional amendment, they did not do so here. We cannot infer, based on the language of section 28, that the voters intended a fundamental change in longstanding criminal and appellate procedure without expressly so stating. This is particularly so in light of Supreme Court precedent, well-established at the time Marsy's Law was approved by the voters, that \"recognition of citizen standing to intervene in criminal prosecutions\" would \"undermine the People's status as exclusive party plaintiff in criminal actions, interfere with the prosecutor's broad discretion in criminal matters, and disrupt the orderly administration of justice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Dix, supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at pp. 453-454,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20834\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201063\">\n    807 P.2d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We describe the governing constitutional and statutory provisions and case precedents that inform our decision, and then turn to the petitioners' contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Code, \u00a7 1191.1.) As amended by Marsy's Law in 2008, section 28 refers to the right \"to seek and secure restitution\" (\u00a7 28, subd. (b)(13)(A)), and enumerates 16 other rights as well. Victims are entitled to these 17 rights \"[i]n order to preserve and protect a victim's rights to justice and due process.\" ( \u00a7 28, subd. (b).) The rights include, as relevant here, the right to \"reasonable notice of and to reasonably confer with the prosecuting agency, upon request, regarding ... the charges filed,\" and \"to be notified of and informed before any pretrial disposition of the case\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd.

And it added the provision allowing a victim to enforce the 17 rights enumerated in section 28 : \"A victim, the retained attorney of a victim, a lawful representative of the victim, or the prosecuting attorney upon request of the victim, may enforce the rights enumerated in subdivision (b) in any trial or appellate court with jurisdiction over the case as a matter of right.

(c)(1)) - and the court's corresponding duty to \"act promptly on such a request\" (\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) - do not suggest to us an \"independent right to appeal\" a restitution order. The recognition of such a right in the absence of language expressly conferring it is inconsistent both with the prosecutor's exclusive discretion to conduct a criminal case, including whether to challenge judicial actions, and with the fundamental principle that the only parties to a criminal action are the prosecutor and the defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Dix, supra\n   </em>\n   , 53 Cal.3d at pp. 451-452,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20834\">\n    279 Cal.Rptr. 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=807%20P.2d%201063\">\n    807 P.2d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Petitioners resist this conclusion with several arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The constitutional language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Petitioners tell us they have a constitutional right to enforce their restitution rights in \"any trial or appellate court with jurisdiction over the case ....\" (\u00a7 28, subd. (c)(1).) Indeed they do. But petitioners simply assume this means they have an independent right to a direct appeal. They do not. Neither the language of section 28 nor the ballot materials accompanying Marsy's Law give any indication the voters intended to change current statutory provisions on the right to appeal in a criminal case. Several points are pertinent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   First, an appellate court has \"jurisdiction over the case\" when one of the parties - the prosecutor or the defendant - takes an appeal. For misdemeanor cases, Penal Code section 1466 delineates all the cases in which an appeal may be taken \"[b]y the people\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (a)) and \"[b]y the defendant\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , subd. (b)). Nothing in Marsy's Law makes the victim a party to the case, or purports to change Penal Code section 1466. Without party status, there is no basis for a direct appeal. Of course, once the appellate court has jurisdiction over the case, Marsy's Law gives victims the right to participate in those proceedings to enforce the rights conferred on victims in section 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, nothing in the ballot materials accompanying Marsy's Law suggested any change in the right to appeal from a criminal\n   judgment. The ballot materials described the changes that would be made by the amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The legislative analyst described the changes the initiative would make in \"notification and participation of victims in criminal justice proceedings\" this way: \"As noted above, Proposition 8 [the 1982 initiative] established a legal right for crime victims to be notified of, to attend, and to state their views at, sentencing and parole hearings. This measure expands these legal rights to include all public criminal proceedings, including the release from custody of offenders after their arrest, but before trial. In addition, victims would be given the constitutional right to participate in other aspects of the criminal justice process, such as conferring with prosecutors on the charges filed. Also, law enforcement and criminal prosecution agencies would be required to provide victims with specified information, including details on victim's rights.\" (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2008) analysis of Prop. 9 by Legislative Analyst, pp. 58-59.) In short, there is no intimation that the changes included a right of direct appeal for victims from a restitution order or any other order in a criminal case.\n   Third, and perhaps most importantly, the Constitution's appellate jurisdiction clause establishes and allocates judicial authority; it does not define or guarantee a litigant's right to appeal.

Restitution is not akin or even analogous to the length of a prison term (e.g.,\n   upper, middle or lower) or to the conditions of a defendant's probation, both of which involve an exercise of the sentencing court's sound discretion, as guided by statute and court rules. (E.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170, subd. (b) ; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420 ; see also rule 4.421 [\"Circumstances in aggravation include factors relating to the crime and factors relating to the defendant.\"].)\n   Restitution, by contrast, \"shall be ordered from the convicted wrongdoer in every case, regardless of the sentence or disposition imposed, in which a crime victim suffers a loss.\" (\u00a7 28, subd. (b)(13)(B); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f) [\"The court shall order full restitution.\"].) No discretion is involved, and the award does not depend on anything other than the crime of which defendant was convicted and the economic loss caused by that crime - no matter how \"transactionally related\" it may be to some other charge of which a defendant has not been convicted. In short, the appellate division did not \"br[eak] with precedent,\" as petitioners claim, when it concluded that \"transactional relationship is not the test\" for determining entitlement to direct victim restitution - quite the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This is not to say, of course, that a defendant may not agree, by way of a\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   waiver, to the payment of direct restitution on a dismissed count as a condition of the plea, if the plea is \"freely and voluntarily made\" - Penal Code section 1192.3 specifically provides for that circumstance. But those are not the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In sum, the rules on restitution are set in constitutional and statutory law, and we see no basis for construing them to say more than they do. Direct victim restitution is available only for losses resulting from the commission of a crime, from a defendant convicted of that crime. (Cf.\n   <em>\n    People v.

The Claim for Economic Losses Resulting From Defendant's Failure to Report the Gas Leak\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Petitioners' final contention is that they are entitled to restitution for economic losses they incurred as a result of defendant's failure to report the gas leak for three days. As stated earlier, the trial court rejected this claim, observing that the failure to report was not \"a crime that includes obvious causation,\" and that \"[t]he delay in the defendant's required notifications to various authorities upon discovery of the gas leak did not cause the damage occasioned by the leak; the damage would have occurred with or without the timely notification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The appellate division observed petitioners had the burden to demonstrate defendant's failure to report the gas leak was a substantial factor in causing their injuries, and agreed with the trial court that they \"failed to establish a causal connection between\n   defendant's failure to timely report the leak and any claimed injuries or losses they sustained as a result of that criminal conduct.\" The court elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \"The Victims offered no evidence in their written motion, nor at the hearing on the motion, and they made no satisfactory offer of proof to support the claim, made for the first time at the hearing, that they were damaged by defendant's three-day delay in reporting the leak. They did assert at the hearing that, had defendant reported the leak 'immediately,' the health department would have 'red tagged' the homes and then 'all of this damage' could have been prevented. Notably, however, the Victims did not elaborate on\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   damages were specifically attributable to defendant's delay in reporting the leak, as opposed to the leak itself. Indeed, the individual victims who spoke at the hearing exclusively addressed their right to restitution for the losses and injuries they suffered as a result of the leak and their sustained exposure to the leaked hazardous materials, not the delay in reporting the leak. No offer of proof was made that certain victims would testify that, had the leak been immediately reported, they could have responded immediately by evacuating their homes, and they would not have sustained injuries during the three days defendant did not report the leak.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Petitioners tell us the court applied an \"erroneous strict causation standard\" that is \"unprecedented,\" \"overly stringent\" and \"unsupported by the law.\" That is simply not the case. The court applied the \"substantial factor\" standard just as it was required to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It is not enough to point out we are to give a \"broad and liberal construction\" to the statute implementing the constitutional right to restitution. (\n   <em>\n    Martinez,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513493\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/140/#p1100\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 2 Cal.5th at p. 1107,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513493\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/140/#p1100\">\n    218 Cal.Rptr.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513493\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/140/#p1100\">\n    394 P.3d 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   states, \"[e]ven giving broad and liberal construction to [Penal Code] section 1202.4 [citation], we must give effect to the unambiguous language the Legislature has\n   chosen.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513493\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/218/140/#p1100\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   [referring to the limitation of restitution to losses incurred \" 'as a result of the commission of a crime' \"].) As was the case before the trial court and the appellate division, petitioners point to no evidence, and refer to no offer of proof that would support a finding, that the three-day failure to report was a substantial factor in causing their injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Petitioners offer only counsel's speculation that the losses they suffered \"could have been lessened or obviated altogether\" by reporting the leak three days earlier. Nothing in the record suggests that is so. And the case petitioners cite for the (correct) proposition that the substantial factor test should not be applied too narrowly (\n   <em>\n    Foalima, supra\n   </em>\n   , 239 Cal.App.4th at p. 1397,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20136\">\n    192 Cal.Rptr.3d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) demonstrates the lack of merit in their claim. \"The test, put simply, is whether [the victim] would have incurred damages had there been no [crime for which the defendant was convicted].\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20136\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In\n   <em>\n    Foalima\n   </em>\n   , the answer was \"clearly no.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20136\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Here, the answer is clearly yes. As the trial court stated, \"the damage would have occurred with or without the timely notification.\" No evidence or victims' comments or other offer of evidence that could be produced suggested otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   We agree with the trial court and appellate division that the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing was woefully insufficient to prove damages from the reporting delay itself - the proper measure of restitution. Nonetheless, we believe there was enough confusion about the scope of the sentencing hearing to warrant a new hearing on the issue of restitution only for damages occasioned by\n   the three-day delay in reporting the leak. The trial court stated at the start of the hearing that \"the whole point of the hearing today was to allow people who wish to be heard to be heard about their concerns with regard to victim restitution as an issue in the case.\" Counsel later stated that \"[w]e weren't quite sure how the court wanted to proceed in regards to the victims,\" and the court responded that \"the court wasn't sure how you all wanted to proceed, so I made arrangements to dedicate as much time as necessary to resolve this.\" These remarks establish that neither the court nor counsel clarified in advance the proper legal parameters of the hearing, that is, whether proof would be considered for all losses stemming from the leak itself, or whether proof would be limited to damages stemming only from the three-day delay in reporting the leak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The district attorney, as the local prosecutor of this environmental crime, was responsible in the first instance to propose to the court and the parties a process by which the victims might seek to enforce their rights to restitution. As the victims' counsel pointed out at oral argument, this was not the first environmental crime to be prosecuted by the district attorney, nor is it likely to be the last. Because the scope of the restitution hearing was not settled in advance, we believe it fair (and within the spirit of Marsy's Law) to remand\n   for a further hearing to determine what, if any, damages were caused only by the three-day delay in reporting the leak to the proper authorities, to which SoCalGas pleaded no contest as charged in count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   There is one final point, however, regarding of the agreed-upon plea bargain notice to the victims. In their reply to the returns of defendant and the district attorney, petitioners offer, as a basis for concluding the courts below applied an \"overly-strict\" causation standard, the claim that the district attorney violated Marsy's Law by (among other things) failing \"to give notice to each of the Victims, or at the very least their attorneys, prior to\" the trial court's acceptance of the negotiated plea at the September 13, 2016 hearing. They say this deprived them of \"a meaningful opportunity to be heard or to submit evidence of their economic losses.\" We reject this contention for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Petitioners did not assert any notice violations of Marsy's Law in their petition as a basis for seeking writ review.

We agree with the trial court that this was satisfactory notice of the proposed plea agreement. Petitioners have not explained how they were prejudiced by the manner or timing of the notice to Mr. Kiesel of the plea hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   We conclude with the observation we made at the beginning: No injustice flows from the legal principles we have applied. While many petitioners have suffered greatly from the Aliso Canyon gas leak, there is recompense to be had in the civil\n   courts, and indeed a specially assigned civil court to hear such cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   We know, of course, that criminal restitution is an entirely independent constitutional right, but it is available only for losses resulting from\n   crimes of which the defendant has been convicted. Victims may seek writ review, as petitioners did here, when they believe a trial court has failed to follow that constitutionally mandated principle. Defendant pleaded no contest only to the failure to report violation, and this court cannot interfere, in the absence of any illegality, with the prosecutor's discretion to accept that plea. There was no illegality. The trial court found the plea agreement \"protect[ed] not only the potential direct victims in this case, but the larger general citizenry.\" We find no basis to say otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The issue of restitution for damages caused only by the three-day delay in reporting the leak is remanded to the trial court for a new hearing.
