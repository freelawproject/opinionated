The facts of the case were these:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">In April term, 1800, final judgment had been regularly entered, and a <em>copias ad satisfaciendum </em>against the body had issued. In July term following the-writ was returned <em>cepi corpus in custodiara; </em>on which the defendant applied to set aside the judgment and execution on an affidavit of merits, and that his attorney, who resided two hundred miles back, did not know of the alteration in the rules of practice, by which the defendant was to plead in twenty days, and nol as before, in the next term. A rule <em>nisi, </em>for setting aside the judgment on payment of costs, and stipulating to plead in twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">Ko plea being given, in October term, 1801, judgment was confirmed, the roll carried in, costs taxed, judgment docketed, and the roll marked as filed, but the clerk had omitted to sign it. A <em>copias ad satisfaciendam </em>was issued, directed to the sheriff of New-York, and returned not found. In January term, 1802, another <em>copias, </em>but not a <em>testatum, </em>was directed to the sheriff of Ulster, on which nothing was done. In April term, 1802, a <em>copias ad respondendum </em>was issued against the bail on their recognizance. In July term, 1802, an <em>alias. </em>In September, 1802, <em>apluries. </em>In October term, 1802, an <em>alias pluries, </em>which, in January term, 1803, was returned taken. The application of last term was then made on three grounds: first, thatthe proceedings were irregular, the roll not having been signed by the clerk,,pursuant to the law of the 24th March, 1801, c. 75, s. 7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">Secondly, that there was no <em>testatum copias </em>issued to the sheriff of Ulster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Thirdly, that the principal had been discharged under the insolvent Jaw.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Hopkins</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac\">now moved for leave to enter an <em>exoncretur </em>on the bail piece, and produced the discharge of the principal under the insolvent law of the state. By this it appeared that the defendant\u2019s estate had been assigned by order of the court of common pleas of the county, on the 25th of September, 1801, and the defendant discharged the same day.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-7\">Golden, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abx\">The bail are too late in their application for relief. Process against the bail was returned <em>cepi cor- , pus </em>on the first day of January term last. They were, therefore, in eight days after absolutely fixed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">then said, on the first point, we consider the omission of the clerk\u2019s signature as an error of our officer. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This ought not to prejudice the plaintiff, defendant, or any other person. The judgment was docketed as the statute requires,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and therefore, the world has the due and legal notice of its existence. On these principles, we, the last term, ordered an amendment <em>nunc pro tune, </em>and the same must be done now, by ordering the signature of the clerk to be added in the same *manner. On the [*10] other two points we will, as the counsel request it, hear them at a future day.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Akq\">On Friday, in the second week of the last term, a motion was made to set a side the ca. <em>sa. </em>issued in this cause, on two grounds: 1. Because it ought to have been a <em>testatum </em>writ, it having issued into a county different from that in which the <em>venue </em>was laid; 2. Because the roll was not signed by the clerk,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and the record was, therefore, incomplete, and the judgment irregular.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The second objection we considered as a mere clerical omission, and it was disposed of at once, by permitting the clerk to add his signature to the roll <em>nunc pro tune. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>consideration of the first objection, on account of the pressure of business, was postponed till the present term; and it being evident that the object of the motion was the relief of the bail, the proceedings against them were in the mean time directed to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Another motion is now made for a rule that an <em>exoneretur </em>be entered on the bail piece, founded on the irregularity of the <em>ca. sa. </em>as above stated, and also on the further fact that the principal was insolvent, and was discharged under the insolvent act on the 25th September, 1801. The <em>ca. sa. </em>was returned <em>non est </em>in July term last, and the action against the bail is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">It is now objected, that the hail ought not to be permitted to avail themselves of the defendant\u2019s discharge, because it was not a ground on which the motion depended at the last term. But this cannot be a good reason to charge the bail, if they are otherwise entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">In the case of <em>Van Ahtyne </em>ads. <em>Brinkerhoff,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we [*11] permitted *an <em>exoneretwr </em>to be entered on an application from bail, under similar circumstances. In that case the principal was also discharged under the insolvent act, before the bail were fixed in law. The suit, however, proceeded against the bail, and the eight days after the return of the <em>copias </em>against them had expired before they made their application for relief. We decided, that as they were entitled to have the exoneretur<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> entered be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>fore they were fixed, and had barely omitted to have it done, they had not forfeited that right while the action was pending against them, and that the only consequence was that they subjected themselves to the payment of costs.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The facts in this case in support of the motion made this term are similar, and we think the former decision was equitable and proper in favor of bail, and ought to govern the present. <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> It is, therefore, unnecessary to give an opinion on the first objection made on the former motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Let the <em>egconeretur </em>be entered on the payment of costs.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b29-10\"> <em>Suydam v. </em>M'Coon, Col.

Cases, 329. <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>Ibid. 334,) yet, as it will be allowed at any <em>Vane pending </em>the suit, and this though they be indemnified, <em>(Browne-low </em>v. <em>Forbes, </em>2 Johns. Rep. 101,) they will have the benefit, of a surrender by an <em>exoneretwr </em>wherever the law has rendered the surrender impossible, <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>6 D. &amp; E. 247. <em>Merrick </em>v. <em>Vaucher, </em>Ibid. 50. <em>Cathcart </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>Col. Cas 60,) unless they be indemnified. <em>(Coles </em>v. <em>De Hayne, </em>6 D &amp; E. 246.) An <em>exoneretwr </em>will also be ordered, when the principal is discharged from the debt, either by having been taken on a <em>ca. sa. </em>and liberated, (M<em>ilner and others v.

The power which bail have to relieve themselves by a surrender, is preserved to both, when sued jointly, so long as it remains in either; and each will be entitled to avail himself of it, for their mutual benefit; <em>(Ballard and Parkman </em>v. <em>Kibba and Ludlow, </em>Col. Cas. 51,) nor does the principal\u2019s being in custody as a felon prejudice their right. <em>(Bignell </em>v. <em>Forest, </em>4 Johns. Rep. 482.)

Erom the relation of the counsel in that cause, the facts were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Riddles <em>v. </em>Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">The original action was brought in the mayor\u2019s court of the city of NewVork, and judgment obtained therein. The defendant brought a writ of error returnable to this court. Pending the writ of error, the defendant in the original suit was discharged under the insolvent law. Errors not being duly assigned, the defendant <em>nonprossed </em>the writ, issued a <em>ca. sa. </em>in this court, and upon a return of a <em>non est inventus, </em>brought an action of debt against the bail on their recognizance in the original suit. After declaration, plea, and demurrer, the defendant applied to the court to stay proceedings. It was contended, on the part of the present plaintiff, that the defendant came too late with this application, having pleaded to the action. But the court, on the authority of a case in Carthew,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ordered the proceedings to be stayed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\"> As to relief of hail after discharge of principal, see also, <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>6 Cow. 596. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Brown,, </em>5 Id. 289. <em>Franklin v.
