Com. 302, is express that it is not maintainable, because the right against the intestate is derived <em>ex delicio, </em>and therefore dies with the person. In the case of <em>Ilamhly </em>v. <em>Trott, </em>Cowp. 375, Lord Mansfield, in settling the meaning and extent of the rule now insisted on, specifics the action of escape against a sheriff, as one which, from its cause, dies with the person. It is an injury <em>ex maleficio, </em>from which the intestate derived no advantage to himself, and this is the principle on which his personal representative is not answerable. Ibid. 376. The same doctrine is to be found in Fitzh. N. B. 121, A. n. a. In <em>Berwick </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>6 Mod. 126,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> case 171. In Dyer, 271, a.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the same principle is acknowledged, for it is there ruled, that debt for an escape will not lie against an heir.
