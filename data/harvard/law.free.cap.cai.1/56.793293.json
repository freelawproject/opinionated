The sheriff had been ruled, and had returned the due execution of the writ, a delivery of the defendant\u2019s body over to one of his deputies, and a rescue, but omitted totally the commitment to prison.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-5\">Troup,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afg\">on an affidavit stating the preceding circumstances, insisted on the court\u2019s being under a moral obligation to order a return according to the truth of the case. That by the false one made, the sheriff avoided that liability for the full amount of the debt, from which nothing but an enlargement by public enemies of the <em>state </em>could exonerate him. It was a device to get rid of his legal responsibility; to leave the plaintiff only to his action for a false return, in which he could recover no more than his damage actually sustained, and in which the defendant\u2019s insolvency might be urged against a recovery of any thing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-6\">\n<em>Harison,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvO\">contra, observed, that <em>Troup </em>had stated the very reason why his motion should not be granted; that of the plaintiff\u2019s having it in his power to obtain a compensation in an action for a false return, to the full amount of what he really had suffered. The proceeding now was, to get from the sheriff a debt, of which not one shilling could ever have been obtained from the defendant. That the escape was at a time, full in the recollection of the court, when a number of the debtors broke out of the city gaol. Several had been indicted and sentenced to the <em>state prison. </em>The application too was very stale; the <em>second </em>sheriff was now in office since the escape, and five years had elapsed in silence. Perhaps the court might have some doubt how far it could in this manner interpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-7\">Troup, in reply, insisted on his former positions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A8R\">The plaintiff is not without remedy; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>has his action on the return. We do not say that in no case shall a return against truth be amended, but in this, under all its circumstances, we think the plaintiff must be left to such redress as the law will give him without our interference.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"><em> Potter </em>v.
