Defendant\u2019s attorney having nominated referees, and the party not having objected, he cannot, on that ground, move to set aside a report. The court will not notice any agreement in a cause between the attorneys, unless reduced to writing.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-9\">This was an action for damages in not delivering a boat alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b212-10\">\n<em>Woods</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKj\">moved to set aside the report of the referees on an affidavit by the attorney in the cause, stating that the witnesses of the defendant were seafaring men; that there had been an express agreement between the deponent and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that the referees should not make up their report until the testimony on the part of the defendant could be obtained; yet, notwithstanding this agreement, the referees had reported without waiting for the evidence on which the defendant relied; that a sum had been allowed the plaintiff for a loss, said to have been sustained by not being enabled to carry a quantity of wood to New-York, though it was proved, and even admitted, that a part of the wood was previously sold by the plaintiff; and the residue might have been conveyed to New-York had he thought fit; that the referees were nominated by the deponent without the knowledge of the defendant, Between whom and one of them a quarrel had taken place, which was not made up; that by the next circuit the defendant hoped to be able to procure testimony which would at least diminish the damages against him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>Skinner, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsSO\">read Ms own. deposition setting forth that he did not recollect the agreement above mentioned, and that_ at least it was not in -writing; that the referees met several times, and were as often adjourned at the request of the defendant\u2019s attorney under the pretence of not being *able to procure the attendance [*148] of his witnesses; that at the last meeting the defendant\u2019s attorney declined summing up, and so far from any enmity existing betwen the defendant and one of his referees, the very party named as being inimical was his special bail.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b213-5\">Livingston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APO\">delivered the opinion of the court. The defendant moves to set aside the report of referees, alleging,</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">1. That it was agreed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that no report should be made until the defendant\u2019s witnesses could be procured, which was afterwards disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">This agreement not being in writing, and being denied by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, must be laid out of sight. The court cannot too frequently inculcate the necessity of reducing to writing all agreements between gentlemen of the bar.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Many mistakes, much misunderstanding and controversy will by this measure be avoided. In the present case it appears that two months elapsed before the report was made, which was allowing sufficient time for the defendant to produce his witnesses. If they were abroad, he might have applied to the court (for a term intervened between the appointment and report of the referees) for an order on them not to proceed for a reasonable time, <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>would have been granted, or a judge at his chambers would have ordered the proceedings to stay until application should be made to the court, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">2. Another objection is, that a sum was allowed, which was not proved to be due. Of this allegation there is no satisfactory proof, and therefore we can take no notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">3. A third objection is, an emnity between the defendant and one of the referees.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This reference, it is observed, was on a nomination by the defendant\u2019s attorney, and although he might have been ignorant of the quarrel spoken of, the defendant by his acquiescence in the appointment, and submitting the cause to his decision, cannot now avail himself of this challenge. He should have applied to the court to remove him and appoint another.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> It is somewhat remarkable, however, that the referee who is repugnant or hostile to the defendant, should be his special bail in this very cause. [*149] *4. The defendant states that \u201c he can now introduce evidence to diminish at least the damages reported.\u201d This is very loose, to say the least. Why was not this testimony obtained before ? and to what extent will the damages be reduced, if it be offered now ? Will it justify a diminution of only one dollar, or less? If so \u201crife <em>minimis non curat lex,\" </em>and if the discovery had been .made even prior to the report it would be no reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>disturbing it.
