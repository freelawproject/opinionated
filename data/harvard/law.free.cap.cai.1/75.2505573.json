(Gobert being there) which after paying commiffions and premium, left 4349 dollars and 35 cents received by Gobert, which it was agreed was to be confidered as a prior infurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-17\">The amount infured on the policy was 7500 dollars, and for that fum the prefent a \u00bflion was inllituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A3I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>It appeared from the teftimony of the captain who took charge of the Helen on the 20th Nov. 1799, and continued to command her till the 6th February 1800, that in that time he expended in repairing and other neceifaries, 1335 dollars and 86 cents, including an item for wages in taking care of the ihip, to a period after he reftgned the command; his knowledge of the payment he faid was derived from the information of the perfons employed in that duty : that the Helen was American built, copper bottomed, and would have been worth in New-York, with an American regifter, 25,000 dollars; during the time he remained on board there were occafionally fugars and cotton put on board her, and taken out again to load other veifels at that place, belonging to Mr. Gobert. From the evidence of the fucceifor of the firft captain it appeared, that, being at Guadaloupe in July 1800, he received orders from Gobert\u2019s agent at St. Thomas\u2019s, to take poffeflion of the Helen, man, victual her, and fend her to him there. That according to an account of one Brocha, Gobert\u2019s agent, \u201c the purchafe money, unrigging and tarring, iafe \u201c mooring and guarding the ihip, while at Guadaloupe, \u201c amounted to 7000 dollars. The witnefs paid Brocha 3000 \u201c dollars, part of the purchafe money, and Brocha told him \u201c Gobert paid him 4000 dollars.\u201d Some expenditures were, made upon the ihip before the witnefs took poifeifion of her as before ftated, to the amount of which he could not fay. But the bill of diiburfements for the ihip, paid by him for repairs and necelfaries to get her diipatched on the voyage from Point-Petre to St. Thomas\u2019s, came to 4461 dollars and 87 cents, amounting in the whole to 7461 dollars and 87 cents. The ihip failed from St. Thomas\u2019s fome time in September : the witnefs was a paifenger ; on the voyage ilie was captured, carried into Antigua and condemned as prize ; a claim had been interpofed, in the profecution of which, ^.317:11:8-y was expended, of which the proportion to be paid by the ihip was admitted to be about 500 dollars. The witnefs received poffelEon in July. That the repairs and outfits and the expences thereof done to her afterwards were particularly enumerated in the accounts rendered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">Mr. Ferrers, an eftablifhed Infurance Broker, faid it was ufual in eftimating the value of the ihip to allow wages ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>vanced to the captain and crew: commonly a month\u2019s pay as part of the outfit of a veffel, alfo provifions for the voyage, and all other charges for things requifite and proper to prepare her for the voyage infured. That no expenditures whatever previous to the commencement of the voyage are charges againft the infurers on freight. That fome of the items in the accounts, in his opinion and according to his practice, required vouchers, or it could not be known whether they were proper or not. That in fettling Ioffes in fuch cafes, vouchers were required by him. It was admitted that nine livres make one dollar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\">The Judge expreffed to the jury, as the inclination of his opinion, that the policy could not be confidered as attaching from the firft purchafe of the ihip by Gobert at Guadaloupe, but from the time fome adt was done towards equipping for the voyage. Whether however this was the cafe or not, and even to fuppofe it to have attached at the time of fuch firft purchafe, that it was not necefiiary to difclofe to the underwriters the length of time the veffel had remained at Guadaloupe, nor that ihe had been ufed as a ftore-ihip at that place. He was of opinion that the account of the firft witnefs ought to be laid out of the queftion; yet however, independently of that, there appeared to be intereft to the amount infured in this policy, beyond the prior infurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">The jury found for the plaintiff, a total lofs, without going from the bar or examining the accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The application was to fet afide the verdict as being contrary to law and evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">Pendleton for the defendant, made two points : Firft, that the policy was void for concealment; fecondly, that, allowing it to be otherwife, the verdiit could not ftand, being againft evidence in finding a total lofs when only a partial injury had been fuftained. On the firft point he obferved, that a contradi muft be taken as it is worded, where there is no ambiguity, or it is no contradi at all. In policies of affurance \u201c at and from\u201d a place, means firft arrival at that place. Park 38,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and the cafe cited by Lord Hardwicke in Motteux v. London Aff. Com. 1 Atk. 48. It is true that the conitrudlion is not tiniverfally the fame. In France it is interpreted to be from the time of failing. 2 Emer. 14. But in England it is regulated by \u00edpecial contradi. 1 Marih 173. Bird v. Appleton, 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Marlh 6o. That <em>\u201c </em>at and from\u201d mean from the firft arrival* *s \u00b0kv*ous from the words themfelves, and the two firft cited authorities. If not fo, when did the riik commence ? The Judge\u20195 opinion would make a new contradi. It would' be from beginning to equip for this voyage. But how is this to be afcertained. The accounts of expenditure are without dates : they can ihew nothing, and this very circumftance is enough to throw afide any other interpretation than the one contended for; becaufe if the commencement of the riik <em>her </em>not mentioned, the policy is void, i Marih 182. If this be fo, then there was a material concealment in not difclofing the veiTel\u2019s having lain nine months at Guadaloupe, and ufed during that time as a ftore-ihip, or the ftay was a deviation. On the point of concealment, it is fettled that every fadt not difclofed, which would increafe the riik, is material and vacates the policy. 1 Marih 354. The difference of premium is deciiive on the importance of communicating her ftay. At St. Thomas\u2019s it was 30 per cent; here ry^-. To prove that concealing the length of ftay would vacate the policy, he relied on Hodgfon v. Richardfon, 1 Black .463, the ftay would deteriorate the veffel and increafe the hazard. It was therefore a material fadt to be difclofed, and if fo, whether the lois was occaiioned by the fadt concealed or not, was perfedtiy immaterial. Fillis v. Bruton, Park. 183. Seaman v. Fonnereau, 2 Str. 1183. But allowing the verdidtnot to be void the plaintiffs are not entitled to a total lofs, the amount infured was ----- dollars 7500 the firft coil of the <em>veffel </em>was, including the commi\u00edfions and neceffary diiburfements, but throwing out the month\u2019s wages and charges previous to the policy \u25a0 - - - dollars 5683 fo that the whole cannot be due.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-12\"><em> </em>Leigh v, Mather,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AtE\">Hamilton contra.</author>\n<p id=\"A10\">In this cafe the fituation and circumftances of the veffel antecedent to the orders for infurance were perfedtiy immaterial, and therefore needed not to have been difclofed. The only efledt which the Helen\u2019s ftay at Guadaloupe could have had, would have been to render her lefs fit for the voyage infured. That ihe was completely adequate to its performance, was a warranty implied in this as in every other policy. It is a fettled principle, that whatever is warranted againft, whether it be in exprefs terms or by implication need not be difclofed, and the reafon is obvious, becaufe it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>a riik the affured takes on himfelf. Though the conduction given to the words \u201c at and from\u201d could not be totally denied, it could not be univerfally acceded to. The interpretation relied on was applicable to only thofe cafes of infurance where a veffel was inlured at and from a port <em>to which she was going : </em>but when the terms in queftion were ufed in reference to a veffel <em>in </em>a diftant port, <em>from whence </em>the voyage infured was to have its inception, the expreffion could mean only from the time fome aft was done towards equipping for the voyage intended ; at the utmoft it could not relate back farther than to the orders for infurance. But as the voyage might, even after the orders given, be in faft deferted, it would perhaps be the fafeft interpretation to fay the policy ihould never attach but on fome overt aft indicatory of carrying it into execution. On the other point, the accounts and the teftimony on which they were founded were before the court, and carried their propriety or impropriety on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Per curiam. Two queftions are made in this caufe. I. Was every proper information given to the underwriter ? II. Were the charges proper and fufficiently proved ?</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">On the firft no doubt was entertained at the trial nor is any now. It was not neceffary to difclofe how long the Helen had been at Guadaloupe, nor that ihe was a prize ihip. The firft could be material only in cafe her being there antecedent to the infurance had enhanced the rifle, and the latter in cafe of a warranty or reprefentation which negatived her being a ihip of that defeription. It is of no importance how long ihe had been at Guadaloupe unlefs the policy attached from the moment of her arrival there, although it might have been feveral years before it was effefted. The conftruftion contended for would be unnatural. In a cafe like this, when a veffel has been long in port previous to an infurance, the rifle does not commence till fome aft be done towards equipping her for the voyage, or on the day on which ihe is ftated, as here, to have been in fafety in the port from which ihe was to fail\u2014this was the 28th of July 1800. If \u00a3he had been loft or injured before that day, the underwriters would not have been liable. When ihe is ftated to have been at \u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\"><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Guadaloupe on a certain day, it muft mean that ihe was there in fafety, and that no preceding accident was to be <em>J 9 r </em>0 . made good by the affiarers\u2014it cannot therefore be material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>where ihe was prior to that day, for the parties by agreement have afcertained that the riik lhall commence on the 28th July 1800.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The other queftion relates to the value of the veflel. In forming this valuation, there were added to the firft coft, fundry charges, on the propriety of which w\u00e9 are now to determine. \u2022 On the trial one account was rejected, and we ftill think thofe charges improper, becaufe they accrued prior to the 6th of February 1800, five months before the policy attached ; but principally becaufe they are, with hardly any exception, of fuch natures as to have been occafioned folely by her ftay at Guadaloupe, and fuch as gave no permanent value to the veflel. They confift (except one anchor) of provifions, which muft have been confirmed while the veflel was ufed as a ftore-ihip, and of wages and other diiburfements, which became necefiary by fuch ftay, and ought not to fwell the computation when we are afcertaining her worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">To the other account it is objected that the items are neither proper nor well proved. As to the proof, Davis, the firft witnefs <em>fays,t( </em>The' bill of diiburfements for the ihip <em>paid </em>by \u201c him for repairs and neceflaries to get the ihip difpatched on \u201c the voyage from Point-Petre to St. Thomas\u2019s, amounted \" to 4461 dollars, as per account (A) annexed.\u201d There is nothing of hearfay in this\u2014he paid the money himfelf, and ftates on what account. What he heard, related only to the purchafe money, not to what was paid for repairs\u2014it is true there is no date to this account, but it is a fair dedudfion, from the depofition of Davis, that all thefe expenses were incurred after he took poflefflon of her, which was in July 1800 : for he exprefsly ftates, that he cannot fay what expenditures took place <em>before the veffel came to his hands. </em>The propriety of many of thefe charges againft an underwriter on the veflel is alfo denied. If thefe be dedudfed, there will ftill remain a fum large enough to entitle the plain-I tiff to retain his verdidt. It is admitted that in eftimating \u00a1 the value of a veflel, it is ufual to allow a month\u2019s pay advanced to the captain and crew, provifions for the voyage, |and all other charges for articles necefiary to prepare her for lit. The counfel will be furniihed with an eftimate of the court according to this opinion, in which the dedudfion muft be regarded as liberal as they refpedt the underwriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Upon the whole, we are fatisfied that the firft coft of the vef\u00edel, and the expences of fuch repairs and outfits as are properly chargeable againft the underwriters on her, are fully equal to the fums covered by the two policies, and that therefore a new trial ought not to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">N.
