His second ground for resisting the application is, that on the examination questions of law will arise. This, if properly stated, would have been a good reason for denying the rule;<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> but on that point the affidavit is defective: it states his information and belief that it will arise; it ought to have said that \u201che is advised by his counsel,\u201d and even then to have set forth the particular and specific point, to satisfy us that it did exist. For these reasons, therefore, as the first taken objection *is waived, [*151] the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit is insufficient, and the defendant must take his rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Motion granted.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Lewis, Ch.

In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bayles, </em>2 Johns. Rep. 374, from the report, and in which it i\u00a1 to be observed the opposition was by the reporter himself, neither the points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>of law, nor advice of counsel, were stated by the affidavit. In <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>6 Johns. Rep. 329, the court seem to have fully adopted the principle of this decision as to the form of the affidavit to oppose a reference. It is true that in <em>Low </em>v. <em>Sallett, </em>in addition to the words \u201cas advised by counsel,\u201d the affidavit contained those of \u201cand verily believed.\u201d Whether these' minute diversities will reconcile the decisions, the reader will judge.
