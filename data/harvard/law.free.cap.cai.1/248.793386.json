If proceedings be commenced for lands to which a title is awarded by the commissioners for settling disputes to lands in Onondaga, within three years after, it is sufficient, though they may be faulty, and require amendment after the three years, to entitle the plaintiff to proceed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-9\">A title to the premises in question had been awarded by the commissioners appointed to settle disputes to land, in the county of Onondaga, to the lessor of the plaintiff, who had served declarations on the tenants, with the usual notices annexed. The declarations, however, contained blanks for the towns and counties, which, at the time of service, were not filled up, nor were they, in the copies an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>nexed to the affidavits of service and filed with them, on which the usual rule was entered.
