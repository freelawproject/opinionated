The answer shows the defence that arises on the return, and this is an attempt to do it away.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b441-5\"><em>Emott, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFIR\">The application may be novel, but it is not unreasonable. Suppose the witness had been examined in court, and had testified to a certain fact which, taken without any explanation, would, have one effect, if explained, another; might not a question be asked to ^explain ? especially when it comes out colla- [*346] terally. Here the deviation was not the object of inquiry The question was simply, to and from what places were you bound ? There may be an apparent, though not real deviation; for there might be a custom to go that route.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AGm\"><em> Livingston, </em>v. <em>Delafie, ante, </em>6, n.
