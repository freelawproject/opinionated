That Driggs was taken upon them <em>some time in March, </em>1798, by one of the deputies of the sheriff, named Hamilton, and that, at the time of the arrest, many threatening observations were made, by the defendant and Driggs, in case the sheriff should detain his prisoner in custody, as they insisted he was not liable to be held, having lately obtained his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>discharge under the insolvent act; that at the same time, theie was some conversation about giving a bond to try the validity of the arrest, and secure the sheriff in case Driggs should ultimately be liable to the abdve executions: that directions were given to one Frazer, the attorney in the suits against Driggs, to prepare such a bond; but before it was finished, the defendant told Frazer he need not go on, for that he (the defendant) would have nothing to do with it; that since the arrest, Hamilton had declared he had permitted Driggs to go at large ; that Driggs went a journey to the westward, and the defendant said he would see him forthcoming in ten days; that Frazer did not consent to Driggs going at large, but on being asked, whether he could be regularly set free, on some person\u2019s undertaking for his return into custody, Frazer answered, so it had been practised by others; that Driggs had been seen, after coming back from the westward; and that Hamilton had been heard to say, Driggs had returned according to his agreement; that on the 23d April, 1798, the bond, on which the present action was instituted, was drawn by Frazer, at the request of Hamilton and the defendant, when Driggs was not present, and that it was executed by the defendant at a house to which he and Hamilton went for that purpose; that the arrest took place on the 10th or 12th of March preceding, \"^between which time, and the [*453] 23d of April following, when the bond was executed, Driggs had been frequently seen in the streets of Loonenburgh, where he and Hamilton resided; that previous to the execution of the bond, Joseph Hopkins consented to its being given, and told Hamilton he would be safe if he took it; that, at the time of its execution, the defendant said he was not afraid of the bond, as he was positive his son\u2019s discharge was good; but, that he did not wish the sheriff to be hurt. The plaintiff here clcscd his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">The defendant gave in evidence, by a witness present when the arrest was made, that Hamilton agreed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>George Driggs, that he might go a journey to the westward, and that the defendant became his surety that he should return in ten or twelve days; 'that he <em>did, </em>return within that time, and was delivered up by the defendant to Hamilton ; that the attorney in the causes against Driggs said the sheriff would be safe in letting him go, if the defendant was surety for his return ; that from Hamilton, it was understood, that Driggs was not his prisoner at the time the bond was given, Frazer\u2019s assent to Drigg\u2019s being set at large was denied by Hamilton, who said, he himself permitted Drigg\u2019s to go the journey to the westward, on condition of the defendant\u2019s undertaking for the return of Driggs, the prisoner; that he did come back, as was promised ; but that Hamilton recollected no surrender of him into custody; that the defendaut said he was willing to give a bond to indemnify the sheriff,-and, on, Hopkins\u2019 consenting to the bond in question, it was executed; but that, the time of its execution, Driggs was absolutely at large, and had been so ever since his return; nor had the sheriff exercised any authority over him, as the deputy did not consider him in custody, in consequence of Hopkins\u2019 consent to the bond; that of such consent, the plaintiff, shortly after the suits against him were commenced, was informed, and that lie had satisfied the judgments obtained therein against him, within about five pounds. On this testimony the jury found a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">The present application was for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqEC\"><em>*Metcalf </em>and <em>Emott, </em>for the plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARi\">The mo tian now made is for a new trial, the verdict being contrary to law and evidence; and, it may be added, though it does not appear in the case, contrary to the opinion of the court also. It is an action of debt on a bond of indemnity, to which the defendant has pleaded that the bond was given by him to the sheriff for ease and favor. The first question is, whether the bond was so given, and therefore, void? The second, whether the judgments obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>against the plaintiff were deceitfully or negligently suffered*/ The first point includes matter of law and matter of fact. Whether a bond to indemnify a sheriff from an escape given subsequent to an escape, and when not in custody, be a bond for ease and favor, and, therefore, void by the statute, is the question of law? Whether the party was then in custody or not, is that of fact. By recurring to the testimony in the case, it will appear that Driggs, for whose ease the bond is alleged to have been entered into, was out of custody long before it was executed, and the very right of taking him was questionable, as he had been discharged under the insolvent act. Against what is advanced, the agreement to let him go, on a promise to return, cannot be urged; for, though he did return, he never was in custody, and the liberation itself, under the agreement, was an escape, <em>after which </em>the bond was given. Is, then, this bond such a bond as is made void by the statute ? It expressly refers to bonds given for deliverance, and refers to one in *custody only. 3 Vin.

If, then, the law be so, the first defence is entirely false; for, it is not a bond under the statute, and therefore, is not void. Had any thing been said about its being given, at the time of liberating George Driggs, it might, perhaps, have been invalidated ; but it was not only not then in existence, but not even contemplated. As to any fraud in the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>from suffering the judgments to be had against him, ii surely will not be contended <em>that </em>is proved, because they went by default. There might have been no defence, and then a judgment by default was the only honest one that could be had; for any other would have been dishonest, as it could have no effect but to increase costs. There was a clear escape, and a recovery was inevitable; for, no consent to the discharge of George Driggs was either given by Hopkins or the attorney in the suit. None of the words made use of imply it; they only mean that as the plaintiff would be liable to Wendover and Hopkins, he might make himself secure by a bond; and to prove that this was the true idea the parties entertained, Hopkins, as survivor of Wendover, instantly commenced a suit against the plaintiff Had there been a wish to exonerate the sheriff, and permit the liberation of George Driggs, Hopkins would have taken the bond to himself, At all events, Dudley did not assent, and whatever may be urged respecting Hopkins\u2019judgment . it cannot apply to that by Dudley; and to neither one nor the other of the suits, could the sheriff justify under the insolvency of George Driggs. In the case of <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>October, 1800, in this court, it was ruled, that a return into custody does not purge an escape; but, that the party may go at large again when he pleas\u00e9s. They, therefore, relied on that authority, in addition to those cited, to show that the bond could not be for favor. Also 6 Mod. 127. 2 Leon. 89.(a) 1 Salk. 271. 10 Vin. Abr. 111, M. 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b580-5\"><em>Spencer </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ_g\">If it be made appear that the , [*456] plaintiff *cannot, under the present state of pleadings, recover, though a new trial should be granted the court will certainly let the verdict stand. Where a jury have found against law, if sending back the cause be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>for a trifling purpose, and the damages small, the court will not interfere; <em>a fortiori </em>they will not, if they see no possible use can. accrue. At the trial it was not made a point, whether, from the condition as set forth, the plaintiif could, under any circumstances, recover <em>for an escape. </em>The words are, that if the plaintiff should pay, &amp;c. <em>\u201cby reason of the taking of the </em>aforesaid George Driggs.\u201d To the action on the penalty of the bond there are two pleas; one to the ease and favor ; the other, that the plaintiff had not been damnified. The replication means to raise this fact, whether the bond was given after Driggs had escaped, and to indemnify for that, or to obtain his deliverance at the moment when executed. The action is intended to recover what has been paid for an escape suffered, and not in consequence of having arrested. The defendant has engaged for nothing but for the taking; he does not say for the suffering to escape. This is a clear departure in pleading. The count, as appears by the condition, is for a taking, and the replication shows damage by an escape. The question, therefore, which now. arises is, whether it be competent for the plaintiif to aver a condition which does not appear on the bond. He cannot aver any thing which 'is not apparent. The bond is to indemnify only against <em>taking </em>on the writs. If Given cannot bring himself within the condition, he has no right to bring the action. Nothing can be averred which varies the condition. 19 Yin. 448, II. pi. 2: No averment against the condition of a bond. The contrary would overturn all legal principles of agreements, and on which the plaintiff resorts to recover damages If there be a recovery, it must be by paroi testimony directly opposite to the condition of the bond. With respects to the validity of the instrument, it is to be observed, that it is to indemnify for <em>taking </em>Driggs. When the wriis were put into the sheriff\u2019s hands, he was to execute them: no security from a third person, to protect him from the consequences of doing his duty, can be good. But, admitting that it is valid, if the plaintiff cannot depart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>[*457] *the condition, and in order to maintain his action he must do so, let the verdict be as it will, the court will not grant a new trial. For, suppose it was done, and a verdict for the plaintiff, a motion would be made in arrest of judgment for the variance; and as it appears on the face of the record that the condition is for the sheriff\u2019s not doing his duty, it is illegal, and the suit not to be maintained. Either of these reasons would be fatal, and both are certainly enough to warrant the refusal of a new trial. The second objection, stated in the rejoinder, still remains unanswered. The defendant was to be answerable only after <em>due proceedings </em>had against the plaintiff <em>ly reason of tin, aforesaid talcing. </em>These words preclude every idea of a default. The condition contemplates a payment after a trial <em>had </em>between the parties. Against all that is advanced on behalf of the defendant, it is urged, that if a party taken on execution escape, and afterwards a voluntary bond be given to indemnify, it would not be within the purview of the act. But this is not such a case. There were conversations at the time of taking, respecting an indemnification, and an agreement that George Driggs should be forthcoming. The whole testimony evinces this. Yet, were it otherwise, the law will not bear out the position of the other side. 4 BaC. Abr. 464, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> is express, that if a party be taken, escape, return, and give bond to indemnify, it is void by the statute and common law.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> On the point of fraud, the jury were the proper judges; it was submitted to them by the judge who tried the cause, and they have determined. The cases cited apply to transactions between the parties, and not to those between the sheriff and a stranger. It is relied on, that under no circumstances does this bond afford a ground for action, being void and nullity in itself; that the condition is to indemnity against the <em>talcing, </em>and that evidence of damage from an <em>escape </em>cannot, therefore be adduced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Emott, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKb\">We are here to argue on a question for a new trial. It is somewhat of a novelty, that we should be called on to speak against an arrest of judgment; all we have to show is, that on the pleadings the verdict is against evidence, and that we were entitled to recover. If the court will *look at the bond and testimony, [*458] they will see it was a bond to indemnify against an escape, and not against a mere taking. The intent of parties is always to regulate in matters of contract. The intent appears from the plea; for the defence is, that the bond was for ease and favor, which it could not be, if it was to keep harmless for taking alone. The testimony on both sides went to the point of ease and favor, and tended to show it was to indemnify, after a going at large, from actions of escape, which might be brought for that which had taken place. If there had been no taking, there could have been no escape ; and, therefore, the bond, transactions, pleadings and testimony, all show that it was to indemnify for an escape which had long before been permitted. This objection, on the word taking, was overruled at the trial, as the judge must recollect, though it does not now appear.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Emott.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akqq\">The dates stated, and before the court, will show that the bond coiild not be for ease and favor. The arrest was on the 10th or 12th of March. George Driggs was then liberated by the sheriff, and the bond not dated till the 22d of April following. <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Fleet,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in point to show that had George Driggs returned to the sheriff himself, he could not have been held, or considered as a prisoner. Where, then, could be the ease and favor in discharging a man that was actually at liberty? For the reason already given, a defence by the plaintiff to the actions against him, might have been highly improper; to show-the judgments, therefore, fraudulent, it ought to be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>appear that there was a good and legal defence, which tho plaintiff neglected to make. This was afforded neither by the discharge under the insolvent act, nor by the words of Hopkins. It is worthy of observation, that it does not appear George Driggs ever was discharged under the insolvent law, as has been asserted. Nothing of the kind was proved at the trial, and nothing appears in the' case: but had it been otherwise, the plaintiff could not have justified under it, for he could not take upon himself to determine on its legality, as it might possibly have been invalid from fraud. The only sections in the act [*459] for the relief of insolvent debtors, applicable to the present discussion, are the 7.tb, 11th, and 12th ; the first, after authorizing a discharge from debts and imprisonment, goes on thus: \u201cWhich discharge, or the record thereof, shall be sufficient authority to the sheriff for setting such prisoner at large, and the discharge shall 'also be conclusive evidence in all courts, of the facts therein contained.\u201d The second authorizes the pleading of the general issue. The third declares, that if the insolvent be guilty of perjury, or fraud, the discharge shall be void. Two cases, therefore, and only two, are specifically provided for; that of an insolvent\u2019s being imprisoned at the time when the discharge is obtained, and that of his being subsequently arrested. In the first, he will be liberated on producing the discharge; in the second, he may plead the general issue, and give the discharge in evidence. It is a mere statutory release, to be taken advantage of like any other, and avoidable by proof of fraud. If therefore, the defendant meant to insist that it ought to have been used by the plaintiff, he should have shown it below, that the plaintiff might have rebutted it by proving fraud. But it never could have been availed of by the plaintiff, as the judgments on which the suits against him were founded are in existence. When the writs of execution against George Driggs came into the plaintiff\u2019s hands, it was his duty to execute them : to obey their precepts, not to judge of their effect; his duty being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>purely ministerial. On this head the law is so strict, that it will not permit a sheriff to set up a payment, without satisfaction is entered of a record. 6 Mod. 27. Mor a release. 2 Leon. 89. It is submitted, therefore, that as the defence would have been useless, it could not have been intended; that the bond being given when George Driggs could not be eased nor favored, could not be for ease and favor, and that, as no kind of fraud is imputable in the recovery on the judgments, the \"verdict is against law and evidence, and must, therefore, be set aside.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u0430) <em>Stepney </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>Oro.

There can be no doubt that the verdict is against evidence. The one issue is upon the allegation that no bond was given, and that it was for his deliverance from such custody. But the evidence on *both sides concurs, that when [*460] the bond was given, George Driggs was not a prisoner, but at large, and had been so for some days, by the permission of the sheriff. The other issue is upon the allegation, that the judgments were suffered by the plaintiff to be entered by default fraudulently. But there is no svidence of such fraud, and no ground from which to infer my. A judgment by default is no presumption of collusion, if no real defence appear, or could have been made. The verdict must, therefore, be set aside, unless we perceive <em>clearly </em>from the case, that the plaintiff can never sustain a suit upon the bond, and then a new trial would be useless. A bond given to indemnify against an escape <em>already hap</em>pened., is good.(a) The bonds, which are void under the act, as being given for ease and favor, are those given by a person in custody. <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Bruner, </em>cited in 10 Co. 100, a.
