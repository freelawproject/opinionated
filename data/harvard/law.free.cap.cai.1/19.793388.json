That, therefore, there should have been two separate notices, each entitled against one defendant, and served on the different attorneys of the defendants.

The notice given to Van Schaick, attorney for Cooper, is entitled against two; and it is on that notice the application is made. The court are of opinion that this is the regular way in which the notice should be entitled; though each party should be served. It does not follow, that appearing separately, and entering into separate consent rules, justifies or requires a different practice; for pleading separately does not make separate suits.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The notice must be as the case was originally entitled, and a copy served on all the attorneys; for otherwise it would imply a distinct issue in each suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Motion refused, with costs to the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b45-9\"> Therefore, in such a case, only one <em>venire </em>issues, which is, \u201c therefore, as well to try this issue as the said other issue (or issues) above joined, between the said A.
