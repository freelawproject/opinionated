This, therefore, is a plain mistake of the rules of practice, which ought not to injure the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-8\">\n<em>Hopkins.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiA\">The plaintiff clearly was not ready; therefore equally in fault, whether the rule was as he imagined, or not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b48-9\">Radcliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATy\">Acting under that belief, he did not prepare himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\"><em>Hopkins </em>asked for a stipulation and costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b48-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ABo\">The excuse is certainly not sufficient to exonerate from costs. If admitted in one case, it must be in all; and, however the good faith of the plaintiff\u2019s com duct, and our belief of it, may deny the judgment moved for, to refuse costs would do away the effect of the rule. The plaintiff must stipulate.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">On stipulation and costs, motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b48-13\"><em> </em>See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Ball, post, </em>252.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
