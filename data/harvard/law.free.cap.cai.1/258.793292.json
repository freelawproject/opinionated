The plaintiffs proved by the testimony of their attorney in the suit, the handwriting of the makers, and, by another witness, that of the endorser, who was also the original payee. Having done this, they there rested their case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">The defendants relied on the note\u2019s having been given on an illegal consideration, and endorsed after it was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\">To substantiate these points, they proposed to examine the attorney of' the plaintiffs<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> to the following questions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>1. Whether he haa ever seen the note before the suit was brought ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">2. Whether, at the time of its commencement, the name of the endorser was upon it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">This was resisted by the counsel for the plaintiffs, because tending to a disclosure of facts confidentially communicated to the witness, *as attorney in the [*259] cause. The defendants then said, that they would confine the question to the witness\u2019s own knowledge, and did not wish to extend it to any information derived from, or communicated by, the plaintiffs. The witness then said, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>he had no knowledge of the note, previous to his being retained by the plaintiffs, nor of any facts or circumstances relating to the matter in question, excepting such as had been confidentially communicated to him by the plaintiffs : but that he had, prior to the bringing the present action, instituted a suit in the name of the endorser payee, against the defendants, which, on account of some unfair practices by them, had been discontinued, and the now pending action commenced shortly after. The defendants then called the endorser<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> to testify that the endorsement was made after the note fell due. The learned judge, however, rejected his evidence upon this ground, that no person whose name is on negotiable paper, and has given it a currency, shall be permitted to impeach it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">The counsel for the defendants then urged that they would waive all testimony that went to impeach the note in any respect, or the original contract between the parties, or to prove that payment had been made. That they would confine their question to this: \u201c At what time did you endorse this note ?\u201d But his honor overruled the question as improper. The plaintiffs, then, to repel the suggestions of the defendants, and to prove that they had treated for its payment, read the following letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">\u201c <em>Troy, March ith, </em>1799.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">\u201c Mr. Sylvester Bowlsoh,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">\u201cSir,\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">\u201c On my return home, I immediately informed my brother of the conversation that had passed between you, Mr. Baker and myself, on the subject of our business; since which, we have been round to all our friends, to see what assistance we could get from them, or what could be done in the business, and I am very sorry to inform you, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>we find it a thing impossible to raise the money, as the *situation of several of our friends is, in [*260] some respects, like our own; and people in general here are so much embarrassed, that it is impossible to get them, who have got any money, to advance any upon land - security, which is the only kind in our power to give them; and I know of no possible way in which we can pay it, unless you will consent to take part of it in the lands that I proposed to you.

With respect to the first point, we are ready to concede; that attorneys and counsel are not to disclose those secrets which \u25a0 their clients communicate. But in this case he was not called on to testify to any such circumstance. Having seen the note, he was asked merely whether he had not seen it in a situation different from that in which it was produced ? This [*261] question, therefore, *does not in the least contravene the general rule. He might have seen it before the suit was brought, without endorsement, and without any communication. If so, he ought to have been interrogated as to that fact. The boundaries of the line of practice in this respect, are accurately laid down in the books. Bull. H. P., 284; Esp. Dig. 717. \u201c The rule is confined to cases only where the attorney is called to prove facts communicated to him by his client, <em>in the course of </em>business, <em>and, instructing him </em>professionally.\u201d.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-6\">\u201c A counsel or attorney may be called on to prove a fact of their own knowledge, of which they <em>might </em>have had a knowledge without being counsel or attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">\u201c As if the question was concerning a rasure in a deed, they may be examined, <em>whether they ever saw such deed in a different plight; </em>for that is a fact of their own knowledge, but they may not be examined as to the expressions of their client.\u201d <em>Lord, Say and Sele\u2019s Case, </em>decided 10th of Anne, by advice of all the judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">\u201c So if they are to be examined as to the true time of the execution of a deed.\u201d Bull. H. P. 284. ' These authorities go the whole length of the case before the court. Ho communication was desired of the witness as an attorney. \u201cHad he ever seen the note without endorsement ?\u201d This he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>have learned when it was put in his hand: he derived his information from that circumstance, and not from any communications made. This, therefore, is perfectly analogous to the rasure in the deed; because, the inspection of the paper furnishes the answer, and the communications of the client are not wanted. l\u00edo confidence is violated; a simple fact, arising from the attorney\u2019s own personal observation, is all that is required. The object of the inquiry was to obtain the true time of the endorsement; an object in perfect harmony with the case put in Buller, of an examination as to the true time of executing a deed. The period of endorsement we endeavored to show both by the attorney and endorser. We alleged it to have been after the commencement of the suit; but the testimony of both our witnesses was rejected. If the question was proper, *we were shut out from our defence, and this, [*262] at once, is enough to warrant a new trial. On the second point it is material to inquire whether the court will extend the rule in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>so far as to preclude an endorser from speaking, where what he may say does not go to invalidate the instrument, and is, therefore, clearly distinct from the principle of that case. It is necessary, in order to determine whether the evidence was properly refused, to observe, that we entirely disclaimed every pretence of invalidating. All we did was to aver a fact which gave us a right to defeat this suit. So, that admitting the authority of <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>it does not apply here. To show this, it may, perhaps, be necessary to investigate jvhat is the point of the rule as then laid down: it seems to have been founded on public policy. By examining the defence in that case, and those of a similar description, it will ap \u2022 pear that it went to destroy the contract, and therefore, the court said, a man who has sent a note abroad, shall never contradict the instrument he has contributed to render current, and thus vitiate it in the hands of an innocent holder. If the principle be sound, an endorser, if examined for this purpose, should be rejected. But here, no attempt was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>made to set aside the note: no tendency towards affecting public policy is to be seen. The aim of the defendants was to impeach \"the practice of the attorney, and prove that issue was joined before the right of action accrued. The plaintiffs must know when their right commenced, and to evince that, does not touch the instrument or consideration. An endorser may testify to collateral facts, unconnected with the validity of the paper. He may prove payment; for that does not destroy what he has made current. There, fore, policy is out of the question: if it be admitted to operate at all, it must in favor of the defendants. When the plaintiffs commenced their action, they knew they had not any right. The endorsement was afterwards made, to do away the equitable and legal claims the defendants had, to set off what might be due to them from him who had demands against them. To the note itself it is immaterial when the endorsement was made, whether before [*263] or after *it was due; but to the defendants it is material,in the highest degree, for it either affords or takes away their only means of defence. Before the decision in <em>Walton </em>v. Shelly, any disinterested person, not infamous, nor incapable of being sworn, was a competent witness, eaving his credibility to the jury. It was not till then that the principle was narrowed. But as this case steers clear of impeaching the validity of the note, the endorser ought to have been received. The letter of the defendau ts does not impair their defence. If the plaintiffs had not a right of action when they commenced their suit, for want of an endorsement, the letter does not cure the defect, and work as an-endorsement.. It was written under an idea of the\" note being endorsed, and that the plaintiffs were legally entitled to sue. If it turn out to be otherwise, the misconception will not vary the rule of law, which ordains that all plaintiffs, to warrant their appeal to a court of justice, must have a lawful claim to what they demand.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-5\"><em>Henry, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjK\">Two points are raised for discussion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>first relates to the competence of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to prove the state of the note at the time of the institution of the suit. The second to the competence of the endorser to establish that the note was endorsed after it was due. On the first point, the law has been correctly stated. Whatever facts have come to the attorney\u2019s knowledge by confidential communication, he cannot be obliged to disclose; but to facts derived <em>aliunde, </em>or from his own observation, he maybe compelled to testify\". The-application of this rule is the only dispute. The attorney expressly declares he had no knowledge of the note before the commencement of the suit, and such only as was confidentially communicated by the plaintiffs. There can, therefore, b\u00e9 no doubt as to not admitting him to prove the time of the endorsement. The authority from Buller makes for the exclusion. There the rasure was made after' the deed came into the attorney\u2019s hands, and, consequently, the information could not have been derived from his client, but from his own observation. Where an attorney witnesses a deed, he stands in the same relation to both parties, and is put there for the very ^purpose of testifying. [*264] From the course of the transaction, it appears, the fact inquired into could have been known by the plaintffs\u2019 attorney only from committing the note to him to bring the action; this, therefore, is a confidential communication.' As to the second point, the principle on which the testimony of the endorser was refused, is exactly that of <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>in 1 D. \"&amp; E. and <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler, </em>in this very court, July, 1802. Every argument from policy to be drawn from those cases is applicable to this. If the endorser is to show that the endorsement was made after the note was due, he may totally defeat the recovery. For it lets in all equities which might be urged against the original holder, and may, in .effect, destroy the note, under the pretence of not impeaching it. If so, then the rule of policy is as strong in one case as the other. In addition to this, the defendants, by the letter of Eichard Arnold, acknowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the debt, and offer a mode of liquidation. The effect, therefore, is not only to recognize the debt, and the right of the plaintiffs,-but to waive every objection as to consideration and time of endorsement. It is a plain avowal that the merits are with the plaintiffs, and surely the court will not grant a new trial to hazard that to which the defendants allow we are entitled.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\">Spencer, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ4\">It would seem from the arguments of the opposite counsel, that our only view was to show that the right to sue accrued after the action brought; the object really is to prevent our being excluded from our equities, by an endorsement after the note was payable, and to let in proof that this was one of the Susquehannah notes, which have been set aside whenever presented. The court will perceive that there was a former suit in the name of the original payee; <em>that, </em>however, was discontinued, because a verdict could never have been obtained in it, the present action then commenced, and a' subsequent endorsement made. That the knowledge of this was confidential, is a mere supposition of the attorney. He imagines, because the note was, before institution of the action, put [*265] into his hands without an endorsement, that, therefore, its being afterwards endorsed, was a confidential communication. We deny that; and so, though we allow the cases of <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly </em>and <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler, </em>we contend against their applicability to this now before the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"><em> </em>The inadmissibility of attorneys and other practitioners of the law to testify to facts, the knowledge of which they have acquired from the confidence placed in them as professional characters, being the privilege of the client, <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Rastall, </em>4 D. &amp; E. 753,) whoever stands in that relation, is within the. rule of exclusion. A counsel, therefore, who has moved in a cause, cannot be examined as to the subject of the motion; <em>(Curry </em>v. <em>Walter, </em>1 Esp. Rep. 450,) nor an interpreter between client and attorney, as to the communications which passed through him. <em>Du Barre </em>v. <em>Livette, </em>Peake\u2019s Cas. <em>77. </em>Whatever is disclosed for the purpose of a suit is a communication made under the protection of professional confidence, though it he only by way of asking advice; (Wilson v. <em>Rastall, ubi sup.) </em>consequently, the relation of attorney and clie'nt may commence before a suit be instituted, <em>(Gainsford </em>v. <em>Grammar, </em>2 Campb. 9.) and will subsist after it be terminated. Therefore, though the cause in which the communications were made be at an end, a person who stood in such a relation cannot\" speak to those facts in another suit, <em>(Du Barre </em>v. <em>Livette ubi sup.; Wright </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>6 Ves. <em>jun. </em>280,) even when the client is not before the court; <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Withers, 2 </em>Campb. 578;) as m the case of an action for an escape, brought against the sheriff, the attorney for the original defendant cannot be examined to prove the debt. <em>Sloman </em>v. <em>Herne, </em>2 Esp. Rep. 695. Whether the information acquired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>attorney or other, be by seeing or hearing is immaterial; the law is the same. An attorney cannot testify to the destruction of an instrument of writing, where his knowledge is deriv\u00e9d from his own eye-siglit, if he was then acting as an attorney. <em>Robson </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>5 Esp. Rep. 52. In this case Lord Ellenborough held that he was bound to be silent \u201cas to all which took place .in the concoction and preparation of the deed, or at any other time not connected with the execution of it,\u201d he being an attesting witness. But Lord Kenyon ruled that an attorney who had prepared a bond and mortgage, might be examined to prove a usurious consideration, because he was, \u201c as it were a party to the original transaction, which did not come to his knowledge in the character of an attorney.\u201d <em>Duffin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>Peake\u2019s Cas. 109. \"What an attorney obtains his knowledge ofj as to the times, names and dates of a bill of exchange put, into his hands to proceed on, from the delivery of the bill by his client, according to Lord Ellenborough, are circumstances to which he cannot be interrogated. <em>Brand </em>v. <em>Ackerman, </em>5 Esp. Rep. 116. When an attorney attests a deed, he lays aside his professional character, and can be examined in the same manner as any other witness, as to what passed at the execution of it, but no more. <em>Bobson </em>v. <em>Kemp, nbi sup. </em>As the rule was framed for the security of the client, as to the instituting, prosecuting, or defending suits, and conducting their business, what is communicated after a suit is at an end is not privileged. <em>Cobden </em>v. <em>Kendrick, 4 </em>D. &amp; E. 431. Therefore, a former attorney of a defendant may be called to prove an offer made through him to the plaintiff to settle an account, and pay a sum of money acknowledged by the defendant to be the plaintiff\u2019s due; <em>(Turner </em>v. <em>Railton, </em>2 Esp. Rep. 414.) and; as the exclusion of his testimony is only as to that which comes <em>from </em>his client, he may be examined to prove the contents of a notice served on him by the opposite side. <em>Spencely </em>v. <em>Shultenburgh, </em>7 East, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">See also <em>Coveney </em>v. <em>Tannahill, </em>1 Hill, 33 ; <em>Brandt </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>17 J.

That the inquiry offered to be made of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, was improperly overruled by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">2. That the testimony of Boswell Lombard, the endorser, ought to have been admitted under the circumstances mentioned in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">With respect to the first point, I think the inquiry offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>to be made of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, was manifastly improper, and to have permitted it, woidd have been a violation of that rule, which the policy of the law has adopted, that an attorney shall not be <em>permitted </em>to betray a secret with which he has been intrusted by his client. This is the privilege of the client, and not of the attorney. It is necessary to be strictly observed, in order to protect a party in the full disclosure of all the circumstances relative to his cause, without the hazard of having them divulged. This restriction, however; does not extend to facts that come to the attorney\u2019s knowledge before his retainer, or to information derived from any other source than from his client. The inquiry offered to be made from the attorney, was whether the note on which the suit was founded, was endorsed to the plaintiffs, when the suit was commenced, with the avowed object of falsifying the endorsement, and showing the note to be given for an illegal consideration. To judge if Mr. Bacon could answer this question, it becomes '-'material, previously to know at what [*267] time, and from whom, he derived his information; if from his client, and after the commencement of the suit, or after he was retained to prosecute it, the inquiry, I think, would have been improper. Mr. Bacon, on examination, declared, that he knew nothing respecting the <em>note previous to his being retained </em>in the cause, and that all his information relative to it was derived from his client. The authorities cited from Buller and Espinasse, instead of contravening the rule above laid down, are in direct confirmation of it. The cases there put suppose the attorney a witness to a deed produced in the cause, in which case he may be examined as to the time of execution. So, if the question was about a rasure in a deed, or will, he might be asked whether he had ever seen such deed or will in any other plight. And the reason why such question might be asked is ai, the same time given, to wit, because they are facts <em>of his own </em>knowledge, not derived from his client, which manifestly shows the inquiry was relative to facts which came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to Ms knowledge previous to Ms retainer, or in some other way than from his client. Was that the case in the present instance ? Directly the reverse. The attorney expressly declared that all his knowledge respecting the business <em>war </em>derived from his client.</p>\n<p id=\"AIts\">The next question for examination is, \"whether -Boswell Lombard, the endorser of the note, was a <em>competent </em>witness to falsify his own endorsement, and prove that it was made after it fell due, \"and also after the commencement of the present action, with the avowed object of showing that it was m'ade on an illegal consideration, and, of course, void <em>ah initia. </em>This point I think settled, by the principles adopted by this court in the case of <em>Winton v. Saidler, </em>(July term, 1802.) In that case, according to my understanding of it, the court decided, that upon principles of public policy, a person whose name appeared upon a negotiable note, and who had contributed to give it currency and circulan on, should <em>not </em>be admitted as a witness to invalidate it. In that \"'case the witness was called to prove the note was made upon a usurious consideration, and of course void .in the hands of an innocent endorser. In the present case, [*268] the object *avowed was general, to show the note was illegal and void. It is not explicitly stated whether the illegality of the note was to be proved by the endorser, or by other testimony. If by the former, he would most clearly be incompetent within the decision in the case of <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler ; </em>and I cannot discover why the same principles of policy do not exist to exclude him from proving a collateral fact, for the express purpose of destroying the note: The note purports to have been endorsed before it fell due. The fact to be established by the endorser was, that it was transferred after it fell due, and, of course, open to impeachment. This was an indispensable pre-requisite; it was an entering wedge to effect its destruction. <em>&lt; </em>If this note was founded on an illegal consideration, the same malady would attend it, if it should pass through the hands of a dozen innocent endorsees, who had taken it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>in full confidence that it was what it purported to be; and having been endorsed before it fell due, the consideration could not be impeached.^ For the protection, therefore, of innocent endorsees, I think a party to a note ought not to be permitted to give the lie to his own acts, and contribute to the desi ruction of a negotiable note which he has circulated as genuine in all its parts. To say that a party to a note shall be competent to open the door, and progress one step towards the destruction of his own paper, and there stop and become incompetent, will, I think, be productive of uncertainty and endless confusion, and will require refinements, and distinctions, too nice and subtle for general rules of evidence. If Boswell Lombard was the witness to prove the illegality of the note, he was an incompetent wit ness within the terms of the decision in <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler. </em>If he was called to prove a collateral fact, indispensably necessary to be established, and thus aid and assist in in validating his own paper, I think he was incompetent wiiiiin the reason and spirit of that decision. It remains only to be examined, whether he ought not to have been admitted, after the defendants\u2019 counsel had wmived all pretence of impeaching this note, or showing it had been paid, and confined themselves to the simple inquiry, whether the note was endorsed *after the commencement of the [*269] suit. I think, considering it merely as an abstract question, the witness was incompetent to answer it. But the defendants here had abandoned all defence on the merits, and the only object in view being to turn the plaintiffs round to a second action, every fair and reasonable presumption ought to be made in favor of the recovery. If the plaintiffs were in possession of this note, as their own property, and in their own right, when they commenced their suit, the simple act of endorsing,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and thereby complying with the forms of law afterwards, ought not to defeat their action. It is not presumable they could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>commence a suit on this note before they had it. Independent of this, however, it appears from the case, that on the 4th of March, 1799, some time previous to that when the endorsement even purports to have been made, the defendants, by letter; recognized the plaintiffs\u2019 right to this note, made propositions for payment, and treated them in every respect as the real owners. Under' these circumstances, I think the time when the endorsement was in fact made, whether before or after the commencement of the .suit would have been immaterial. And it never can.be sufficient grounds for granting a new trial, to ascertain an immaterial fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the plaintiffs ought to have judgment upon the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<author id=\"b356-6\">Livingston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Yb\">The defendants, on the trial of this cause, insisted that the note was endorsed after commencement of the suit, and to prove this fact produced the endorser, whose testimony was not received. Whether the endorser be a proper witness for this purpose, is unnecessary now to decide; There is great danger in permitting any one whose name appears on a note, which is the subject of controversy, to be a witness at all. The court will not receive him to impeach its validity; and when a fit occasion offers, it will merit serious consideration whether it will not be best to exclude him altogether. It is true, that a man who comes forward merely \"to prove <em>when </em>he put his name on a note, does not excite so much detestation, as one who [*270] basely obtrudes himself *to destroy a security to which he has given currency, by affirming that it was given on an illegal, or without \u2022 any, consideration. The rule of the civil law, therefore, which says, <em>'\u2022'\u25a0nemo albgans suam turpitudinem est </em>audiendus,\u201d is adopted both in England and in this state: so also in Pennsylvania, the endorser and original payee was not permitted to invalidate his own instrument, by establishing a want of consideration, although he was a certificated bankrupt, and not interested. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>2 Dall. 194. For my part, it would give me less offence to see such a man expiating his fraud and effrontery in a pillory, than attesting heaven, in the sanctuary of justice, to the truth of asseverations, which at once evince his turpitude, and destroy his credit. Even in the case before us, the payee was to prove a fact different from the import of his endorsement, which, when not dated, is supposed to be made oh the same day with the note, and is generally so alleged in declarations. There was, then, some degree of turpitude in first putting his name on a note to enable the plaintiffs to recover, and then appearing at the' trial to destroy a right of action created by himself. But without hazarding an opinion on this point, I think the fact offered to be proved, considering the use to be made of it, was irrelevant. It is conceded that the defendants did not wish to ascertain the precise time of the endorsement with a-view to any substantial defence, of which the-makers might have availed themselves against the payee, or against the endorser, if the negotiation took place after the note fell due. Their sole object was to show that* the plaintiffs were premature in the commencement of their suit; because, at that time, there was no endorsement on the note. The effect of this would be to drive the plaintiff to another action, in which it is admitted they must succeed. This being the avowed object, the testimony was properly rejected. It is not to be presumed that any man will institute an action on a note not in his possession, and in which he has no interest. Such an attempt can only be followed by certain defeat, and considerable expense. But a note may be delivered to the plaintiffs before a suit. be commenced, *and the payee neglect to endorse it. [*271] Why should a court, in such case, prevent the plaintiff\u2019s title being perfected by a subsequent endorsement, and thus protect himself against the heavy inconvenience of discontinuing his suit, or suffering a nonsuit, on the payment of costs ? A plaintiff is permitted to fill up a blank endorsement, or strike it out altogether in court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>to facilitate a recovery; but never is an inquiry made into the real time of making an endorsement, unless for the purpose of showing the consideration illegal, as between the original parties, or to pave the way for a defence which cannot be used against a holder who receives it <em>bona fide, </em>and before it falls due. If the defendants had not abandoned this ground, the proof would have been proper, and it would only remain to say whether it could be made by an endorser; but, having expressly waived every defence arising from the lateness of the 'endorsement, the evidence, in my judgment, was inadmissible. The rule I adopt is this; that a court will ever presume an endorsement to have been in season, and admit no evidence to the contrary, unless as introductory to a defence on the merits, but never for the single purpose of showing the suit was prematurely commenced. I had rather let the payee come in at the trial and put his name on the note for the furtherance of justice, than open a door to investigations of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">But as the defendants did not relinquish the defence arising from an illegal consideration, until all their testimony to this point was rejected, it may be well to inquire whether the source from which-it'was offered to be drawn was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Mr. Bacon, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, was produced only to ascertain the time of the endorsement. Whether his relation to the parties' exempted\u2019 him from answering the questions proposed, is not absolutely necessary to decide; because, in the view which I have taken of this subject, these questions were impertinent, unless the illegality of the contract could be established. I think, however, that the judge did right in imposing silence on-him after his declaration, \u201c that he had no knowledge of the note, previous [*272] *to his being retained, nor of any circumstance relating to the matter in question, but such as had been confidentially communicated by the plaintiff-*.\u201d The right which clients have to the secrecy of their counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>produces confidence and a full disclosure of every fact necessary to the latter\u2019s forming a just estimate of their several cases; courts, therefore, are careful that this trust shall not be abused, and will not permit even willing witnesses, when thus connected, to disclose matters frankly confided to them in moments of doubt and difficulty. Whether he <em>might </em>have derived his information from other sources is here an immaterial inquiry; because, it is proved to have come directly from his client. Mr. Bacon might have advised the plaintiffs that they had a right, being in possession of the note, to commence an action, although it was then not endorsed, and take their chance in getting the payee\u2019s endorsement afterwards. The fact, then, of its being unendorsed at the time of bringing the action if such were the case, was a secret intrusted confidentially to Mr. Bacon, and he ought not to be permitted, after giving such advice, and bringing the action, to defeat a recovery by his own testimony. I can hardly conceive a case in which the privilege of the client more powerfully interposes itself than in the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The only witness, then, by whom the contract could have been impeached, was the endorser; and he being a party to it, was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Upon the whole, my opinion is, that as no one was produced to invalidate the note, which at one time was the only defence set up, but the endorser, and as his testimony could not be received consistent with our decision in <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler, </em>it became improper to show <em>when </em>the note was endorsed merely for the purpose of compelling the party to bring a new action. This principle is recognized by this court in the case of <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>in April term, 1795, Col. Cas. 36, and Hob. 199, cited in favor of it. \u201cIt is regularly true,\u201d says that authority, \u201c that if the plaintiff will <em>himself </em>discover to the court any thing, whereby it may appear that he had no cause of action when he Commenced it, his trial shall abate; of his [*273] own showing it was against him.\" On this our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>court, without coming to a decided judgment, intimated that the defendant could not avail himself of any such matter by plea, unless the plaintiff himself discover he had no cause of action at its commencement. And if not by plea, <em>a fortiori, </em>he ought not to be allowed to give it in evidence. That I may be well understood, I think it proper to repeat, that from the whole of this case, which is not very accurately drawn, it appears that the defendant had no other witness to impeach the consideration of this note but the payee, and that as he was properly rejected, or could not be admitted for that purpose, the defendants, in pursuing the inquiry as to the real time of the endorsement, had no other object in view but to turn the plaintiffs round, by'showing the action was prematurely commenced; for which single purpose I should have admitted no witnesses whatever to establish that fact. For these reasons, and as no injustice appears to be done, I am against a new trial.</p>\n<author id=\"b360-5\">Radcliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2W\">The note on which this action is brought fell due on the 31st March, 1799, or at the end of the three days of grace thereafter. The endorsement is \u2022 dated the 30th March, 1799.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">It <em>appears </em>that on the 4th March, 1799, and previous thereto, there were negotiations between the plaintiffs (who afterwards became the endorsees) and the defendants, respecting the payment of the <em>note; </em>and also that a suit had been commenced before the present suit, in the name of Lombard, the payee, and discontinued on account of some unfair practice by the defendants, as was alleged by one of the witnesses. This evidence was not objected to, and these circumstances proved that the plaintiffs were privy to the original transaction, or acted as trustees for Lombard, the payee. On this ground alone, I am of opinion, enough was shown to entitle the defendants to go into evidence of the consideration of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">But the principal point I think is, that Lombard was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>competent witness to prove the time the endorsement was ^actually made. This would not im-' [*274] peach the validity of the note, and, therefore, is not within the decision of <em>Walton- </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>nor of <em>Winton \u25a0 </em>v. Saidler, the latter of which was determined in this court. It was merely preliminary proof} which, if it appeared that the note had been endorsed when overdue, would have enabled the defendants to go into other evidence to impeach it. If no other evidence could be produced to that effect, the note would still be valid, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover. The idea of policy on this subject, appears to me to be carried beyond the reason of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">I also think that the questions put to the plaintiff\u2019s at torney, whether he had before seen the note, and whether the name of Lombard was endorsed upon it at the time of commencing this suit, ought to have been answered. It would not have been a disclosure of the secrets of his client, within the sense of the rule which prohibits or excuses an attorney from making such disclosure. \u2022 He was not asked to discover any thing communicated confidentially, but to answer a fact which he must have known from his own observation, and which, from its nature, could not be a secret intrusted to him. The endorsement or transfer of a note is a public act, and the discovery by an attorney whether it existed or not, ought, I think, not to be liable to this objection. The authority of Buller, which has been mentioned, is, in my view, to the same effect. I im, therefore, of opinion, there ought to be a new trial. Bull. N. P. p. 284, 288; Esp. Dig. 717.</p>\n<author id=\"b361-6\">Kent, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvYr\">The motion to set aside the verdict in this cause rests upon two grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">1. That the court overruled certain questions from being put to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">2. That they rejected the endorser as an incompetent witness for the purpose for which he was- called.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">With respect to the second point, (for I shall pass by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the first at present 'as unnecessary to be considered,) I do not think that the decisions of this court in the cases of <em>Winton </em>v. <em>Saidler, </em>and <em>Stewarts </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>(July term, 1802,) go so far as to warrant a rejection of the endorser in the \u25a0 present instance. In those cases, the maker of the [*275] note *in'the one, and the endorser in the other, were offered to prove the note to have been <em>usurious. </em>Those witnesses were therefore, called to invalidate the paper they had signed. So, in the case of <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>(1 D. &amp; E.,) upon the authority of which I presume the above decisions of this court were founded, the endorser, who was rejected, was called to prove the note <em>void </em>by reason of <em>usury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In all those eases the testimony of the witness produced went <em>directly </em>to destroy the paper. Here the question went no further than to defeat the present action, by showing that it had been prematurely brought. Proof that a note was endorsed after it was due, might indeed <em>lei in </em>the party \u25a0 to an examination of the consideration. But this consequence does not necessarily follow. The object of the party may be merely to set up as a defence payment to the original payee. And if it did necessarily follow, still it ought not to exclude the. witness, because the testimony that <em>he gives </em>does not violate the sanction which his name had given to the paper. The sanction his name gives is, that the paper is valid, because the transaction is legal and honest,- and he must say nothing that contradicts this. Whether the <em>date </em>of the endorsement be, or be not, correctly filled up, is a matter in which the endorser has no concern, nor to which he is considered as having added his assurance, because it is now the established usage for the endorser' not to date his endorsement. It is generally <em>in blan7c, </em>and the holder fills up the endorsement afterwards, according to his convenience. The <em>testimony </em>of-the endorser, as to the time of. the endorsement, does not, therefore, as of course, or by any direct or necessary consequence, affect the validity of the note, or violate his plight<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ed faith, to the world. And because it may <em>possibly </em>lead to other testimony that will impeach the note, is surely not enough to render the witness incompetent. It would be carrying the principle in <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>and the decision of this court in pursuance of it, beyond all precedent, beyond every <em>dictum, </em>and would lead, as I apprehend, to manifest inconvenience in the administration of justice. *It has been the bent of the courts for a [*276] century past, to enlarge the rule respecting the competency of witnesses. It must be a present and vested, and not a future and contingent interest, that excludes a witness. He must be interested <em>directly </em>in the event of the cause, and not merely in the question put. These are instances in which the rule as to interest has been straightened, and defined with the utmost clearness and precision. And I could wish to see this other rule of witnesses being incompetent, on grounds of <em>policy, </em>rendered equally manageable, by being reduced to limits susceptible of equal definition and certainty. To do this, we must adhere strictly to the cases which produced the rule, and exclude only the witness who is called to impeach his own paper, by showing it to have been immoral or illegal when he put his name to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">My opinion, therefore, is, that the witness offered was competent to answer the question put, and that there ought to be a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Lewis, Ch.
