If such a necessity existed in this case, the actual time of suing out the first process might have been shown by plea. But where it does not exist the fiction of law will be preserved, and especially so when it is in furtherance of justice. On this occasion, the true question, therefore, is, when, in a legal or technical sense, was this action commenced? This can only be ascertained by showing the time of <em>filing the bill. </em>The time of filing the bill may be examined into to show the time of commencing the action. It ought to have been shown by pleading in this case. Hot being shown, the court are at liberty to presume that it was after the cause of action accrued. The caption of the declaration is matter of fiction, and not conclusive upon either party. If it be conclusive, all actions by bill of privilege; actions against attorneys of the court; actions against absent or absconding debtors, giving security to appear to any declaration which may be filed by the petitioning creditor, would be defeated in all cases in which the cause of action accrued, during the vacation in which the declaration is filed. Because, in all these cases the declaration is entitled of the preceding term, and must necessarily be stated in the memorandum to have been brought ii ito court of that term. This doctrine involves no hardship ypon the defendant; because, if in the first instance process be issued before the cause of action accrued, a judge will discharge on common bail. So, if the bill be filed before \u2022 cause of action accrued, the actual time of filing it may be shown and pleaded in abatement or in bar. In this case, it do^s not necessarily follow that the cause of action did not accrue before the commencement *of the [*71] action, and the time of that commencement not being shown, the court are at liberty, and ought, to presume it to have accrued afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">In addition to this general reasoning on this subject, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>may be observed that, in this instance, the real cause of action is stated to have accrued in 1797 ; being the date of the bill of exchange and long prior to the issuing of process. It is the assumption, founded on that undertaking, which is stated to have been made in October, .1801; and the time of the promise being wholly immaterial, the court will, in this circumstance, see an additional motive for adopting the principle contended for by the plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\"><em> Johnson et al. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 Burr. 950. See Lord Mansfield\u2019s opinion 961. <em>Foster v. Bonner, </em>Cowper, 464.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-5\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Afl\">This case comes before the court on demurrer. It was an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>and the declaration captioned of July term, 1801. The time laid in the declaration, at which the cause of action arose, is on the 11th day of October, 1801. To this there is a special demurrer, alleging for cause, that the action appears from the dec\u00eda ration to have been commenced before cause of action arose. It is, .we take it, well settled that if the plaintiff <em>at the commencement </em>of his suit had no cause of action, a subsequent right would not maintain his action. And it has been settled in this court, in the case of <em>Carpenter </em>v. Butterfield, that as to every material purpose, the issuing the writ<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was the commencement of the suit; so that a note purchased by the defendant after that time, could not be set off against the plaintiff\u2019s demand.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The declaration must be captioned of the term when the writ is returned served. This point is settled in the case of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Muller, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and it is there also determined that the plaintiff cannot recover any demand after the term when, the writ is returnable, though before the declaration is <em>'actually filed. </em>Justice <em>Buller </em>there says, according to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ancient practice the declaration was actually delivered the same term the writ was returned, and it was only in ease of the plaintiff that the time of actual delivery was enlarged, but still it must be considered as delivered <em>nunc pro tune.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Upon the principles of these authorities, therefore, it must appear from -the face of the declaration in this cause, and the court must necessarily intend the facts, that the writ was returned in July term, 1801, and of course the action, both in fact, and technically speaking, commenced previous to that *time. But the plaintiff alleges [*72] his cause of action to have arisen on the 11th of October thereafter. We think, therefore, it appears upon the face of the record that the action was commenced before the right of action accrued. The time of actually filing the declaration cannot, as contended by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, be considered the commencement of the suit: if, therefore, the defendant, by plea, had put the fact in issue, it would have been an immaterial fact; all the material facts appear by the plaintiff\u2019s own showing. In the case of <em>Ward </em>v. Honeywood,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the judgment was reversed on writ of error, on the ground that it appeared on the face of the record, that there was no cause of action when the suit was commenced. If this would be error after judgment, advantage may certainly be taken of it by demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We are, therefore, of opinion, that judgment ought to be for the defendant.</p>\n<author id=\"b117-7\">Livingston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">In England it is settled, that the filing of a bill or declaration is to be regarded for every essential purpose as the conimencement of a suit. Cowp. 454. But in <em>Carpenter </em>and Butterfield, decided by this court, a different rule was adopted. The issuing of a writ was there considered as the beginning of an action, so much so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>defendant was not permitted to set off against the plainiff\u2019s demand, a note which he had obtained for valuable consideration between the sealing of the process and the arrest. This rule, to operate fairly, must be mutual; if an action begins by issuing a writ so as to deprive the defendant of a set-off in the case mentioned, neither ought the plaintiffs to recover a demand not <em>then </em>due. <em>My </em>judgment, therefore, in favor of the defendant is not founded on British authorities, but entirely on a former da sion of aux own.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Demurre vllowed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>\u0430) </em>S.
