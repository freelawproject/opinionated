This they have authority to do from their general controlling power. This differs from the applications to return evidence, because there it would be to assume a right to determine on facts, matters cognizable by a jury alone. The granting of a <em>certiorari </em>is not confined to reasons that appear on the record. In 4 Yin. 842, letter D. pi. 7, tit. <em>Certiorari, </em>the writ was allowed, to inquire whether the defendant, who had pleaded his protection as the <em>Icing's </em>servant, was attending on the <em>Icing </em>for his own business, or the <em>Icing's.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-5\">Henry, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUB\">This is, in substance, to bring up the fact; and this court has decided it will not oblige a justice to return evidence.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"APo\"> 1 Rev.
