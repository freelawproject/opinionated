John P. Byers; </em>this, he said, was fatal, there being no such suit in existence as the one in which the notice was given, but he added, he would not have urged it except from its being one of Mr. <em>Golden's </em>causes, whose state of health the whole court knew.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-13\">Spencer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbY\">contra, observed, that there could be np force in the objection, unless it appeared that the party had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>[*113] been *misled.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The notice was for judgment as in case of nonsuit for not proceeding to trial, therefore, it must have come from a defendant. In the next place, it was an affidavit, a copy whereof was annexed, and that affidavit was rightly entitled. It is a mere question of who shall pay costs. There has been no countermand, and the defendant kept all the circuit with his witnesses.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>Hoffman.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADS\">As this is the first default, will the court oblige us to stipulate ?</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\"> This is the true principle. Therefore, where the Christian name of a plaintiff was \u201cTeunis,\u201d and the notice \u201cJeunis,\u201d as there was no other suit against the defendant by a person of the same surname as the plaintiff, the variance was deemed immaterial. <em>Quick </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 133. So a notice to quit, styling the premises \u201c The Waterman\u2019s arms,\u201d was held good, though the sign of the house was \u201cThe Bricklayer\u2019s arms,\u201d the defendant holding no other house of the plaintiff, and there being no such sign as \u201cThe Waterman\u2019s aims \u201d in the parish. <em>Doe ex dem. </em>v. <em>Cox et al. </em>v. 4 Esp. Rep. 185. <em>See post, </em>344.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">On the same principle where a notice of executing a writ of inquiry \u201c on Tuesday the 14th of January inst.\u201d was given, the court of 0. B. refused to set aside the execution of the writ, because the 14th was on a Thursday, saying it was clear the defendant could not have been misled. <em>Batten </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AUz\">Stipulate to try at the next circuit for the city and county of New-York, and pay the costs of the present application.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On stipulating, and paying costs,</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Motioned denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Radcliff and Livingston, justices, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
