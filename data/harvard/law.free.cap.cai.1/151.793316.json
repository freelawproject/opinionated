That nothing would be lost by the plaintiff, as a trial might be had at the circuit in September.

If, then\u00a1 there is no title, if he is not landlord, and if there is no privity, how can he be made a defendant? If a man may thus come in and vacate a judgment, without any complaint from the tenant, there is not one which may not be set aside. There is nothing stated which shows that notice of the ejectment ought to have been given to the deponent. The tenant is not obliged to hunt out all persons who have claims; he can only be expected to communicate to his privies.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b219-5\">Radcliff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">There does not appear to be any relation between Masterton and the tenant.</p>\n<author id=\"b219-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Anb\">The party can take nothing by his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Lewis, Ch. J., absent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\"><em> </em>The claim of the landlord to defend, is thought to be by statute. 1 Rev. Laws, 145, s. 30. Lord Holt says it is of right, <em>Fenwick's </em>Case, 1 Salk. 257, but though before the statute a landlord might have been let in to defend, the second provision of the section seems new. It has been determined that neither a devisee, where the ejectment is by the heir, nor a mortgagee, who has never received rent, Bull N. P. 95, nor a <em>cestui que </em>trust; who has never been in possession, <em>Lovelock </em>v. <em>Doncaster, </em>3 D. &amp; E. 783, are \u2019andlords within the statute; that a devisee in trust, <em>Nonis </em>v. Doncaster, 4 D. &amp; E. 122, a mortgagee, <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>8 D. &amp; E. 645, though the report does not say he had ever received rent, and a lord claiming by escheat, <em>Fairclaim </em>v. <em>Shamtitle, </em>3 Burr. 1290, are landlords within. From this last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>cited case, it would seem, that all who stand behind the tenant may come in to defend for their own interests. See Jackson, ex dem. <em>Cantine and others, </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>(George Clark, tenant,) 4 Johns. Rep. 493, as to admitting alien landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\"><em>Slites </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>1 Wend.
