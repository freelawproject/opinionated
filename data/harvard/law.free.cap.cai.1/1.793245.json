This is a motion to vacate a rule entered the last term, \u201c for changing the <em>venue </em>to Montgomery, unless the plaintiffs would undertake to give evidence material to the issue Arising in the city and county of New-York.\u201d It is now said,- that the court committed an error in changing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>venue; </em>because, there being matter of law and matter <em>in </em>pais, material to the issue, in different counties,-the plaintiff \u2022 might elect to lay his action in either; and that, in such cases, it cannot be changed, unless for urgent or particular reasons. This rule, when well understood, is a salutary one, but it does not apply to this case ; it means, that-when official acts are done by the defendants in several counties, some of which are matters of record, and others of fact, there the plaintiff has his election. Thus, in the case of <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>1 Wils. 386, which was an action against the sheriffs of Eadnorshire, for a false return to a <em>scire facias, </em>the <em>venue </em>of which was laid in Herefordshire, it was alleged, on demurrer, that the action ought to have been laid in Eadnor, because, whatever acts the sheriff does officially, must be done in his own county, or at least, the law supposes them done there; but the court said, the sheriff may endorse his writ anywhere; and, as it is alleged that he did this in Herefordshire, the plaintiff has his election to lay his action where he can prove the <em>fact done. </em>Here the return was matter of record, but it is not on that account merely that this election is given, but because the sheriff was the party <em>who made that return, which was the gist of the suit. </em>If this return had, afterwards, been filed (as was no doubt the case) in the office of the court of king\u2019s bench, it would not have justified the laying of the <em>venue </em>in that *county. In the case before us, it is said that [*3] the judgment roll against the party who escaped, is filed in an office kept in the city and county of Hew-York, and, therefore, the <em>venue </em>cannot be changed. This judgment was no act of the sheriff\u2019s, and, therefore, not like the case of a return made by him in a particular county. Nor is it the ground of this action, which is, emphatically, the escape from the gaol of Montgomery.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">A principal reason for permitting a plaintiff to retain the <em>venue </em>where he has laid it, arises from the circumstance of \u25a0 his having material witnesses there. This rule should not be abused by too much refinement. If the recovery against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the party who has escaped must b\u00e9 given in evidence on the trial, it may be done by exemplification, which is the proper way; and this maybe carried'without expense to Montgomery. <em>Bulwer's Case, </em>in 7 Co. 1, only determines, and that on demurrer, that an action for maliciously outlawing the plaintiff might be laid in the county where the <em>copias uilagatum </em>was executed; and not necessarily in Middlesex, where the wrong was commenced by issuing the <em>copias ad satisfaciendum. </em>This decides nothing; for although the plaintiff may, in many cases, in the first instance, choose his <em>venue,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it does not follow that the defendant shall not change it, or that the court would not, in that very case, have changed it, on the common affidavit. The case of <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>in 6 Term Rep. 363, is subsequent to the revolution, nor can the facts be all disclosed. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>would hardly have said (and yet such is the effect of that decision) that all actions for infractions of patent rights are local, and must be tried at Westminster, solely because the patent, which is its <em>substratum </em>issued there. If this be his meaning, we are at liberty, considering the date of this case, to differ from his lordship; and it appears to us, with due deference, that the county in which the right of the patentee was invaded, was the proper theatre of trial; for there, and not elsewhere, the cause of action arose. So, in an action for an escape, unless particularly circumstanced, many reasons occur why a trial should be had in the county from which the prisoner fled. A sheriff ought not lightly to be called out of his county; the witnesses also must, generally speaking, be there; nor should a public officer be subject to the oppression and'expense of attending, with his witnesses, at a distance. Yet we are now called [*4] on, not only to sanction *this practice in one case, but to render it universal and permanent; of, in other words, to declare that every sheriff, however distant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>he may reside, shall answer, in Albany or. Mew-York, for escapes, for no other reason than because the judgment or writ, on which the person was arrested, is to be found in one of those counties. It is astonishing that actions of this kind have ever been regarded as transitory: this, however, without any decision on the point,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> appears to be the case. -Why they should be local, has already been suggested. Much vexation must be the consequence, if we decide (which will be the effect of a <em>vacatur) </em>this rule, that in no case shall a sheriff have a trial of this kind in his own county, because a judgment, which can be proved without the personal attendance of any one, has been rendered elsewhere. Actions of this nature are within the .reason of the \u201c act for the more easy pleading in certain suits rendering local certain suits against sheriffs and other public officers;\u2019\u2019 and it would be a good rule, in which I should heartily concur, to make all actions of this kind triable in the county to which the officer belongs, unless strong circumstances rendered it improper. Upon the whole, we are well satisfied with our decision at the last term. It was full as favor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>able to the plaintiff as he had any reason-to expect, and ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b16-5\"> See <em>Gilbert v.

Pursuing that' practice, the plaintiffs would be entitled to retain the <em>venue </em>in New-York. But he thought this a question in which we had a right to prescribe a rule for ourselves.
