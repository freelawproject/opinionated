If a sheriff were to serve one man with a writ directed to another, it certainly would not be a legal service, and, in ejectment, a notice to A. is not a notice to B. Kerman can never be Perkins. The court will not permit the possession of one man to be changed by proceedings against another. <em>Ex parte Reynolds, </em>this term. (Ante, 500.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b642-9\">\n<em>Woodworth</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avc\">(Attorney-General) read an affidavit, stating that James Kerman was personally served, and that the declaration, with notices annexed, were served on the tenants. He also referred the court to <em>Jaclcson </em>v. <em>Stiles, </em>ante. 249, for the same facts, on a former application in this very cause. The effect of the present motion, if \"allowed, would be, he said, to try and decide the cause against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>lessor of the plaintiff, as the limitation of the statute will then apply. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>3 Caines\u2019 Rep. 197, and the note there.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-5\"><em>Harrison, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ave7\">The effect of the statute cannot be taken into consideration. Suppose trespass for carrying away goods brought, instead of <em>assumpsit, </em>and the six years passed, would the court interfere to prevent the operation of the statute ? This case deserves no indulgence; twelve months elapsed before the application to amend in August last was made.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b643-6\">\n<em>Per Guriam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">The application in these suits is founded on a reference to the proceedings on file, by which, it is said, it will appear that one of the notices was misdirected, and the others in blank. In the affidavit on behalf of the plaintiff, it is sworn, that the direction of the one served on James Kerman, was to him- in his name, and that the tenants were duly served: if the facts were otherwise, it would have been very easy to evince them, by producing the several notices, \u00bfce. actually served, without referring to those on file. It is, therefore, to be presumed that the services have been regular. The court will, in the present case, support this presumption, as otherwise, by the intervention of the limitation of the statute, the plaintiff would be barred. The case of Eeynolds is very different from this; there no proceedings had been served on him; a different tract of land was. claimed ; the first intimation he had was by an execution which turned him out, and that very execution against *the possession of [*503] a different man. We there protected the right of the party, and we do so here. The tenants can take m thing by their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
