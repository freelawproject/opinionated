In addition to this, <em>Woods </em>insisted on the general rule, that in transitory actions the venue is never changed except on very cogent and strong circumstances. He also relied on the deficiency of the defendant\u2019s affidavit</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ACKA\">This is an application to change the venue in a transitory action; special cause<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> ought, therefore, to be shown. We are of opinion that what has been done is not sufficient to take the case out of the general rule adopted with respect to suits of this nature. The defendant ought to have offered as much to change, as the opposite party would have been obliged to allege in order to retain.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">Supposing, therefore, <em>that </em>to be the criterion, he [*123] ought to *show when the usury originated, and that the witnesses resided here; but the affidavit does not state when the usury took place, nor that the cause of action arose in Albany. For though the note is apparently made here, and payable at the Bank of Albany, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u25a0 it was negotiated in Bew-York, and the presumption is, it was made where it was passed. The doctrine now acted upon is established. 1 D. &amp; E. 781.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is necessary to show that the cause of action arose, and that material testimony is to be given in the place where the venue is to be removed. The defendant, therefore, can take nothing by his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Motion denied.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Radcliff and Livingston, Justices, absent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"><em> Jenkins </em>ads. <em>Union Turnpike </em>Company, Caines\u2019 Prac. 126. <em>Sayer </em>and <em>Hurd </em>v.
