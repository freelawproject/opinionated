The defendant obtained an order for a stay of further proceedings until the next term, for the purpose of then moving for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\">\n<em>Hawes</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa\">now moved, on the part of the plaintiff, for an order, that the defendant bring into court the sum found by the jury, with costs of suit; and that in default [*12] thereof, the order *to stay proceedings be dis charged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">In support of the application he read an affidavit stating, \u201c that since this cause has been at issue, the special bail has been declared bankrupt, and discharged under the bankrupt law of the United States. That, on the trial of this cause, a balance was admitted by the defendant\u2019s counsel to be due to the plaintiff of about 500 dollars. That, at the sittings in November last, on the application of the defendant, this cause was put off for that court, on the condition of payment of costs; but that those costs, although repeatedly demanded, were not yet paid.\u201d A further affirmation of the plaintiff was read, stating \u201cthat from the circumstances of the defendant he was in danger of losing his said debt, unless the money was brought into court, or the rule to stay proceedings discharged.\u201d A copy of this affidavit, it was acknowledged, had not been served.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">He argued that a motion for a new trial was an application to the equitable discretion of the court, to relieve from what, in the opinion of the party, was an erroneous or oppressive verdict. That it was a maxim of law, founded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>principles of equal justice, \u201c that he who seeks equity should do equity.\u201d From the affidavit it appeared, that the defendant had admitted on the trial that the plaintiff was entitled to recover about 500 dollars, which sum entitled him also to full costs. Before, therefore, the court would suffer the defendant to be heard on a motion for a new trial, they would require him to do what he acknowledged to be just. The bankruptcy, and discharge of the bail, and the circumstances of the defendant, were additional reasons for requiring the defendant to bring the money into court, to abide the event of the suit. That, from the great number of cases now before the court, it was not in the least probable that the case to be made in this cause could come on in its order,' and a decision be had thereon, in a shorter time than six or nine months; before which period the defendant, from his present circumstances, would doubtless be a bankrupt, or, as his bail were already bankrupt, he might abscond. Under such circumstances, <em>delay </em>was equally prejudicial as a <em>denial of justice. </em>It also appeared that the defendant was now in contempt, and liable to an attachment for non-payment of costs incurred on putting off the trial of this cause, at a former sitting. That it was a standing rule of . the mayor\u2019s court of the city of Uew-York, *that [*13] \u201c upon every motion for a new trial, the defendant should, within eight days, bring into court the sum recovered by the verdict, with costs; and that in default thereof, the plaintiff have leave to proceed.\u201d That, although this court might not be disposed to go the length of establishing such a rule <em>in all cases, </em>it was believed the peculiar circumstances of this cause were of a nature that would induce them not to hesitate in making the order now requested; or at least, for such sum as was admitted to be due, with costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-5\">\n<em>Bogert</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A41\">said the object of the motion was nerfectly new and unprecedented.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b34-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Atc\">The practice of the mayor\u2019s court, in obliging the amount of the verdict<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> to be brought into court on a motion for a new trial, has never been adopted here. The insolvency of the bail<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> is certainly not a sufficient ground to induce us to make such an order; and a copj of the affirmation, respecting the defendant\u2019s circumstances, has never been served on him; of that, therefore, we can take no notice.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But let it be understood, we do not mean to say that had it been otherwise we would have granted the motion.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Buie refused.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b34-6\"> But on a tender of it with costs up to the time, entry of judgment, and all further proceedings will he stayed. <em>Hatfield </em>v.
