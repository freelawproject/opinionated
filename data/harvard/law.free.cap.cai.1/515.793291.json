Notwithstanding this, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sued out an execution against the body of the defendant, upon the judgment on which he had been in custody, and took him upon the <em>ca. sa. </em>thus issued.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b663-9\">Henry,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXZ\">on these facts, disclosed by affidavit, moved that he should be discharged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b663-10\">This case, he said, is to be distinguished from that of Brantingham; in that, the court held the .plaintiff entitled, after notice of a rule for a <em>supersedeas, </em>to come in, charge in execution, and show that circumstance as a cause for refusing the application. <em>Blandford </em>v. <em>Foote, </em>Cowp. 72, recognizes the principle of the application. The court there decided that a man released for want of being charged in execution, <em>might </em>be taken on a <em>ca. sa. </em>in an action founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>on the judgment in the original suit. It is to be inferred, therefore, that on an execution sued out in the original suit, he could <em>not </em>be taken.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b664-5\"><em>Benson </em>and Biggs, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akh\">The English courts proceed on \u25a0his maxim, \u201c once supersedeable, and ever supersedeable.\u201d This we have departed from, and overruled, in Branting<em>aam's Case. </em>Besides, the whole object of the motion is to prevent us from doing that directly, which they allow we can accomplish circuitously; for they say we must proceed by action on the judgment, and have' execution in the second suit. This is contrary to the settled principle, that circuity and multiplicity of actions are abhorred in the law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b664-6\"><em>Henry, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arc\">The doctrine contended for by the plaintiff, would go to shut out, from a defendant, any right of set-off. Suppose a man discharged; in the course of fair dealing, he, by services, or other means, pays a part of the debt; if he is to be taken on the original judgment, he is excluded from showing perhaps a full satisfaction, till he applies to the court for relief, and during that period is deprived of his liberty.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b664-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AE4G\">In <em>Brantingham's .Case </em>we certainly did depart from the English practice. \"We there allowed, on a rule to show cause, the being charged in execu[*517] tian subsequent *to notice of the application, to be shown as a reason for denying the <em>supersedeas. </em>The court proceeded there on the idea, that the statute gave the plaintiff a right of election to have execution against the body, or the goods; and that he was not obliged to manifest this election till called on.<footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark> The present case is not of that description; that statute was only to prevent double executions. The plaintiff has elected to relinquish the person of his debtor, who, having been once actually superseded, must continue so, and the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>shall never have liberty again to resort to his first judgment. Let the defendant, therefore, be discharged, but without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Motion granted, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"[1]\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\"> See <em>Manhattan Co. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>ante, p. 67,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
