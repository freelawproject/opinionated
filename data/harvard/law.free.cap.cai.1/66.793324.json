The defendants\u2019 attorney thereupon entered rules for judgment as in case of nonsuit in all the causes, pursuant to the consolidation rule, and the costs were taxed, and judgment rolls ready to be signed. It was now submitted to the court, on these facts, to decide whether the rules for judgment, and the judgment for costs as in case of nonsuit, were regular or not; or whether they ought to be set aside, as at the time of compromise nothing was said about the costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b109-10\"><em>Hoffman, </em>as <em>amicus curiae,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9A\">mentioned, that in <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lochwell </em>it had been decided, if a party compromise without knowledge of his attorney, each pays his own costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b109-11\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AJB\">In every suit each party is supposed to advance as his suit proceeds.
