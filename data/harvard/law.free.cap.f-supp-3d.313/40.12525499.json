This Opinion addresses three outstanding issues. First, the Court has raised\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   the issue of whether it has jurisdiction over this action under Article III of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaratory Judgment Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2202. Second, Harford has moved to strike Defendants' Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28. Third, Harford has moved to dismiss Defendants' first amended counterclaim, which seeks attorney's fees, for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court will dismiss Harford's Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Harford may seek to remedy the deficiencies identified in this Opinion by filing a second amended complaint on or before May 28, 2018. The pending motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 15 and 17) will be denied as moot, although the parties may file renewed motions if Harford files a second amended complaint over which this Court has jurisdiction. The Court will also grant both Harford's motion to strike and its motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The amended counterclaim generally asserts that Harford's conduct in the insurance dispute has been vexatious, oppressive, and in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 75-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the Amended Complaint does not put the legal claim at the heart of this case before the Court. Under District of Columbia law, a liability insurer is generally obligated to defend its insured against claims that fall within the coverage of the policy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

While agreeing that Harford has such a duty to defend, the parties appear to disagree whether Harford has fully lived up to that duty. But Harford has not asked the Court to decide whether it has breached its duty to Defendants. Instead, Harford has carved out one factual issue-the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee-from that dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. at 6. It is telling that neither party has identified any federal declaratory-judgment case where the only issue presented to the court was the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee. While Harford cites several cases in which courts have determined the amount of a reasonable fee, Harford concedes that they did so only \"as a component of the broader duty to defend issue.\" ECF No. 30 at 6 n.3. Therefore, \"the court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate [Harford's claim] because [it does] not present a 'substantial [legal] controversy ... of sufficient immediacy and reality,' as required under the Declaratory Judgment Act and Article III of the Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    C.F.

Mar. 31, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Even if the narrow issue presented by Harford's Amended Complaint could be considered a legal dispute for which declaratory relief is appropriate, the Court would exercise its discretion to decline to hear the action in its current form. The discretion afforded by the Declaratory Judgment Act should be used to avoid \"the type of piecemeal litigation consistently rejected by federal courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3838937\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/778/75/#p78\">\n    778 F.Supp.2d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7850148\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/138/76/#p79\">\n    138 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   79 ). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that the issues underlying the declaratory-judgment claims were \"really just components of a claim for breach of contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7850148\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/138/76/#p79\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7850148\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/138/76/#p79\">\n    at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court explained, it would decline to hear those claims even if it could. The same is true here: the amount of a reasonable attorney's fee is just one component of a claim that Harford is in breach of its duty to defend. The Court would therefore decline to exercise jurisdiction over that piece of the parties' dispute in isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For these reasons, the Court neither can nor should exercise jurisdiction over Harford's Amended Complaint. But that does not necessarily mean that Harford will be deprived of a federal forum for this dispute. This case may well involve a substantial legal controversy regarding whether Harford has breached its duty to defend. If Harford has in fact failed to pay Defendants' reasonable costs of defense in the underlying Superior Court lawsuits, then Defendants may be able to assert such a claim against Harford. And assuming that the threat of such a lawsuit is sufficiently real and immediate, Harford may ward it off by seeking a declaration that it is not in breach of its duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270873\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/31/#p35\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court will give Harford a chance to rectify this deficiency, if it wishes, by amending its complaint to seek a more comprehensive form of relief. Harford must make any such amendments by May 28, 2018. If Harford seeks to make other, substantive amendments that are not necessary to cure the jurisdictional defects addressed in this Opinion, it must first seek leave of the Court. Because Harford's complaint is dismissed, the Court will also deny as moot the parties' pending motions for summary judgment. The parties may, of course, file renewed motions for summary judgment if Harford files a second amended complaint over which this Court has jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Alternatively, Defendants may file a motion for leave to further amend their pleading to assert a valid cause of action. The amended counterclaim will be dismissed, without prejudice to either of those possibilities. The Court cautions, however, that unless Harford files a second amended complaint over which this Court has jurisdiction, Defendants must establish an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over any counterclaim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marbury Law Grp., PLLC v.

Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Harford's Amended Complaint is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the pending motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 15 and 17) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   . Harford shall have until May 28, 2018, to file a second amended complaint that remedies the deficiencies identified in Section III.A of this Opinion. Harford must seek leave of the Court if it wishes to make any substantive amendments other than those necessary to remedy the deficiencies that the Court has identified. The parties may refile their motions for summary judgment if Harford files a second amended complaint over which this Court has jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition, Harford's motion to strike (ECF No. 28) Defendants' second amended pleading is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The Court\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim (ECF No. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Harford's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 25) Defendants' amended counterclaim is also\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The amended counterclaim is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   , without prejudice to Defendants' filing a motion for attorney's fees or seeking leave to amend. Finally, Harford's initial motion to dismiss (ECF No. 16) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
