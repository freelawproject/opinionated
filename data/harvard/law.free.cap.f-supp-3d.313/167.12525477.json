Holdings from the Supreme Court and various circuits suggest that, when a Defendant is sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment that is\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   than his or her recommended Guidelines range, the sentence is not \"based on\" the Guidelines, but on the mandatory minimum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1789-90,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202465190\">\n    2018 WL 2465190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

In those cases, the mandatory minimum effectively supersedes the Guidelines range, which then drops out of the sentencing framework and is not considered by the judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n    635 Fed.Appx. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710 (11th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, however, Mr. Jones' mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months fell\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   his Guidelines range of 120 to 135 months. Probation Memo, ECF No. 233. And when the mandatory minimum falls within or below the defendant's Guidelines range, the sentencing guidelines require the district judge to impose a sentence equal to or greater than the mandatory minimum but \"within the applicable guideline range.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c). The sentencing judge in this case was accordingly required to consider Mr. Jones' Guidelines range (120-135 months) as part of her sentencing framework. Accordingly, Mr. Jones' sentence was \"based on\" the Guidelines, as they played a relevant part in the sentencing judge's framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n    635 Fed.Appx. at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The second part of the inquiry into whether Defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c) looks to whether the retroactive amendment to the Guidelines had the effect of lowering Defendant's Guidelines range. When Mr. Jones was sentenced, his Guidelines range was 120 to 135 months' imprisonment. Probation Memo, ECF No. 233. Absent his mandatory minimum, the amendment would have lowered his range to 87-108 months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But because his mandatory minimum of 120 months was greater than the 87-108 month range, the amendment only lowered his range to 120 months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (\"[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence\"). Amendment 782 accordingly had the effect of reducing Defendant's range from 120-135 months to 120 months. Although the amendment did not lower the bottom end of Defendant's range, it had the effect of reducing his overall range because, \"had [Defendant] been sentenced originally to a term longer than the statutory minimum (between 120 and 135 months), he would have been eligible for a sentence reduction notwithstanding\n   the fact that the low end of his range did not change.\"\n   <em>\n    Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n    635 Fed.Appx. at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (parenthetical in original). The Court accordingly concludes that the amendment had the effect of reducing Defendant's applicable Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The third and final analysis looks to whether Defendant's proposed sentence reduction would result in a sentence that is less than the minimum of the amended guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (\"the court shall not reduce the defendant's term of imprisonment... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\"). Here, the minimum of the amended guidelines is 120 months. Probation Memo, ECF No. 233. Mr. Jones, however, asks the Court to reduce his sentence to 97 to 108 months. Petitioner's Mot. For a Reduction of his Sentence, ECF No. 217, at 3. Mr. Jones is ineligible for a reduced term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the Court is not authorized to reduce his term of imprisonment below 120 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Because Mr. Jones is not eligible for a reduction under step one of the inquiry, which looks to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the Court need not engage in step two, which involves analyzing the factors set out in 3553(a).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Because this Order references documents that are not publicly available, it is being sealed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    As a preliminary matter, Defendant was sentenced in accordance with a written plea agreement executed pursuant to F.R.C.P.

The fact that Defendant's sentence was based on a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, however, does not categorically bar a \u00a7 3582(c) motion as his sentence could still have been \"based on\" the Guidelines' sentencing range.\n    <em>\n     Hughes v.
