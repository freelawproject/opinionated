MOON, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2010, Christopher Mixell pled guilty to the Oregon crime of encouraging child\n   sexual abuse. Oregon alleged Mixell knowingly possessed \"a motion picture of sexually explicit conduct involving a child for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual desires of himself or another,\" and that he knew (but disregarded) the fact that creation of the material \"involved child abuse.\" As a factual predicate for his plea, Mixell admitted in writing that he \"possessed (by computer) a photograph depicting [a] child engaged in [a] sexual act.\" The United States now has charged Mixell with failure to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (\"SORNA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mixell filed two motions to dismiss, one on statutory grounds and another on constitutional grounds. This opinion addresses only the statutory motion, which argues that Mixell's Oregon conviction does not meet SORNA's definition of a \"sex offender,\" and therefore he was not required to register as such. But Mixell's Oregon conviction does fall within SORNA because it involved \"conduct that by its nature is a sex offense against a minor,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(I), as well as \"criminal sexual conduct involving a minor,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20911(7)(H), and the \"possession, production or distribution of child pornography,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20911(7)(G).

(Dkt. 48 at 2). Mixell specifically invited the Court to consider the Government's submissions of the state charging document, his guilty plea, and the judgment.

Reduced to a sentence, the argument advanced in his moving brief is this: The Oregon conviction is not a sex offense under SORNA because, applying the categorical approach, the Oregon crime he pled to,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20163.686\">\n    Or. Rev.

To begin to evaluate this position, one must become familiar with SORNA's detailed text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal law provides for up to a 10-year sentence for a person who travels in interstate commerce and \"knowingly fails to register or update a registration\" as otherwise required by SORNA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202250\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

A \"sex offender\" must register in every jurisdiction where he or she resides, is employed, or is a student.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016901\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20913.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The statutory question here rests upon a set of nested definitions. A \"sex offender\" is defined as an individual \"convicted of a sex offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).

The phrase \"specified offense against a minor\" is further defined. It means an offense \"against a minor that involves\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the following\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (A)\n   </strong>\n   An offense (unless committed by a parent or guardian) involving kidnapping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    (B)\n   </strong>\n   An offense (unless committed by a parent or guardian) involving false imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    (C)\n   </strong>\n   Solicitation to engage in sexual conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    (D)\n   </strong>\n   Use in a sexual performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    (E)\n   </strong>\n   Solicitation to practice prostitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    (F)\n   </strong>\n   Video voyeurism as described in section 1801 of Title 18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    (G)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Possession, production, or distribution of child pornography.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    (H)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Criminal sexual conduct involving a minor\n   </em>\n   , or the use of the Internet to facilitate or attempt such conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    (I)\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Any conduct that by its nature is a sex offense against a minor.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To put all this in plain English (but in a way that is by no means exhaustive), a person must register as a \"sex offender\" under SORNA if he or she has been convicted of a crime against a minor that involves at least one of the nine categories listed in \u00a7 20911(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   So, turning back to Mixell, his argument-this time set out in premise form-is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. A sex offense under SORNA includes a \"specified offense against a minor.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. One such specified offense is \"[p]ossession, production, or distribution of child pornography\" under \u00a7 20911(7)(G) (\"subsection (7)(G)\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. Subsection (7)(G), according to Mixell, incorporates the federal definition of child pornography.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. The \"federal definition of child pornography does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include any depiction\n   of a minor's breasts.\" (Dkt. 25 at 3 (emphasis in original) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5. But Oregon law\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   include lewd exhibitions of minor's breasts within its definition of \"sexually explicit conduct,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20163.665\">\n    Or.

Stat. \u00a7 163.665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(f), which is incorporated into Oregon Code \u00a7 163.686,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the statute to which Mixell pled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6. The categorical approach applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   7. So, as (4) and (5) show, Oregon Code \u00a7 163.868 is categorically broader than federal child pornography.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   8. Thus, Oregon Code \u00a7 163.868 does not qualify under subsection (7)(G) as an offense requiring SORNA registration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   There are multiple reasons why Mixell's argument does not prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Parts of \u00a7 20911(7) Besides Subsection (7)(G) Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The above line of reasoning in Mixell's opening brief assumes that subsection (7)(G)- the part mentioning possession of child pornography-is the only SORNA provision that might require him to register. But a \"specified offense against a minor\" in \u00a7 20911(7) is defined as \"any\" of nine possibilities. As a result, to show SORNA does not require him to register, Mixell must demonstrate that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of those definitions apply to his Oregon conviction. This he cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. SORNA's residual clause, \u00a7 20911(7)(I)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   One definition of a \"specified offense against a minor\" is an offense that \"involves ... [a]ny\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    by its nature\n   </em>\n   is a sex offense against a minor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(I) (emphasis added). The parties call this provision the SORNA residual clause. Mixell rightly conceded in his reply brief that the Fourth Circuit has rejected the categorical approach when analyzing the SORNA residual clause. (Dkt. 38 at 3). Instead, the Fourth Circuit applies the \"circumstance-specific approach.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Dkt. 38 at 5-6). His Oregon indictment charged him with possessing a motion picture of sexually explicit conduct involving a child, he admitted in his plea agreement to possessing a photograph of a minor engaged in a sex act, and his judgment ordered him to register as a sex offender under Oregon law. The Court holds that possessing a pornographic image (or motion picture) depicting a child engaged in a sex act is definitively conduct that by its nature is a sex offense against a minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That someone is a victim. And that victim in Mixell's Oregon case was the minor who was photographed while engaged in sexual activity. That's sufficient to satisfy SORNA's residual\n   clause. Perhaps anticipating this conclusion, a paragraph at the end of Mixell's reply brief contends that SORNA's residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. (Dkt. 38 at 6). But arguments made for the first time in reply are not properly before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Again, possessing an image of a child engaged in a sex act surely suffices as \"criminal sexual conduct involving a minor.\" Mixell's actions were undoubtedly criminal and involved a minor, and the \"sexual conduct\" was twofold: possessing the pornography itself and the underlying sex act being perpetrated against the minor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mixell, though, contends that the categorical approach rather than the circumstance-specific approach should apply. The rationale of the Fourth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   decision says otherwise. Although it dealt with SORNA's residual clause,\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   looked to the \"text, structure, and purpose of the relevant SORNA provisions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n    777 F.3d at 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the residual clause, subsection (7)(H)'s \"explicit reference to the 'conduct' underlying a prior offense ... refers to how an offense was committed-not a generic offense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n    at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The purposes of SORNA similarly support the circumstance-specific approach.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3986916\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/777/700/#p708\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As a result, the circumstance-specific approach, rather than the categorical one, applies, bringing within its reach Mixell's Oregon conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mixell's Conviction Also Falls Under \u00a7 20911(7)(G)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Turning at last back to Mixell's original argument that his Oregon conviction was not an offense involving the \"[p]ossession, production, or distribution of child pornography,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020911\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7)(G), it too fails. As explained earlier, Mixell's position depends upon reading the federal definition of child pornography, 18 U.S.C. 2256(8), into subsection (7)(G), which then serves as a launching point to categorically compare federal child pornography to the relevant Oregon statute. (Dkt. 25 at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   But instead of importing \u00a7 2256(8) into subsection (7)(G), SORNA gives the contrary indication. It does not incorporate or cross-reference the federal definition of child pornography, even though the immediately prior subsection of SORNA, \u00a7 20911(7)(H), did just that regarding video voyeurism \"as described in section 1801 of Title 18.\" Congress, then, knew how to import a specific, preexisting, extrinsic definition of a crime into \u00a7 20911(7), but consciously choose not to regarding \"child pornography\" in subsection 7(G). That choice makes ample sense considering\n   that the title of \u00a7 20911(7) broadcasts that it is meant to have an expansive reach. By declining to incorporate only the technical, federal definition of child pornography, Congress widened the class of offenders who would be required to register.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this, of course, is consistent with SORNA's avowed purpose of protecting the public from child predators.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020901\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   's logic once again leads to the conclusion that the circumstance-specific approach applies. Section 20911(7) speaks of an offense against a minor that \"involves\" child pornography. That is, it addresses the specific\n   <em>\n    acts\n   </em>\n   underlying a given offense, not a specific offense at an abstract, categorical level. Mixell's Oregon conviction involved child pornography as any ordinary speaker of English would understand that term,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   footnote 4-he admitted in his guilty plea form that he possessed a photograph depicting a child engaged in a sex act. Plainly, Mixell was convicted of an offense involving the possession of child pornography and therefore is subject to SORNA's registration requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court has denied Mixell's statutory motion to dismiss for the above reasons.
