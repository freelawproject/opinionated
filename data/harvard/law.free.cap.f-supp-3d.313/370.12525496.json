(Docket No. 23). For the reasons discussed below, the United States' motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the record and parties' submissions, and are only considered as true for purposes of this motion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vaello-Madero lived in New York between 1985-2013. There, he received SSI disability benefits, which were deposited into his New York bank account. (Docket No. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 6-8). In July 2013, he moved to\n   Puerto Rico, and continued receiving SSI disability payments through his New York bank account until August 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13. Throughout this time, he was unaware that his relocation would affect his ability to receive SSI disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vaello-Madero learned he was ineligible for SSI payments in June 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Through two notices that summer, the Social Security Administration (SSA) stopped its SSI payments and retroactively reduced its payments from August 2013 through August 2016 to $0. (Docket Nos. 32-1 at 2; 25 at 4). Those two notices did not inform Vaello-Madero that he was liable for any overpayments, but stated that the SSA could contact him in the future \"about any payments we previously made.\" (Docket Nos. 32-1 at 2; 25 at 4). More than a year later, the United States commenced an action against Vaello-Madero to collect $28,081.00 in overpaid SSI benefits after he moved to Puerto Rico. Jurisdiction was premised on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201345\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4). (Docket No. 1 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The United States and Vaello-Madero, unrepresented by counsel, signed a stipulation for consent judgment less than a week after this case was filed. (Docket No. 3). Nevertheless, represented by Court-appointed pro bono counsel, Vaello-Madero subsequently moved to withdraw the stipulation for consent judgment. (Docket Nos. 5; 19). Vaello-Madero then filed an answer challenging\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), a criminal statute, as a basis for the civil action and attacking the constitutionality of denying SSI benefits to residents of Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 17). In response, the United States moved for voluntary dismissal without prejudice, acknowledging its lack of jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and alleging that the Social Security Act's administrative requirements have not been met.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The United States moves to dismiss without prejudice its claims against Vaello-Madero under Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule states that \"an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 41(a)(2). The United States argues that it made a mistake pleading jurisdiction, and the Court lacks jurisdiction over this case because Vaello-Madero did not exhaust administrative remedies under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

Such is the case with SSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Scholar Arnold Leibowitz notes significant shortcomings in the Supreme Court's rational-basis review. For example, although Puerto Rico does not contribute to the federal treasury exactly as a state, \"Congress has discriminated against citizens in the territories\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of income tax payments.\" Arnold H. Leibowitz,\n   <em>\n    Defining Status\n   </em>\n   30-31 (1989) (emphasis added). For example, in 1916, the Federal Aid Highway Act did not extend a matching-funds benefit to the Territory of Alaska, which paid federal taxes, but did to Hawaii, which also paid, and Puerto Rico, which did not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. Another inconsistency concerns the cost of extending equal welfare benefits to Puerto Rico.

Indeed, when has Congress considered the cost of a statute's application in a single state, enacted the statute, and refused to apply it for the citizens of that particular state? If Puerto Rico had been treated equally for purposes of SSI in 2011, federal spending for the program would have ranged from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.

These are pennies in the bucket of a $3.8 trillion budget, especially when one considers that it would have improved the quality of life of up to 354,000 individuals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hurricane Mar\u00eda provides another reason why federal courts could revisit\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   . The hurricane blew away the mainland's lack of awareness regarding the inequality that United States citizens suffer just for residing in Puerto Rico. As First Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Juan R. Torruella points out in the Harvard Law Review Forum, \"[i]f there is a silver lining to be found within the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Mar\u00eda on the Island of Puerto Rico, it is that the barrage of news generated by that unfortunate event has\n   served to inform the rest of the nation that Puerto Rico is a 'part of the United States' and that its residents are 'citizens of the United States.' \" Juan R. Torruella,\n   <em>\n    Why Puerto Rico Does Not Need Further Experimentation with Its Future: A Reply to the Notion of \"Territorial Federalism\n   </em>\n   ,\" 131 Harv. L. Rev. F. 65, 67 (2018). This newfound awareness could trigger juridical change as other American citizens learn of the limits imposed on their rights due to anachronistic historical and geographical quirks dating to precedents established by the same Supreme Court that decided\n   <em>\n    Plessy\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The belief that the discriminatory duo of\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   should be revisited transcends local politics-an unusual circumstance. For example, Puerto Rico former Governor Pedro J. Rossell\u00f3 argues against excluding United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico from equal treatment in federal programs like SSI. \"This exclusion results in major curtailment of civil and socioeconomic rights of a discrete group of citizens, based solely and artificially on geographic residence.\" Pedro J. Rossell\u00f3,\n   <em>\n    Foreword\n   </em>\n   to Gustavo A. Gelp\u00ed,\n   <em>\n    The Constitutional Evolution of Puerto Rico and Other U.S. Territories (1898-Present)\n   </em>\n   24 (2017). As a result, this exclusion deprives these citizens from \"equal protection under the law for multiple socioeconomic programs, such as Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income Program, Aid to Families with dependent children, among others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rossell\u00f3's predecessor, former Governor Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n, concurs. He criticizes\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   by stating that \"one must understand that the rational criteria utilized by the U.S. Supreme Court-which allowed for discrimination in\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   -overlooked the racial premises permeating the\n   <em>\n    Insular Cases\n   </em>\n   .\" Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n,\n   <em>\n    The Evolution of Democratic Governance under the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Suffolk%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%20587\">\n    50 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606 (2017). The controversial\n   <em>\n    Insular Cases\n   </em>\n   , decided in the early 1900s, created the framework of incorporated and unincorporated territories, where the former are destined for statehood and the latter are not necessarily. Whatever pros and cons may have evolved from such framework, the fact remains that they were grounded on outdated premises. As former U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh explains, \"the 'alien race' of the inhabitants in the far-flung territories acquired from Spain ... was pivotal to the reasoning behind the bold imperialist doctrine formulated by the Court.\" Richard Thornburgh,\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico's Future\n   </em>\n   47 (2007). Hence, as Justice Marshall denounced in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , \"the present validity of those decisions is questionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186659\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/651/\">\n    446 U.S. at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186659\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/651/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Marshall, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Yet another former executive agrees that Puerto Rico's unequal treatment is at least part of the equation behind Puerto Rico's current fiscal and economic crisis. Former Governor An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1 denounces that, \"Congress sometimes excludes Puerto Rico from laws that would benefit it, while also denying the same level of funding that the fifty states get to enjoy with regards to their specific financial situations or to fund federally-mandated programs.\" An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1,\n   <em>\n    With Plenary Powers Comes Plenary Responsibility: Puerto Rico's Economic and Fiscal Crisis and the United States\n   </em>\n   , Rev. Jur. UPR 729, 742 (2018). Hence, three governors with different views regarding Puerto Rico's ultimate political status all coincide as to the injustice sanctioned by\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   . Their collective experience of twenty-four years indeed carries significant weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , and the ensuing forty years of discrimination upheld under\n   rational-basis review, may be ripe for reconsideration. \"Bureaucratic inertia, combined with the powerlessness and distance of the territories\" has given this discriminatory treatment a lifespan that approaches\n   <em>\n    Plessy\n   </em>\n   's. Leibowitz,\n   <em>\n    Defining Status\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 31. But the reality is that these cases were decided \"without benefit of briefing or argument,\" as Justice Marshall warned, or worse, without even the benefit of the government of Puerto Rico participating in the case and being heard.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186659\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/651/\">\n    446 U.S. at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186659\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/651/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Marshall, J., dissenting). Circumstances surrounding Puerto Rico have changed. There is increased national awareness of its existence and political consensus against its disparate treatment. As a result, federal courts could now conclude that heightened scrutiny is \"a proposition [that] surely warrants [their] full attention,\" potentially leading to an adverse result for the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hern\u00e1ndez-Col\u00f3n,\n   <em>\n    The Evolution\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 606 (\"Elemental principles of fairness and equal protection demand that such distinctions drawn by Congress in the application of federal programs to Puerto Rico and other nonstate areas should be subject to strict scrutiny.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Hence, the Court agrees with Vaello-Madero that the United States' voluntary dismissal \"raises the prospect that the United States might be trying to abandon its chosen forum in response to what it might perceive as a serious setback.\" (Docket No. 25 at 12). The Court will not allow the United States to avoid judicial review of an unsympathetic topic using jurisdictional pretexts. Therefore, the United States' motion for voluntary dismissal at Docket No. 23 is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
