(Doc. 46 (\"P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Former Defendant Daniel Gagnon has been employed by Defendant since 2008 as the Security Manager at IPEC. (Doc. 12 \u00b6 8.) Former Defendant Wayne Griffin has been employed by Defendant since 2011 as the Supervisor of Access Authorization/Fitness for Duty at IPEC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Harold Flores is employed by Defendant as an armed Nuclear Security Officer (\"NSO\") at IPEC. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 1.) He was initially hired in April 2005, and with the exception of a break in employment between May 2013 and October 2014, has held the same position since then. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) As an NSO, his responsibilities include but are not limited to: patrolling; controlling entry processing of individuals into protected areas; conducting personnel and vehicle searches; securing, protecting and assisting at scenes of accidents, fires and similar events; and conducting operational tests of intrusion detection and contraband detection systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. NRC Regulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As a nuclear plant operator, Defendant is required to adhere to numerous regulations promulgated by the NRC. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.) These regulations mandate, among other things, that Defendant maintain a fitness-for-duty (\"FFD\") program and an unescorted access authorization (\"UAA\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.21\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 26.21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73.56 (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The FFD program is designed to \"[p]rovide reasonable assurance\" that employees are \"trustworthy and reliable\" and \"are not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, or mentally or physically impaired from any cause, which in any way adversely affects their ability to safely and competently perform their duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2026.21\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 26.23(a), (b).

Plaintiff's Employment Prior to Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Between November 2007 and May 2013, Plaintiff was counseled, warned, reprimanded or suspended twenty-three times as a result of repeated performance issues, mostly tardiness and absenteeism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 18, 2013, Plaintiff was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) As a result of the arrest, Plaintiff's New York State pistol permit was suspended, rendering him unqualified to perform his job as an armed NSO. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of Plaintiff's inability to work as an armed NSO following his arrest, and as a result of Plaintiff's prior extensive disciplinary record, Gagnon and the Security Supervisor decided to terminate Plaintiff's employment on May 9, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37; Doc. 42 (\"Kozak MSJ Aff.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ex. HH at 2.) The decision was confirmed in a memorandum from Gagnon to Flores dated May 16, 2013. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 38; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. II.) Plaintiff does not dispute that his employment was terminated on May 16, 2013, although he contends that he was not aware of that fact at the time. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about May 13, 2013, Plaintiff provided an affidavit in support of co-worker Kendric Lever's then-pending discrimination lawsuit against Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, Lever gave Plaintiff a prepared affidavit, which Plaintiff then signed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff never told anyone at Entergy that he provided an affidavit in support of Lever's claim, nor does Plaintiff believe that Gagnon or Griffin had any reason to know that he provided the affidavit at the time of his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Settlement of Plaintiff's Termination Grievance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As a NSO at IPEC, Plaintiff was and is a member of Local 456 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the \"Union\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) On May 31, 2013, through his Union representative, Plaintiff grieved the termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. JJ.) Plaintiff, through his attorney, served Defendant with a notice of intention to arbitrate on August 2, 2013, (Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. KK at 2), and arbitration was scheduled for January 31, 2014, (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 47). In the meantime, on October 8, 2013, the charge against Plaintiff for criminal possession of a controlled substance was dismissed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 31, 2014, Plaintiff and Defendant reached a settlement agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\"), which fully and finally resolved the dispute and provided Plaintiff with a path to return to work as a NSO with his prior seniority, as long as Plaintiff accomplished certain enumerated preconditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.) Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff was required to obtain a valid Westchester County pistol permit by July 1, 2014 and meet all access requirements established by Defendant's access authorization department in accordance with company policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) The Settlement Agreement also provided that if Plaintiff satisfied these conditions, Defendant would reinstate Plaintiff to the NSO position, and the period from his termination until his reinstatement would be considered an unpaid leave of absence except for May 17, 2013, which would be considered a one-day unpaid disciplinary suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But if Plaintiff failed to comply with its terms, he would not be reinstated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff spoke with his attorney before entering into the Settlement Agreement, understood and agreed to its terms, and voluntarily signed it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52; P's Depo. at 144:21-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Plaintiff's Reinstatement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff secured his pistol permit on July 3, 2014, two days after the July 1, 2014 deadline. (Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. OO.) As a result, Defendant initially declined to reinstate Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But on September 3, 2014, Plaintiff obtained a judicial ruling from the Westchester County Court retroactively backdating Plaintiff's pistol permit to June 30, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was ultimately reinstated as a NSO in or about October 2014. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Recommendations from an Independent Substance Abuse Expert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because of Plaintiff's arrest, an independent substance abuse expert, Dr. Paul T. Seidenschnur, evaluated Plaintiff on May 2, 2013 to determine his FFD pursuant to Defendant's policy and NRC Regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In his May 2, 2013 report, Dr. Seidenschnur concluded that Plaintiff engaged in \"risky behavior\" and \"used questionable judgment\" with respect to the events leading up to his arrest for criminal possession of a controlled substance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. PP at 3.) Nonetheless, Dr. Seidenschnur concluded that Plaintiff was \"indeed fit for duty as long as he [wa]s compliant with the following recommendations:\" (1) participate in five to eight sessions of a psycho-educational program addressing alcohol and drug consumption practices and their effect; (2) regularly indicate compliance with the treatment; and (3) participate in intensified random follow-up drug testing (a minimum of twenty-nine tests over three years). (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 63; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. PP at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 2, 2014, Dr. Seidenschnur modified his recommendation, in light of the dismissal of Plaintiff's 2013 criminal charge, reducing the number of psycho-educational program sessions to three to five and reducing the number of drug tests to a minimum of twelve. (Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. QQ.) Griffin communicated these recommendations to Plaintiff by letter dated October 9, 2014. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 66.) Plaintiff understood that Griffin was required to follow to Dr. Seidenschnur's recommendations so Plaintiff could maintain UAA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Plaintiff's Conduct Leading Up to the December 2015 Suspension\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In or about August 2015, Plaintiff was issued a summons for possessing an open container of alcohol while sitting on a friend's porch and was ordered to appear in court on September 24, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.) Plaintiff failed to report to Defendant both the fact that he received the open container summons and the September 24, 2015 court date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff failed to report to work on September 24, 2015, and missed a scheduled annual physical examination that was necessary for him to maintain his NSO qualification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) Plaintiff knew that he was scheduled for the physical on that date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Additionally, in early October 2015, Plaintiff was scheduled to take an annual exam-known as the RAD exam-that NSOs are required to pass. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) NSOs have three opportunities to pass this exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) Each time a NSO fails the exam, he is required to report the failure to a supervisor prior to retaking the exam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The consequence for failing a third time is termination from employment because of the inability to obtain a necessary qualification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76, 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On October 7 and 8, 2015, fact finding meetings were conducted concerning Plaintiff's failed RAD worker exams. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) The fact finding meetings revealed that Plaintiff failed his first attempt at the exam, but instead of reporting the failure to his supervisor as required, he took the exam a second time immediately thereafter and failed again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 12, 2015, Plaintiff failed to attend scheduled shooting range training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.) Plaintiff claimed that a supervisor told him that he was not required to go to the range, but a fact finding determined that Plaintiff was never told that he should skip the shooting range training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result of these four performance and communications issues, Defendant suspended\n   Plaintiff for three days on December 7, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. XX.) Plaintiff challenged the suspension by filing a grievance through his Union representative. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 82; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. ZZ.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Plaintiff Enrolls in the Substance Abuse Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Between October 2014 and September 2016, Plaintiff was selected for drug testing on eight occasions. (P's 56.1 Stmt. &amp; Resp. \u00b6 91.) Plaintiff contends that he was directed to go for these tests in the presence of other NSOs, and that certain unnamed peers made comments asking him whether he was a drug addict or whether he wanted them to take the drug test for him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85.) At his deposition, Plaintiff was initially unable to recall the identity of any supervisor who allegedly publicly notified him to submit to a random drug test. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) In response to Defendant's counsel's request to provide him with the name of just one lieutenant who allegedly publicly notified him to submit to a drug test, Plaintiff responded \"I'd say Lieutenant Bauman.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.) Plaintiff was unable to recall any dates when Lieutenant Bauman allegedly asked him in the presence of others to submit to a drug test. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Plaintiff also was unable to identify the name of a single co-worker whom he claims teased him for having to submit to drug tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) Plaintiff acknowledged that his co-workers regularly joke around and that he has never complained to anyone at Entergy about being offended by coworkers' comments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 12, 2016, Plaintiff filed a discrimination charge with the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"), which was deemed dual-filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92; Kozak MSJ Aff. Ex. YY (\"Discrimination Charge\").) The Discrimination Charge alleged that Defendant took multiple employment actions against Plaintiff for \"submit[ing] an Affidavit in support of ... Lever's lawsuit\" against Defendant: terminating Plaintiff's employment; inducing Plaintiff to enter into the Settlement Agreement; requiring Plaintiff to participate in psycho-educational sessions and random drug testing; subjecting Plaintiff to \"numerous groundless and harassing\" fact findings since October 2014; regarding Plaintiff as a drug or alcohol addict; rescheduling the date for Plaintiff's mandatory physical examination while he was away on vacation; and suspending Plaintiff for three days \"without any lawful basis.\" (Discrimination Charge at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Complaint in this case on September 16, 2016 against Entergy, Griffin, and Gagnon. (Doc. 5 (\"Complaint\").) The Complaint alleged claims for retaliation against Entergy, Gagnon, and Griffin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; discrimination against Entergy under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and retaliation and discrimination against Entergy, Gagnon, and Griffin, in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20L.%20%C2%A7%20290\">\n    N.Y.

(Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 71-80.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court held a pre-motion conference on September 27, 2017 to discuss Defendants' proposed motion for summary judgment and a discovery issue discussed below. (Minute Entry dated Sept. 27, 2017.) Following the conference, the claims against Gagnon and Griffin were voluntarily dismissed. (Doc. 28.) Entergy submitted its motion for summary judgment on November 8, (Docs. 37, 40 (\"D's MSJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mem.\") ), Plaintiff opposed on December 6, (Doc. 45), and Entergy replied on December 20, (Doc. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background on Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Plaintiff's deposition ended at 3:00 P.M. after Plaintiff advised counsel that he had not slept the night before (because he had worked the night shift) and that he was scheduled to work the night shift again that later that day. (Doc. 32 (\"Kozak Sanctions Aff.\") \u00b6 5.) The parties agreed to continue Plaintiff's deposition on June 12, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On June 12, 2017 at 7:32 a.m., Plaintiff's counsel sent a text message to Defendant's counsel informing him that Plaintiff would not be able to attend his deposition scheduled for later that morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) The reason for Plaintiff's absence was that he \"worked 12 hour shifts for 6 out of the last 7 days and [wa]s fatigued.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Following Plaintiff's cancellation of the June 12 deposition, Defendant's counsel notified Plaintiff's counsel that Defendant intended to recoup the costs, attorney and paralegal fees, and court reporter cancellation fee associated with Plaintiff's late cancellation, totaling $1,137.50. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) On June 16, 2017, Defendant's counsel submitted a letter requesting a pre-motion conference, or in the alternative, leave to file a motion for costs and fees resulting from the cancellation. (Doc. 19.)

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff fails to provide a substantial justification for his failure to attend his deposition on June 12, 2017. Plaintiff explains that he cancelled because he was tired due to his demanding schedule, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   P's Sanctions Opp. at 3), but he does not explain how that meets the substantial justification standard. As Defendant notes, Plaintiff did not attempt to reschedule the deposition before the morning it was to take place. (D's Sanctions Reply at 2). Plaintiff's employer was willing to allow Plaintiff to request time off as necessary to participate in this litigation, but Plaintiff failed to make any such request. (Doc. 19 at 2.) Plaintiff knew the demands of his employment when the parties scheduled the deposition; he had over a month's notice of the date; and he does not argue that any special circumstances made his post-work fatigue on June 12, 2017 unexpected. And Plaintiff's conduct is particularly glaring considering that \"his failure to properly plan his schedule caused the early termination of the first day of his deposition.\" (D's Sanctions Reply at 2.) Thus, Plaintiff has not met his burden in providing substantial justification for his failure to attend his June 12 deposition, and the imposition of fees is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant's fee application appears to identify tasks that are, for the most part, a result of Plaintiff's cancellation of his deposition.

Plaintiff's federal claims are DISMISSED with prejudice and his state claims are DISMISSED without prejudice. Plaintiff shall pay the sanctions award of $2,399.00 to Defendant by July 16, 2018, unless he submits a financial affidavit (listing all income, expenses, assets, and liabilities) and a proposed payment schedule by July 2, 2018, in which case the Court will consider letting Plaintiff pay in installments. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the pending motions, (Docs. 31, 32, 33, 37), enter judgment for Defendant, and close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Plaintiff admits that the suspension of his state pistol permit rendered him unqualified to perform his job as an armed NSO. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 36.) Elsewhere he seems to dispute that possession of a valid pistol permit is an essential precondition to being an armed NSO, (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 9; Doc. 45 (\"P's MSJ Opp.\") at 7-8), and also argues that Defendant requiring it was retaliatory, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    P's MSJ Opp. at 7-8). Putting aside the inconsistency of Plaintiff's positions, the dispute is immaterial. Even if possession of a valid pistol permit was not an essential precondition to being an armed NSO, a retaliation claim based on this requirement would be time-barred, for the reasons discussed below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    May 13, 2013 is the date the affidavit was filed and stamped in court; Plaintiff does not recall when he signed the affidavit.
