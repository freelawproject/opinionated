Those motions are the subject of this memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Motion to Continue Trial and for Appointment of Additional Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 21, 2018, Gottesfeld filed a motion to continue the trial to a date in October or November, 2018, which the government has opposed. In support of the motion, defendant submits that the current defense counsel (the fourth appointed lawyer for the defendant) was appointed in March, 2018. Since his appointment, defense counsel has filed a number of substantive motions which are the subject of an upcoming hearing. He notes that two prosecutors have entered appearances for the government and that he is therefore outnumbered. Finally, defense counsel points to personal obligations in other criminal matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In determining whether a continuance is appropriate, a district court may consider the reasons contemporaneously presented, the amount of time needed for preparation, how diligently the movant has used that time to date, the complexity of the case, other available assistance, the probable utility of a continuance, inconvenience to others and the likelihood of injustice if there is no continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosario-Otero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048649\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/14/#p18\">\n    731 F.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085783\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/563/#p568\">\n    631 F.3d 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (1st Cir. 2011) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant has been incarcerated for a period of over two years because he was determined to be a flight risk. The trial has been continued on three separate occasions in the past year to allow successor counsel (requested by defendant) to get up to speed with the case. The long-ago filed pre-trial motions (including motions to suppress, to dismiss and\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   ) are finally ready for hearings. As the government notes, disposition of the motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   seeking to preclude the so-called \"torture defense\" will, if allowed, significantly narrow the scope of the trial. If denied, the government suggests that it will likely assent to defendant's request for a continuance. One factor the Court must consider in connection with that request is the availability of legal assistance. To that end, defendant has filed an\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   motion for appointment of additional counsel, which this Court will allow, subject to the certain parameters set out in the Court's separate order filed herewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Considering all relevant factors, including the length of time defendant has been incarcerated, the status of the briefing in the case, its complexity and the availability of assistance to defense counsel, the Court will deny the motion to continue the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Emergency Motion for Leave to File an Opposition to the Government's Motion\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Limine\n    </em>\n    in Two Separate Parts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 23, 2018, Gottesfeld filed an emergency motion for leave to file his opposition to government's motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude defendant's \"torture defense\" based on necessity and defense of another in two separate parts. The government opposes that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Gottesfeld contends that requiring him to file an opposition addressing the merits of the government's motion would improperly impose upon him the burden of proof and would require him to divulge constitutionally-protected aspects his defense. Gottesfeld objects to the use of a motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude an entire defense, particularly in what he contends is a politically-charged case. He suggests that use of a motion\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude a defense undermines the purpose of the jury. He contends that if he is required to oppose the motion on the merits, he will need additional preparation time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   procedure is proper to determine whether defendant's anticipated defense is sufficient, as a matter of law, to present to the jury.
