Pinson has challenged EOUSA's prior responses to these requests, but she has not challenged the latest response. This Court has already granted in part and denied in part three motions for summary judgment concerning her requests.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinson v.

(Oct. 24, 2017), ECF No. 409-3. Legal Administrative Specialist Narkin conducted the search using Courtlink, LexisNexis's docket research tool, and retrieved the docket for\n   <em>\n    United States v.

DOJ claims that all 949 pages relating to Pinson's request for materials concerning the 11-cr-68 case were released. Defs.' Statement of Material Facts (\"Defs.' SMF (409)\") \u00b6 6, ECF No. 409-2. However, the materials DOJ submitted with its renewed motion indicate that 949 pages relating to a case with the docket number 12-cr-236 were released. Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 13, 2017) at 2 &amp; Ex. A, ECF No. 409-4. DOJ again moves for summary judgment, this time on the basis that Pinson has received the materials she requested.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Defs.' MSJ (\"Defs.' Mem. (409)\") at 3, ECF No. 409-1. Pinson did not submit an opposition to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Request No. 12-1757\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a letter dated February 26, 2012, Ms. Pinson requested the \"production of all documents, email, or records\" for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , cases 10-cv-949 and 11-cv-1906. Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 11, 2015), Ex. Y, ECF No. 254-4. Pinson did not explicitly limit the number of pages to be produced or the search time to be occupied by this request.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   She did later clarify that this request also sought public records, but was not limited to them. Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 11, 2015), Ex.

Matuszewski Decl. (Dec. 20, 2017) \u00b6 15, ECF No. 412-3. Matuszewski's updated declaration repeats information from her original declaration regarding all the records systems that were searched, why those systems were likely to contain all responsive records, and the amount of material produced.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Matuszewski Decl. (Dec. 20, 2017)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Matuszewski Decl. (Oct. 12, 2016), ECF No. 332-3. Additionally, Matuszewski declares that she searched the computerized docketing case management system Caseview using the terms \"Jeremy Pinson\" and civil case file numbers 11-cv-1906, 11-cv-1346, and 10-cv-949 to produce 197 pages of responsive material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Matuszewski Decl.

DOJ again moves for summary judgment, contending that Matuszewski's updated declaration sufficiently demonstrates that EOUSA's search was reasonably calculated to locate all responsive documents, and that all such responsive documents were released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. P. &amp; A. Supp. Defs.' MSJ (\"Defs.' Mem. (412)\") at 5, ECF No. 412-2. Pinson has not opposed this motion either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

This showing requires the agency to demonstrate that its search was adequate and that all responsive records were either released or properly withheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under FOIA, an adequate search is one that is \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Morley v.

On the other hand, once the agency has provided a reasonably detailed affidavit describing its search, the burden shifts to the FOIA requester to produce \"countervailing evidence\" suggesting that a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to the adequacy of the search.\n   <em>\n    Morley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566353,6046285\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1108/\">\n    508 F.3d at 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In a case such as this one, where the requester initially challenges the agency's response but does not consistently articulate specific objections to the agency's releases, the Court is mindful that summary judgment cannot be granted as conceded and that it must independently evaluate whether any issues of material fact exist. \"Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion for summary judgment cannot be 'conceded' for want of opposition.\"\n   <em>\n    Winston &amp; Strawn, LLP v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   DOJ's renewed motions for summary judgment argue that it has performed adequate searches with respect to Request Nos. 13-1085 and 12-1757 and released all non-exempt documents. Pinson has not raised any objections to these motions, but the Court nonetheless considers whether DOJ has demonstrated that it is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Request No. 13-1085\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DOJ asserts that EOUSA adequately searched and properly released records responsive to Request No. 13-1085. Defs.' Mem. (409) at 3. EOUSA's declaration provides a general description of the search, including details of the records system that was searched, the amount of time used to conduct the search, and the scope of the search, which was limited to public records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Narkin Decl. (Oct. 24, 2017) at 2-3. However, the record does not clearly indicate which docket number was used to conduct the search, and even suggests that the wrong docket number may have been used.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 13, 2017) at 2. For this reason, the Court denies EOUSA's motion for summary judgment as to Request No. 13-1085.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   FOIA searches are inadequate when the incorrect search term is used to retrieve responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kleinert v. Bureau of Land Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156029\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/132/79/#p87\">\n    132 F.Supp.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87-88 (D.D.C. 2015) (holding that an agency's search was inadequate when the agency used an incorrect spelling of requester's name during its search). Discrepancies in the materials DOJ submitted with its renewed motion for summary judgment indicate that the wrong case number may have been used to search for Pinson's requested materials. If so, EOUSA's search was not sufficient to warrant summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pinson's FOIA request sought records in the District of Idaho case\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-cr-68. Defs.' SMF (409) \u00b6 1. DOJ claims in its briefing that it conducted a search for records in that case, which is also called\n   <em>\n    United States v. Apodaca\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-cr-68.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. However, while EOUSA's FOIA contact in Idaho stated in her declaration that she \"utilized ... Courtlink, to retrieve the criminal case docket of\n   <em>\n    United States v. Apodaca\n   </em>\n   ,\" Narkin Decl. \u00b6 9, she did not reference which case number was used in conducting the search. Additionally Mr. Luczynski, an Attorney Advisor at EOUSA, stated in his declaration that the 949 pages of materials produced by the FOIA contact's search came from a District of Idaho case numbered 12-cr-236, rather than one numbered 11-cr-68,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 13, 2017) at 2, and in a letter from the Assistant Director of EOUSA to Pinson regarding the release of 949 pages of public records purportedly responsive to Request No. 13-1085, the subject of the request was listed as \"12-cr-236 (D ID),\" Luczynski Decl. (Dec. 13, 2017), Ex. A. EOUSA's two references to 12-cr-236, along with the absence of a search term mentioned in the FOIA contact's declaration, suggests that the wrong case\n   number may have been used in searching for materials Pinson requested. Therefore, the Court will deny summary judgment as to Request No. 13-1085 until EOUSA clarifies that the correct search terms were used to perform a search reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Request No. 12-1757\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   DOJ also asserts that EOUSA adequately searched and properly released records responsive to Request No. 12-1757.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. (412) at 5. However, because EOUSA has not explained how it conducted the search with sufficient detail, summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   EOUSA's original declaration provided a \"general description of the search, including describing all of the records systems that were searched and explaining why those systems were likely to contain all responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206887041\">\n    2017 WL 6887041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9. EOUSA's updated declaration includes the original details provided as well as a description of the search terms used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Matuszewski Decl. (Dec. 20, 2017) \u00b6\u00b6 7-20 (stating that the terms \"Jeremy Pinson\" and the Middle District of Pennsylvania civil case file numbers 11-cv-1906, 11-cv-1346, and 10-cv-949 were used in the search). However, just as in the original declaration, EOUSA's updated declaration does not contain a clarification of whether \"the search and released documents were limited to only public records,\" nor does it contain an explanation of \"the discrepancy between the 197 pages located and the 200 pages apparently released.\"\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206887041\">\n    2017 WL 6887041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While DOJ indicates in its brief that the search was performed \"with an intent to provide\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   documents contained therein, including public records,\" Defs.' Mem. (412) at 4 (emphasis in original), DOJ's submitted materials have not explained why Luczynski's October 20, 2016 declaration stated that a search was conducted for only \"\n   <em>\n    publicly\n   </em>\n   filed responsive records,\" Luczynski Decl. (Oct. 20, 2016) \u00b6 13 (emphasis added). And although Matuszewski's updated declaration maintains that \"all documents\" found were forwarded to EOUSA, this was a mere restatement of her original declaration, which the Court found to be unclear as to whether the search was limited to only public documents. Matuszewski Decl. (Dec. 20, 2017) \u00b6\u00b6 18-19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206887041\">\n    2017 WL 6887041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10. Additionally, DOJ has made no attempt in its renewed motion to explain the discrepancy between the 197 pages mentioned in Matuszewski's declaration and the 200 pages apparently released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Matuszewski Decl. (Oct. 12, 2016) \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Therefore, although EOUSA's updated declaration sufficiently explains the search terms used, it fails to clarify the other matters this Court highlighted when denying in part DOJ's third motion for summary judgment as to Request 12-1757. Therefore, the Court once again denies summary judgment as to this request, and will continue to do so until EOUSA provides a declaration that adequately explains whether the FOIA contact's search was limited to public documents, as well as the discrepancy between the pages located and those released. If the discrepancy is simply due to mistake, error, and/or sloppiness, then EOUSA must state so. But simply providing slightly different sworn statements with each subsequent motion, without explaining the discrepancies that exist in prior sworn statements, will not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
