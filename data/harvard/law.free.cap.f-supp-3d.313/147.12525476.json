COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   States that participate in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\") must comply with strict statutory deadlines for processing benefit applications and periodically recertifying benefit eligibility. Plaintiffs, three classes of District of Columbia residents, have sued the director of the agency that administers the District's SNAP program for alleged noncompliance with these deadlines and now move for a preliminary injunction. The injunction sought would compel the District to: (1) adhere to the statutory timelines for processing both initial and periodic recertification applications; (2) timely notify eligible households that their benefits will expire absent recertification; and (3) notify households of any delay in the processing of their applications and of their right to a hearing to contest adverse or delayed eligibility determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court will grant the plaintiffs' motion in part. It will issue an injunction requiring the District to process SNAP recertification applications within the statutory deadlines, which it has fallen well short of doing in the recent past. The Court declines, however, to extend that injunction to the processing of initial applications. The evidence before the Court suggests that the District is making progress towards full compliance with that particular deadline, with the active assistance and supervision of the Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service,\n   the federal agency that oversees SNAP. Additional judicial intervention is therefore unnecessary at this juncture and would be contrary to the public interest. The Court will instead continue to monitor the District's performance as the litigation progresses and consider extending the injunction to initial applications as warranted. Finally, the Court will also decline to issue injunctions ordering the District to provide the requested notifications, finding that the plaintiffs have not adduced sufficient evidence at this stage of the litigation to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiffs move for a three-fold injunction that would require the District to: (1) adhere to the statutory timelines for the processing of all SNAP benefit applications, (2) send out recertification notices on time as required by the statute, and (3) provide recipients notice of any delays in processing their applications and of their right to a hearing. The Court will grant the plaintiffs' first request in part but will deny the other two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' motion for an injunction requiring the District to process initial and recertification SNAP applications in a timely manner.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, the plaintiffs request an injunction requiring the District to process initial and recertification applications in accordance with the statutory timelines. Looking to the four factors for injunctive relief, the Court will grant this part of the plaintiffs' request as to the processing of recertification applications and will impose monitoring and reporting requirements as to the processing of initial applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    1. Likelihood of success on the merits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In order to obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs must first demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Sherley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5647585,3557097\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/388/\">\n    644 F.3d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether the plaintiffs have met this requirement depends in part on whether the SNAP Act requires absolute or substantial compliance with the timelines for processing applications. The District argued at the hearing that the Court should follow the approach taken by the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Shands v. Tull\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1448746\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/602/1156/\">\n    602 F.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1979), which only required substantial compliance with the statute. But Shands is not the proper analog here. For one, Shands is of limited value because it involved a different statutory provision and scheme, namely a requirement under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (now the TANF program) to provide hearings upon request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1448746\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/602/1156/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1448746\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/602/1156/\">\n    at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Shands\n   </em>\n   has since been rejected by multiple courts, which have instead required absolute compliance with statutory requirements for the administration of welfare programs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Withrow v.

For one, the District conceded at the hearing that it was processing less than 95% of applications on time. Hr'g Tr. 52:19 (March 19, 2018). This concession is confirmed by the evidence in the record that the plaintiffs have presented, namely recent data on two metrics of timeliness used by the Food and Nutrition Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The first such metric is known as the \"Application Processing Timeliness\" or \"APT\" rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of Agriculture, Food &amp; Nutrition Serv., \"Clarification on\n   the three ways initial SNAP application processing timeliness is measured,\" at 1 (June 2, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statistic exclusively covers the timely processing of\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   applications, not recertification applications, and is calculated based on the sample of cases used in the State quality control process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To calculate the APT rate, the Food and Nutrition Service divides the total number of sample applications timely disposed of by the total number of approved sample applications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With respect to the APT rate, the most recent data covers the FNS quality control audit for April to September 2017.

Both of these numbers are obviously below full compliance. Similarly, according to the most recent FNS-366B report-for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018-the District approved a total of 74.54% of applications on time, which includes 94.97% of initial applications, 59.28% of recertification applications, and 94.81% of expedited applications.

Given the District's relatively high and rising timeliness rate and the Service's active regulation here, there are reasons to believe that the District will reach a de minimis level of non-compliance, or even full compliance, as to initial applications in the absence of a court order. As such, injunctive relief may not be necessary to prevent irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, these reasons why injunctive relief may not be necessary to prevent irreparable harm do not apply to recertification applications.

In contrast, the additional burden imposed on the District by any injunction would be minimal. As the Seventh Circuit explained in a case involving a SNAP Act injunction, \"[t]he Act itself imposes the burden; [an] injunction merely seeks to prevent the defendant[ ] from shirking [its] responsibilities under it.\"\n   <em>\n    Haskins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1591296\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/794/1273/#p1274\">\n    794 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1277 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Withrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530308\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/1385/#p1387\">\n    942 F.2d at 1388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An injunction requiring adherence to [the SNAP Act] regulations ... imposes no inappropriate obligations on the state.\");\n   <em>\n    Briggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%206026167\">\n    2012 WL 6026167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (same).

Def.'s Opp'n at 37. If it does divert resources, the District says, it may be unable to properly administer other benefit programs or other aspects of the SNAP program, and could face sanctions from federal regulatory agencies as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Surreply at 22-23. But while an injunction might in practical terms demand a diversion of resources, the legal obligation to divert those resources is rooted in the statute; the injunction simply enforces the statute's requirement that the District find the resources needed to meet all of its obligations. An injunction thus imposes no burden on the District beyond what the statute already requires. Consequently, the balance of equities tilts in favor of granting injunctive relief, both as to initial applications and recertification applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    4.

Fourth Zeilinger Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-14. And the Service has tools in its arsenal to enforce the District's adherence to its corrective action plan, namely the ability to suspend or disallow all or part of the District's administrative funds or to itself seek injunctive relief from a federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20276.4\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 276.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And where the Court has a less intrusive means of furthering the statutory purpose and ensuring compliance with the District's statutory obligations, the public interest would weigh towards choosing such options, especially where, as here, the plaintiffs seek a mandatory (\"do this\") rather than prohibitory (\"don't do this\") injunction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dorfmann v.

First, the District's noncompliance as to recertification applications is far beyond de minimis. The most recent FNS-366B reports-the only data that directly measures recertification application timeliness-shows a timeliness rate of 59.28%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Surreply Ex. B. While the District contends that it is typical for states to have a lower rate of timely processing for recertification applications as opposed to initial applications, the District's rate is well below what other states have reported: Colorado reports monthly rates of 94.71% to 97.91% for January 2017 to February 2018, New Mexico reports monthly rates of 90.4% to 98.4% for November 2017 through March 2018, and Texas reports\n   monthly rates of 96.65% to 99.10% for October 2017 to April 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs have also presented data indicating that states have achieved much higher rates; Nebraska, for instance, processed 99% of recertification applications on time in February 2018. Pls.' Response Def.'s Suppl. Br. (\"Pls.' Response) Ex. E. Although some states may not have rates this high, this data shows that it is possible for states to achieve timeliness rates far higher than the District's. Since the District's non-compliance well exceeds a de minimis level, and because the Food and Nutrition Service does not directly oversee state compliance on timely processing of recertification applications, the Court concludes that the public interest would favor the full injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   But initial applications again present a slightly different story. For one, the District's compliance rates are much closer to a de minimis level of non-compliance: statistics suggest the District is likely processing somewhere around 90-95% of applications in a timely fashion currently.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the District has shown a definite upward trend in its timeliness rate, improving from 90.59% of applications processed on time in the first quarter of 2017 to 94.97% of applications processed on time in the first quarter of 2018.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Finally, the District is currently subject to a corrective action plan aimed at ensuring that it achieves a 95% APT, bringing it near rates that other courts have found to be de minimis non-compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This regulatory process offers an alternative means of ensuring statutory compliance without the burden of an injunction. Thus, in light of the relatively high level of compliance that the District has already obtained and the ongoing corrective action plan process with the Service, the Court concludes the public interest favors a less intrusive oversight role with respect to initial application rather than the full injunction that will apply to recertification applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    5. Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court concludes that the plaintiffs have carried their burden as to an injunction requiring the District to process\n   <em>\n    recertification\n   </em>\n   applications in accordance with the statutory timelines: they have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, that irreparable harm would occur without an injunction, that the balancing of equities tilts in favor of injunctive relief, and that the public interest favors an injunction. The Court will therefore grant this aspect of the plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the other hand, the Court concludes that it will exercise its equitable discretion to more narrowly tailor relief as to\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   applications. While the plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits and that the balancing of equities tips in their favor, the other two factors point towards a more limited judicial role in light of the ongoing federal corrective action plan process. That process makes it likely that the District will continue to improve its timely processing of applications until it achieves a 95% APT rate, bringing it close to a level of de minimis noncompliance and eliminating the need for a full injunction. Moreover, the Court is hesitant to take upon itself the role that the Food and Nutrition Service is currently and actively playing in the regulatory scheme given the Service's greater expertise and experience. That said, there is still a role for the Court to play in monitoring the ongoing regulatory process. Thus, the Court will require the District to file periodic reports regarding the status of the corrective action plan and updating the Court on its current timeliness rates. Should the District show a large or consistent decline in its initial application timeliness rates, or should it fall out of compliance with or fail to progress in the corrective action plan process, the Court will consider instituting more fulsome injunctive relief covering initial applications as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' motion for an injunction requiring the District to provide an opportunity for SNAP benefit recipients to complete the recertification process without a break in benefits.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition to injunctive relief concerning the timely processing of benefits applications, the plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring the District to \"provide an opportunity for SNAP recipients to complete the recertification process and have SNAP benefits for the new certification period issued in a timely manner.\" Pls.'

Instead, they rely primarily on (1) bi-weekly reports submitted by the District to the Food and Nutrition\n   Service, (2) testimony from Director Zeilinger regarding a \"vendor's error\" resulting in the failure to send 4,500 recertification notices in June 2017, and (3) declarations from individuals stating that they did not receive recertification notices when they were due. The Court concludes that, on the current factual record, the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The bi-weekly reports are the closest thing to statistical evidence that the plaintiffs present. These are a series of reports (in the form of a slide deck) that the District presents to the Service every two weeks.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, Ex. R (Oct. 11, 2017 slide deck). The plaintiffs point primarily to two pieces of information contained in these reports: the \"backlogs\" of notices and the \"error rate\" for notice generation. Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 34-35; Pls.' Reply at 12-13. But the significance of these two pieces of information is not readily apparent to the Court. Assuming for the moment that a \"backlog\" notice is one sent late, the number of such notices reported in the most recent reports is small compared to the total number of notices that the District generates. The December 20, 2017 bi-weekly report-the most recent one in the record-indicates a total of 200 \"backlog\" notices. Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, Ex. W, at 26. Without minimizing the importance of every household receiving the notices due to it, 200 notices represents a scant fraction of 1% of the 55,000 notices the District sends monthly. First Zeilinger Decl. \u00b6 133. Of those 55,000, an average of 4,500 are recertification notices,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    \u00b6 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , making the 200 backlog notices no more than 4.5% of recertification notices-assuming all 200 \"backlog\" notices are\n   <em>\n    recertification\n   </em>\n   notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This brings the Court to a second limitation in the \"backlog\" notice statistics: it is not self-evident from the record that the \"backlog\" notices listed are recertification notices in particular. Indeed, record evidence indicates they might not be. In the most recent bi-weekly reports, the \"backlog\" notices are all categorized as \"Change in Benefit\" notices.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, Ex. W, at 26 (Dec. 20, 2017 slide deck). The District's counsel represented at the hearing that a \"Change in Benefit\" notice is not the same thing as a recertification notice. Hr'g Tr. 58:24-25 (March 19, 2018). Thus, it is not clear to the Court that the backlog listed in the most recent reports reflects a backlog in sending out recertification notices. In light of these gaps and the general lack of clarity regarding what the bi-weekly reports show, the backlog figures in the bi-weekly reports provide only limited indication of a systemic failure to print and send recertification notices on time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The same is true with the \"error rates\" that the plaintiffs point to.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, Ex. W, at 24 (Dec. 20, 2017 slide deck). In her declaration, Director Zeilinger explains that this \"error rate\" refers to notices that do not automatically generate, likely due to an issue such as an incorrect address or missing information. First Zeilinger Decl. \u00b6 136. These notices are instead manually generated and then sent to a third-party vendor for printing and mailing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Director Zeilinger further attests that the District's IT personnel monitor notice generation and can quickly re-run notices that fail to automatically generate to ensure they are processed and sent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    \u00b6 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of this process, the fact that a notice is not properly generated \"does not mean the notice is untimely sent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    \u00b6 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs offer no evidence to rebut Director Zeilinger's representations or to establish that the \"error rates\" refer to notices that are ultimately not sent on time. Thus, without more evidence, these figures, too, provide little indication\n   of an ongoing systemic failure to send recertification notices on time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Aside from the bi-weekly reports, the plaintiffs primarily rely on the deposition testimony of Director Zeilinger and a set of individual declarations. Many of those declarations are from class members attesting to their failure to receive a recertification notice and the consequent termination of their benefits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of James Stanley [ECF No. 27-2] \u00b6 5; Decl. of Roderick Gaines [ECF No. 27-4] \u00b6 7. While these declarations certainly suggest that some households are not receiving the notices owed them, they cannot on their own demonstrate a\n   <em>\n    systemic\n   </em>\n   failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In an attempt to bridge that gap, the plaintiffs point to other evidence that they argue shows the District has had repeated, large-scale failures to send out notices. The most persuasive piece of evidence they present involves a \"vendor's error\" from June 2017, which was one of the key topics in the limited discovery the Court permitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order at 6 (Dec. 15, 2017) (allowing the plaintiffs to conduct a corporate representative deposition regarding the vendor's error). According to Director Zeilinger, in June 2017 a vendor's error resulted in the failure to send out any of the recertification notices due to recipients that month (whose recertification applications would have been due in September 2017).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply Ex. 3 (\"Zeilinger Dep.\") 124:4-11. Director Zeilinger testified that the District prepared a file with the necessary information for printing and mailing and successfully transferred that file to the third-party vendor the District uses to print and mail notices.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    124:4-11, 126:17-21, 127:9-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Approximately 4,500 households did not receive a recertification notice as a result of this error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    130:11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The failure to provide notice to 4,500 households is obviously disconcerting. But the error is again equally consistent with a systemic problem as it is with an isolated failure. The District, after all, provided the necessary information to the printer on time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    126:17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even a conscientious and well-run system might experience this sort of unexpected human error. Without additional indications that this vendor's error was more than an isolated mistake, it does not bridge the gap left by the other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Moreover, after this error occurred the District took steps to prevent similar ones in the future: it adopted procedures to \"confirm that when files were transmitted for notices, they actually resulted in notices printed and mailed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    153:12-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    154:19-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bi-weekly reports that the District submits to the Service also indicate that it is verifying the transfer of files to the printer, confirming the files are being processed, and monitoring the printing process for notices sent with return envelopes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Reply Ex. 1, Ex. W, at 27 (Dec. 20, 2017 slide deck). Given the processes that the District has put in place to avoid another mailing error, the June 2017 snafu is not particularly powerful evidence of a\n   <em>\n    systemic\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ongoing\n   </em>\n   failure to prepare and send recertification notices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Nor is there enough evidence of further failures akin to this vendor's error to establish a likelihood that it is part of a trend of problems as opposed to an isolated error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs point to a declaration\n   submitted by their counsel, who states that she called the District's call center on October 23, 2017 and heard a message that stated: \"If you failed to receive timely notification to renew your SNAP benefits, which have now terminated for October 2017, this is due to a technical issue.\" Decl. of Chelsea Sharon [ECF No. 33-3] \u00b6 3. While this message might suggest an additional issue in the production of notices, it gives no sense of the nature of the error, the scope of the error, whether it relates to the same vendor error discussed above, or the number of households impacted. Similarly, a class member attests that he spoke to someone with the District's call center who indicated \"a lot of people did not get a notice telling them they needed to recertify.\" Pls.' Reply Ex. 10, \u00b6 11 (Decl. of Joseph Carver). Again, however, there is no sense of the nature or scope of the error or even that this is a separate error from the one referenced in counsel's declaration. While these two declarations ultimately provide some suggestion of continued problems in the generation and delivery of notices, they are still insufficient to establish that the plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of demonstrating an ongoing and systemic failure to produce recertification notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Ultimately, most of the plaintiffs' evidence-particularly the bi-weekly reports and the June 2017 vendor's error-is equally consistent with the District's argument that any notice failures were isolated instances. At this juncture, with too many factual questions remaining, that is insufficient for the plaintiffs to carry their burden of demonstrating a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Obama v.

Cir. 2015) (opinion of Brown, J.) (affirming denial of injunction since \"[a]lthough one could reasonably infer from the evidence\" that plaintiffs would prevail in showing standing \"one could also conclude the opposite\"). Of course, this does not mean that the plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits. Discovery and further development of the factual record may well demonstrate that the plaintiffs have the better understanding of the evidence they submit. The Court simply concludes that right now the plaintiffs have not provided evidence sufficient to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. Consequently, the Court will deny their request for a preliminary injunction regarding the sending of recertification notices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' motion for an injunction requiring the District to send written notice of processing delays and of the opportunity for an administrative hearing.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring the District to send written notices of processing delays and of the opportunity to request an administrative hearing to households whose applications are delayed beyond the statutory\n   timelines.

Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As to the first contention, the plaintiffs present only declarations from several class members indicating that they failed to receive notification as to any delays in processing their applications-indeed, that they failed to receive\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   notice concerning their application in contravention of the regulatory requirements in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20273.10\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.'

But as with the failure to send out recertification notices, in light of the sheer volume of SNAP recipients, declarations from a dozen or so households do not suffice to show a\n   <em>\n    systemic\n   </em>\n   failure. And the plaintiffs provide no indication that the class members involved are a representative statistical sampling of the larger population of households. Without more, the submitted declarations cannot carry the plaintiffs' burden to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Turning to the alleged failure to provide households with notice of their appeal rights, again the plaintiffs provide insufficient evidence to show a systemic failure. For one, Director Zeilinger, in her first declaration, states that the District routinely includes a notice of appeal and of hearing rights in adverse determination notices. First Zeilinger Decl. \u00b6 144. None of the individual class member declarations contradict this by, for example, stating that the class member received a notice without information regarding her appeal rights. Again, on the current evidentiary record, the plaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on the merits related to this aspect of their requested injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In sum, the plaintiffs rely exclusively on individual declarations to establish a likelihood of success on this aspect of their case. Such declarations, without more, do not establish a substantial likelihood of demonstrating a systemic error of the type necessary to support an injunction. As such, the Court will deny this portion of the plaintiffs' preliminary injunction motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant in part and deny in part the plaintiffs' Motion for a Preliminary Injunction.

That order specified that the deposition would cover \"the 'vendor error' referenced on pages 9 and 22 of Defendant's opposition.\" Order at 6 (Dec. 15, 2017). That error was the June 2017 error. The District's opposition made reference to no other vendor's errors, and the Court's discovery order was specifically tailored to resolve only the factual questions created by the District's opposition and the original motion for preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5. Other errors that might have occurred were not teed up by the District's opposition or the plaintiffs' initial motion and thus fall outside the scope of the narrowly-tailored discovery order. The plaintiffs are, of course, free to inquire about other possible vendor's errors in merits discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The District also raises a challenge to plaintiff Bread for the City's standing.

Cir. 2012). No party contests that the plaintiff class has standing to seek injunctive relief given their allegations of harm flowing from an ongoing, systemic violation of their statutory rights. As a result, the Court need not at this juncture resolve any arguments as to Bread for the City's standing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
