The Court assumes familiarity with its prior opinion and confines its discussion to the facts most relevant to the present motion. The current motion concerns BOP's searches for records\n   responsive to Requests Nos. 2011-7156, 2012-39, 2012-40, and 2013-1684; BOP's withholding of records responsive to such requests pursuant to several FOIA exemptions; and BOP's reprocessing of Request Nos. 2010-12533, 2011-1351, 2011-1886, 2011-2366, 2011-7619, 2012-39,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 2012-975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

BOP initially could not perform a search of its email archives due to technical problems, but in October 2016, the search tool was fixed and BOP subsequently performed searches for responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268054\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/338/\">\n    236 F.Supp.3d at 356-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, BOP explained that it determined that it was proper to withhold the plaintiff's name and signature and the case number in a suit over negligent medical care received for HIV/AIDS because such disclosure would \"increase the likelihood of the plaintiff's private medical information becoming more widely known,\" and \"a medical diagnosis of HIV/AIDS is incredibly stigmatizing\" and \"leads to potentially false assumptions about ... drug use and unprotected homosexual sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   With this new explanation, the Court is now able to perform its balancing test. First, this Court finds that the public interest in discovering what the government is up to is not served by disclosing the name and signature of the plaintiff in a lawsuit against BOP; the name and signature of that plaintiff's attorney; the name, address, administrative claim number, and civil case number of the plaintiff in an administrative claim under the FTCA; or the signature of the Regional Counsel involved in that claim. The Court finds it significant that the information withheld involves only one government official, and the Court cannot see how disclosing her signature would inform citizens about the inner workings of their government. Accordingly, because even a \"modest privacy interest\" outweighs nothing \"every time,\"\n   <em>\n    Billington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9348466\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/245/79/#p86\">\n    245 F.Supp.2d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , these individuals' privacy interests outweigh the nonexistent public interest in disclosure, and the application of Exemption 6 to withhold such information is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   BOP also asserts that telephone extensions and direct telephone numbers of BOP staff were properly withheld because the staff members may be reached through a \"general telephone number for the institution,\" and they therefore \"maintain a privacy interest in not being contacted directly at their extensions.\" 7th Christenson Decl. \u00b6 19. Courts in this district have varied in their approach to determining whether work telephone numbers can be withheld pursuant to Exemption 6.
