She has satisfied all conditions of her probation and asserts that she will not be \"putting [her]self in situations of this type ever again.\" Mot. at 1. She neither challenges the legality of her conviction on constitutional grounds, nor claims that any statute authorizes her expungement request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, she seeks expungement of her criminal record because she says it is preventing her from achieving reemployment by the federal government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Expungement is justified when the movant can show that she has suffered a harm rising to the level of extraordinary or unusual circumstances, and that the need to prevent such harm outweighs the government's interest in maintaining criminal records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n    606 F.2d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Circuit has recognized that the \"adverse effect on job opportunity\" is the \"main evil produced by dissemination of arrest records.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrow v.

Yet, absent some showing of a \"violation of rights,\" difficulty finding meaningful employment does not \"rise to the level of exceptional circumstances necessary\n   to justify this Court's exercise of its equitable power to expunge records.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

June 17, 2008) (holding that although defendant's criminal record was a hurdle to her attaining new employment and becoming a foster parent, such harm was insufficient to justify expungement). Ms. Woods has not alleged a violation of her rights. She makes no claim that a government official mishandled either her arrest or her conviction, or that she is innocent of the crime for which she was convicted. The only evidence she provides in support of expungement is that she has completed her sentence and is unable to obtain reemployment with the federal government because of her criminal record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Inability to obtain specific employment is neither an exceptional circumstance nor an unusual result of a criminal conviction.

May 23, 2006) (holding that the \"mere existence\" of consequences, including inability to obtain employment, \"does not rise to the level of extreme or exceptional circumstances necessary to justify the expungement of records\"). Ms. Woods has clearly alleged collateral employment consequences as a direct result of her conviction. However, her inability to obtain reemployment with the federal government is not only a typical consequence of a conviction, it is a harm that is directly attributable to Ms. Woods' own prior actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n    606 F.2d at 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting expungement would be appropriate if \"unusually substantial harm to the defendant not in any way attributable to him outweighs the government's need for a record of the arrest\"). Because Ms. Woods has not shown that her rights have been violated by either her arrest or her conviction and the harm is directly attributable to her own actions, the constraint of her employment opportunities is not an extraordinary circumstance that justifies expungement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Even if the employment consequences resulting from Ms. Woods' conviction could be seen as unusually harmful, any such consequences must be balanced against the government's interest in maintaining criminal records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1436410,3784331\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/606/1226/\">\n    at 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
