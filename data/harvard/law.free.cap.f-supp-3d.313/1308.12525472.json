It framed the issue on remand as \"the percentage of irrecoverable VAT included in Jacobi's selling price to the United States,\" and \"clarif[ied] that the amount of [input] VAT that Jaocbi actually paid to the PRC ... is irrelevant to [its] margin calculations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27 (noting that Commerce \"is concerned with deducting the amount of\n   <em>\n    irrecoverable\n   </em>\n   VAT\n   <em>\n    which was actually included in the selling price\n   </em>\n   of activated carbon to the United States\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   To that end, Commerce stated that Chinese law requires Jacobi to pay 17 percent VAT on inputs and exempts sales of activated carbon from any VAT rebate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 &amp; nn.94-95 (citations omitted).

Commerce's Redetermination as to the Irrecoverable VAT Adjustment is Remanded\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the court is compelled to remand again the VAT adjustment to Commerce so that the agency may reconsider the record evidence and apply a methodology that is consistent both with the record evidence and with U.S. law. The Remand Results currently under review do not reasonably support the application of the methodology as it is explained by the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Commerce's revised explanation for its irrecoverable VAT adjustment differs in a material respect from the explanation offered in support of the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   . In the Issues and Decision Memorandum, Commerce explained its irrecoverable VAT calculation by way of reference to the 17 percent\n   <em>\n    input VAT\n   </em>\n   and the absence of an export rebate; in the Remand Results, while Commerce continued to define irrecoverable VAT in terms of the input VAT, it explained its methodology for adjusting for irrecoverable VAT by reference to, and as based upon, the 17 percent\n   <em>\n    output VAT\n   </em>\n   applicable to Jacobi's U.S. sales.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   I &amp; D Mem. at 17,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 27-28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   At oral argument, the court afforded\n   the Government an opportunity to reconcile this inconsistency; the Government did not and the court cannot provide such a reconciliation for the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The statute permits Commerce to deduct from CEP \"[1] the amount, if included in such price, of [2] any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B). Commerce's redetermination relied on evidence that Jacobi's U.S. price includes\n   <em>\n    output VAT\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 27. In so doing, Commerce's inconsistent explanations introduced uncertainty as to whether the adjustment is intended to account for an unrefunded\n   <em>\n    input VAT\n   </em>\n   imposed on exported goods that could be understood as an \"other charge,\" or instead, an output VAT collected on these exports by application of Chinese law, which could be considered an \"export tax\" under U.S. law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed.

Understanding the basis for Commerce's adjustment is crucial to the court's ability to review the agency's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For that reason, at oral argument, the court asked the Government to clarify the statutory basis for the adjustment; in other words, to reconcile its calculation methodology with its theory underlying the irrecoverable VAT adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg. at 1:57:00-2:00:14 (inquiring whether the absence of a rebate for exported activated carbon means that the adjustment accounts for a 17 percent export tax corresponding to the output VAT as opposed to irrecoverable VAT corresponding to unrefunded input VAT).\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Government responded that the\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   contemplates irrecoverable input and output VAT; that neither were rebated in this case; and that, therefore, both are included in Jacobi's U.S. price. Oral Arg. at 2:00:15-2:02:44). The Government's response failed to reconcile the inconsistencies in the Issues and Decision Memorandum and the Remand Results or otherwise clarify Commerce's determination on the basis of the facts in this particular case. The court remands Commerce's redetermination for reconsideration or further explanation in accordance with this discussion. Commerce must also address the following issues on remand:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   To the extent that Commerce continues to justify the adjustment as accounting for irrecoverable VAT defined as unrefunded\n   <em>\n    input VAT\n   </em>\n   , Commerce must address record evidence demonstrating that Jacobi, in fact, recovers the input VAT it incurs by the offset it takes before remitting the output VAT it collects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobi Suppl. SCQR, Ex. SC-54;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. SC-58, Suppl. Conf. RJA, CR 109, 119, ECF No. 119-1. Commerce has contrasted the PRC's VAT regime with the \"typical VAT system,\" in which companies can offset input VAT against VAT collected from its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Results at 25-26. The agency must, therefore, address this evidence suggesting Jacobi's ability to offset input VAT against output VAT collected from foreign customers, suggesting that the input VAT is not, in fact, irrecoverable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Commerce must explain why the amount of the export tax, duty, or other charge is properly determined on the basis of the FOB price of the output (or the estimated customs value) rather than the value of the inputs (or some other approach that seeks to determine the amount of input VAT actually paid to the PRC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   On the other hand, if Commerce asserts that the adjustment is based on an export tax due to Jacobi's collection of output VAT, Commerce must (a) address the record evidence regarding Jacobi's offset for input VAT paid on inputs taken against the output VAT collected, and (b) explain why the VAT adjustment is properly made on the basis of an estimated customs value instead of the FOB value on which the PRC assesses it. In\n   <em>\n    Jacobi (AR7) I\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that Commerce's reliance on an estimated customs value was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. 222 F.Supp.3d at 1191-92.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   While there may be legitimate questions about Jacobi's entered values, the adjustment, by definition, relates to \"the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   ... of any export tax, duty or other charge\n   <em>\n    imposed by\n   </em>\n   \" the PRC on the exportation of the subject merchandise, 19 USC \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added), and Commerce, in the\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   , found that it \"can measure a transfer of funds between [the PRC] and companies therein, regardless of the direction the money flows,\" and that because the \"taxes [are] affirmatively imposed [by China, Commerce] presume[s] that they are also collected.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. at 36,483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, if Commerce continues to disregard Jacobi's FOB values, it must explain why the reliability of Jacobi's entered values is pertinent when Commerce is attempting to determine the export VAT \"imposed by\" the PRC. While an artificially low FOB value might lead Chinese authorities to impose lower taxes than are otherwise appropriate, Commerce must explain its basis for taking account of any such under-collection by China in the calculation of the antidumping duty margin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Finally, consistent with its discussion of \"included in the price\" in the\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036%2C481\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. at 36,483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Commerce must address whether it is using gross or net prices to calculate the adjustment and, in so doing, address the evidentiary support for rejecting DJAC's proposed calculation methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   are sustained with respect to the issue of economic comparability, as set forth in Discussion Section II above; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   are remanded to further address the issue of significant production, as set forth in Discussion Section III above; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   are remanded with respect to its surrogate value selections, as set forth in Discussion Section IV above; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   are remanded to further address the issue of irrecoverable VAT, as set forth in Discussion Section V above; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that, in the event Commerce amends the antidumping margin assigned to Jacobi, Commerce reconsider the separate rate assigned to non-mandatory respondents; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce shall file its second remand results on or before July 18, 2018; it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the deadlines provided in USCIT Rule 56.2(h) shall govern thereafter; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that any opposition or supportive comments must not exceed 6,000 words.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    Plaintiff-Intervenors include: Ningxia Huahui Activated Carbon Co., Ltd.
