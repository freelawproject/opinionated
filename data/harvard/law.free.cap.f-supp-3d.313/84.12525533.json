For approximately the last ten of those years, Defendants Deutsche Bank National Trust Company and Specialized Loan Servicing were the mortgagee and servicer, respectively, for a mortgage secured by the Property. After Plaintiffs defaulted on the mortgage, Deutsche Bank commenced foreclosure proceedings against them and, eventually, obtained court authorization for their eviction. In an attempt to remain in the Property, Plaintiffs brought this suit claiming that the doctrine of adverse possession protects their rights. Defendants now move to dismiss on three grounds: standing, failure to state a claim, and claim preclusion. Finding that Plaintiffs have standing, but do not meet the statutory requirements for adverse possession, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants argue that this case should be dismissed because Plaintiffs lack standing, do not meet the requirements for adverse possession, and should be precluded from bringing this action because the validity of their possession has already been decided. The Court addresses the first two below and, finding that Plaintiffs have not adversely possessed the Property, declines to evaluate the third.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In conducting its standing analysis, the Court assumes, as it must, that Plaintiffs are, in fact, adverse possessors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Navy Chaplaincy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573853,4065317\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/756/\">\n    534 F.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760 (D. C. Cir. 2008). Defendants contend that \"[b]oth Plaintiffs conveyed away their 'interests' in the Property long before a 15 year period of adverse possession could accrue\" and, consequently, have no standing to sue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 5. While their premise is correct, their conclusion is not. Asnake did, indeed, convey his interest to Merid in 2006, making her the sole owner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Asnake Deed. And, in 2017, Merid conveyed her interest to the IAL trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IAL Trust Deed. Defendants thus claim that \"[t]he only party ... with even theoretical standing to raise a claim is the IAL trust.\" Mot. at 6. Such a conclusion, however, is antithetical to the doctrine of adverse possession. That doctrine allows a person who occupies, but does not own, real property to acquire valid title. The entire idea of the doctrine is built on the understanding that the claimant will not have\n   <em>\n    deed interest\n   </em>\n   in the property, but is nonetheless a possessor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auer Park Corp., Inc. v.

According to Defendants, Plaintiffs \"have failed to allege the requisite hostility\" for the statutory time period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 4. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the name suggests, adverse possession requires the possessor to be \"adverse\" to the actual owner-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"possession that is opposed and antagonistic to all other claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Tippett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11946803\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/569/1186/#p1190\">\n    569 A.2d at 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs here claim adverse possession\n   against Deutsche Bank, which, until the foreclosure in 2017, was merely the mortgagee. But a mortgagor and mortgagee cannot be hostile to one another until one party repudiates the relationship, such as if the mortgagor defaults and the mortgagee forecloses on the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vowell v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6759405\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/dc/3/428/#p428\">\n    3 D.C. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 428 (1829) (\"[U]ntil actual foreclosure or sale, the mortgagor is, in equity, considered as the owner of the property.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 Am.

[s]o long as the relation[ship] of mortgagor and mortgagee is recognized between the parties.\"). In other words, the earliest time at which Defendants could have been adverse to Plaintiffs is 2017, when the Superior Court approved the foreclosure. Prior to that time, because \"the mortgage conveys nothing in the land,\" Defendants were \"only considered as a trustee, and the mortgage [ ] but a security for the money lent.\"\n   <em>\n    Vowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6759405\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/dc/3/428/#p428\">\n    3 D.C. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   428 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Third) of Property \u00a7 4.1(a) (\"A mortgage creates only a security interests in real estate and confers no right to possession of that real estate on the mortgagee.\").
