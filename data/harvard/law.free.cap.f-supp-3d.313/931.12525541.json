ST. EVE, District Court Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff Authenticom, Inc., a data-integration firm, sued Defendants CDK Global, LLC and The Reynolds and Reynolds Company, the premier purveyors of dealer management systems, for violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and committing tortious interference. Both Defendants filed respective motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (R. 53, R. 56.) For the reasons explained below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Authenticom filed this lawsuit on May 1, 2017, in the Western District of Wisconsin. With its Complaint, Authenticom filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction. The motion sought to enjoin Defendants' allegedly anticompetitive practices which, as explained below, allegedly prevented Authenticom from accessing Defendants' respective dealer management systems (\"DMS\"), a necessary part of Authenticom's data-integration business. Authenticom claimed that those practices effectively excluded it from the market and, as a result, were \"on the verge of putting [it] out of business.\" (Case No. 18-cv-868, R. 5.) Over the next three months, the parties submitted voluminous exhibits and declarations, and the district court held a two-and-a-half-day hearing in early July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 14, 2017, the district court granted Authenticom's motion for a preliminary injunction. It ruled that Authenticom had demonstrated a \"moderate\" likelihood of success on its Section 1 claims (it did not address the Section 2 claims), and that Authenticom had no adequate remedy at law as evidence suggested Defendants' conduct could force it to shutter its business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v.

Those preliminary injunctions forced, among other things, Defendants to allow Authenticom access to their DMSs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants appealed, and the Seventh Circuit vacated the preliminary injunctions and remanded the case. The Seventh Circuit held that whatever the merits of Authenticom's Section 1 claims, the injunctions' forced sharing of Defendants' DMSs ran afoul of the bedrock principle that firms generally have no duty to deal with competitors.\n   <em>\n    Authenticom, Inc. v.

The JPML granted that motion and transferred the cases to this Court for consolidated pretrial proceedings. (R. 1.)

DMSs, Data Integration, and Auto Dealers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This case concerns the data services and businesses upon which auto dealers rely in conducting their operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two purported markets in that space are of principal relevance here: the DMS market and the data-integration market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The DMS Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DMS software is the \"central nervous system\" of a dealership. (Compl. \u00b6 28.) It is essentially enterprise software designed specifically for dealers, and a DMS manages \"virtually every aspect of a dealer's business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, DMS software handles information regarding sales, financing, part and vehicle inventory, repair and service, accounting, payroll, human resources, marketing, and still more. In addition to some management functionalities, a DMS is a database in which dealers effectively house this critical information and data. A dealer has only one DMS provider at a time; it would be \"functionally impossible\" for a dealer to try to use more than one. A DMS provider licenses its software to a dealer through a written contract generally lasting between five to seven years. The Complaint defines the DMS market as providers that sell DMS software to dealers in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   CDK and Reynolds \"dominate\" the DMS market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) Viewed by dealer-customers, they together control approximately 75 percent of the market. CDK has approximately 45 percent of it, and Reynolds has approximately 30 percent. Viewed by the number of vehicles sold, their collective control increases to approximately 90 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As alleged duopolists, CDK and Reynolds enjoy a profitable business. They each, for example, earn approximately 40 percent profit margin. Their customers, the dealers, are also unable to freely switch between DMS providers. In addition to the contract lengths, \"it is enormously difficult and disruptive for a dealer to switch DMS\" given the costs of transferring data, retraining employees, and reconfiguring systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Adding to those \"logistical nightmares,\" the Complaint claims that CDK and Reynolds \"punish\" dealers that try to change DMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   providers through lawsuits and by restricting third-party access to the dealers' DMS-stored data. In part for those reasons, the average DMS-dealer relationship lasts more than 20 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Data-Integration Market\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Critical as it is, a dealer's DMS is not the only data service upon which it relies. Many dealers use third-party application providers-or vendors-for service and management applications. These applications help a dealership, for example, track vehicle inventory, customer information, service and repair appointments, and recalls. Most dealerships have ten or more vendors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To make their applications, vendors require access to dealerships' data-which is stored on DMSs. A vendor that provides an application organizing vehicle registration and titling must be able to obtain purchaser, vehicle, and financing information from a dealer's DMS. Some vendors, further, must be able to input data into a DMS. For example, an application that handles customer information must be able to \"push\" sales information into the DMS when a dealership sells a car from the lot. The Complaint does not estimate how many vendors exist, but it asserts that both CDK and Reynolds offer application services. CDK and Reynolds both, for example, offer relationship-management applications, and they jointly operate a provider of electronic-vehicle registration and titling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Vendors, however, do not access the DMSs directly. Instead, data integrators-like Authenticom-provide this service to vendors. Data integrators \"specialize in extracting dealers' data from DMS databases, aggregating that data and putting it into a standard format, and then delivering to vendors the specific data required for their applications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) To pull the needed data from the DMS, data integrators generally receive authorization from dealerships. In many cases, including Authenticom's, dealers set up separate login credentials for the integrators so that they can access the DMSs. Once in, data integrators \"data scrape\" or \"screen scrape\" the DMS, an automatic process that pulls relevant data. Although dealers generally choose whether to authorize integrators' access to the DMSs, they do not directly pay integrators. Vendors, as the customers receiving the integrators' data output, make the payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dealers \"own\" their data in the DMSs. The Complaint quotes a Reynolds spokesperson as having stated, \"The data belongs to the dealers. We all agree on that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) CDK, likewise, has stated publicly that it \"has always understood that dealerships own their data and enjoy having choices on how best to share and utilize the data with others.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Both CDK's and Reynolds's websites make similar claims. Similarly, the Complaint cites a number of statements by CDK representatives (though not Reynolds representatives) making clear that dealers can permit third-party access to their DMS-stored data, at least before 2015. To take just one example, Matt Parsons, CDK's vice president of sales, stated in 2007, \"We're not going to limit the ability of a dealer to give an ID to someone else to, in essence, dial into their system. That is the dealer's right. We have no right to tell them they can't do that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Complaint defines the data-integration market as comprised of providers of integration services in the United States. According to the Complaint, there used to be \"numerous\" data integrators. Today, only CDK, Reynolds, and Authenticom remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Steve Cottrell founded Authenticom in 2002. Authenticom's feature product is\n   DealerVault, which gives dealerships \"state-of-the-art control over how their data is pulled and shared.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) In addition to pulling data from DMSs, Authenticom has begun, in limited fashion, \"pushing\" data as well, which benefits vendors and dealers in that it expands the services provided. Before accessing a dealer's DMS, Authenticom secures the dealer's-though not the DMS provider's-express authorization. The Complaint also highlights that Authenticom has never incurred a data breach and that its tools and practices are secure. As to pricing, Authenticom generally charges approximately $25 for a first data set, and $50 for two or more. The average price Authenticom charges a vendor is between $30 and 40 per month for one dealership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CDK and Reynolds also offer integration services. CDK, for its part, owns the two largest data integrators in the market-Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink. It also offers a product that permits direct access to CDK DMSs, called the 3PA program. Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink function like Authenticom; they obtain login credentials for a DMS from the dealer, then extract and format the data. Indeed, Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink formerly pulled data from Reynolds DMS for vendors. Reynolds did not begin to block CDK \"and others\" from doing so until 2009. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) After Reynolds began to block Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink-that is, prevent them from accessing Reynolds DMSs-CDK devised the \"SMART-R\" solution, which permitted its integrators to continue to access Reynolds DMSs. As a result, CDK (through Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink) continued to access Reynolds DMSs on behalf of its vendor clients, again at least until 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Unlike Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink, 3PA, also known as \"Third Party Access,\" allows access to CDK DMSs only. CDK's 3PA formerly offered three \"levels\": one supplied vendors with login credentials for the dealership's system, another allowed third parties \"subscriber access\" that the dealer controlled, and a third permitted real-time access to CDK DMSs. That, too, changed after the alleged anticompetitive agreements of 2015, when CDK revised 3PA to prohibit dealer control over third-party access to CDK DMSs. CDK represented that the change was the result of its \"SecurityFirst\" initiative, which ended up increasing charges to vendors to approximately $250 to $300 per connection-almost triple what it charged before the 2015 revision, and far more than the $25 to $50 per connection that Authenticom charges. Today, CDK has taken the position that 3PA is the \"only approved method for accessing\" CDK DMSs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) CDK considers all other access \"unauthorized,\" and it forbids vendors from obtaining data on a CDK DMS from any integrator other than 3PA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Reynolds does not offer integration services to access other providers' DMS software, but it does offer the Reynolds Certified Interface Program (\"RCI\"). RCI is an \"equivalent\" to CDK's 3PA, and it is the only Reynolds-authorized method by which vendors can access Reynolds DMSs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.) Like with CDK and 3PA, Reynolds contractually restricts both dealers and vendors from using integrators other than RCI to access Reynolds DMSs. Reynolds's RCI pricing is not publicly available, but the Complaint represents that it is \"even steeper\" than CDK's 3PA pricing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Complaint describes other integrators that, though once successful, have been forced out of business as a result of Reynolds's prohibition and CDK's more-recent prohibition on third-party access to their respective DMSs. Those prohibitions,\n   while having the purported effect of excluding data integrators from the data-integration market generally, also allow CDK and Reynolds (through 3PA and RCI, respectively) to dominate their single-brand aftermarkets. The Complaint alleges that such aftermarkets are cognizable in this case, because when dealers purchase a DMS, they are \"locked in\" to that purchase through high switching and information costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) A vendor who wants to work with both CDK and Reynolds dealers must purchase both 3PA and RCI services. In turn, Defendants can, and do, charge supracompetitive pricing for their respective integration services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. CDK and Reynolds Pre-2015 Treatment of Data Integrators and Third-Party Access\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Initially, and for over a decade, all DMS providers-CDK and Reynolds included- permitted dealers the right to authorize third-party access to the DMSs. That industry-wide agreement began to erode in 2007, when Reynolds announced that it would start blocking data integrators from Reynolds DMSs. Since then, Reynolds has considered third-party, unauthorized scraping of its DMSs as \"hostile access.\" As a result of this policy change, Reynolds began disabling Authenticom's credentials in 2009 by imposing \"challenge questions\" and \"captcha\" (entry requests to enter random or blurred text), which identify non-human users. In 2013, Reynolds began disabling Authenticom's credentials en masse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CDK, on the other hand, countenanced third-party access for far longer. Indeed, CDK touted its open architecture. Its CEO, for example, publicly stated, \"We're not going to prohibit\" integrators' access \"or get in the way of that...I think we've stated pretty emphatically, we really believe the dealer owns the data. I don't know how you can ever make the opinion that the data is yours to govern and to preclude others from having access to it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) In 2015, however, CDK came to echo Reynolds's disapproval of third-party access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CDK and Reynolds's Alleged Conspiracies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Complaint alleges that in February 2015, CDK and Reynolds \"entered into an agreement to eliminate competition in the Dealer Data-integration market and the single-brand after markets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) Essentially, these agreements took two forms-written agreements, signed in early 2015, and a general understanding. The alleged purpose of Defendants' agreements was twofold: first, to protect vendors from siphoning any part of their DMS market duopoly by offering services that could compete with DMS software, and second, to protect CDK and Reynold's data-integration businesses and aftermarket single-brand monopolies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The February 2015 Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Effective February 18, 2015, CDK and Reynolds entered into a Data Exchange Agreement (the \"DEA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The DEA purportedly served as a wind-down arrangement, in which CDK agreed to eventually restrict (during a term that could last up to five years) its integrators-Digital Motorworks and IntegraLink-from accessing Reynolds DMSs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 54, Ex. 1 \u00a7 4.0.) As a part of that wind-down arrangement, CDK agreed to \"cooperate\" in efforts to have Digital Motorworks's and\n   IntegraLink's vendor-clients join RCI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1.) The wind-down arrangement also featured Section 4.5, titled a \"Prohibition on Knowledge Transfer and DMS Access,\" which stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Each of Reynolds and CDK further covenants and agrees not to sell, transfer, or assign to any affiliate or third party any technology, business process, or other such knowledge regarding integration with the other party's DMS or take any other step to assist any person that it reasonably believes to have plans to access or integrate with the other party's DMS without the other party's written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.5 is not intended as a \"covenant not to compete,\" but rather as a contractual restriction of access and attempted access intended to protect the operational data security integrity of Reynolds DMS and CDK DMS and protection of intellectual property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.5.) According to Authenticom, this arrangement constituted an agreement to divide the market: Reynolds would not access, or aid the access of, CDK DMSs without CDK's permission,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and CDK would not access, or aid the access of, Reynolds DMSs without Reynolds's permission. Section 4.5's terms do not expire. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The parties also entered into two, contemporaneously executed, reciprocal agreements. In the \"3PA Agreement,\" Reynolds's vendor applications received five years' of free data integration using 3PA to access CDK DMSs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   54, Ex. 2; R. 54 at 8; 56 at 11.) In the \"Reynolds Interface Agreement\" (collectively, with the DEA and 3PA Agreement, the \"2015 Agreements\"), CDK agreed to enlist seven of its vendor applications in the RCI program to access Reynolds DMSs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   54, Ex. 3; R. 54 at 8; R. 56 at 11.) By way of both agreements, Defendants, in their capacity as application providers (though only for seven of CDK's applications\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), agreed not to use other integrators when extracting data from the other's DMSs. Specifically, Reynolds agreed that it would not \"otherwise access, retrieve, license, or otherwise transfer any data from or to a CDK System (including, without limitation, pursuant to any 'hostile interface') for itself or any other entity,\" nor contract with a third-party to access CDK DMSs. (R. 54, Ex. 2 \u00a7 1(e).) CDK likewise agreed to a provision titled \"Non-Approved Access,\" which prohibited it from obtaining \"[a]ny direct or indirect access of the Reynolds System for the benefit\" of the applications \"by CDK or an agent acting on behalf of CDK other than with Reynolds' prior written consent.\" (R. 54, Ex. 3 \u00a7 1.8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The General Agreement to Oust Authenticom\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to a market-division agreement, the Complaint alleges that Defendants reached a broader agreement to expel Authenticom and other third parties from the data-integration market. Defendants have allegedly conveyed this agreement to Authenticom. On April 3, 2016, Dan McCray, CDK's Vice President of Product Management, approached Mr. Cottrell at an industry convention. Mr. McCray led Mr. Cottrell off the convention floor and to a secluded area. There, he told Mr. Cottrell that CDK and Reynolds had agreed to \"lock you and the other third\n   parties out.\" (Compl. \u00b6 180.) Regarding an offer CDK had made to acquire Authenticom's business for approximately $15 million, Mr. McCray asserted that the offer was relatively low because Authenticom's \"book of Reynolds business is worthless to us because of the agreement between CDK and Reynolds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. McCray then threatened: \"I wanted to look you in the eye and let you know man to man, I have been mandated by our new CEO to seek you out and destroy your business on our systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Regarding CDK-dealer contracts prohibiting third-party access, Mr. McCray stated further, \"we will enforce our contract with the dealers and sue them if needed to keep you out of our systems.\" He concluded, \"For god's sake ...you have built a great little business, get something for it before it is destroyed otherwise I will f***ing destroy it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steve French, CDK's Senior Director of Client and Data Services and former Reynolds employee, delivered a similar (albeit more tempered) explanation of the supposed CDK-Reynolds agreement to a vendor. In attempting to move a vendor over to the 3PA program, Mr. French stated that he was working with Reynolds to lock out third-party integrators like Authenticom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Reynolds's executives have delivered the same message to Authenticom. In May 2015, Robert Schaefer, Reynolds's Director of Data Services and the person in charge of the RCI program, told Mr. Cottrell during a phone conversation that CDK and Reynolds had an agreement to support each other's 3PA and RCI programs, and therefore block integration competitors like Authenticom. Mr. Schaefer shared with Mr. Cottrell that Bob Brockman, Reynolds's Owner, Chairman, and CEO, was \"adamant\" about blocking independent data integrators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 181.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Complaint cites examples of Defendants carrying out these shared threats. Reynolds unsuccessfully proposed a wind-down agreement with Authenticom, and CDK began blocking Authenticom from their DMSs. In August 2016, for example, CDK disabled Authenticom's credentials at thousands of dealerships. After doing so, CDK sent a letter to all dealers whose vendors use Authenticom. The message said that the dealers must join the 3PA program to avoid business \"disruption.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 201.) Reynolds has delivered similar messages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 202.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CDK and Reynolds's Alleged Vertical Restraints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to those agreements between competitors, the Complaint claims that Defendants have entered into anticompetitive agreements with their vendors and dealers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Vendor Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CDK requires that any vendor using 3PA for any of its dealer-customers on a CDK DMS must agree to use 3PA exclusively for all of its of its dealer-customers on CDK DMSs. The penalty for failing to comply with this exclusive arrangement is termination of the agreement (and thus access to dealer data stored on CDK DMSs). The terms of these exclusivity clauses purportedly \"last forever,\" according to the Complaint. Reynolds has similar terms in its vendor contracts. Likewise, in its RCI contracts, Reynolds requires that\n   the vendor agree not to use any \"Non-Approved Access\" to Reynolds DMSs. These terms last as long as the agreement is in effect, which generally constitutes three years plus any one-year renewals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   CDK and Reynolds also both include \"price secrecy\" provisions in their vendor contracts. These provisions prevent vendors from sharing with dealers information about how much Defendants charge for data access. The CDK 3PA contract, for example, states that vendors \"shall not include any interface fee, DMS access fee or any other similar fee related to the use of the CDK Interface System in any of its invoices to its customers or otherwise include any direct or indirect indication to its customer (in its invoices or otherwise) of the fees charged by CDK hereunder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.) Reynolds's RCI contracts contain a similar provision binding the vendors from sharing pricing information with their customers, the dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dealer Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As for the contracts with dealers, both Defendants purportedly require that dealers agree that they will not provide access to the DMS to anyone other than the DMS provider for data-integration purposes. CDK's standard DMS contract, for example, contains a clause stating: \"Client is not authorized to cause or permit any third party software to access the CDK Dealer Management System,\" and \"Client shall not allow access to [the CDK DMS] by any third parties except parties otherwise permitted,\" which includes the dealer's \"employees and agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151.) According to the Complaint, CDK used to take the position that its contracts permitted integrators to access CDK DMSs-as demonstrated by its self-touted open architecture-but it now takes the opposite stance. CDK's contract provisions last for the contract's five-year duration. Reynolds has similar provisions in its standard DMS contracts. Those contracts bar dealers from \"provid[ing] access to the [Reynolds DMS]...to any third party.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.) Reynolds's restriction clauses, too, last for the contract's duration, which is generally five to seven years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   CDK and Reynolds, respectively, enforce these contract provisions by disabling third-party user credentials (like those upon which Authenticom relies) to access their DMSs. When one dealer complained to CDK, CDK cited in response the authorization provisions of its standard contract. Reynolds, further, has filed lawsuits against data integrators for tortiously interfering with their dealer contracts by accessing (presumably with dealer authorization) Reynolds DMSs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Alleged Competitive Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Complaint claims that Defendants' conduct has harmed the markets in essentially two ways: one, it has allowed Defendants to increase the prices they charge for their integration services, and two, it has reduced consumer choice and output.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Price Increase\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As noted, Authenticom generally charges $25 for one data feed and $50 for two to seven. As such, Authenticom customers generally pay between $30 to $40 dollars for services per month. Authenticom also charges $75 dollars for \"bi-directional access\" to dealer data. These prices are comparable to those charged by most other data integrators. One, for example, charges $40 per connection and $70 per connection for bi-directional access. CDK and Reynolds, on the other hand, charge much higher prices for integration. One vendor used to pay an integrator a rate of $45 to $55 per month; it now pays Reynolds and CDK between $300 to $866 per month. CDK used to charge $70 per\n   connection, for example, but since 2015, now charges upwards of $300. Likewise, post-2015, Reynolds continues to raise prices for integration services. Defendants, moreover, charge substantial upfront fees. It costs \"at least\" $30,000 to join the 3PA and RCI programs, and the setup fees for such services are approximately $300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reduced Consumer Choice and Output\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants' conduct has also reduced output in the data-integration market and downstream markets, the Complaint claims. Dealerships and vendors prefer Authenticom because of its higher-quality services and better prices, but Defendants' contracts with dealers and vendors-and the general exclusion of Authenticom and other integrators from the market- effectively require both to use (indirectly and directly) Defendants' integration products. Defendants' higher prices also hinder the third-party application market. One vendor, for example, closed one of its application products because of Reynolds's high integration fees. Another expressed concerns about going out of business because it could not afford Defendants' integration costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Authenticom brings five counts-four based on alleged violations of the Sherman Act, one based on state tort law. Defendants have moved to dismiss all counts. The Court addresses them in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Antitrust Claims (Counts One Through Four)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Counts One through Four of the Complaint entail claims under both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, based on several anticompetition theories. Defendants challenge each of those claims as insufficiently pleaded, but also argue that Authenticom's claims fail for threshold reasons concerning antitrust defenses and injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Other Cyber-Security Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Defendants argue that Authenticom's Sherman Act claims fail at the start because they seek to vindicate an illegal trade through an antitrust lawsuit. Defendants contend, specifically, that the Complaint affirmatively pleads Authenticom's violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (\"CFAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , the Wisconsin Cyber Crimes Act (\"WCCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20943.70\">\n    Wis. Stat. \u00a7 943.70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and other cyber-security laws. The CFAA, for example, imposes criminal liability on anyone who \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains...information from any protected computer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(c). Defendants argue that the Complaint makes clear that Authenticom did just that by accessing DMSs (protected computers) and pulling data without authorization (from Defendants). Having admitted as much, Defendants submit, Authenticom cannot now seek refuge under the Sherman Act. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Courts have generally held that a plaintiff's wrongdoing is not a defense to an antitrust suit.

Horizontal Conspiracy Between Defendants (Count One)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Count One of the Complaint claims a conspiracy between CDK and Reynolds, competitors in both the DMS market and the data-integration market. Two related agreements, essentially, comprise the alleged conspiracy: first, the Complaint alleges that Defendants agreed to drive Authenticom and other third-party integrators out of the data-integration market by blocking access to the dealers' DMS-stored data, and second, the Complaint claims that Defendants agreed to allocate their respective DMS single-brand aftermarkets through the 2015 Agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Alleged Agreement to Block Authenticom's Access to Dealer Data\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Complaint adequately alleges an agreement to drive Authenticom out of the market. It claims that in May 2015, just three months after CDK and Reynolds executed the 2015 Agreements, a Reynolds executive referenced those agreements on a phone call with Mr. Cottrell. He told Mr. Cottrell that CDK and Reynolds had agreed to \"support each other's\" integration programs and \"therefore\n   block competitors\" like Authenticom from \"pulling dealer data.\" (Compl. \u00b6 181.) The Reynolds executive also told Mr. Cottrell that he was \"in communications\" with other DMS providers to join \"in the agreement to block independent data integrators,\" like Authenticom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A CDK executive allegedly repeated that message to Mr. Cottrell a year later, in April 2016. At an industry convention that month, CDK's Vice President of Product Management told Mr. Cottrell that CDK and Reynolds had agreed to \"lock you and the other parties out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.)

Defendants correctly point out that the 2015 Agreements do not require them to preclude third-party integration on their own DMSs. They do, however, effectively require that CDK stop hostile access of Reynolds DMSs (for a period, at least) and, more importantly, expressly prohibit Defendants from assisting in the hostile access of one another's DMSs. Such a partial ceasefire and mutual forbearance between two rivals would make sense if-as the executives allegedly admitted-Defendants sought to \"support\" one another's integration services to the exclusion of third-party integrators from the competition. Defendants also contend that there are legitimate explanations for the 2015 Agreements, such as resolving CDK's hostile access and addressing security concerns. But at this stage, it is reasonably inferable that such agreements were a part of the broader and admitted agreement to block third-party integrators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That broader agreement is, moreover, anticompetitive.

CDK, for example, contends that the alleged confessions are \"nonsensical\" because Reynolds had decided long before 2015 to block Authenticom's access. Accepting that argument, though, requires the Court to ignore well-pleaded allegations of fact (that the executives admitted the agreement), and then credit an inference in Defendants' favor (that the agreement did not exist because Reynolds had already engaged in integrator blocking) over a contrary one in Authenticom's favor (that Reynolds agreed, for example, to escalate or enhance its blocking, or agreed not to go after CDK for its hostile access, in exchange for CDK's commitment to begin blocking). The Court cannot do that at this stage.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forgue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266402\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/962/#p966\">\n    873 F.3d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CDK further submits that the executive's comment to Mr. Cottrell-that \"Reynolds and CDK had agreed to 'lock [Authenticom] and the other third parties out' \"-does not \"tend to exclude independent conduct.\" (R. 54 at 14.) Again, the allegation is that Defendants admittedly \"\n   <em>\n    agreed\n   </em>\n   \" to block third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Reynolds's similar arguments are equally misplaced. It identifies innocent explanations for and interpretations of the executives' comments, and then attempts to persuade the Court that those exculpatory explanations are \"more plausible\" than Authenticom's inculpatory ones.

That is a bad argument. For one, it requires an inference in Defendants' favor and Authenticom's disfavor. It also backfires. The executives allegedly confessed to an agreement to \"block\" third-party integrators; Defendants' position that the agreement referenced was in fact the 2015 Agreements suggests that Defendants (or at least their executives) thought that the 2015 Agreements aimed to \"block\" third-party integrators-precisely as the Complaint claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants' other argument, that there is no plausibly pleaded agreement to block integrator access to dealer data because Defendants could have done so independently, fails for similar reasons.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges facts showing that many dealers preferred open architecture; when CDK began blocking, for example, several dealers loudly complained. In light of those claims, it is inferable that-as is true of most antitrust conspiracies-Defendants (which together control the DMS market) desired the luxury of taking an action profitable for them but disadvantageous to their customers (by excluding a cheaper rival in the downstream data-integration\n   market) without fearing that their customers would respond by, for example, turning to another provider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Making that inference, as the Court must, Defendants' argument fails. Reynolds or CDK could indeed have continued or began to block integrator access independently, like any oligopolist could, say, continue or decide to raise prices independently. But the former fact does not mean Defendants' lacked a motive to conspire to do so, like the latter fact does not mean that oligopolists lack motive to fix prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Complaint plausibly pleads an anticompetitive conspiracy to block third-party integrators' access to DMSs and dealer data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court, accordingly, denies Defendants' motions to dismiss with respect to this part of Count One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Alleged Market-Allocation Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Complaint also claims that Defendants agreed to divide the data-integration market, in which Authenticom, CDK, and Reynolds allegedly compete for vendors' business. Authenticom bases this theory on the 2015 Agreements' terms. (R. 59 at 23.) Specifically, it alleges that the DEA plainly evidences an agreement in which CDK would forebear from providing integration services on Reynolds DMSs, in exchange for Reynolds's forbearance from providing integration services on CDK DMSs. The point of Defendants' alleged conspiracy, according to Authenticom, is to reap monopoly rents for Defendants' data-integration services. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 217.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Whether or not the market-division agreement is plausible, and insofar as it is distinct from the alleged agreement to block third-party integrators, Authenticom lacks the antitrust injury (if not injury-in-fact) required to challenge that agreement. It is well-established that a competitor \"cannot recover for a conspiracy to impose nonprice restraints that have the effect of either raising market price or limiting output.

That injury, however, stems from the alleged agreement (discussed earlier) to block Authenticom and other third-party integrators from accessing dealer data, not from the alleged agreement to divide the market and raise prices. In other words, the Complaint alleges that Authenticom's customers headed for the exits in 2015 and 2016 because Authenticom began to lose large-scale access to dealer data, not because competing integrators had divided the market and raised prices. The Court therefore grants Defendants' motions to dismiss with respect to the Complaint's market-division claims without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Vertical Agreements with Vendors and Dealers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Counts Two and Three also assert Section 1 violations. Count Two claims that Defendants engage in anticompetitive exclusive dealing, and Count Three claims that Defendants practice illegal tying arrangements. These claims, in essence, take issue with how Defendants have operated their DMSs, and specifically which companies they have permitted-and more importantly restricted-to use and access their DMSs. Defendants challenge both of Authenticom's vertical Section 1 theories and argue that the Complaint's allegations do not meet the legal requirements for such claims. Before addressing those arguments, the Court addresses another threshold concern: the effect of\n   <em>\n    Trinko\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Linkline\n   </em>\n   on the Complaint's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Trinko\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Linkline\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The driving animus behind many of Defendants' Section 1 arguments is that Authenticom essentially challenges Defendants' refusals to deal.

The Complaint alleges that these contracts require a vendor that uses the 3PA or RCI programs for one dealer to use those programs to obtain data for any and all of its dealer-customers that use CDK or Reynolds DMSs, respectively. In other words, they require the vendor to obtain its integration-services exclusively from Defendants when obtaining data from their DMSs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paddock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1074\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/42/#p46\">\n    103 F.3d at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Complaint also has pleaded sufficient facts indicating that these exclusive-dealing contracts could foreclose a substantial portion of the data-integration market.

CDK is right that Defendants' respective share of the\n   <em>\n    DMS\n   </em>\n   market is not the operative measure, but the Complaint further alleges that vendors rely on data integrators to access customer-dealers' data on the DMSs that Defendants' dominate. As a result, \"[t]here are few, if any, [vendors] that could survive without serving CDK and Reynolds dealers.\" (Compl. \u00b6 175). The Complaint also plausibly suggests that the enforcement of the exclusive-dealing arrangements-which again preclude vendors from working with\n   other integrators on Defendants' DMSs-has likely forced integrators (including Authenticom to an extent) from the market, and that Defendants have been effective at hiking integration costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roland Mach.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"633090\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/749/380/#p393\">\n    749 F.2d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It also alleges that CDK changed from open architecture to closed architecture as a matter of policy in 2015, which resulted in hefty integration-service fees. CDK contends that because its DMS licenses with dealers expressly prohibit DMS access to anyone other than the dealers' \"employees and agents,\" dealers knew what they were signing up for. The Complaint is replete with detailed allegations, however, showing that, before 2015, CDK publicly and loudly took the position that it permitted third-party integrator access. It is thus inferable that dealers did not in fact \"knowingly and voluntarily\" agree to third-party blocking when they purchased DMSs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3165795\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/1038/#p1048\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That the licenses permit \"agents\" to access the DMS adds to the conclusion that CDK may have duped dealers by closing its architecture post-sale, even if CDK is correct that integrators do not actually constitute agents under state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In addition to the 2015 switch in policy, the Complaint alleges that CDK's contracts with vendors prohibit the vendors from informing dealers of how much CDK's integration services cost, or even telling dealers any part of its charges from vendors are \"in any [ ] way associated with\" CDK's costs. From that, it is reasonably inferable that dealers cannot price shop for \"lifecycle\"-a fact that the\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   court found critical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    504 U.S. at 473-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . CDK's counter argument-that the Complaint pleads that some dealers complained about the costs, and thus the allegations about price-secrecy are not well-pleaded-is a stretch. A contract can prohibit vendors from sharing pricing information and a few vendors can do so anyway. Altogether, as was true in\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he proper market definition in this case can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the 'commercial realities' faced by consumers.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    504 U.S. at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729653\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/451/#p461\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The aftermarket case against Reynolds is thinner, but nevertheless sufficient at this stage.

It pleads further that Reynolds's has made this stance publicly known, and that its contracts expressly ban \"provid[ing] access to...any third party.\" The Complaint, therefore, affirmatively pleads that Reynolds's closed architecture was generally known to customers before they purchased the product (during whatever can be considered the relevant period, at least).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   But a change in aftermarket practices is not the sole worry of\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison Aire, Inc. v.

June 29, 2015). Under Wisconsin law, tortious interference with contractual relations has five elements: \"(1) the plaintiff had a contract or prospective contractual relationship with a third party; (2) the defendant interfered with the relationship; (3) the interference was intentional; (4) a causal connection exists between the interference and the damages; and (5) the defendant was not justified or privileged to interfere.\"\n   <em>\n    Comsys Inc. v.

They contend that Authenticom's vendor contracts are invalid and unenforceable in that they are illegal under\n   the cyber-security laws. The Complaint, however, does not plead that assertion. Further, as already noted, the question of \"authorization\" is fact-intensive and its resolution on these pleadings is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Weingand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203763640\">\n    2012 WL 3763640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Defendants point to no case in which a court has dismissed claims based on the notion that the Complaint affirmatively pleaded a violation of cyber-security laws. Defendants also contend that Section 773 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which says that a party may be \"justified or privileged to interfere\" if it is asserting \"in good faith a legally protected interest,\" protects their conduct. As Authenticom correctly notes, however, that exception does not extend to otherwise illegal acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 767 cmt. c (1979) (\"Conduct specifically in violation of statutory provisions or contrary to established public policy may for that reason make an inference [that the defendant acted without inappropriate motive] improper. This may be true, for example, of conduct that is in violation of antitrust provisions or is in restraint of trade\"). Moreover, courts recognize that the issue is a factual one inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metso Minerals Indus., Inc. v.

Rather, the question of this case is whether Defendants' refusal to grant such authorization and access, and more specifically their attendant blocking, was the result not of a unilateral refusal to deal, but of illegal conspiracies and anticompetitive arrangements (like tying or exclusive dealing) recognized by the antitrust laws.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Neither party suggests that the quick-look analysis is applicable to any of Authenticom's claims at this stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    Authenticom also cites Mr. Cottrell's preliminary-injunction testimony, which is consistent with these factual allegations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    Defendants do argue that an alleged \"group boycott\" is a \"factual mismatch\" to this case because they do not deal with Authenticom directly and because both Defendants could have unilaterally blocked Authenticom based on their service contracts. As Authenticom correctly responds, the first argument misunderstands a group boycott under\n    <em>\n     Klor's\n    </em>\n    , and the second fails at this stage because it ignores an inferable reason Defendants would conspire-to prevent unhappy dealers from, for example, turning to another DMS provider, as discussed further below. None of this, however, is to say that the per se test will ultimately apply to Authenticom's Section 1 conspiracy claim.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litig.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3567730\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/856/1103/#p1122\">\n     856 F.Supp.2d 1103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1122 (N.D.
