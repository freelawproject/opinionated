In January\n   2018, Ms. Ortega had her first encounter with law enforcement after a valid search of her home resulted in the seizure of heroin. Ms. Ortega admitted she had knowledge of the controlled substance but stated it belonged to her partner who was not home at the time of the search. Upon release from state custody Ms. Ortega was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). Now pending before the Court is Ms. Ortega's petition for writ of habeas corpus. Having carefully reviewed the parties' initial and supplemental briefing and having had the benefit of oral argument on April 17, 2018, the Court GRANTS Ms. Ortega's petition for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Ortega is a 51-year old woman from Mexico. (Dkt. No. 6-1 at 5.) In 2000 she entered the United States without lawful admission near Nogales, Arizona. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) She has a nine-year old daughter who is a U.S. citizen and two adult sons who were born in Mexico. (Dkt. No. 8-1 \u00b6 3.; 6-1 at 7.) On January 23, 2018, Alameda County detectives executed a search warrant of Ms. Ortega's home. (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 32.) During the search \"a large quantity of suspected heroin\" was located \"inside a paper bag inside the bottom [of] [a] dresser drawer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The dresser was \"easily accessible and did not have any type of locking device attached to prohibit access inside it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, \"the quantity of suspected heroin located inside of Ms. Ortega's residence exceed[ed] the amount commonly possessed for personal use drug users.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Ortega admitted the bedroom was hers and provided \"an admonished statement admitting to knowing about the suspected heroin and that it belonged to her husband who was not on scene at the time the search warrant was executed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Ortega's bedroom door had a deadlock but she admitted it was always left unlocked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Ortega was placed under arrest and transported to Santa Rita jail based on \"the large quantity of suspected heroin\" in the bedroom, \"her admitted knowledge of the suspected heroin,\" and \"the children who live at the residence and their ease of accessibility to the suspected heroin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 6, 2018, Ms. Ortega was charged with possession for sale of a controlled substance, willful cruelty to a child, and two sentencing enhancements due to the quantity of the controlled substance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Ms. Ortega was then released from criminal custody on her own recognizance by order of an Alameda County Superior Court judge and ordered to reappear on February 8, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) That same day, February 6, 2018, Ms. Ortega was arrested by ICE upon her release from Santa Rita County jail. (Dkt. No. 6-1 at 1 \u00b6 2.) Ms. Ortega was \"deemed to fall within ICE's enforcement priorities\" due to her \"pending felony criminal charges.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 7, 2018, \"ICE initiated removal proceedings because [Ms. Ortega] is unlawfully present in the United States without being inspected, admitted or paroled in violation of section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 4.) ICE determined Ms. Ortega should be detained pursuant to Section 236(a) of the INA \"pending removal proceedings\" and notified Ms. Ortega that she had \"a right to request a review of that determination by an Immigration Judge ('IJ').\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 \u00b6 5.) Ms. Ortega requested a review of the determination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The following day, February 8, 2018, Ms. Ortega was unable to appear for the preliminary hearing in her criminal case because she was in ICE custody. (Dkt. No. 1-2 at\n   39-40.) As a result, a bench warrant for her arrest was issued and held. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately one month later, on March 2, 2018, an IJ conducted Ms. Ortega's bond hearing. (Dkt. No. 6-1 at 2 \u00b6 7.) Ms. Ortega was \"advised by her criminal attorney not to testify about the facts of her pending criminal case outside of the presence of her criminal defense attorney.\" (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 6 \u00b6 12.) While Ms. Ortega was not able to testify about the criminal matter she was prepared to testify about other facts regarding her life in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Ms. Ortega's daughter was also present and prepared to testify and be cross-examined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Understanding that Ms. Ortega could not testify due to her pending criminal matter, the IJ stated \"instead of testimony let us ... get some of the saline facts.\" (Dkt. No. 2 at 7:79-80.) Ms. Ortega's counsel represented that Ms. Ortega (1) has never been arrested and has no criminal convictions, (2) has been in the country 18 years, (3) entered the United States without inspection, (4) has been living in Oakland, CA over the last 9 years, (5) is a widow and has not remarried, (6) has been living with her partner who is a co-defendant in the criminal matter, the father of the nine-year old, and \"verbally abusive and mistreats her,\" (7) has two sons who have no status, but one son is married to a U.S. citizen and they have started the process of legalization, (8) participated in a program that provides microloans to women in poor communities to help them start businesses, (9) sells tamales, (10) has had no contact with immigration authorities since her entry, and (11) has never failed to appear for any civil or criminal proceeding. (Dkt. No. 2 at 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Ortega intended to seek cancellation of removal given she had a qualifying relative, her U.S. citizen daughter, and has been in the United States for over 10 years continuously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:185-188.) Ms. Ortega's counsel further represented that Ms. Ortega is the primary caretaker of her daughter and her removal would result in \"an exceptional and unusual hardship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:191-192.) In regards to the child endangerment charges, Ms. Ortega submitted a probable cause declaration which showed \"no allegation of physical or verbal abuse against any child and the charges simply arose from the fact the child lived in a house where controlled substances were allegedly found.\" (Dkt. No. 1-2 \u00b6 15.) Ms. Ortega's counsel also informed the IJ that pursuant to California Government Code 7282.5, the Alameda County Sherriff's Office was prohibited from handing custody of Ms. Ortega over to ICE and that it violated this law when it cooperated with ICE. (Dkt. No. 2 at 10:194-197.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Ms. Ortega asked to be released on her own recognizance in light of the fact she had already been granted this relief by the Superior Court, or alternatively sought a $2000 bond, which would cause a substantial hardship on Ms. Ortega's family but given a recent tax return was an amount she was prepared to pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:191-212.) Ms. Ortega does not drive, does not own a car, and does not own any other property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:213-215.) The primary way Ms. Ortega spends her time is taking care of her daughter and staying at home making tamales to sell to her friends' co-workers and her son's boss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:215-218.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IJ determined at the hearing that Ms. Ortega was not a flight risk but requested that counsel provide oral argument on whether Ms. Ortega was a danger to the community. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:224-11:231.) Ms. Ortega's counsel stated that \"we considered ... putting [Ms. Ortega's daughter] on the stand to talk about how much time she spends with her mother ... that her mother is there when she wakes up\n   ... and when she goes to sleep ...\" but that Ms. Ortega's counsel did not \"want to particularly traumatize her any more than she's been traumatized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:234-239.) To that, the IJ responded \"tell us ... what was in the declaration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:240-242.) Ms. Ortega's counsel stated there is a concern regarding the child's safety since her mother is not there to care for and protect her, particularly in regards to the child's healthcare and schooling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:247-250.) The daughter was kept away from school because of a concern that her father may try to take her out of school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:252-257.) Further, the locks were changed after the child's father disappeared, displacing the child from her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11:191-192.) One week after Ms. Ortega's bond hearing, her partner was arrested and taken into criminal custody in Alameda County. (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 8 \u00b6 19.) The child is now is living with Ms. Ortega's older son and wife. (Dkt. No. 1-2 \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The IJ issued a written order on March 5, 2018. (Dkt. No. 6-1 at 21-22.) The IJ held that Ms. Ortega \"carries the burden of demonstrating: (1) she is not a danger to the community, and (2) she is not a flight risk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Citing\n   <em>\n    Matter of Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (BIA 2006), the IJ further held that \"there is no limitation on the discretionary factors that an Immigration Judge may consider when ruling on custody and bond issues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.) Thereafter the IJ concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on the totality of evidence of record, the court finds the respondent a danger to the community. She has been recently arrested for possession for sale of a controlled substance. The dangers that selling controlled substances cause a community, and society in general, cannot be easily overstated. The Board has long recognized the dangers associated with the sale and distribution of drugs. See\n   <em>\n    Matter of Melo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20883\">\n    21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 (BIA 1997) (noting that the scourge on society of illegal drug trafficking and the associated criminal activity it generates is, at this point, beyond dispute); see also,\n   <em>\n    Mahini v.

The danger is especially clear here in that the respondent lives with a young child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) The IJ determined that Ms. Ortega failed to establish she was not a danger to the community and denied her request for bond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Ms. Ortega's bond hearing the IJ went back on the record to conduct Ms. Ortega's removal proceeding; however, because Ms. Ortega had not been given notice and Ms. Ortega's counsel was not prepared to go forward Ms. Ortega asked for more time. (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 8 \u00b6 22.) Ms. Ortega's next removal proceeding was scheduled for March 28, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) That hearing was postponed to April 11, 2018 after Ms. Ortega's continuance was granted. (Dkt. No 6-1 at 2 \u00b6 9.) According to the Government, ICE has not received any requests to transfer Ms. Ortega to her criminal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 \u00b6 10.) The Government represents that \"if such a request were received, ICE will make diligent efforts to accommodate this type of request provided it was received sufficiently in advance of the criminal hearing, does not pose a security risk, and does not inadvertently delay the removal proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ms. Ortega filed her petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 2243 on March 14, 2018. (Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   No. 1.) Thereafter the Court issued an order to show cause as to why the petition should not be granted. (Dkt. No. 4.) The Government responded on April 11, 2018. (Dkt. No. 6.) Ms. Ortega filed a traverse on April 13, 2018. (Dkt. No. 8.) The Court held oral argument on April 17, 2018. At that hearing the Court expressed concern regarding its jurisdiction over the matter. Petitioner requested the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on that issue, which the Court granted. The Court ordered Petitioner to submit her brief by April 24, 2018 and Respondent to reply by May 1, 2018. (Dkt. No. 9.) Supplemental briefing is now complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Ortega has also filed a bond appeal with the BIA which is currently pending. (Dkt. No. 6-1 at 2 \u00b6 8.) Both parties' briefs were due to the BIA on April 23, 2018. (Dkt No. 6-1 at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Ortega argues that the IJ's reliance on her arrest to detain her violated due process. The Government responds that (1) the Court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ's discretionary decision to deny bond, (2) even if the Court finds jurisdiction Ms. Ortega has not exhausted administrative remedies, and (3) Ms. Ortega's petition does not state a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") authorizes the detention of aliens awaiting removal from the United States.

The IJ concluded Ms. Ortega is a danger to the community solely because she was\n   <em>\n    arrested\n   </em>\n   for possession for sale of a controlled substance. The IJ then went on to opine that the dangers to a community from the selling of controlled substances cannot be overstated. (Dkt. No. 1-2 at 14.) Thus, the IJ's dangerousness conclusion rested on his finding that she had sold drugs. The record, however, did not contain sufficient evidence to support such a finding. While Ms. Ortega had been arrested for selling drugs, no court or grand jury had determined that there is probable cause to believe she in fact had done so. And the Alameda County Sheriff's Office's Declaration does not include facts that support a finding that she sold drugs as opposed to a finding of Ms. Ortega being aware that her boyfriend at the time sold drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The two cases the IJ cited to support his decision concern individuals who were\n   <em>\n    convicted\n   </em>\n   of drug trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matter of Melo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20883\">\n    21 I. &amp; N.

Further, the Ninth Circuit has held that criminal history\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   can be insufficient to justify detention, particularly when \"a conviction could have occurred years ago, and the alien could well have led an entirely law-abiding life since then.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200052\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1196/#p1206\">\n    638 F.3d at 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The IJ may do so if the evidence supporting the charge is probative and specific.\n   <em>\n    Matter of Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Matter of Guerra\n   </em>\n   , for example, there was \"specific and detailed\" evidence in a criminal complaint of the detainee's alleged involvement in a drug trafficking scheme.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This evidence included the source of the information that the detainee was involved in drugs, the events leading to the detainee's arrest, \"including locations, alleged accomplices, and other details.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2037\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The evidence here, in contrast, is not that Ms. Ortega was involved in a drug trafficking scheme, as the IJ found, but rather that she was aware that her boyfriend was selling drugs, a boyfriend that is currently in custody. It thus violated due process for the IJ to find that she posed a danger to the community because she was engaged in the sale of drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons described above, Ms. Ortega's petition for habeas relief is GRANTED. The appropriate relief is a new bond hearing before an immigration judge that complies with due process. The hearing must be held within fifteen days from the issuance of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This Order disposes of Docket No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Section 1226(c) only applies to immigrants who fall \"into one of several enumerated categories involving criminal offenses and terrorist activities.\"\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/#p838\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 837\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Ms. Ortega has not been found guilty of any offense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
