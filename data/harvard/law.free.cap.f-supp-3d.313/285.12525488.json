BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-10\">In this action, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) challenges the purported Nonbank Charter Decision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Comptroller<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (collectively, the OCC). CSBS is a nationwide organization of state banking and financial services regulators from all fifty U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. Compl. \u00b6 13, Dkt. 1. The OCC is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and functions as the primary supervisor of banks with national charters. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 16; <em>see also</em> <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1</extracted-citation>, 26 - 27 (establishing the OCC and empowering it to grant national bank charters to entities that carry on \"the business of banking\").</p><p id=\"p-11\">Financial regulation in the United States is shared between federal and state governments. Compl. \u00b6 27. As a general matter, a bank may choose to pursue a state or national charter, and the bank will then be regulated primarily by the corresponding authority. <em><extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\"> \u00b6 21</extracted-citation>. Through the challenged Nonbank Charter Decision, the OCC allegedly decided to move forward with a process for considering national bank charter applications from companies that provide bank-like services but do not accept deposits, which have historically been regulated by the states. <em>See <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201\"> \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 5, 26</extracted-citation>.

National charters apply a uniform set of requirements to national charter recipients and exempt recipients from uneven state regulatory landscapes. Compl. \u00b6 23. Historically, the OCC has granted national charters only to banks that receive deposits or other special purpose banks specifically authorized by statute. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2027\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 27</extracted-citation> ; <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201841\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1841</extracted-citation>(c)(2)(D), (F) (authorizing trust banks, banker's banks, and credit card banks); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-46. Indeed, CSBS</p><p id=\"p-13\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"292\" href=\"#p292\" id=\"p292\">*292</a>does not allege that a single national charter has been granted to an entity that does not receive deposits, and the OCC confirms the same. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mem. at 14, Dkt. 9-2.</p><p id=\"p-14\">In 2003, the OCC promulgated a rule interpreting its chartering authority to include the power to charter a special purpose bank that limits its activities to \"any ... activities within the business of banking,\" provided that the special purpose bank conducts \"at least one of the following three core banking functions: Receiving deposits; paying checks; or lending money.\" <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">12 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.20</extracted-citation>(e)(1) ; <em>see</em> Rules, Policies, and Procedures for Corporate Activities; Bank Activities and Operations; Real Estate Lending and Appraisals, <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2070122\">68 Fed. Reg. 70122</extracted-citation> (Dec. 17, 2003) ; Compl. \u00b6 55. Under the rule, the OCC could charter a special purpose bank that does not receive deposits, so long as the bank pays checks or lends money. That may open the door (assuming other requirements are met) for a Fintech that does not accept deposits to acquire a national charter.</p><p id=\"p-15\">That particular aspect of the 2003 rule lay dormant for more than a decade. But in March 2016, the OCC announced through a white paper that it had begun to study the regulatory impacts of innovations in financial technology.

In a December 2016 speech, then-Comptroller Curry said that \"the OCC <em>will</em> move forward with chartering financial technology companies that offer bank products and services and meet our high standards and chartering requirements.\" Thomas J. Curry, Special Purpose National Bank Charters for Fintech Companies (Dec. 2, 2016), Dkt. 1-2 at 4 (emphasis in remarks as published on the OCC's website). According to Curry, \"I have asked staff to develop and implement a formal agency policy for evaluating applications for fintech charters. The policy, informed by the comments we receive on our [forthcoming] white paper, will articulate specific criteria for approval as well as issues that we should consider and conditions that should be met before granting such charters.\" <em>Id.</em> at 6.</p><p id=\"p-16\">Soon after, the OCC published a white paper that outlined general \"baseline\" supervisory requirements for charter holders. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Exploring Special Purpose National Bank Charters for Fintech Companies (Dec. 2016), Dkt. 1-3; <em>see also</em> Compl. \u00b6 56-57. This white paper solicited public feedback, and many parties registered objections. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 58-66.

CSBS asserts five claims: (1) the OCC does not have statutory authority for the Nonbank Charter Decision; (2) the OCC does not have statutory authority for a corresponding regulation; (3) the Nonbank Charter Decision failed to follow the appropriate rulemaking procedures; (4) the Nonbank Charter Decision was arbitrary and capricious; and (5) the Nonbank Charter Decision violated the Tenth Amendment. <em>See <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.20\"> \u00b6\u00b6 99-121</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-20\">Since CSBS filed its complaint, a number of developments have occurred. The OCC has undergone two leadership changes along with the changing presidential administrations, so Curry is no longer Comptroller: he was succeeded in May 2017 by Acting Comptroller Keith A. Noreika, who was then succeeded by the current Senate-confirmed Comptroller Joseph M. Otting. The OCC's new leadership suggested that, even if a Fintech attempted to apply, the OCC may not accept the application. In July 2017, for example, Acting Comptroller Noreika stated:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">[A]t this point the OCC has not determined whether it will actually accept or act upon applications from nondepository fintech companies for special purpose national bank charters that rely upon [ 12 C.F.R. 5.20(e)(1) ]. And, to be clear, we have not received, nor are we evaluating, any such applications from nondepository fintech companies. The OCC will continue to hold discussions with interested companies while we evaluate our options. These meetings have been very informative and provide insight into the financial landscape and the companies providing traditional banking services as they continue to evolve.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Keith A. Noreika, Public Remarks before the Exchequer Club (July 19, 2017), Dkt. 9-3 at 10. Also in the time since the complaint was filed, a similar lawsuit was filed against the OCC in the Southern District of New York by Maria Vullo, Superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services. <em>Vullo v.

Several contingent and speculative events must occur before the OCC charters a Fintech: (1) the OCC must decide to finalize a procedure for handling those applications; (2) a Fintech company must choose to apply for a charter; (3) the particular Fintech must substantively satisfy regulatory requirements; and (4) the OCC must decide to grant the charter to the particular Fintech. When the complaint was filed, not even the first step-finalized procedures-had occurred. <em>See</em> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"297\" href=\"#p297\" id=\"p297\">*297</a><em>Wheaton Coll. v.

Cir. 2012) (\"[S]tanding is assessed at the time of filing.\"). The draft supplement was a draft \"issue[d] for public comment\" and it \"explain[ed] how the OCC <em>would</em> evaluate applications from fintech companies\" in an \"<em>envisioned</em> application process.\" Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Summary of Comments and Explanatory Statement: Special Purpose National Bank Charters for Financial Technology Companies (Mar. 2017), Dkt. 1-6 at 3-4, 17 (emphasis added). And the second step-a Fintech's electing to apply-had not occurred, let alone the third or fourth. In fact, an aspiring Fintech that does not accept deposits plausibly could have attempted to apply for a charter anytime since the 2003 regulations took effect. And yet in the almost fifteen years between those regulations and the complaint, the OCC posits-and CSBS does not plead otherwise-that not one Fintech of the type described by the complaint has attempted to apply for a national charter. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mem. at 14.</p><p id=\"p-44\">This chain of speculative events that must take place before a CSBS member is injured fails to clear the bar posed by either the \"certainly impending\" test or the \"substantial risk\" test. The possibility of future injury is too attenuated and uncertain to be \"certainly impending.\" And CSBS does not allege in more than a conclusory fashion that its members suffer an injury from a \"substantial risk\" of harm, and CSBS certainly does not allege that any such risk \"may prompt [its members] to reasonably incur costs to mitigate or avoid that harm.\" <em>Clapper</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">568 U.S. at </extracted-citation>414 n.5, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p409\">133 S.Ct. 1138</extracted-citation>. Indeed, CSBS does not point to any expenditures or any other efforts taken by a member state to mitigate or avoid the alleged harm. <em>See</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 92-96. Furthermore, the present case is unlike the U.S. Supreme Court's recent application of the \"substantial risk\" test in <em>Susan B.

That case dealt with pre-enforcement review of a state statute prohibiting false statements during elections, not speculative infringement upon state regulations. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\"> at 2347</extracted-citation>. Moreover, the injury in that case was much less attenuated; the Court noted that the applicable commission likely \"handle[d] about 20 to 80 false statement complaints per year.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581581\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2334/#p2341\"> at 2345</extracted-citation> (quotation marks omitted). If the OCC had received 20 to 80 Fintech charter applications, then CSBS would have a much stronger argument for standing. But not a single Fintech has ever applied for a charter. Because it is not \"certainly impending\" that this chain of events will take place and the present situation does not expose CSBS to a \"substantial risk\" of harm, CSBS fails to establish injury in fact.</p><p id=\"p-45\">To resist this conclusion, CSBS seeks refuge in several cases that allow states to show regulatory injuries. Pl.'s Opp'n at 21-24, Dkt. 14. Ultimately, this effort is not persuasive because it cannot cure CSBS's lack of an imminent injury. CSBS argues that a state may sue the federal government when it alleges \"a judicially cognizable interest in the preservation of its own sovereignty, and a diminishment of that sovereignty by the alleged [federal] interference.\" <em>Bowen v.

In this way, the complaint runs afoul of the baseline requirement to identify a particular member of the organization that was injured.

And here the identification requirement serves an important gatekeeping role. It highlights the challenge of determining whether any particular state will be injured before a particular Fintech, if any, receives a charter. A national charter could injure Indiana without injuring Alaska, or vice versa. As it stands, the complaint does not equip the Court to decide which state to consider when evaluating standing, what role the CSBS member has in that state's regulatory system, or whether there are any Fintech companies within that state that are likely to receive a national charter. And the identification requirement ensures that the Court considers the likelihood of injury to individual members of the organization, thus preventing the organization from gaining standing by combining several alleged injuries that are inadequate separately.</p><p id=\"p-51\">In conclusion, a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has standing to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion. <em>Lujan</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">504 U.S. at 561</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">112 S.Ct. 2130</extracted-citation>.

In particular, this dispute will be sharpened if the OCC charters a particular Fintech-or decides to do so imminently. CSBS admits that Fintechs \"encompass any of a very broad array of technology-driven financial services providers ... that range from start-up ventures to well-established conglomerates.\" Compl. \u00b6 2. The term can include an \"almost unimaginably wide variety of services, from the traditional (<em>e.g.</em> , payment processing) to the more cutting edge (<em>e.g.</em> , crowd funding and digital currencies, such as bitcoins).\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344864,5871522\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/281/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> To address whether the OCC can issue Fintech charters may require the Court to imagine the \"unimaginably wide\" range of possible Fintechs, and to draw distinctions between them. Courts are ill-equipped to prospectively draw lines as to which hypothetical Fintechs, if any, may be chartered. While a court could readily consider the legality of awarding a charter to a particular Fintech, the current dispute does not present that question.</p><p id=\"p-59\">Moreover, CSBS asks the Court to review the agency's procedures. But, as discussed in Section III.A, any procedures that may lead to issuing a Fintech charter have not yet been finalized. Based on the record before the Court, the OCC's supplement to the chartering manual remains in draft form, awaiting subsequent updates. <em>See</em> Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Evaluating Charter Applications from Financial Technology Companies (Mar. 2017), Dkt 1-5; <em>see also</em> Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67, 76. And there are many other procedural hurdles to overcome before a charter could be granted. <em>See</em> Defs.' Mem. at 12-13 (explaining briefly some chartering procedures, such as application, public comment, analysis, and a conditional approval process, which are set forth in 12 C.F.R. Part 5). Any procedural review at this point would be piecemeal, potentially involving a new legal challenge every time the OCC</p><p id=\"p-60\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"301\" href=\"#p301\" id=\"p301\">*301</a>takes a step towards a result disfavored by a trade organization. In light of the recent leadership changes at the OCC, it is particularly speculative to guess whether the OCC will continue down paths considered by a previous Comptroller. The OCC may pursue similar ends through different regulatory means, or the OCC may choose not to move forward with a national charter program for Fintechs. Indeed, then-Acting Comptroller Noreika stated in July 2017 that \"the OCC has not determined whether it will actually accept or act upon applications from nondepository fintech companies\" and the OCC \"will continue to hold discussions with interested companies while we evaluate our options.\" Keith A. Noreika, Public Remarks before the Exchequer Club (July 19, 2017), Dkt. 9-3 at 10; <em>see also</em> <em>Wheaton Coll.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661360,3649335\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/551/\">703 F.3d at 552</extracted-citation> (assessing ripeness based in part on events that occurred after the filing of the complaint).

In particular, the dispute involves the interpretation of statutes entrusted to the OCC, and both parties brief the issue of <em>Chevron</em> deference.

If the OCC elects to adopt and apply a regulatory scheme to a particular Fintech charter, then the agency action will become sufficiently settled and courts will have a more concrete setting to resolve the legal disputes.

This argument is not persuasive when considered against the hardship to the OCC if each minor step towards a potential agency policy were litigated one-by-one as the policy becomes more settled.</p><p id=\"p-63\">For these reasons, the prudential ripeness doctrine counsels in favor of allowing time to sharpen this dispute before deciding it.
