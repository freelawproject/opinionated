The OCC has undergone two leadership changes along with the changing presidential administrations, so Curry is no longer Comptroller: he was succeeded in May 2017 by Acting Comptroller Keith A. Noreika, who was then succeeded by the current Senate-confirmed Comptroller Joseph M. Otting. The OCC's new leadership suggested that, even if a Fintech attempted to apply, the OCC may not accept the application. In July 2017, for example, Acting Comptroller Noreika stated:\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n       [A]t this point the OCC has not determined whether it will actually accept or act upon applications from nondepository fintech companies for special purpose national bank charters that rely upon [ 12 C.F.R. 5.20(e)(1) ]. And, to be clear, we have not received, nor are we evaluating, any such applications from nondepository fintech companies. The OCC will continue to hold discussions with interested companies while we evaluate our options. These meetings have been very informative and provide insight into the financial landscape and the companies providing traditional banking services as they continue to evolve.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-23\">\n       The OCC now moves to dismiss this action under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

And the second step-a Fintech's electing to apply-had not occurred, let alone the third or fourth. In fact, an aspiring Fintech that does not accept deposits plausibly could have attempted to apply for a charter anytime since the 2003 regulations took effect. And yet in the almost fifteen years between those regulations and the complaint, the OCC posits-and CSBS does not plead otherwise-that not one Fintech of the type described by the complaint has attempted to apply for a national charter.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Defs.'

If the OCC had received 20 to 80 Fintech charter applications, then CSBS would have a much stronger argument for standing. But not a single Fintech has ever applied for a charter.

And here the identification requirement serves an important gatekeeping role. It highlights the challenge of determining whether any particular state will be injured before a particular Fintech, if any, receives a charter. A national charter could injure Indiana without injuring Alaska, or vice versa. As it stands, the complaint does not equip the Court to decide which state to consider when evaluating standing, what role the CSBS member has in that state's regulatory system, or whether there are any Fintech companies within that state that are likely to receive a national charter. And the identification requirement ensures that the Court considers the likelihood of injury to individual members of the organization, thus preventing the organization from gaining standing by combining several alleged injuries that are inadequate separately.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-51\">\n       In conclusion, a plaintiff must demonstrate that it has standing to survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion.\n       <em>\n        Lujan\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n        504 U.S. at 561\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n        112 S.Ct. 2130\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

In particular, this dispute will be sharpened if the OCC charters a particular Fintech-or decides to do so imminently. CSBS admits that Fintechs \"encompass any of a very broad array of technology-driven financial services providers ... that range from start-up ventures to well-established conglomerates.\" Compl. \u00b6 2. The term can include an \"almost unimaginably wide variety of services, from the traditional (\n       <em>\n        e.g.\n       </em>\n       , payment processing) to the more cutting edge (\n       <em>\n        e.g.\n       </em>\n       , crowd funding and digital currencies, such as bitcoins).\"\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9344864,5871522\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/325/281/\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       To address whether the OCC can issue Fintech charters may require the Court to imagine the \"unimaginably wide\" range of possible Fintechs, and to draw distinctions between them. Courts are ill-equipped to prospectively draw lines as to which hypothetical Fintechs, if any, may be chartered. While a court could readily consider the legality of awarding a charter to a particular Fintech, the current dispute does not present that question.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-59\">\n       Moreover, CSBS asks the Court to review the agency's procedures. But, as discussed in Section III.A, any procedures that may lead to issuing a Fintech charter have not yet been finalized. Based on the record before the Court, the OCC's supplement to the chartering manual remains in draft form, awaiting subsequent updates.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Evaluating Charter Applications from Financial Technology Companies (Mar. 2017), Dkt 1-5;\n       <em>\n        see also\n       </em>\n       Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67, 76.

Mem. at 12-13 (explaining briefly some chartering procedures, such as application, public comment, analysis, and a conditional approval process, which are set forth in 12 C.F.R. Part 5). Any procedural review at this point would be piecemeal, potentially involving a new legal challenge every time the OCC\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-60\">\n       takes a step towards a result disfavored by a trade organization. In light of the recent leadership changes at the OCC, it is particularly speculative to guess whether the OCC will continue down paths considered by a previous Comptroller. The OCC may pursue similar ends through different regulatory means, or the OCC may choose not to move forward with a national charter program for Fintechs. Indeed, then-Acting Comptroller Noreika stated in July 2017 that \"the OCC has not determined whether it will actually accept or act upon applications from nondepository fintech companies\" and the OCC \"will continue to hold discussions with interested companies while we evaluate our options.\" Keith A.

In particular, the dispute involves the interpretation of statutes entrusted to the OCC, and both parties brief the issue of\n       <em>\n        Chevron\n       </em>\n       deference. And for that reason \"[i]t is more consistent with the conservation of judicial resources to make that deference-bound review after the agency has finalized its\n       <em>\n        application\n       </em>\n       of the relevant statutory text.\"\n       <em>\n        Am.

If the OCC elects to adopt and apply a regulatory scheme to a particular Fintech charter, then the agency action will become sufficiently settled and courts will have a more concrete setting to resolve the legal disputes. In these ways, the dispute is not yet fit for judicial decision.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Am.
