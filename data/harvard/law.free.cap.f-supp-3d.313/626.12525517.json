Both parties initiated litigation in Pennsylvania state court, and then seemingly reached an agreement resolving the matter in the form of a memorandum of understanding. A dispute quickly broke out as to whether the agreement was self-executing. This led one partner to amend his complaint in his state case, and the other partner to file a separate action in federal court in New York, which included trademark claims based upon rights allegedly conferred by the parties' agreement. The first partner promptly amended his state court action again to assert trademark claims there as well, and the case was then removed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With litigation now pending in two federal district courts-here and in the Southern District of New York-I have before me a motion to dismiss, stay, or transfer this case to New York under the \"first-filed rule\" and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and to dismiss on several related grounds. For practical purposes, the controlling issue is whether the date an action was commenced in state court is properly considered in determining which action was first-filed, as opposed to a rule that only federal filings count. Because I am persuaded that state filings should be considered, and because these cases arise from an integrated dispute, I will deny the motion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background: The Disagreement and Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Carl Monzo, a Pennsylvanian, and Defendant Andrew Bazos, a resident of Connecticut, both run businesses that provide medical services for professional sporting events, music festivals, and other large events. Monzo's businesses are Pennsylvania-based while Bazos's operate in the\n   New York City region. In 2015, the two entered a Shareholders' Agreement to merge their respective medical services businesses to form \"CrowdRx, Inc., a Pennsylvania Corporation\" [hereinafter \"CrowdRx-Pa\"]. Under the agreement, Monzo and Bazos wholly owned the corporation in equal shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The partnership soon faltered, and by early 2016 Monzo and Bazos had filed complaints against each other in Pennsylvania state court-the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas-asserting various state and common law claims based on their Shareholders' Agreement and seeking emergency injunctive relief. Monzo's allegations included that Bazos \"failed to forward revenues generated by New York events [Bazos] controlled to [CrowdRx-Pa],\" removed information related to Monzo from the CrowdRx-Pa website, and locked Monzo out of the company's Google Docs account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15, 28-30,\n   <em>\n    Monzo v. Bazos\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-3179 (Del. Cnty. Ct. Comm. Pl. 2016). To resolve Monzo's emergency motion, the parties stipulated on May 10, 2016 \"not to unilaterally change the content of the website\" or to access the Google Docs account unless the parties agreed in advance by email. Stip. 55, ECF No. 6-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 10, 2016, with both state cases still pending, Monzo and Bazos signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) setting out a division of CrowdRx-Pa's assets and clients \"as of the Effective Date\"-a phrase that has turned out to be crucial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If and when the MOU went into effect, Bazos would own the CrowdRx trademark, website, and exclusive rights to several clients, including Mysteryland and Electric Zoo (two music festivals). Monzo, in turn, would have exclusive rights to his own roster of clients but would no longer own CrowdRx-Pa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bazos proceeded as though the MOU had already taken effect. In December 2016, he blocked Monzo and his employees from accessing the CrowdRx-Pa email server and removed all mention of Monzo from its website. In response, Monzo filed an Amended Complaint in his Delaware County case, again seeking emergency relief. He alleged that Bazos's actions violated the Shareholders' Agreement, the Stipulation, the MOU, and common law duties. Two weeks later, Bazos filed in the Southern District of New York (\"S.D.N.Y.\") alleging trademark and unfair competition claims under federal and New York laws. S.D.N.Y. Compl., ECF No. 6-1. Monzo later amended his complaint in the Delaware County case (the \"Second Amended Complaint\") to include his own trademark claims and to seek declaratory judgment and indemnification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most recently, after filing his own case in New York, Bazos removed Monzo's Delaware County case to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Disagreement over the meaning of at least two paragraphs in the MOU-\"Termination of Relationship\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"Definitive\n   Documents\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -forms the central dispute in this and the S.D.N.Y case. Monzo asserts that the MOU was not self-executing because it would take effect only if and when the definitive documents were signed, which they were not. Bazos argues that the MOU was self-executing such that CrowdRx-Pa had already \"ceased operationally and financially\" and that he owned the trademark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant Bazos moves to dismiss, stay, or transfer this case to the S.D.N.Y.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on the first-filed rule, which holds that, when two cases are pending in federal courts, the first-filed case should generally be the one to proceed. Alternatively, Bazos seeks a transfer under 28 U.S.C. Section 1404(a). He also seeks dismissal on several other grounds, many of them contingent on the assertion that CrowdRx-Pa no longer exists:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(7) for failure to join an indispensable party (CrowdRx-NY) pursuant to Rule 19;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 under Rule 12(e) for lack of factual specificity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for failure to state a claim for declaratory judgment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 under Rule 23.1 for failure to state a claim for a derivative action;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) for improper venue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties' briefing focuses primarily on the first-filed rule and I will do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As I recently discussed in\n   <em>\n    Landau\n   </em>\n   , two interpretations have emerged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Some courts take a narrow view of the first-filed rule and apply it only when the parties and claims in the later-filed suit are a 'mirror image' of the first. Others have embraced a broader, close-enough-for-government-work approach to the rule and applied it to 'disputes involving similar, concurrent actions.' According to proponents of the broader approach, the 'substantive touchstone of the first-to-file inquiry is subject matter,' rather than identity of legal claims or parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418336\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/329/#p333\">\n    274 F.Supp.3d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). I attempted to reconcile these interpretations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]here are two distinct scenarios where the [first-filed] rule has been applied. The first-filed rule started with cases ... where earlier- and later-filed actions involved the same parties and arose out of the same transaction, agreement, or encounter. Only later was it extended to cases that were not truly related but raised similar issues. In cases where two actions arise out of an integrated dispute, transfer, stay, or dismissal of the later-filed action should be required in the absence of exceptional circumstances.... Such cases are genuinely related, in the technical sense, making transfer (where it is sought) an obvious remedy. As a matter of simple logic, however, the rule does not carry the same force when (1) different parties are involved, (2) the underlying dispute involves similar but not identical issues, and (3) the controlling law is from different jurisdictions. Any relationship between such cases is necessarily more attenuated. Faced with that scenario, courts import \u00a7 1404 [governing Change of Venue] into the analysis, implicitly recognizing the weakness of the relationship between cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In my view, clarity is served by explicitly recognizing a two-tiered approach to the first-filed rule. In truly related cases, transfer to the jurisdiction with the first-filed case should be presumed. Otherwise, the existence of an earlier-filed case that is similar, but not identical, should be a relevant, but not controlling, factor to consider as part of \u00a7 1404 transfer analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418336\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/329/#p333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418336\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/329/#p333\">\n    at 333-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This case raises an additional threshold question under the first-filed rule: in deciding which case was filed first, should courts credit the date a case was filed in state court, or the date it was removed to federal court?

Nearly all of the claims here and in the S.D.N.Y. case hinge on the same substantive questions of contract interpretation: did (and do) either party's actions relating to CrowdRx-Pa violate the MOU or the Shareholders' Agreement? If the MOU was self-executing, it supersedes all previous written agreements, including the Shareholders' Agreement, and Bazos is now the sole owner of the CrowdRx trademark, website, and certain assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MOU 2.

To allow two federal courts to expend time and resources resolving this single question would be wasteful and inefficient, and create the possibility of conflicting results.

Pa. 2013). Here, Monzo, on behalf of himself and \"CrowdRx, Inc.,\" sued Bazos as an individual. In the S.D.N.Y. action, Bazos brings claims as \"CrowdRx, Inc., a New York Corporation\" against Monzo and three entities wholly under Monzo's control. If a former employee can stand in for a company for purposes of the first-filed rule, surely the current, sole owner of a company can stand in for the company and vice versa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D &amp; L Distrib.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833455\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/959/757/#p769\">\n    959 F.Supp.2d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The argument is further belied by the MOU, which describes Monzo and the companies he owns (the same three Bazos names in the S.D.N.Y. action) as \"the Monzo Parties,\" and refers to Bazos and \"CrowdRx NY\" as the \"Bazos Parties.\" MOU at 1. There is no dispute\n   over this portion of the MOU, which reinforces the obvious-that these cases are, at base, the same two men (Monzo and Bazos) suing each other. To distinguish the cases based on party names would be unsupported by case law, and would place form over substance in contravention of the goals of the first-filed rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Under the rule, this action is the first-filed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As explained above, I hold that Monzo's prior filing in state court, rather than the date on which Bazos removed it to this Court, is relevant for the first-filed rule analysis. Perhaps anticipating such a ruling, Bazos correctly points out that Monzo did not add his trademark claims to the state action until after Bazos filed the S.D.N.Y. action. Mot. Dismiss 5, 7 n.6. Bazos seems to imply that, when Monzo's case was initially filed, it was not substantially similar to Bazos's (later-filed) S.D.N.Y. case. While it is true that Monzo's most recent amendment created greater overlap between the claims made in the two cases, it did not mark the moment at which the two cases became related. Rather, by January 25, 2017-after the MOU was signed and well before Bazos filed in New York-Monzo had placed the MOU (and its interpretation) squarely at issue in the state case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Del.

But looking beyond the arguments to the facts alleged and evidence presented, I see no suggestion of gamesmanship, forum shopping, or bad faith by Monzo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1792487\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/850/969/#p971\">\n    850 F.2d at 976-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dismiss 15-16 (\"Monzo has also agreed that CrowdRx-Pa ceased to operate as of March 31, 2016 and that it no longer has any customers since the customers have been divvied up between the principals.\"). Monzo, of course, disputes this.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. 5-6 (\"[CrowdRx-Pa] continues as an operating entity in order to service [its] contractual obligations.\"). As discussed above, the status and ownership of CrowdRx-Pa, as determined by the interpretation of the MOU, is the crux of both pending cases. Bazos thus asks the Court to dismiss Monzo's Complaint by assuming the key issue has already been decided in Bazos's favor. I must decline to do so\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   and accordingly deny Bazos's request for transfer under Section 1404, and his motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, lack of factual specificity, and improper venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Bazos has not shown that CrowdRx-NY is a required party under Rule 19\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I am likewise not persuaded that, in choosing to name Bazos as a defendant, and not Bazos's company, CrowdRx-NY, Monzo has failed to name a required party under Rule 19(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Dismiss 14. Rule 12(b)(7) provides for dismissal for failure to join a \"required party,\" as outlined Rule 19(a).

It appears that subparagraph (a)(1)(A) might be relevant-it requires joinder, where feasible, of any party without whom \"the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties.\" But \"the Rule 19(a)(1) inquiry is limited to whether the district court can grant complete relief to the persons already parties to the action\" and \"[t]he effect a decision may have on the absent party is not material.\"\n   <em>\n    Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc. v.

The gist of the ... New York action is ownership and infringement of a federally registered trademark brought by the registered trademark owner. Likewise, the gravamen of this case is ownership and infringement of a purported trade dress that includes the very same trademark\" and \"both cases involve the subsequent termination of [CrowdRx-Pa] and issues regarding the interpretation and enforcement of the MOU.\" Def.'s Mot.

Because I now hold that Monzo's case was first-filed, this argument is irrelevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    I cannot reconcile these facts with Plaintiff Monzo's assertion that Bazos's trademark claims \"in the New Yrok [sic] action do not relate to breaches of the Shareholder's Agreement, the MOU or the duties owed by Bazos.\" Pl.'s Resp. 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Unlike the other claims, which turn on whether the MOU was self-executing, this claim will require the Court to determine whether Bazos misrepresented his relationship with these clients in the MOU.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Am.

Therefore, even if the MOU were self-executing, it apparently would not resolve the question of liabilities like the Sky Medical litigation (and any indemnification for it), which seems to have existed at the time the MOU was signed. I will not attempt to further dissect Monzo's indemnification claim at this stage. I instead hold that, to the extent that the indemnification claim arises from questions different from those that underlie the other claims, the cases remain genuinely related.
