That coach subsequently spoke to two of the involved players and to other Baylor football coaches, but allegedly took no further action.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51).

The Supreme Court has held that sexual harassment within a school or school program is a form of sex discrimination when the harassment is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprives the victim of educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    526 U.S. at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p639\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This framework for liability in sexual harassment cases ultimately serves as a proxy for the showing of intentional discrimination that is otherwise required for Title IX claims.

The doctrine of equitable estoppel, for example, tolls the statute of limitations when a defendant conceals material facts from a party without knowledge of those facts.\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Higgins of Tex., Inc. v.

Specifically, the doctrine requires \"(1) a false representation or concealment of material facts; (2) made with knowledge, actual or constructive, of those facts; (3) with the intention that it should be acted on; (4) to a party without knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the facts; (5) who detrimentally relies on the representations.\"\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that her post-reporting claims did not accrue until Pepper Hamilton's recommendations and findings of fact were released in May 2016. (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 137-39). Baylor argues that Plaintiff's alleged claims accrued well before that date. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 9, at 10-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' filings and relevant law, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's claims accrued, at the latest, in May 2013. Plaintiff knew of her alleged post-reporting injuries, including her continuing subjection to harassment, in 2012 and 2013. She also knew that Baylor had failed to intervene. Further, because she notified Baylor of her assault, Plaintiff knew the university had actual knowledge of her assault and her continued exposure to a hostile environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King-White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347312\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/754/#p759\">\n    803 F.3d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] claim accrues ... the moment the plaintiff becomes aware that he has suffered an injury or has sufficient information to know that [s]he has been injured.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, even if her post-reporting claims had accrued by 2013, they should be tolled. Making reference to the doctrines of fraudulent concealment and equitable tolling, she asserts that her post-reporting claims are \"based on Baylor's affirmative involvement in manipulating and misinforming Plaintiff of her rights or lack thereof, discouraging Plaintiff from taking further action with respect to the sexual assault, and concealing Baylor football players' and school officials' misconduct with respect to Plaintiff's sexual assault.\" (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 137-39). According to Plaintiff, she therefore could not have known of her injuries prior to the release of the Pepper Hamilton materials discussed above. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 137-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Fraudulent concealment is based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and Plaintiff uses the same alleged facts in support of both arguments. The Court will therefore consider the application of equitable estoppel and fraudulent concealment together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    B. Mahler Interests, L.P. v. DMAC Constr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175989\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/503/43/#p60\">\n    503 S.W.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2016, no pet.) (\"Because fraudulent concealment is based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and because [the plaintiff's] equitable estoppel and fraudulent concealment defenses are based on the same alleged conduct by [the defendant], we consider them together.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Baylor \"manipulate[ed] and misinform[ed] Plaintiff of her rights or lack thereof.\" (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6 137). Even accepting this as true, whether Baylor misinformed Plaintiff of her rights is not the question. Equitable estoppel and fraudulent concealment required the false representation or concealment of material facts.\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9983454\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/813/483/#p489\">\n    813 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   489 ;\n   <em>\n    KPMG Peat Marwick v.

Plaintiff knew the facts underlying any post-reporting claims specific to her experience by 2012 or, at latest, 2013. She knew she had been assaulted. She knew she had reported the assaults and that, according to her complaint, Baylor had done nothing in response. She knew of her ongoing harassment at the hands of Baylor football players.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Knowledge of such facts is in law equivalent to knowledge of the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Borderlon v.

Applying applicable state law, then, the Court concludes that Plaintiff may not avail herself of either fraudulent concealment or equitable estoppel. Any post-reporting claims specific to her own experience are time-barred and must therefore be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Corp. v.

App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, pet. denied) (\"Appellees' 'deceit,' if any, did not conceal these facts underlying [the plaintiff's] causes of action; therefore, we determine that [the plaintiff] did not raise a fact issue regarding the doctrine of fraudulent concealment.\"). With respect to any individual post-reporting claims, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CLAIM FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff seeks a permanent injunction ordering Baylor to (1) \"refrain from unlawful discrimination and/or retaliation\"; (2) \"undertake and rectify any and all Title IX violations and/or inequities\"; (3) \"refrain from creating and condoning a hostile sexual harassment and/or discriminati[ng] environment against individuals on the basis of sex by immediately ceasing deliberate indifference to sexual assaults\"; and (4) \"cease interference with the disciplinary process in favor of students who were charged with sexual assault.\" (Compl., Dkt. 1, \u00b6 145). Baylor argues that Plaintiff, who is no longer a student at Baylor, lacks standing to bring a claim for injunctive relief. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 9, at 16). Plaintiff, despite filing a response to Baylor's Motion to Dismiss, did not refute Baylor's arguments regarding her claim for injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp., Dkt. 13). With respect to Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss is therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    V. LEAVE TO AMEND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiff, in cursory fashion, argues that she should be entitled to amend her complaint. (Resp., Dkt. 13, at 15). The Court disagrees. As Plaintiff notes, there is a strong presumption in favor of allowing amendment rather than dismissal, and \"[l]eave to amend should be freely granted when justice requires.\"\n   <em>\n    Fin. Acquisition Partners, L.P. v.

P. 15(a)(1) (providing that a party may amend her pleading once as a matter of course within 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b) ). Moreover, because Baylor's motion concerns only those claims that are barred by the statute of limitations or for which Plaintiff does not have standing to bring, it is not possible for Plaintiff to allege additional facts that would alter the Court's conclusion regarding their viability. Amendment would be futile, and Plaintiff's request should be denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stripling v. Jordan Prod.
