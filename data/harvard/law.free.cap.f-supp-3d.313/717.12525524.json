Finally, Rule 26(c)(1) requires a certification that the moving party has conferred or attempted to confer in good faith with the other affected party to attempt to resolve the issue without the court's interference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plaintiffs in the action filed the instant motion because Plaintiff's counsel received a video recording of defendant Jack Allen allegedly \"spreading false, defamatory information\" with respect to the litigation and Plaintiff's counsel that is meant to deter potential plaintiffs from joining the litigation. Plaintiff's counsel states that on April 11, 2018 he received a video from an opt-in plaintiff taken of Defendant Allen, the plaintiff, and two other individuals, including a potential opt-in plaintiff who withdrew, in which Allen allegedly says it would be foolish to join the litigation, threatens retaliation, misstates contingency fees, says Plaintiff's counsel is taking advantage of his clients, and threatens to fire the potential opt-in Plaintiff. R. Doc. 60-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the FLSA's remedial purpose would be thwarted if employers were permitted to threaten employees and the purpose of aggregating claims would also be defeated if attempts to intimate potential plaintiffs is not halted. Plaintiffs argue that courts misrepresenting the status of an action or its details can impact justice, undermine the class members' confidence in counsel, and undermine the collective action and therefore a protective order is appropriate. Further, Plaintiff argues that the FLSA makes it illegal for an employer to retaliate against a plaintiff for exercising rights under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that Allen's actions are an attempt to dissuade litigation, which has succeeded as one person has withdrawn from the suit after opting in, and threats of retaliation requiring an order from the Court. They seek a protective order narrowly tailored to address Allen's behavior that would not run afoul of any protected speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendants oppose the motion. R. Doc. 63. They argue that apart from counsel's statement that the recording was taken by Erick Quintanilla sometime in August 2017 the video lacks any indicia of what it purports to be, there is no declaration by Mr. Quintanilla setting forth the date, the person who made the recording, whether they were a party to the conversation, or whether there was consent to record the conversation, to whom the conversation is occurring, events leading up to the conversation, what device it was on, and whether it was edited. Further, they argue it is difficult to hear what is being said and there is no certified transcript. They state the video is a \"clandestinely-recorded, unauthenticated video.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants state that setting aside any authenticity issues they do not object to a narrowly tailored protective order prohibiting Allen or his representatives, exclusive of counsel, from contacting or discussion litigation with any class member or potential class members outside of the litigation process through the end of the opt-in period. Defendants argue that the First\n   Amendment necessitates the order not include counsel, exclude discovery, and be limited to the opt-in period. Further, they argue attorney's fees are not warranted. They state the request in the motion is different than in the memorandum in support of the motion, which is overly broad as it would prevent the discovery with respect to potential class members. Defendants argue the order should be limited as the timing of the video shows there has been no attempt to thwart conditional certification, approved notice or notice procedure, and that there is no impact from the defendants' allegedly speaking with class members because the individual who recorded the conversation opted into the lawsuit and the mere possibility of abuses does not justify a ban on communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to the Defendants, the law requires that an order limiting communications should be based on a clear record and specific findings that reflect a weighing of need for such a limitation and should be carefully drawn that limits speech as much as possible. Further, they argue that mere statements by counsel is not evidence to support a protective order. They state the First Amendment requires a limited order such that is not inhibit business communications, relationships, or prohibit discovery, depositions, and a right to interview witnesses. Defendants argue that any language in the order with respect to retaliation is superfluous as the notice issued in the case includes language about retaliatory conduct and there is no indication that the notice regarding retaliation has been ineffective. Finally, Defendants argue that fees are not warranted as Plaintiffs' counsel did not confer in good faith prior to filing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the Defendants' cite to La. R.S \u00a7 15:1303 as argument that the video may be unlawfully recorded and no evidence has been presented it was lawfully recorded. The reliance on the Electronic Surveillance Act is misplaced. Under that statute there is no violation of the use and disclosure provision unless \"there is first a violation of the interception provision.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9115587\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/848/650/#p652\">\n    848 So.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652 (La. App. 4 Cir. 5/21/03). The Louisiana Court held that there can be no interception violation unless the circumstances justified an expectation of privacy. Lawful presence and recording of a conversation in a place where the hearer has a right to be, can hear unaided by the mechanical device, and where the device cannot record more than hearer could unaided does not violate an expectation of privacy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9115587\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/848/650/#p652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9115587\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/848/650/#p652\">\n    at 654-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, the instant video appears to have been recorded in public with people around such that the speaker had no reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore that the interception aspect of the statute could not have been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, while arguing that the video is unauthenticated, counsel does seem to admit that it is a video of Defendant Allen, nor did they dispute it was him at oral argument. The Defendants have agreed that a limited protective order is acceptable both in their opposition as well as during oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Third, courts have the authority to govern the conduct of counsel and parties in \u00a7 216(b) collective actions, just as they do in Rule 23 class actions.\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. v.
