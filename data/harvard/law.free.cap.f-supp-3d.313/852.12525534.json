MURPHY, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are minor children who attend, or attended, public schools in Detroit. They have alleged that the conditions of their schools are so poor, and so inadequate, that they have not received even a minimally adequate education. Specifically, they alleged they have been denied access to literacy on account of their races, in violation of their rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution. They brought suit against the Michigan state officials they believe to be responsible. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint, principally because they believe Plaintiffs sued the wrong parties. Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs' alleged harm is not cognizable under the Constitution. Many amici weighed in on the matter and the Court held a hearing. For the reasons below, the\n   Court must grant the motion and dismiss the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court may grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss if the complaint fails to allege facts \"sufficient 'to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,' and to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hensley Mfg. v.

First, they insist that they cannot be sued. According to Defendants, the State of Michigan and its officials never operated Plaintiffs' schools, so they are the wrong parties to enjoin. Moreover, Defendants contend that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. Second, Defendants argue that access to literacy is not a constitutionally protected right, so the failure to provide such access cannot constitute a valid claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Const. art. 8, \u00a7 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The constitution further states that \"[l]eadership and general supervision over all public education...is vested in a state board of education.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Michigan's legislature exercised its constitutional obligations by passing and periodically updating the Revised School Code.

Michigan's Successive Public Acts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Circumstances sometime require more state involvement-especially when those circumstances involve finances. Over the last few decades, Michigan enacted several statutory schemes permitting state officials to appoint managers in the event of financial crises.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Phillips v.

Michigan used those mechanisms to intervene in Detroit public schools more than once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 1999, Public Act 10 went into effect. The Act required Detroit's mayor to appoint a \"school reform board\" charged with appointing a chief executive officer. Act of March 26, 1999, \u00a7\u00a7 372(1), 374(1). The reform board was initially composed of seven members: six appointed by Detroit's mayor, and the seventh appointed by \"the superintendent of public instruction or his or her designee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354599\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/707/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 372(2)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After five years, the mayor would gain the power to appoint the seventh member as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354599\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/707/#p711\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The arrangement ended in 2004, however, when a voter referendum returned governance of Detroit Schools to a locally elected board. ECF 1, PgID 51, \u00b6 69; ECF 60, PgID 506.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 2008, the state again became involved. Plaintiffs assert that the Governor \"invoked Public Act 72 to appoint an Emergency Financial Manager\" for Detroit Public Schools. ECF 1, PgID 51, \u00b6 69. Public Act 72, also known as the \"Local Government Fiscal Responsibility Act,\" went into effect in 1990 and has since been repealed. But in 2008, it required the Governor to appoint an emergency financial manager for the district if certain financial conditions in a school district occurred.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20141.1238\">\n    Mich.

Although the Complaint does not go into further detail, the characterization is consistent with the broad powers granted to the manager under the Act.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.1240\">\n    Mich.

That year, Michigan repealed Public Act 72 and replaced it with Public Act 4, the \"Local Government and School District Fiscal Accountability Act.\" Public Act 4 did not last long-Michigan voters rejected it by referendum the following year-but the legislature soon replaced it with the very similar Public Act 436, which remains in effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20141.1541\">\n    Mich.

Indeed, Public Act 10 went into effect before any of the Plaintiffs were of school age, and in most cases, before they were even born. There likewise is no question that Michigan law imbues the emergency managers-under any of their various legal descriptions-with significant power and authority to conduct the affairs of Detroit schools.

As the Court explained above, however, those parties were responsible for the selection and appointment of the emergency managers.

At each step, courts affirmed the legality of the State's interventions. Now, facing the deplorable conditions alleged in the Complaint, Detroit students seek to hold someone responsible. They have adequately pled that state actors effectively control the schools, at least in part, and are therefore proper parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Argument Defined\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Before the Court proceeds further, one point is in order. The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs are asserting a right to literacy or a right of\n   <em>\n    access\n   </em>\n   to literacy. Defendants assert that Plaintiffs initially argued that Defendants denied them the right to \"literacy\" but then changed course and asserted a right to \"access to literacy.\" ECF 96, PgID 1854. Defendants are incorrect: from the beginning of the case, Plaintiffs couched the claim in terms of the right to \"access to literacy.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, 6-9, 19-20. And that phrasing makes a difference here. Literacy is of course an outcome of education, whereas \"access to literacy\" speaks to an opportunity; and an opportunity is precisely what the Plaintiffs describe.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.1549\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20141.1549\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35, 47, 57, 61, 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.

The proper inquiry is therefore whether Plaintiffs have identified anything Defendants have done or are affirmatively doing to either (1) violate Plaintiffs' alleged substantive right of access to literacy or (2) deny Plaintiffs access to literacy while granting it to others similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Constitution limits federal courts' jurisdiction to cases and controversies.

Defendants raise standing arguments based on all three requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A. Injury in Fact\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not demonstrated an invasion of any legally protected interest. In support, they suggest that \"federal courts have never deemed literacy to be a legally protected interest.\" ECF 60, PgID 512. In addition, they maintain that Plaintiffs \"have not shown an injury that is concrete and particularized, or even actual or imminent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants' first argument is premature. The Court discusses\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   whether access to literacy is a fundamental right. At the standing stage, however, the Court must consider the more general claim that Defendants violated Plaintiffs' due process rights.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Initiative &amp; Referendum Inst. v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/#p1092\">\n    450 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1092 (10th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (\"For purposes of standing, the question cannot be whether the Constitution, properly interpreted, extends protection to the plaintiff's asserted right or interest. If that were the test, every losing claim would be dismissed for want of standing.\"). Plainly, a plaintiff who alleges a violation of his right to due process states a legally protected interest, and Plaintiffs have done so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Still, Defendants posit that the Complaint amounts only to a \"generalized grievance\" and fails \"to identify anything Defendants are affirmatively doing to violate [Plaintiffs'] alleged right to literacy.\" ECF 60, PgID 513. Accordingly, they conclude that Plaintiffs have not pled a violation that is concrete, particular, actual, or imminent. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs allege that their school buildings, unlike those of other Michigan students, are replete with conditions \"that make learning nearly impossible,\" and identify them with specific photographic allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 119-37. They allege that their schools, unlike other Michigan students', lack enough teachers to hold classes in which they would learn to read.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 144-54. They allege that, unlike other Michigan students, they lack books necessary to attain literacy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79, 103-04, 107, 113-15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those are concrete, particular, actual injuries that satisfy the standing requirement under both the Due Process claim and the Equal Protection claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B. Traceability\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Traceability is also satisfied. Defendants rightly point out that Plaintiffs\n   must allege \"which allegations apply to which defendant,\" ECF 60, PgID 481, and Plaintiffs have done so. Although the Complaint principally refers to actions (and inactions) of \"the State,\" it also plainly lays out each Defendant's position in the State government and how that position relates to the operation of Detroit schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 28-32. For example, in paragraph 73, Plaintiffs allege that \"the State has appointed four emergency managers and one transition manager since 2009 without regard to whether any of these individuals possessed professional competence or experience in the area of K-12 education.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. As alleged in the Complaint and further explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Governor selects a school district's emergency manager based upon a list provided by the State's Board of Education and Superintendent of Public Instruction, all of whom are defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-51. In paragraph 70, Plaintiffs allege that the \"SRO is charged with creating the necessary conditions for sustainable and positive student outcomes\" and failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52 (quotation marks and alteration omitted). The paragraph notes that the SRO (who is a Defendant) has been within the purview of both the Department of Education and the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget (the directors of both are defendants).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And paragraph 65 notes that under Michigan law, the State School Board has supervisory powers over public school districts and charter schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 49. Traceability is therefore satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   C. Causality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Complaint also provides the necessary description of a causal chain. As pled, Defendants are the parties \"responsible for the education of all Michigan public school students and for the system of Michigan public schools\" as well as being \"particular[ly] responsibl[e] for the schools in Detroit\" due to the State's interventions.

That case revolved around several Michigan laws that split Detroit Public Schools into two entities: the Qualifying School District (which is responsible for collecting taxes and discharging debts) and the Community District (which oversees the day-to-day operations of the schools). The plaintiffs made two principal claims: (1) the procedure used to pass the laws violated the Michigan Constitution so the laws were unenforceable, and (2) the laws violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution because they permitted uncertified teachers to teach in the Detroit schools while every other Michigan district\n   required certified teachers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 60-10, PgID 1313.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court of Claims dismissed both claims, but for different reasons.

And the court dismissed the equal-protection claim because it was not ripe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1316.

Moreover, the plaintiffs sued only Governor Snyder, who, the court pointed out, would not be involved in any future hiring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court opined, \"it would appear that the 'appropriate official' is or will be a local official\" of the newly formed school district, but this observation was not part of the court's holding.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Despite an overlap of topics, the reasoning and ruling in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   does not implicate\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   .

Plaintiffs' theory emerges from those precedents, so the cases merit some description here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   A. A Short History of the Supreme Court's Right-to-Education Cases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   concerned a state education funding mechanism. Beginning in the 1940s, Texas took a two-stage approach to funding its public school districts. A statewide fund provided about one-half of each district's budget. Local governments could then choose the taxation methods for raising the rest of the money. Most districts used local property taxes to pay for education, but in districts with higher property values, schools were funded at significantly higher rates than other districts. Students from one of the lowest-funded districts, therefore, claimed the funding scheme violated the Equal Protection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Supreme Court disagreed. First, the Court determined that rational-basis review-and not strict scrutiny-governed its analysis because education is not a fundamental right and because wealth is not a suspect classification.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    411 U.S. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then, the Court reaffirmed that the state had a legitimate interest in conferring to local governments the power and flexibility to devise their own taxation schemes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore concluded that the state's school funding system was rationally related to that interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court also made a few significant distinctions. It explained that \"[t]he argument here is not that the children in districts having relatively low assessable property values are receiving no public education; rather, it is that they are receiving a poorer quality education than that available to children in districts having more assessable wealth.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    411 U.S. at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it noted that \"[n]o scheme of taxation, whether the tax is imposed on property, income, or purchases of goods and services, has yet been devised which is free of all discriminatory impact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court again recognized that education is not a fundamental right and also held that undocumented aliens (and their children) are not a suspect class.

In 1817, the federal government granted land to the then-new state of Mississippi. The federal government had already divided the land into townships, and a portion of each township was to be set aside for schools. Granted land reserved for the Chickasaw Tribe also contained a portion to be set aside for schools. But the State sold the land for the Chickasaw schools and lost the ensuing funds through a failed investment. From then on, the State paid interest on the money it lost at a statutorily fixed rate. By 1984, Mississippi schools received their funding, in part, based on the revenues from their townships' granted lands or-in the case of the Chickasaw-the State's interest payments. But the revenues from the lands greatly exceeded the interest payments, which meant that the Chickasaw school districts received substantially less funding: $0.63 per Chickasaw pupil versus $75.34 per pupil in the rest of the state. Ultimately, the Court remanded the case and framed the question like this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Given that the State has title to assets granted to it by the Federal Government for the use of the State's schools, does the Equal Protection Clause permit it to distribute the benefit of these assets unequally among the school districts as it now does?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p289\">\n    at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p289\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   also made two important observations.

The Applicability of the Education Cases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Defendants contend that the foregoing line of cases compels the Court to grant their motion. In their view, the right to literacy-or the right of\n   <em>\n    access\n   </em>\n   to literacy-are foreclosed by the Supreme Court's pronouncements that education is not a fundamental right and that disparate access to it based on wealth does not trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The questions raised in the instant case, however, are different from the prior cases in two respects. First, the right alleged is \"access to literacy\"-a distinct concept from the bare right to education or the right to an equally funded education. Second, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kadrmas\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs are not challenging the validity of a state law or the State's educational structure or funding scheme. Plaintiffs' suit confronts their perceived dilemma: the laws are valid, the authority of school officials is valid, school attendance is compulsory, but they are not given any meaningful education at all. Thus, the claims here differ from those in the preceding cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff students were accorded \"an opportunity to acquire the basic minimal skills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full participation in the political process.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    411 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiffs assert that they have not been given that opportunity. The\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   Court specifically avoided ruling on whether the functional deprivation of literacy access would violate the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    at 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10186\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/1/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Even if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is a constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of either right, we have no indication that the present levels of educational expenditures in Texas provide an education that falls short.\"). Because\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   did not reach the argument posed in Plaintiffs' complaint, it is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   , the Court reviewed a statute requiring alien children to pay tuition that effectively barred them from receiving a basic education. The Court weighed the societal cost of the deprivation against the state's justification for the law (state finances), and concluded that, on the evidence before it, the state's justification was irrational. At oral argument in the present case, Plaintiffs' counsel suggested that the Complaint alleges an analogous claim because \"having a system that does not provide teachers, books, courses and the conditions conducive to learning fails even a rational basis test.\" ECF 109, PgID 2592. Although that may be so, the ambiguity of the phrase \"having a system\" makes this dispute more abstract than\n   <em>\n    Plyler.\n   </em>\n   The statutes that compose Michigan's \"system\" have already been determined to be valid and no statute is specifically challenged in\n   the case. Rather, while Plaintiffs insist that they have not received a basic, minimal education\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   , they reach that conclusion by alleging that Defendants have not done\n   <em>\n    enough\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   is therefore highly instructive, but not wholly dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   , the terms of the Court's remand prevented a holding on the equal-protection claim and the Court never reached the fundamental-right argument because of its threadbare pleading-a finding that cannot be levied in this case. And even so, the factual scenario was inapposite to the allegations here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   The petitioners do not allege that schoolchildren in the Chickasaw Counties are not taught to read or write; they do not allege that they receive no instruction on even the educational basics; they allege no actual facts in support of their assertion that they have been deprived of a minimally adequate education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p289\">\n    478 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p289\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a positive right, access to literacy (i.e., a minimally adequate education) is so important that the state is compelled to provide it. As a negative right, access to literacy is so important\n   that the state may not hinder Plaintiffs' attempts to secure it. The Complaint alleges that each Plaintiff was \"denied access to literacy\" and repeatedly speaks of the \"denial of access to literacy.\" In a sense, the phrasing evokes the notion of a barrier: Defendants have kept Plaintiffs from accessing literacy and but for Defendants' obstruction, Plaintiffs could and would have the access. In other words, the allegations state the violation of a negative right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   But a violation of negative rights is not what the Complaint truly seems to argue. The Complaint explains, in great detail, that the instruction and resources in Plaintiffs' schools are inadequate. Plaintiffs aver the State \"is the entity responsible for securing and ensuring Plaintiffs' opportunity to access literacy\" yet have \"failed to ensure a basic environment for teaching and learning that is the necessary prerequisite for the acquisition and transmission of literacy.\" ECF 1, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 109. The Complaint notes the compulsory nature of schooling in Michigan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20380.1561\">\n    Mich.

But the relief sought is exclusively positive in nature: Plaintiffs believe that Defendants must implement \"evidence-based programs for literacy instruction and intervention,\" universally screen students for literacy problems, and establish an accountability system, to name a few.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1, PgID 131-32. In sum, the Complaint points exclusively to a positive-right argument: Plaintiffs are entitled to a minimum level of instruction on learning to read, yet the State, vis-\u00e0-vis Defendants, has failed to give it to them. The Court will therefore construe the Complaint in that manner.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221570\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/115/#p125\">\n    503 U.S. at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221570\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/503/115/#p125\">\n    112 S.Ct. 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing that the \"doctrine of judicial self-restraint\" urges a court to \"focus on the allegations in the complaint to determine how [a plaintiff] describes the constitutional right at stake\" and what the state actor allegedly did to deprive plaintiff of the right).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plainly, literacy-and the opportunity to obtain it-is of incalculable importance. As Plaintiffs point out, voting, participating meaningfully in civic life, and accessing justice require some measure of literacy. Applying for a job, securing a place to live, and applying for government benefits routinely require the completion of written forms. Simply finding one's way through many aspects of ordinary life stands as an obstacle to one who cannot read.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   But those points do not necessarily make access to literacy a fundamental right.

When a child who could be taught to read goes untaught, the child suffers a lasting injury-and so does society. But the Court is faced with a discrete question: does the Due Process Clause demand that a State affirmatively provide each child with a defined, minimum level of education by which the child can attain literacy? Based on the foregoing analysis, the answer to the question is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   D. Equal Protection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Lastly, the Court arrives at Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claim. This cause of action rests on two theories: (1) Defendants deny Plaintiffs the fundamental right of access to literacy \"by intentionally discriminating against them on the basis of race,\" and (2) Defendants have \"functionally excluded Plaintiffs\" from Michigan's schools on the basis of their race, and denied them \"access to literacy equal to the access provided to students in other schools in the State on the basis of their race, and responded with deliberate indifference to such exclusion and such denial[.]\" ECF 1, PgID 128, \u00b6\u00b6 207-08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Equal Protection Clause \"is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Cleburne v.

A plaintiff must therefore adequately plead that the government treated him or her \"disparately as compared to similarly situated persons and that such disparate treatment either burdens a fundamental right, targets a suspect class, or has no rational basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Bio-Ethical Reform, Inc. v. Napolitano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739880\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/365/#p379\">\n    648 F.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Club Italia Soccer &amp; Sports Org., Inc. v.

The Complaint hinges on comparisons to \"students in other schools in the State,\" but according to Defendants, students in non-Detroit schools are not similarly situated, and are therefore not the appropriate comparison group. ECF 60, PgID 533. Rather, the appropriate comparison would be to other students in Plaintiffs' respective school districts, and Plaintiffs have made no argument that any students within these schools are treated differently from one another. So Defendants insist the Complaint fails to state a claim under the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Court agrees that Michigan schools as a whole are not the proper comparator. Plaintiffs have not challenged a statewide funding scheme, a specific statute, or any particular decisions by Defendants applicable to all Michigan schools. Instead, they advance a kind of ambivalence theory: that Defendants\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   treat Plaintiffs schools the way they treat other schools in Michigan, but they have chosen not to. Michigan's laws, however, put the State in a different posture with respect to distressed schools than schools that have not\n   required state intervention. The SRO operates as the school board only in Priority Schools. The Governor and other state actors appoint financial managers only when a district is financially distressed. As described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , sec. III.B., Defendants are the proper parties in this case specifically because of the State's involvement in Detroit schools pursuant to Michigan law. The appropriate comparators for an equal-protection claim are therefore other Michigan schools that have come under the control of emergency managers, been designated a Priority School, or were governed by the EAA. So framed, the Complaint fails to state an equal-protection claim under any of the three recognized theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   1. Burdening a fundamental right\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Court has already concluded that the Due Process Clause does not require a state to provide access to minimally adequate education. In other words, access to literacy is not a fundamental right-at least not in the positive-right sense. Accordingly, the State's alleged failure to provide literacy access to Plaintiffs fails to state an equal-protection claim on the basis of burdening a fundamental right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   2. Targeting a suspect class\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Although the Complaint clearly establishes that Plaintiffs' schools predominantly serve children of color-four of the five schools are at least 97% African American and the fifth is 31.1% African-American and 64.2% Latino, ECF 1, PgID 62-63, \u00b6 90-it makes no claim about the relevant comparator schools. The only specific reference to the racial makeup of other schools is to Grosse Pointe, which has not experienced the relevant state interventions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, n.2. The Complaint opines that the conditions in Plaintiffs' schools \"would be unthinkable in schools serving predominantly white, affluent student populations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 1, but it does not state any instance where Defendants intervened in a school with a different racial makeup and treated that school disparately. Without this type of comparison, the Complaint fails to state a claim that Defendants have classified or otherwise differently treated Plaintiffs on account of race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   3. Lacking a rational basis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   When a classification involves neither fundamental rights nor suspect classes, it \"is accorded a strong presumption of validity.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller v. Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    509 U.S. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 319,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355778\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/312/#p319\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).

The mechanics of the two cases, however, make a difference in evaluating the equal-protection claim. In\n   <em>\n    Plyler\n   </em>\n   , a statute required one specific group to pay tuition, but not another. The statute did not survive rational-basis review, so the defendants were enjoined from enforcing it. Here, the Complaint references Michigan's funding scheme, ECF 1, PgID 49-50, \u00b6 66, but does not allege it is irrational. The Complaint discusses Michigan's governance systems, but likewise fails to allege that they are (or were) irrational.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-52, \u00b6\u00b6 68-70. And none of the relief requested implicates particular statutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-32. Plaintiffs must mean, then, that Defendants' actions in implementing the various state laws are irrational-but the Complaint fails to provide a concrete example. Plaintiffs simply assert that \"Michigan's failure to provide [ ] curriculum, teachers, and books\" or \"to eliminate the deplorable and unsafe conditions that deny access to literacy\" does not satisfy rational-basis review. ECF 64, PgID 1434.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiffs must do more than point to the present conditions as prima facie evidence that the State-and Defendants specifically-have acted irrationally. The Court accepts as true the Complaint's factual allegations, but Plaintiffs must still plead facts that are more than \"merely consistent with\" Defendants' liability.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

But whether an action is rational depends on the available options.
