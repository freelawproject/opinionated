(\"Pinnacle\"). (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86-113.) She also alleges defamation against BMW and James Fox (\"Fox\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-30.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), BMW and Fox move to dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII and Section 1981 claims for discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment. (R. 16, Mot. at 2-3.) For the reasons stated below, the motion to dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    RELEVANT FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff is African American and an Illinois resident. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6 4.) BMW is a company that sells cars and other vehicles to a network of dealerships throughout the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Plaintiff worked for BMW through Pinnacle, a staffing company through which BMW hired persons on a \"contingent\" basis until they are hired as permanent BMW employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.) Such contingent workers are not offered benefits available to permanent BMW employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiff alleges that the vast majority of BMW's permanent employees are white, and that BMW regularly refuses to promote minority contingent workers to permanent employee positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   24-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff began working part-time at BMW in 2006, through a staffing agency, for BMW Financial Services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) In 2007, Plaintiff began working at BMW full-time as the coordinator for its Central Region Mini Market division. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Plaintiff alleges that she received universal praise from her supervisors before July 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19-20.) BMW, however, never hired Plaintiff as a permanent employee and she instead continued working as a contingent employee through April 17, 2017, at which time she was placed on administrative leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) She claims that BMW refused to hire her as a permanent employee despite being qualified for such a position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's supervisor in 2013 allegedly advised Plaintiff that she would become a permanent employee, but later notified her that the employee position was given to another BMW employee, who was white, and whose previous job position was being eliminated by BMW. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff alleges that BMW hired several other white contingent workers for job positions similar to Plaintiff's position, and that BMW has failed to hire African Americans as permanent employees when presented with an opportunity to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that she regularly experienced or witnessed racial and gender-based discrimination while working at BMW. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.) She alleges that BMW vice president Kevin Coon (\"Coon\") demanded that Plaintiff or another female cut his coffee cake at a business meeting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff also avers that, while reviewing the Central Region Mini Market division's organizational chart, Coon stated that \"MINI really\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   black,\" and further stated at a fundraiser on Chicago's south side, \"what is this, [t]he Chitlin Circuit?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (emphasis in original).) Plaintiff alleges that he also asked another female contingent worker if she \"wanted to be spanked,\" among a \"host of other unprofessional, racist[,] and sexist remarks[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2016, Fox was appointed Regional Business Manager of BMW's Central\n   Region, and he became Plaintiff's supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 40-43.) While Plaintiff was training Fox on budgets in his office, Fox allegedly asked Plaintiff about her age, marital status, how many children she had, and whether all her children had the same father. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff also alleges that Fox uttered vulgar and profane comments about his sexuality in response to a woman that questioned his sexuality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.) Fox also allegedly commented about oral sex to other persons working at BMW and, from July 2016 to January 2017, regularly used sexual, demeaning, and profane language. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2016, Plaintiff allegedly told Fox that she was dissatisfied with BMW's failure to hire minority contingent workers as permanent employees, and that it appeared to her she had not been hired as a permanent employee because of her race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) In response, Fox allegedly stated that although Plaintiff did her job well, she would never be hired as a permanent employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Fox also allegedly said that he was \"surprised BMW hasn't been sued,\" and that \"it sucks but that's the price if you want to play\" because \"[t]hat's just how the Germans operate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff claims that she had never complained about discrimination at BMW before September 2016 because others who did complain suffered negative job consequences. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Plaintiff alleges that, the day after she complained to Fox about discrimination against minorities, she received-without explanation-a work schedule with reduced hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.) Plaintiff also alleges that Fox disseminated several false explanations for the reduction in Plaintiff's work hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff claims that Fox took further actions that negatively affected her, including requesting that she sign a temporary work contract-something that Fox allegedly had not requested of any other worker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.) Fox also allegedly began to criticize Plaintiff's performance and delegated her job responsibilities to less-qualified employees and interns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-62.) In October 2016, Fox allegedly accused Plaintiff of fraud related to the hours she had entered on her time cards reflecting the number of hours she worked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Plaintiff claims that these accusations were false. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 2, 2016, Plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint against Pinnacle and BMW with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64; R. 1-1, BMW EEOC Compl.; R. 1-2, Pinnacle EEOC Compl.) Plaintiff's EEOC complaint against BMW states that she believes she had \"been discriminated against because of [her] sex, female, and race, Black, and in retaliation for engaging in protected activity[.]\" (R. 1-1, BMW EEOC Compl. at 2.) Plaintiff's EEOC complaint is based on BMW's alleged failure to hire her as a permanent employee, having her hours reduced, being wrongly accused of falsifying time sheets, and offering her a temporary work contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She checked boxes on the EEOC complaint form indicating her belief that BMW's discrimination against her was based on her race, her sex, and BMW's desire to retaliate, and that BMW's discriminatory conduct occurred in November 2016 and continued since that date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff included the same language and checked the same boxes in her EEOC complaint against Pinnacle. (R. 1-2, Pinnacle EEOC Compl. at 2.) The EEOC ultimately terminated its processing of both EEOC complaints and issued to Plaintiff notices of her right to sue Pinnacle and BMW. (R. 1-1, BMW EEOC Compl. at 1; R. 1-2, Pinnacle EEOC Compl. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Plaintiff filed her EEOC complaints, Fox prepared a 2016 performance review for Plaintiff in which he allegedly gave her a negative review. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6 65.) Plaintiff claims that Fox then began to ask her to manage his travel arrangements, despite that task not being part of Plaintiff's job description. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.) Then, on April 17, 2017, Plaintiff was placed on administrative leave so that BMW could investigate her charges of discrimination and retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) The next day, Fox allegedly stated on a conference call with BMW employees that Plaintiff was on a \"much-needed vacation\" and that she should not be \"disturbed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) As of the filing of her complaint, Plaintiff has remained on administrative leave. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 6, 2017, Plaintiff filed this suit against BMW, Pinnacle, and Fox. (R. 1, Compl.) In Count I, Plaintiff alleges that BMW and Pinnacle discriminated against her and harassed her because of her race and created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-94.) Count II alleges that BMW retaliated against Plaintiff for complaining about conduct that allegedly violated Title VII. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-100.) Count III claims that BMW and Pinnacle violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by discriminating against Plaintiff and harassing her because of her race as well as creating a hostile work environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-07.) Count IV asserts that BMW retaliated against Plaintiff for complaining about conduct that she believed was unlawful under Section 1981. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-13.) In Count V, Plaintiff alleges defamation against BMW and Fox for Fox's statement that Plaintiff was on a \"much-needed vacation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 114-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 5, 2017, Pinnacle answered the complaint. ( R. 12, Pinnacle Answer.) On the same day, BMW and Fox filed their present motion to dismiss Counts I and III as well as their joint answer to the complaint. (R. 16, Mot. at 2-3; R. 19, BMW &amp; Fox Answer.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, BMW and Fox argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII harassment and hostile work environment claims in Count I because they are not reasonably related to the claims asserted in her underlying EEOC complaint. (R. 17, Mem. at 78.) BMW and Fox contend that Plaintiff's EEOC complaint only alleged discrimination, and therefore any claims of harassment or hostile work environment must be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies available through the EEOC, (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) BMW and Fox also contend that the Court should dismiss the claims of harassment and hostile work environment in Counts I and III because Plaintiff fails to allege: any discriminatory comments made to Plaintiff personally as opposed to other persons; comments that were related to Plaintiff's race; or any conduct that was \"severe or pervasive,\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.) With respect to Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination in Counts I and III, BMW and Fox argue that the Court should dismiss those claims because Plaintiff does not allege that she applied for any permanent employee position with BMW or that there exist similarly-situated individuals of another race who were offered a position for which Plaintiff was qualified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff opposes the motion to dismiss, arguing that her harassment and hostile work environment claims are reasonably related to her EEOC complaint. (R. 27, Resp. at 7-9.) Plaintiff also argues that she alleges sufficient facts to support her discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-7, 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A complaint must set forth a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" FED.

As noted above, to survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff need only allege that her employer took an adverse employment action against her because of her race, and she satisfies this requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356569\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/826/#p833\">\n    804 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   833 ;\n   <em>\n    Tamayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1081\">\n    526 F.3d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, the Court rejects BMW's and Fox's argument that Plaintiff must allege that she applied to a permanent position at BMW. (R. 17, Mem. at 11.) First, the cases BMW and Fox rely on are unpersuasive because they are summary judgment cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loyd v.

In addition to the different procedural posture of this case, \"[w]hen an employer uses a promotion system in which employees do not apply for promotions but rather are sought out by managers, the application requirement... is loosened somewhat\" in a claim based on an employer's failure to hire or promote.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Ill. 2014) (citation omitted). Here, Plaintiff alleges that BMW's contingent employees are promoted to permanent employees \"after they have proven to be capable at their jobs,\" and the complaint suggests that there is no application process for a permanent employee position as opposed to a process in which BMW unilaterally promotes employees. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 27.) In such circumstances, a plaintiff need not prove, much less allege, that she applied for an open job position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steinbarth v.

(R. 17, Mem. at 12.) The complaint, however, provides fair notice of other, similarly-situated white contingent employees who were promoted to permanent BMW employee positions. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 28, 40-41.) Additionally, whether similarly-situated comparators exist is a matter addressed at summary judgment, not on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.
