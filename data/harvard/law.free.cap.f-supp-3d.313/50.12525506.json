Specifically, Iran provided financial support and weapons, as well as weapons training, to Hezbollah prior to the attack. During the\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   hearing, Dr. Bechtol explained that \"[t]his whole thing\"-the 2006 attack-\"was financed by Iran.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 28.

Podoler Decl. \u00b6 28. Evidence introduced during the\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   hearing also establishes that Iran worked in\n   concert with North Korea and Syria to provide the rocket and missile components that Hezbollah used in the 2006 attack.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr.

Iran also secured the assistance of North Korean instructors who cooperated with Iranian engineers to construct a sophisticated underground tunnel network in southern Lebanon to move Hezbollah fighters during the 2006 attack. Podoler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. The underground tunnel network enabled Hezbollah to \"hide the troops from being hit by Israeli retaliations\" during the 2006 attack and also likely served as a hiding place for Hezbollah's stockpile of missiles and rockets.\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 18, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of this evidence, the court finds that Iran provided material support and resources to Hezbollah in carrying out the 2006 attack at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Although the FSIA generally insulates foreign states from suit in American courts, as relevant\n   here, the FSIA provides an exception to a foreign state's sovereign immunity in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A, known colloquially as the \"state-sponsored terrorism exception.\" In pertinent part, the exception abrogates a foreign state's sovereign immunity in any case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   in which money damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death that was caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking,\n   <em>\n    or the provision of material support or resources for such an act\n   </em>\n   if such act or provision of material support or resources is engaged in by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1) (emphasis added).

First, as established above, satisfactory evidence has been presented that Iran provided \"material support and resources\" to Hezbollah within the meaning of \u00a7 1605A for the 2006 attack. \"Material support or resources\" includes the provision of \"any property, tangible or intangible, or service, including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities, financial services, lodging, training, expert advice or assistance, safehouses, false documentation or identification, communications equipment, facilities, weapons, lethal substances, explosives, personnel ..., and transportation, except medicine or religious materials.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(h)(3) ; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A. Plaintiff has supplied satisfactory proof that Iran provided material support and resources to Hezbollah in the form of financial services and support, weapons, and training, thereby enabling Hezbollah to perpetrate the 2006 attack. Second, Iran was designated a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(h)(6) at the time of the 2006 attack, and has been so designated by the Secretary of State since January 19, 1984.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Dep't of State,\n   <em>\n    State Sponsors of Terrorism\n   </em>\n   , https://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm (last visited May 1, 2018).

And, finally, Plaintiff's suit satisfies Section 1605A(a)(2)(A)(iii), as the acts of terrorism at issue did not occur in Iran, rendering an opportunity to arbitrate unnecessary. Accordingly, Iran does not enjoy foreign sovereign immunity from Plaintiff's suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A, and this court possesses original\n   jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201330\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
