McFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Robo-Team NA, Inc., sells tactical ground robotics systems to United States government agencies including all branches of the military, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Endeavor Robotics competes with Robo-Team for government contracts in this field. According to Robo-Team, Endeavor Robotics hired Sachem, a defense-focused lobbying firm, to spread a false rumor that the Chinese government controls Robo-Team and uses it to steal military technology from the United States. Robo-Team has sued Endeavor Robotics and Sachem for defamation, tortious interference with contractual and other business relationships, civil conspiracy, and unfair competition. Both Defendants moved to dismiss Robo-Team's claims under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Both Defendants also argued that Robo-Team's lawsuit is a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP, and have moved to dismiss the case under the District of Columbia's Anti-SLAPP statute, which provides for the recovery of costs. Because this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, the motions to dismiss under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will be granted and the Anti-SLAPP motions will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Sachem has its principal place of business in Boston, Massachusetts, but conducts lobbying activities in the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Robo-Team alleges that it has been competing with Endeavor for government contracts since at least 2014, and that Endeavor has been spreading false information about Robo-Team during that time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Robo-Team alleges that Endeavor's \"campaign of defamatory statements\" intensified after Robo-Team defeated Endeavor in a competition for a particularly significant contract with the Air Force in 2015 and then declined Endeavor's\n   proposals to partner on future federal bids and other projects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2016 and early 2017 the Army began the competitive process for awarding two of the biggest robotics contracts offered by the military in the last 15 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Each contract was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Robo-Team alleges that Endeavor hired Sachem to damage Robo-Team's reputation and prevent it from competing successfully for these contracts, for other business, and for future federal contracts, including one contract that is expected to have a value of approximately $1 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Sachem prepared a memorandum that was distributed on Capitol Hill and that included in its discussion of \"Foreign Threats\" a description of Robo-Team's alleged connections with China and alleged violation of International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The allegations in Sachem's memorandum were repeated in a letter from Congressman Seth Moulton to Frank Kendall, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, asking that \"the Department of the Army ... carefully examine the evidence of Chinese influence when considering award of [the two major contracts mentioned above].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2. They also appear to be echoed in a letter to Undersecretary Kendall that was signed by six other Members of Congress and circulated with supporting materials about Robo-Team's connections with China.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31-33;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3.

More specifically, Robo-Team alleged in June 2017 that it was still in the process of responding to a series of complex Requests for Information issued by the Department of State and the Department of Defense in February 2017, that dozens of current and prospective clients had reported concerns about Endeavor's allegations about Robo-Team's connections with the Chinese government, and that it had also had to deal with an inquiry by the Wall Street Journal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Robo-Team sued Endeavor and Sachem for defamation, tortious interference with contractual and other business relationships, civil conspiracy, and unfair competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14. Before me now are four motions to dismiss, two by each Defendant. Each Defendant has moved under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss Robo-Team's claims for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Each Defendant has also moved to dismiss under the District of Columbia's Anti-SLAPP statute and has requested an award of costs, including attorney's fees, pursuant to that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To hear a claim against a defendant, a court must have personal jurisdiction over that defendant. Under the Due Process Clause, this means that the defendant must \"have certain minimum contacts with ['the territory of the forum,' which is to say, the geographic area under the court's authority,] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Shoe Co. v.

Depending on the defendant's forum contacts, a\n   court's personal jurisdiction over a defendant may be general, allowing the court to hear any claim against the defendant, or specific, allowing the court to hear claims against the defendant only if those claims arise from the defendant's forum contacts.\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

Robo-Team's Complaint does not even use the word \"fraud\" and does not come near satisfying the pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Thus, the fraud exception does not alter my conclusion that I lack specific jurisdiction over the Defendants. Since I have neither general nor specific personal jurisdiction over the Defendants in this case, the Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction will be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Robo-Team alleges that it has a good faith belief that jurisdictional discovery would reveal: (1) the identities of individuals and companies in the District of Columbia to whom the Defendants made false statements about Robo-Team; (2) additional facts about Defendants' conduct of business in the District of Columbia; and (3) additional facts about the control that Endeavor's parent company, which is located in the District of Columbia, exerts over Endeavor. Pl.'s Opp. to Endeavor's Mot. Dismiss, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Robo-Team has not explained the basis for its belief that jurisdictional discovery would reveal that it has been defamed to private parties in the District of Columbia, nor does its Complaint purport to state a claim arising from defamatory statements made to private parties in the District of Columbia. Robo-Team has not alleged that\n   it has a good faith belief that additional facts about the Defendants' conduct of business in the District of Columbia or about the control that Endeavor's parent company exerts over Endeavor would establish personal jurisdiction. Thus, Robo-Team has not demonstrated a more than speculative basis for believing that discovery would establish my jurisdiction over the claims stated in its Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
