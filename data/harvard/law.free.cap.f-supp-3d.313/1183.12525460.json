On December 19, 2017, a hearing on the motion was held. Attorneys Teresa Allen, Michael Haddad, and Sanjay Schmidt appeared telephonically on behalf of plaintiff Jeremy Lapachet. Attorneys Jemma Saunders, Jesse M. Rivera, and Jill Nathan appeared telephonically on behalf of defendants. Having reviewed the parties' briefing and heard arguments, and for the reasons that follow, defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff brings this action against the County of Stanislaus (\"County\"), Sheriff Adam Christianson (\"Christianson\"), California Forensic Medical Group, Inc. (\"CFMG\"), various CFMG employees, and unidentified Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department supervisors. In his complaint, plaintiff alleges as follows. When plaintiff entered the Stanislaus County Jail on December 9, 2014, he possessed the ability to walk, jog, run, and use all of his extremities freely. (Doc. No. 1 (Compl.) at \u00b6 25-26.) On or about October 26, 2015, he left the jail on a stretcher as a quadriplegic, with injuries that included a fractured skull, multiple subdural hematomas, a traumatic brain injury, severe spinal cord injuries, and a torn rotator cuff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 24, 2015, around 5:50 p.m., plaintiff was placed in the jail's \"Sobering Cell\" because County and CFMG staff became\n   aware that he had been injected with and was under the influence of an unknown controlled substance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) Specifically, defendant Jessamae Trinidad, R.N. (\"Trinidad\"), a CFMG employee, received a report that plaintiff had been injected with an unknown substance by another inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Trinidad noted three red marks in plaintiff's right AC joint, with bruising present. Plaintiff reported to Trinidad that he had experienced the effects of various drugs prior to being in custody, but that the effects produced by this unknown substance did not feel like any he had experienced previously. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to his placement in the Sobering Cell, plaintiff had also been observed to be engaging in self-harm, including punching himself multiple times. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) County jail staff reported this to CFMG staff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Less than an hour later, defendant Tabitha King (\"King\"), a CFMG employee and L.V.N., documented an \"Emergency Response,\" indicating that she had responded to a call for possible drug use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) Defendant Lani Antonio (\"Antonio\"), another CFMG employee, was also notified of the call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) King responded and found plaintiff sitting in a chair with handcuffs on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) His symptoms included trembling, restlessness, dilated pupils, and elevated vital signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Antonio directed that plaintiff's vital signs be checked every six hours until he stabilized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around 8:02 p.m. that same evening, defendant Trinidad checked the Sobering Cell and observed plaintiff touching his chest, pacing in his cell, and behaving restlessly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff also complained that his lungs and chest were filling with fluid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rather than treating plaintiff, Trinidad merely told plaintiff to \"relax.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Around 11:46 p.m., defendant Judith Alejandre, L.V.N. (\"Alejandre\"), a CFMG employee, checked the Sobering Cell again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) Defendant Alejandre took plaintiff's vital signs, which remained elevated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although plaintiff had been injected with an unknown substance, and had displayed elevated vital signs for several hours, defendant Alejandre did not request any further medical treatment or order a toxicology screening test. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At about midnight, plaintiff was moved from the Sobering Cell to a \"Safety Cell,\" although the Safety Cell lacked the precautions that such cells normally have. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 25, 2015, around 5:01 a.m., plaintiff's vital signs were checked again, and remained elevated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) Defendant Veronica Berghorst, R.N. (\"Berghorst\"), a CFMG employee, observed plaintiff and related to CFMG medical staff that plaintiff had told her \"people were going to get him in his cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Berghorst did not order a toxicology screening or request medical treatment, despite the fact that plaintiff's vital signs had been elevated for roughly 10 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At 9:08 a.m., CFMG R.N. Varinder Sablok attempted to perform a \"Drug Withdrawal\" monitoring evaluation, but did not do so because County staff at the jail had removed plaintiff from his cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around 4:00 p.m. on October 25, 2015, defendant Amardeep Tawana L.V.N. (\"Tawana\"), a CFMG employee, conducted a check on plaintiff to monitor the effects of the substance he had taken. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.) At that time defendant Tawana, as well as other CFMG and County staff, observed plaintiff standing beside the wall in his cell with a towel tied tightly around his left wrist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Tawana requested that County staff open the cell in order for Tawana to check plaintiff's vital signs, but County staff refused to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Around 5:30 p.m. that same day, CFMG staff, including defendant Tawana, were summoned\n   for a \"man down\" call because plaintiff was bleeding from his nose and the right side of his head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) No further medical examination or treatment was performed at that time since defendant Tawana observed \"no visible injuries.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At around 5:55 p.m., defendant Tawana observed plaintiff without a safety garment, and with towels wrapped around his neck and hands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.) CFMG's mental health R.N., defendant Grashika Devendra (\"Devendra\"), was notified of these observations at roughly 6:10 p.m., but conducted no follow-up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 5:58 p.m., defendant Tawana noted that she responded to plaintiff's cell with other CFMG staff and found plaintiff lying on the floor and \"bleeding from an unknown place.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) Plaintiff had blood on his mouth, forehead, and both hands, and was apparently using \"filthy language to medical and custody staff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) County correctional officers dragged plaintiff out of his cell by the head and neck. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An unidentified County shift sergeant directed that plaintiff be placed in a safety cell due to the risk of him injuring himself, but otherwise no medical action was taken at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At 6:58 p.m., defendant Tawana conducted a \"Suicide Watch\" of plaintiff and observed him lying on the floor without a safety garment and with dried blood on his face and nose. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) At 11:02 p.m., defendant Tawana checked on plaintiff and observed him lying flat on the floor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.) Defendant Tawana scheduled a mental health evaluation for the next morning, but the evaluation was never conducted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 26, 2015, at about 12:40 a.m., defendant Berghorst wrote a Suicide Watch Report stating that plaintiff was \"found laying\" in the \"prone position\" and, according to County staff, had not moved since he had been placed in the safety cell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.) Plaintiff was found lying in a pool of yellow and brown liquid around his face and upper body and provided with a safety garment, although his breathing was reportedly labored at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An examination of his mouth and throat revealed the presence of blood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.) At 12:49 a.m., defendant Berghorst requested that the County sergeant on duty call for an ambulance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's statements to treating personnel at that time indicated that he did not know where he was. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Medical staff arrived at around 12:59 a.m., placed plaintiff into \"full spine precautions\" and transported him to an emergency room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49.) Plaintiff arrived at the Doctors Medical Center hospital at 1:39 a.m., approximately 32 hours after he was first placed in the jail's \"Sobering Cell.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After being admitted to the hospital and undergoing tests, plaintiff was found to be suffering from numerous injuries including, but were not limited to, lack of feeling or movement of his legs, a cervical spine fracture at the C5 vertebrae, a nondepressed skull fracture, and a torn rotator cuff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52.) Plaintiff remains paralyzed from the neck down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his complaint, plaintiff presents eight causes of action. On November 20, 2017, defendants separately moved to dismiss the first, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 51.) On December 5, 2017, plaintiff filed an opposition to the motion. (Doc. No. 54.) On December 12, 2017, defendants filed a reply. (Doc.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.)

(Compl. at \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff was then treated by defendants King and Antonio, both medical professionals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's vital signs were checked, and he was placed on \"drug withdrawal monitoring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court finds that based on these allegations of the complaint, public employees were \"summoned\" to treat plaintiff within the meaning of \u00a7 845.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff argues that despite this monitoring, his claim under \u00a7 845.6 should not be dismissed because plaintiff \"was neither transported to an inpatient medical or psychiatric care facility, nor placed in a proper safety cell on suicide.\" (Doc. No. 54 at 32-33.) These arguments go merely to the adequacy of the medical response, and California law is clear that inadequate medical treatment does not provide the basis for asserting a claim under \u00a7 845.6 as long as medical treatment was in fact provided. Because the complaint alleges that medical care was summoned to treat plaintiff soon after he was placed in the jail's Sobering Cell, the court will grant defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's sixth cause of action with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Negligence Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, defendants move for dismissal of plaintiff's negligence cause of action brought against defendants County and Christianson. The County argues it is immune from all negligence actions, and that the complaint fails to state claim against defendant Christianson. The court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Defendant County\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The County argues that it is \"\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   immune for any tort injury to prisoners under Gov. Code \u00a7 844.6.\" (Doc. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   51-1 at 31.) That provision states that \"notwithstanding any other provision of this part...a public entity is not liable for...[a]n injury to any prisoner.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20844.6\">\n    Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 844.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel conceded that \u00a7 844.6 barred all state law claims against the County except for those claims based on a failure to summon medical care under \u00a7 845.6. As discussed above, reliance on \u00a7 845.6 is unavailing because, on the facts alleged, medical care was in fact summoned. The court will therefore dismiss plaintiff's negligence claim against the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Defendant Christianson\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court turns next to plaintiff's negligence claim brought against defendant Christianson. In California, the elements of a cause of action for negligence are: (1) a legal duty to use reasonable care; (2) breach of that duty; and (3) proximate cause between the breach and (4) the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"358325\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/66/1333/#p1339\">\n    66 Cal.

There is nothing from which the court could plausibly infer that defendant Christianson was aware of plaintiff, let alone that he was aware of plaintiff's need for medical attention and failed to respond appropriately to it. Therefore, the court is unable to discern what actions defendant Christianson allegedly took or failed to take that constituted a breach of any duty owed to plaintiff. Plaintiff's negligence claim against defendant Christianson must therefore be dismissed as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   1.
