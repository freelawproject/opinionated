Defendant Rios was responsible for all operations of the LCF, including oversight of Unit Management and staff. This oversight would include approving classification recommendation and ensuring that properly classified offenders were housed at this facility and properly classified inmates were transferred to other appropriate facilities. Defendant Rios knew or should have known about the misconduct of Inmate Mounce to include violent misconduct or the threat of violent conduct. Defendant Rios would have known or should have known about the positive results for the drug screening test on the day of Inmate Mounce's arrival to the LCF. This should have prompted Defendant Rios to seek an immediate transfer for Inmate Mounce to return to maximum security. The willful or reckless failure to perform the foregoing duties and responsibilities constituted deliberate indifference to safety and well being of Boling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   37.

Okla. Feb. 5, 2018) (\"The Court finds these allegations [that Mr. Autry 'was found unconscious in his cell' and 'returned to the hospital in a coma'] ... sufficient to state a potential basis for tolling the limitations period for Mr. Autry's \u00a7 1983 claim, subject to later proof.\"). This is precisely what Plaintiff alleges-that Boling remains in a coma and unable to communicate or care for himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 3, at 7. Thus, Plaintiff states a plausible case for tolling the applicable statute of limitations on the basis of his legal disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, Defendant Wilson argues that Plaintiff fails to state a plausible claim for relief. Wilson is an LCF Unit Manager who oversaw Mounce and Boling's unit during the alleged attack.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. After Mounce's case manager investigated him for threatening his cellmate on May 27, 2015, Wilson \"recklessly failed to house Mounce alone in a Segregation Unit, and directed that Boling be housed with him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. He was \"responsible for oversight of the unit record keeping system to ensure that detailed information about each offender housed in [his] unit is maintained by ... staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Plaintiff also alleges that Wilson was personally responsible to \"be aware of the history of Mounce\" and he \"knew or should have known about Mounce's violent conduct. Defendant Richard Wilson had the responsibility to ensure that Mounce was not classified for medium security.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Lastly, Wilson\n   \"failed to adequately train, direct, supervise, and/or control the actions of ... employees at LCF so as to prevent violation of Boling's constitutional rights, and the rights of others similarly situated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Again, Plaintiff has plausibly alleged substantial risk of serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part II(A), at 1268-69. Moving to the remaining Eighth Amendment elements, the Court rejects Plaintiff's conclusory failure-to-train allegation. Nonetheless, he alleges other facts that establish Defendant Wilson's deliberate indifference and personal involvement. Unlike Warden Rios, Wilson had more than a general supervisory responsibility over LCF officials. He had direct oversight of the record keeping system and assignments in Mounce and Boling's unit, and he \"directed that Boling be housed with Mounce.\" Doc. 3, at 5. Therefore, it was plausible that Wilson was aware of Mounce's extensive misconduct history; in Mounce's six months at LCF before Wilson celled him with Boling, his record included a positive methamphetamine test, battery of another inmate, and a threat against his prior cellmate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Wilson also allegedly became Mounce's Unit Manager as a result of his threats to his prior cellmate, making it likely that Wilson knew of Mounce's danger. Despite awareness of this substantial risk of serious harm to the inmates in Wilson's unit, he \"failed to house Mounce alone in a Segregation Unit\" and exposed Boling to the risk that ultimately incapacitated him. Thus, Plaintiff's claim against Defendant Wilson pleads a plausible claim for relief under the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Carol Barrett\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff states a plausible claim against Defendant Barrett, the LCF case manager that conducted Mounce's \"Custody Assessment Scale form\" recommending medium-security. Doc. 3, at 2. In doing so on January 9, 2015, Barrett \"recklessly omitted several relevant facts\" on the form that \"would have increased\" Mounce's security level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Plaintiff also pleads the following against Barrett:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [She] recklessly failed to properly screen and document the misconduct of Inmate Mounce to include violent misconduct or the threat of violent conduct, and to recommend maximum security or isolation for Mounce.... Carol Barrett ... knew or should have known about the positive results for the drug screening test on the day of Inmate Mounce's arrival to the LCF. This should have prompted Defendants to seek an immediate transfer for Inmate Mounce to return to maximum security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The link between Barrett's alleged conduct and the harm to Boling is clear, given that Barrett's security recommendation allegedly caused LCF to cell Mounce in the general population. Yet, the parties dispute whether Plaintiff's allegations amount to recklessness or mere negligence. To assess Barrett's state of mind, the Court must view the information in Barrett's possession at the time she recommended medium-security to determine if she deliberately ignored a substantial risk. To that end, Plaintiff's complaint is rather vague; other than the positive drug test, it is unclear what facts she \"recklessly omitted\" from the form.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. However, viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the Court finds that Barrett's alleged failure to \"document the misconduct of Inmate Mounce to include violent misconduct or the threat of violent conduct\" establishes that she was aware of Mounce's violent history and deliberately ignored it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562654\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/1182/#p1186\">\n    495 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Erickson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573451\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/89/#p93\">\n    551 U.S. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573451\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/89/#p93\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (\"[S]pecific facts are not necessary;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   the statement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the claim is\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the grounds upon which it rests.\").

Moreover, Plaintiff fails to state a plausible Eighth Amendment claim against Defendants Rios and Pitman. Accordingly, Defendants Williams and Pitman's Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 15, is GRANTED in part with respect to Pitman and DENIED with respect to Williams. Defendant Rios's Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 18, is GRANTED.

Doc. 3, at 6, 10. The Court's focus is the relevant risk to Boling, not whether ODOC could have housed him in a different prison. Thus, unless Plaintiff can allege that a defendant who was aware of Boling's minimum-security eligibility was also aware of, and personally responsible for, Boling's cell assignment with Mounce-all with the conscious awareness that Mounce posed a substantial risk of harm-Boling's security status is immaterial.
