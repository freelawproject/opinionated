R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the ground that the proposed action does not alter the status quo and therefore cannot trigger NEPA's requirement for preparation of an EIS. ECF No. 69. Federal Defendants join the motion, provided it is decided under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard and note cases declining to limit summary judgment briefing by federal agency defendants based upon denial of an intervenor's motion to dismiss. ECF No. 72. Plaintiffs oppose the motion. ECF No. 71. Defendant Intervenors replied. ECF No. 73. The matter was taken under submission on the papers pursuant to Local Rule 230(g).

U.S. Dep't of the Interior\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   \"), 1:12-cv-01303-LJO-MJS, which concerned a similar challenge to the NEPA review performed in connection with eight interim contracts that covered the period of time from March 1, 2012 through the end of February 2014 (\"2012-2014 Interim Contracts\").\n   <em>\n    See PCFFA\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 47. The first amended complaint in that case (\"\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   FAC\"), filed December 4, 2012, contained two causes of action similar to those alleged here: (1) that the EA prepared by Federal Defendants in connection with the eight Interim Contracts is inadequate; and (2) that Federal Defendants should have prepared an EIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Federal Defendants and Defendant Intervenors moved to dismiss both claims in the\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   FAC.\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 45-46. A March 8, 2013 Order granted the motions in part.\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52;\n   <em>\n    Pac. Coast.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed'n of Fishermen's Ass'ns v.

Cal. 2013). Among other things, Plaintiffs, whose opposition to the motion to dismiss primarily focused upon undermining Federal Defendants' choice of a \"status quo\" alternative as the \"No Action Alternative,\" appeared to concede that that the Proposed Action, which proposed\n   only a small water pricing difference from the No Action Alternative, would not alter the \"status quo\" of CVP operations.\n   <em>\n    See PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 48 at 12-13 (indicating assent to the proposition that the No Action Alternative as defined in this EA was the continuation of the status quo). Accordingly, after finding the No Action Alternative to be appropriate, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' second cause of action demanding that an EIS be prepared, relying in part on a line of cases which stand for the proposition that no EIS is required for a project that does not alter the status quo.\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 52 at 10-20. After cross motions for summary judgment decided the remaining claims concerning the EA and FONSI in February 2014,\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 88, an appeal was taken in March 2014.\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   appeal was pending, Reclamation issued its EA and FONSI for the 2016-18 Interim Contracts. Plaintiffs sued, raising claims substantially similar to those in\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   : (1) that the EA/FONSI was inadequate under NEPA; and (2) that Reclamation should have prepared an EIS for the 2016-18 Interim Contracts. ECF No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 25, 2016, the Ninth Circuit reversed in part this Court's summary judgment ruling in\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   , remanding for further proceedings in connection with the EA/FONSI claim. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit found that, despite the fact that the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (\"CVPIA\"), Pub. L. No. 102-575,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=106%20Stat.%204700\">\n    106 Stat. 4700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), mandates renewal of long-term water service contracts, the CVPIA does not require Reclamation to enter into interim contracts and therefore the \"no action\" alternative articulated in the EA for the 2012-2014 Interim Contracts unlawfully assumed interim contract renewal.\n   <em>\n    PCFFA\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 102 (Amended Memorandum);\n   <em>\n    Pac.

The Ninth Circuit also held that \"Reclamation's decision not to give full and meaningful consideration to the alternative of a reduction in maximum interim contract water quantities was an abuse of discretion, and the agency did not adequately explain why it eliminated this alternative from detailed study.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20595\">\n    at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The matter was remanded to this Court with instructions to vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' claim that the EA for the 2012-14 Interim Contracts was inadequate because it did not give full and meaningful consideration to the alternative of a reduction in maximum water quantities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Reclamation was directed to \"consider such an alternative in any future EA for an interim contract renewal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In particular, the Ninth Circuit indicated that \"[i]n satisfying this duty, Reclamation may rely upon any water needs assessment for which the data remain accurate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=655%20Fed.%20Appx.%20595\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of the\n   <em>\n    PCFFA Appellate Ruling\n   </em>\n   , Federal Defendants moved for voluntary remand without vacatur of the EA/FONSI prepared in connection with the 2016-18 Interim Contracts. ECF No. 42 at 4-5. Plaintiffs did not oppose remand but requested that the Court vacate, set aside, or otherwise rescind the 2016-18 Interim Contracts. ECF No. 44. The Court granted Federal Defendants' motion and denied Plaintiffs' request for vacatur. ECF No. 52.

This renders the line of cases requiring EIS's in the case of such commitments of resources-a line of which\n   <em>\n    Pit River\n   </em>\n   is a part-inapplicable. In this way the Court is able to at least partially reconcile the seemingly conflicting holdings of\n   <em>\n    Idaho Conservation League\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pit River\n   </em>\n   under the circumstances of this particular case.
