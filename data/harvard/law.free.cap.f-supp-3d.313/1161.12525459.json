This matter is suitable for disposition without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 230(g). For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiff's motion to remand is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a wage-and-hour class action arising out of Plaintiff's purported employment with URS. On February 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Kern. That complaint defined the putative class to be \"All persons who are employed or have been employed by Defendants in the State of California as hourly, Non-Exempt truck workers, industrial truck workers, industrial truck drivers, industrial vehicle drivers, industrial workers, and/or other similar job designations and titles during the period of the relevant statute of limitations.\" ECF No. 1-1 at PDF page 14 \u00b6 41. Defendant filed its answer on June 6, 2017. ECF No. 1-1 at PDF page 71. Pending at the time that Plaintiff filed his case was\n   <em>\n    Brent Hooper, et al. v. URS Midwest, Inc. d/b/a United Road Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Lead Case No. CIVDS1607489, Superior Court for the State of California, County of San\n   Bernardino (\"\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   action\"). On July 10, 2017, the court granted final approval of the class settlement in\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   . ECF No. 1-1 at 83. The settlement class was defined to be \"All individuals who were employed by [URS] in the position of California-domiciled Car Hauler employee in any pay period during the ... period from May 13, 2012 through January 30, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff served discovery in mid-June, including requests for production of documents, interrogatories, and deposition notices. ECF No. 12-1, Declaration of Tony Roberts (\"Roberts Decl.\") \u00b6 3. Defendant resisted, arguing that Plaintiff and the putative class were not employees of Defendant and that their claims were covered by the class settlement in\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   . It was at this time, in mid-July, that Plaintiff first learned of the\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   action. Because Defendant did not consider him to be an employee, he did not receive notice or opt-out rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Counsel for Plaintiff and Defendant engaged in a number of communications that Plaintiff now claims served to put Defendant on notice of the class that Plaintiff sought to represent. First, Plaintiff sent a letter to Defendant on August 21, 2017, clarifying that the putative class was not part of the\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   settlement: \"In other words, Mr. Taylor and the class of similarly situated persons were not part of the Hooper settlement because Defendant did not classify them as 'employees' and, therefore, [they] are entitled to pursue their claims under this lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Defendant sent a letter on September 27, 2017, to Plaintiff, stating in part that it was Defendant's \"understanding that Plaintiff believes that 'similarly situated' persons are individuals based in California who, while not a party to an IC Agreement, provided driver services to Fleet Owners.\" ECF No. 12-3. Third, Plaintiff sent an email to Defendant on October 10, 2017, requesting that Defendant \"please send me a ballpark estimate of the class size (for all California based drivers of Fleet Owners).\" ECF No. 12-4 at 5. Fourth, Plaintiff cites his response to Special Interrogatory No. 1, dated November 1, 2017, which stated Plaintiff's position that \"he and other 'drivers of Fleet owners' \" were non-exempt employees, contrary to Defendant's classification. ECF No. 12-5 at 4. Fifth is an email dated November 3, 2017, from Defendant to Plaintiff, in which Defendant stated that it was not in possession of any policies or procedures for \"drivers of fleet owners that we have been discussing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 6, 2017, Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that Plaintiff's claims were covered by the\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   settlement. The court granted Defendant's motion on December 5, 2017, and permitted Plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which he did on February 5, 2018. He seeks to represent a class of drivers who were not directly employed by URS but drove for third-party entities that made pickups or deliveries for URS customers, defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All persons who are employed or have been employed by Defendant in the State of California as all non-exempt drivers, car-haulers, fleet drivers, co-drivers or similar job designations who did not contract directly with but were dispatched by UNITED ROAD SERVICES, INC. to perform pickup and delivery services for customers of UNITED ROAD SERVICES, INC. or any related entity during the time period of February 1, 2013, to the present (hereinafter referred to as \"Non-Exempt Employees\").

First, Plaintiff points to an August 21, 2017, letter to Defendant that clarified that Plaintiff sought to represent a different class of employees from the\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   class. Mot. at 11 (citing ECF No. 12-2 at 3 (explaining that\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   covered only those that Defendant classified as \"employees\") ). This letter, Plaintiff claims, alerted Defendant to the identity of the members of the putative class, allowing it to make the arguments in favor of removal at that time. Second, Plaintiff relies on a letter that Defendant sent to Plaintiff a little over a month later, on September 27, 2017, which memorializes Defendant's understanding that the putative class covers those that Plaintiff believes that URS jointly employed, including parties to independent-contractor agreements or owner-operator agreements. Mot. at 12 (citing ECF No. 12-3). Plaintiff contends that this letter also put Defendant on notice about the scope of the putative class. Third is an email from Plaintiff's counsel to Defendant, dated October 10, 2017, that requested \"a ballpark estimate of the class size.\" Mot. at 12 (quoting ECF No. 12-4 at 6). Fourth is Plaintiff's response to Special Interrogatory No. 1, dated November 1, 2017, which stated Plaintiff's position that \"he and other 'drivers of Fleet owners' \" were non-exempt employees, contrary to Defendant's classification. Mot. at 12 (quoting ECF No. 12-5 at 4). Fifth is an email dated November 3, 2017, from Defendant to Plaintiff, in which Defendant stated that it was not in possession of any policies or procedures for \"drivers of fleet owners that we have been discussing.\" Mot. at 13 (quoting ECF No. 12-4 at 2.) This, Plaintiff contends, again demonstrates awareness of the class at issue. Sixth is Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which demonstrated an awareness that the class that Plaintiff sought to represent included drivers of Fleet Owners and was sufficient information to permit Defendant \"to calculate the amount in controversy as it ultimately did when it filed its Notice of Removal.\" Mot. at 13. Seventh, and finally, is Plaintiff's opposition to Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings, filed November 20, 2017, which Plaintiff contends included sufficient facts about the scope of the putative class to allow Defendant to make the calculations\n   that it ultimately did when it moved to remove. Plaintiff argues that each of these, covering a period from August 21, 2017, to November 20, 2017, signaled to Defendant that the putative class excluded the\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   class and included Fleet owners, and thus began the 30-day window for removal. Despite this knowledge, \"Defendant waited months to remove this matter based on the same facts it ascertained before Plaintiff filed his FAC.\" Reply at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   None of these triggered the 30-day removal window. Plaintiff cites a number of cases for the proposition that disclosures in \"other papers\" can serve to put a defendant on notice that the jurisdictional threshold for removal is met and begin the running of the 30-day window for removal. As Defendant correctly points out, however, in each of the cases Plaintiff cites, the \"other paper\" contained a specific indication that the jurisdictional threshold had been met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, even putting aside Defendant's objections to wheth\n   <strong>\n    e\n   </strong>\n   r the other papers that Plaintiff has identified truly were as illuminating about the nature of Plaintiff's claims as he argues,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff does not argue that any of the seven examples contains a straightforward declaration about the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. at 14 (\"Defendant has been aware that the putative class in this case excluded\n   <em>\n    Hooper\n   </em>\n   class members and included drivers of Fleet Owners since at least August 21, 2017 and could have made the same calculations it made in its Notice of Removal at that time.\"). None of them indicates the number of class members or the potential amount of money at issue; indeed, one of them asks\n   <em>\n    Defendant\n   </em>\n   to gather a \"ballpark estimate of the class size.\" A defendant is under no duty of inquiry where a document is indeterminate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   , 720 F.3d at 1125 (\"even if a defendant could have discovered grounds for removability through investigation, it does not lose the right to remove because it did not conduct such an investigation and then file a notice of removal within thirty days of receiving the indeterminate document\"). Under the Ninth Circuit's bright-line rule, without a clearer indication of removability, Defendant was not on notice as to the fact of removability, and the 30-day period did not begin to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Ninth Circuit's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Carvalho\n   </em>\n   is instructive. The plaintiff there stated in the complaint that she sought $25,000 in damages, though the complaint was silent\n   as to the damages claimed for the other 500 class members. Only at her deposition, when she testified that the amount in controversy was at least $25,000 per class member, could the defendant determine that at least $12.5 million was at issue in the aggregate, which was a paper triggering the 30-day removal window. None of the above instances that Plaintiff identifies comes close to identifying this level of specificity, either as to the number of putative class members or the potential damages at issue, and falls short of putting Defendant on notice that the case was removable. That Defendant was in possession of facts that did later permit it to conduct its own investigation and perform calculations that served as the basis for its notice of removal does not mean that it was required to do so or that it was required to do so at any particular time.\n   <em>\n    Kuxhausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535623\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/1136/\">\n    707 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1141 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Whether Defendant Waived Right To Removal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff next argues that Defendant waived the right to removal by moving for judgment on the pleadings, an affirmative act seeking a dispositive ruling that manifested an intent to submit to having the matter adjudicated in the state forum. A defendant \"may waive the right to remove to federal court where,\n   <em>\n    after it is apparent that the case is removable\n   </em>\n   , the defendant takes actions in state court that manifest his or her intent to have the matter adjudicated there, and to abandon his or her right to a federal forum.\"\n   <em>\n    Kenny v.

In\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   , a defendant in a class action filed a demurrer and motion to strike on the deadline for responding to the complaint. After filing the demurrer, and before the plaintiff had filed an opposition to the motion, the defendant removed to federal court under CAFA. Because the complaint was indeterminate as to removability, and the defendant discovered grounds for removal only through its own investigation, the Ninth Circuit held that the defendant had not waived its right to remove by participating in state court litigation prior to removing the case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275276\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/786/#p790\">\n    881 F.3d at 790-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's argument fails for the same reason that the \"other papers\" did not trigger removability. Because it was not apparent from the pleadings or other papers that the case was removable, Defendant did not consent to jurisdiction by filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Courts \"will not charge defendants with notice of removability until they have received a paper that gives them enough information to remove,\" and \"[a]s long as the complaint or an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper does not reveal that the case is removable, a defendant, in effect, may remove at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    Kenny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275276\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/786/#p790\">\n    881 F.3d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kuxhausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3535623\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/1136/\">\n    707 F.3d at 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Rea\n   </em>\n   , 742 F.3d at 1238 ) (internal alterations omitted). Here, without having received a complaint or other papers making it apparent that the case was removable, Defendant conducted its own investigation, determined that the case was removable, and removed to federal court.

Defendant assumed that though this claim also alleges a failure to pay putative class members for time worked before clocking in and after clocking out, it would assume only a daily failure to pay for a 30-minute meal period.

Plaintiff argues that the use of the word \"may,\" coupled with a lack of specificity with respect to the exact files consulted to produce the estimate, renders the testimony speculative and falls short of meeting the evidentiary burden. Madison's supplemental declaration clarifies that he reviewed \"the available records for drivers of Fleet Owners, which contains the name of the driver, the fleet he or she drove for, and the date range that the driver drove for the Fleet Owner (with respect to URS pickups or deliveries),\" then counted the drivers listed on these records to determine that there are between 160 and 182 people in that group during the relevant timeframe.

In his supplemental declaration, Madison explains that for each driver, he examined the document containing the names, Fleet Owner for which the driver drove, and the date\n   range that the driver worked, calculated the number of days a driver drove for a Fleet Owner (the difference between the date the driver began driving and the last date on which the driver worked), then divided the number of days by seven to get the approximate number of weeks each driver drove for the Fleet Owner. Madison Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. In other words, he approximated the number of weeks that elapsed between a driver's first day and last day and assumed that each of them worked during each week in between.

Cal. 2010), but a defendant does need to come forward with reasonable and supported calculations of the amount in controversy. Madison's estimate of the number of work weeks at issue accounts for no vacation time or other time off that a driver may take over the course of the five years at issue here and fails to explain why the estimate does not account for the actual percentage of work weeks that an average driver can reasonably be expected to work during his or her time driving for Fleet Owners. It instead assumes that every driver worked a full work week during the entire term of their driving for the Fleet Owners. The Court does not find it reasonable to assume that every driver worked every possible week during the entirety of the class period. Without any information about why this is a reasonable assumption, the Court is not persuaded that it is proper to assume that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   class member worked every possible week during the period at issue and cannot accept for purposes of calculating the amount in controversy that this is a reasonable assumption for\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   class member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   That the calculations supporting the amount in controversy are anchored to a number of work weeks that accounts for no vacation time or other time off for any putative class member over the course of the five years at issue, without explanation for how much time off each driver might be expected to take or why it did not account for the actual percentage of work weeks that a driver might reasonably be expected to work, leaves the Court unable to assess the reasonableness of the calculations using this number.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20933506\">\n    2018 WL 933506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (crediting declaration from defendant's employee, finding that the \"workweek calculation accounting for sick and/or vacation time generates a more reasonable and specific estimate than calculating the workweeks solely based on each class member's dates of employment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Calculation Of Amount In Controversy For Wage Statement Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant's calculation of the amount in controversy for the wage statement claim is speculative because the calculation assumed that each of the 125 drivers who drove for fleets within the one-year period prior to the filing of the Complaint would be subject to the maximum statutory penalty of $4000. He objects on two grounds. First, he argues that Defendant provided no evidence that all of the 125 drivers worked every pay period. Second, he contends that Defendant provided no evidence about the frequency with which drivers were paid. California Labor Code \u00a7 226 provides for damages up to $50 for the initial pay period and up to $100 for each subsequent violation per pay period per employee.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20226\">\n    Cal.

If drivers were paid biweekly, rather than weekly, as Defendant assumed when calculating the amount in controversy for this claim, then the amount at issue would be reduced substantially, from Defendant's estimate of\n   $500,000 to approximately $318,750.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, Defendant points to Plaintiff's testimony that he received paychecks on a weekly basis as support for its assumption of a weekly pay period. Opp. at 17-18; ECF No. 13-2. It also calculated the number of weeks that class members worked in the last year and determined that a more accurate estimate of the total amount in controversy for this claim was $423,650. Madison Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes that $423,650 is the appropriate figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Hourly Rate Used To Calculate Amount In Controversy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff objects that the hourly rate Defendant used to calculate the amount in controversy is unsupported and speculative. Madison states in his declaration, \"I understand that Plaintiff alleges in this case that he is, was, or should be considered a URS employee. Based on this allegation, and without conceding its truth, URS pays its actual employee drivers an average of approximately $25.24 an hour (before any bonuses).\" This $25.24 figure serves as the basis for nearly all of Defendant's calculations to demonstrate that the amount is at issue exceeds the $5 million jurisdictional threshold. Madison does not explain what records he examined to come to this conclusion. Nor does he explain whether the \"employee drivers\" differ in kind, such as in level of experience, or in pay from drivers who did not contract directly with URS. Importantly, the figure he offers appears to be the average hourly wage the company\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   pays its drivers. The declarations do not even attempt to establish what Defendant paid its drivers-to say nothing of what any drivers working through Fleet Owners were paid-in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, or 2013. Defendant offers nothing to support the idea that this was the average rate paid to the class of drivers Plaintiff seeks to represent beginning\n   <em>\n    more than five years ago\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff demonstrates the importance of the hourly wage by performing the same calculations that Defendant did in the notice of removal, but with an hourly rate of $24, rather than $25.24. Even holding constant all other assumptions that Defendant used when performing the calculations, Plaintiff's calculations show that using an hourly rate of $24 would drop the calculations below the $5 million threshold. The Court also ran the calculations using hourly rates of $22 or $20 for further points of reference:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Straight Time Wages\n   </strong>\n   : (hourly rate) x 0.5 hours per day x 5 days per week x 9588 work weeks\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $605,002.80\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 $24: $575,280\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 $22: $527,340\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 $20: $479,400\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Overtime\n   </strong>\n   : (hourly rate) x 1.5 overtime rate x 2.5 hours per week x 9588 work weeks\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $907,504.20\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 $24: $862,920\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 $22: $791,010\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 $20: $719,100\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Meal Periods\n   </strong>\n   : (hourly rate) x 1 hour per day x 5 days per week x 9588 work weeks\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $1,210,005.60\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 $24: $1,150,560\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 $22: $1,054,680\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 $20: $958,800\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Rest Periods\n   </strong>\n   : (hourly rate) x 1 hour per day x 5 days per week x 9588 work weeks\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $1,210,005.60\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   \u2022 $24: $1,150,560\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   \u2022 $22: $1,054,680\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 $20: $958,800\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Wage Statement\n   </strong>\n   : $423,650\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Waiting Time Penalties\n   </strong>\n   : (hourly rate) x 8 hours x 30 days x 124 drivers\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $751,440\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 $24: $714,240\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 $22: $654,720\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 $20: $595,200\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022\n   <strong>\n    Total\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 $25.24: $5,107,608.20\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 $24: $4,877,210\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \u2022 $22: $4,577,990\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \u2022 $20: $4,134,950\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"[T]he average wage of class members during the relevant period is an acceptable method on which to base the amount-in-controversy calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20933506\">\n    2018 WL 933506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Defendant admits that it does not know what the class members were paid on an hourly basis, and it has not provided sufficient support for the figure it did choose. As demonstrated above, the hourly wage substantially affects the amount in controversy calculation. If the number of work weeks is less than 9588-which it more than likely is, given that that number represents the unrealistic scenario in which class members drove every possible week-then the calculations would result in additionally reduced figures. Depending on the appropriate average hourly wage and number of work weeks at issue, even holding the other assumptions constant, the calculations that Defendant performed to demonstrate the amount in controversy could well fall below $5 million or $4 million. Without more information, the Court cannot make that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In short, Defendant has offered little to support the rate it has chosen to serve as the anchor of its calculations supporting its contention that the amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold.

Courts in CAFA wage-and-hour cases also routinely decline to add prospective attorneys' fees to the amount in controversy, and there remains a split within this Circuit on the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20679451\">\n    2018 WL 679451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant's notice of removal points to the attorneys' fees awarded in a \"similar employment case\" bringing allegations similar to the ones here brought by the same counsel representing Plaintiff here. In that case, counsel sought fees in the amount of $375,000. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 26. The notice of removal contended that because the amount in controversy based on the non-attorneys' fees calculations were over the $5 million jurisdictional threshold, the $375,000 in potential attorneys' fees-which could be even higher in a case proceeding to trial rather than settling-increased the amount in controversy even further beyond the jurisdictional requirement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   That argument assumed the propriety of using $25.24 as the proper average hourly wage and that the other assumptions in the calculations performed in connection with the notice of removal were correct. If $375,000 in attorneys' fees were added to the amounts calculated using a $22 hourly wage, even holding all other assumptions constant, the total would not exceed the $5 million threshold. Defendant argues in opposition to Plaintiff's motion to remand that its fee estimate \"is even more conservative than warranted\" given that courts, including this one,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   generally use a 25% benchmark to calculate potential attorneys' fees in calculating the amount in controversy in CAFA cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court need not reach the issue of how attorneys' fees apply in CAFA cases such as this one.
