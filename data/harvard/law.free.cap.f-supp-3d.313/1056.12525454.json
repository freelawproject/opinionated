Orrick, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case stems from the purported interest of defendants Ubiquiti Network, Inc., Ubiquiti Networks International Limited (UNIL), and Ching-Han Tsai to review and evaluate for licensing plaintiff Synopsys, Inc.'s semiconductor electronic design and automation software. In its Second Amended Complaint, Synopsys alleges that defendants fraudulently gained access to its copyrighted software and related support materials and used evaluation license keys and counterfeit keys to repeatedly and illegally access and copy those programs and materials over the course of three years. When defendants' alleged conduct was discovered by Synopsys-through embedded \"piracy tracking\" tools (as described by Synopsys) or \"spyware\" (as described by defendants)-Synopsys sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ubiquiti and UNIL counterclaimed based on Synopsys's use of the piracy tracking tools. They argue that Synopsys's conduct-hiding or failing to disclose the presence and operation of the anti-piracy software, using the anti-piracy software to access information on defendants' systems, and then sharing defendants' confidential information with third-parties-violated the parties' master non-disclosure agreement (MNDA) as well as federal and state computer abuse and common laws. UNIL alleges the following counterclaims: (1) declaratory relief; (2) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; (3) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Computer Data Access Fraud Act; (4) Trespass to Personal Property and Chattels; (5) Conversion; (6) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), Civil RICO; (7) violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), RICO Conspiracy; and (8) Fraud. Ubiquiti currently has counterclaimed only for declaratory relief and breach of contract, but seeks leave to amend to match the counterclaims asserted by UNIL (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , adding the federal and state computer abuse and common law claims).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Synopsys moves to dismiss UNIL's counterclaims, arguing that the counterclaims are either barred or inadequately pleaded. Similarly, Synopsys argues Ubiquiti's motion for leave to amend should be denied because of undue delay and prejudice in seeking leave, but also because amendment would be futile because the claims Ubiquiti seeks to allege (like UNIL's) are barred or inadequately pleaded. Finally, Synopsys moves to strike the state law counterclaims asserted by UNIL under California's anti-SLAPP statute, because those claims are based on Synopsys' privileged pre-litigation conduct in identifying\n   what it believed were defendants' acts of piracy and seeking pre-litigation settlement of those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As discussed below, defendants' theory of fraud is implausible and I agree in many respects with the arguments in Synopsys's motion. I GRANT the motion to dismiss UNIL's counterclaims. I DENY Ubiquiti's motion for leave to amend its counterclaims without prejudice and DENY Synopsys's motion to strike without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The background to Synopsys's claims against defendants are laid out in full in my August 2017 Order. For purposes of ruling on the pending motions, I will focus on the allegations in Ubiquiti's existing counterclaims and those made in UNIL's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of the parties' agreement to allow Ubiquiti to review Synopsys's software, the parties entered into a master non-disclosure agreement (MNDA) to allow for the confidential exchange of information between the parties. UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 34-35, 40.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ubiquiti signed the MNDA on October 15, 2013, and Synopsys executed it on November 25, 2013. UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint (SAC) \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants allege that Synopsys formed an \"Enterprise\" with QuatreWave LLC d/b/a SmartFlow Compliance Solutions (SmartFlow) and related-entity IT Compliance Association (\"ITCA\"), and the founders and current officers of those companies (Ted Miracco and Chris Luijten). The Enterprise placed SmartFlow's \"phone-home\" \"spyware\" in Synopsys' software programs. UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 8-16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   UNIL alleges that SmartFlow and ITCA \"work in partnership in schemes to generate revenue for software companies by targeting supposed unlicensed uses of their customers' software.\" UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6 11. As part of that effort:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   SmartFlow's spyware is embedded at least into that company's software and subsequently used to monitor and collect data from computers, servers, and unsuspecting individuals who use or have access to that software. The data includes individuals' personally identifiable information, such as user names and email addresses, the software programs and features accessed by users, and the locations, dates, and times of access. SmartFlow then shares the data that it collects and the identity of the suspected unlicensed users with its software customers. SmartFlow also offers the services of its sister company ITCA, who uses various coercive techniques to pressure individuals to pay exorbitant fees or other compensation to the software company for the alleged unlicensed uses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   UNIL Counterclaim \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   UNIL asserts (and Ubiquiti wants to allege) that Synopsys concealed the presence of the spyware in the products that was downloaded pursuant to the parties' agreements onto Ubiquiti and UNIL's servers and computers. UNIL contends that Synopsys's license evaluation and MNDA agreements fail to disclose the presence and operation of this spyware in its products. UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 17, 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   UNIL states that Synopsys together with ITCA and SmartFlow use the spyware to identify, often mistakenly, unauthorized users of Synopsys's software in order to \"extract exorbitant license fees under the threat of litigation.\" UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18-25. UNIL identifies five lawsuits Synopsys filed based on unlicensed use of its software and alleges on information and belief that the facts regarding unauthorized use in those suits were obtained from phone-home spyware and that the Enterprise monitored, collected, and transmitted the confidential information of the defendants in those cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 18-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   UNIL asserts that the Enterprise likewise monitored, collected, and transmitted UNIL and Ubiquiti's confidential information through the spyware in violation of the MNDA, unbeknownst to UNIL or Ubiquiti, and without their consent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 29-36, 40, 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

ITCA made that disclosure and contact in order to convince Ubiquiti to pay \"exorbitant fees\" for the Synopsys software programs allegedly accessed by UNIL and Ubiquiti employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 51-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ubiquiti and UNIL argue that Synopsys delayed notifying them of the matter until two and one-half years after Synopsys had notice in order to allow the Enterprise to keep collecting confidential information and enlarge the period over which Synopsys could claim damages in the form of retroactive license fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    \u00b6 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In opposing Ubiquiti's motion for leave to amend and in support of its separate motion to strike UNIL's state law counterclaims, Synopsys relies on evidence that in order for Tsai to download Synopsys' software in December 2013 (which is when Tsai admits he downloaded Synopsys software initially: UNIL Counterclaim \u00b6 41; Ubiquiti's Proposed Counterclaims \u00b6 42), Tsai would have had to \"click through\" a notice and agreement that disclosed that \"Licensed Products communicate with Synopsys services for the purpose of ... detecting software piracy and verifying that customers are using Licensed Products in conformity with the applicable License Key\" and that Synopsys will use that information to \"pursue software pirates and infringers.\" Declaration of Norman F.

However, this third-party discovery (or motion practice) will arguably be required if UNIL's counterclaims stand after Synopsys's motion to dismiss, irrespective of whether Ubiquiti is given leave to amend. Therefore, prejudice could be demonstrated only if UNIL's counterclaims are dismissed and then Ubiquiti was given leave to amend.

Ubiquiti's motion for leave to amend is DENIED as to the CFAA, without prejudice.

However, other courts faced with allegations that embedded software was \"deeply hidden\" so that plaintiffs had no notice it \"was operating, and they had no way to remove the software or to opt-out of its functionality\" have concluded that voluntary installation does not defeat the CCDAFA claim.\n   <em>\n    In re Carrier IQ, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/#p1101\">\n    78 F.Supp.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1101 (N.D.

UNIL Counterclaim \u00b6 106. These allegations adequately allege access was \"without permission\" under the CCDAFA to the areas of defendants' systems \"wholly unconnected to the areas where Synopsys' evaluation software operated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266042\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/78/1051/#p1101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Knowing Access\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As an additional ground to dismiss under CCDAFA, Synopsys argues that defendants need to but have not pleaded facts that could show that Synopsys\n   <em>\n    subjectively\n   </em>\n   believed that it lacked permission to access defendants' computers in the way it did given defendants' voluntary actions downloading Synopsys's software, including the anti-piracy component. With particular respect to UNIL, Synopsys argues there are no allegations that UNIL and Synopsys had an agreement (like the MNDA with Ubiquiti) to not disclose information that it secured, no allegations of breach of terms of use, and no allegation that Synopsys did anything to circumvent technical barriers. However, this argument ignores defendants' claims that the hidden anti-piracy exceeded the contemplated and authorized use of defendants' data by Synopsys' software. Defendants could not have given permission for activities that Synopsys knew (or were alleged to have known) were hidden from defendants' knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Contaminant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants also argue that they have separately pleaded a claim under Section 502(c)(8), which does not contain a \"without permission\" requirement, but does require a \"contaminant\" to have been placed in defendants' computers. As explained in\n   <em>\n    Flextronics International, Ltd. v.

Use of Data and CUTSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In addition to the pleading deficiency arguments, Synopsys contends that to the extent that defendants' CCDAFA claims are based on misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information, the claims are preempted by California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA). Synopsys points to a line of cases holding that where there are allegations of misappropriation of information, even if that information does not meet the high standard of a protectable trade secret, any claim based on the misappropriation of that information is nonetheless preempted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waymo LLC v.

Enterprise/Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   A RICO enterprise has three elements: (1) a common purpose, (2) an ongoing organization, and (3) a continuing unit.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335799\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/763/#p780\">\n    828 F.3d 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780 (9th Cir. 2015). Synopsys argues, first, that defendants have not pleaded these elements because they have only pleaded (and can only plead) facts showing legitimate and arms-length business dealings between Synopsys, the supplier of its anti-piracy software, and its enforcement agent ITCA, all of whom are engaged in permissible anti-piracy endeavors. Because all three's endeavors are consistent with a legitimate business purpose, there can be no inference of a RICO enterprise with a common, illegal purpose. Synopsys MTD at 15. The cases relied on by Synopsys for this point are well-taken as to the RICO conspiracy claim, but do not preclude a direct RICO claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   However, other deficiencies in the enterprise allegations exist. For example, defendants have failed to plead that anyone other than Synopsys had knowledge of the only predicate act-the wire fraud-because there are no allegations that SmartFlow or ITCA were aware of the MNDA and negotiations regarding access to Synopsys' software. MTD at 15-16. The existence of the MNDA is key to the effectuation of the enterprise's fraud (enticing victims to download Synopsys' software with false assurances the victims' confidential information will not be used against them). Similarly, Synopsys points out that there is no evidence that SmartFlow or ITCA were involved in the litigations filed by Synopsys against alleged unlicensed users of its software, yet these \"improper\" litigations are really the only facts supporting the purpose and longevity elements. Defendants' enterprise allegations are deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Predicate Acts/Pattern of Racketeering Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   To plead a RICO pattern, at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity need to be alleged.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). Synopsys argues that only one instance of wire fraud has been alleged-the entering into the MNDA by Ubiquiti-which is insufficient to allege a pattern. Defendants discuss other \"wire acts,\" including the actual downloading of the Synopsys software, but defendants identify no\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   representations or omissions that occurred in connection with those downloads. The downloads are merely the effectuation of the initial fraud. As to the May 2016 communications from ITCA (by letter and subsequent email), defendants do not assert that the ITCA communications were fraudulent in and of themselves (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , they intentionally misstated or overstated the use of Synopsys's software by defendants),\n   only that they were part of the otherwise fraudulent scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Defendants might also intend to rely on the \"information and belief\" conduct that Synopsys and its Enterprise associates undertook with respect to the other lawsuits identified, in support of the pattern of racketeering element. UNIL Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 19-23. But information and belief is insufficient. Facts must be stated to support a charge that Synopsys or its Enterprise associates committed acts of wire\n   <em>\n    fraud\n   </em>\n   with respect to those lawsuits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As currently stated, the one predicate act of wire fraud identified-the initial discussion about and provision of the MNDA that was \"false and misleading\"-is insufficient to establish the requisite number of predicate acts or the pattern of racketeering activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Proximate Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Another significant flaw with UNIL's RICO claim is the lack of proximate cause between the fraud alleged and the harm suffered.

Because UNIL did not sign the MNDA, because UNIL voluntarily downloaded Synopsys's software, because UNIL then (allegedly) continued to use that software after the evaluation license period, and because the ITCA communications were sent to Ubiquiti (not UNIL), any harm to\n   <em>\n    UNIL\n   </em>\n   is too remote and indirect from the fraudulent conduct alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

UNIL's RICO counterclaims fail for this independent reason; it fails to plead injury to its business or property in the United States, as opposed to a \"foreign injury.\" Mindful of UNIL's repeated protestations in this case that it has no presence in California and did no business in California, facts supporting a domestic injury have not been alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   More generally, Synopsys argues that both defendants have failed to allege facts showing they were \"injured\" in their business or property by the alleged RICO conduct. Defendants counter that because the \"extent\" of the information secured by the anti-piracy tools in Synopsys's software is currently unknown, the extent of defendants' injuries are unknown. UNIL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Counterclaims \u00b6\u00b6 105-106. Defendants, however, are required to allege more than they were \"damaged\" by the RICO conduct.

As noted above,\n   <em>\n    Noerr-Pennington\n   </em>\n   does not bar the CCDAFA claims. But the result is different for RICO, given the nature of RICO scheme as pleaded by defendants (a fraudulent scheme to extort license fees).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UNIL Counterclaim \u00b6 14 (\"the purpose of exploiting personal and proprietary information from Synopsys's software users to generate revenue for Synopsys, SmartFlow, and ITCA based on the 'recovery' of Synopsys's license fees\"); \u00b6 95 (\"the common purpose of implementing a compliance program for Synopsys to recover license fees and to convert suspected unlicensed users of Synopsys' EDA software to licensed customers\"); \u00b6 104 (\"exploited for the purpose of making exorbitant license fee demands to those users.

As such, defendants must plead facts showing that the pre-suit license demands and subsequent litigations they rely on as evidence of the RICO Enterprise's purpose were objectively baseless\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   based on improper motives. All that has been alleged to date is that the Enterprise associates (Synopsys, SmartFlow, ITCA, Luijten, and Miracco) have sought to enforce Synopsys's software rights, and that in some instances the information relied on by the Enterprise associates to enforce those rights might not have been \"accurate.\" UNIL Counterclaim \u00b6 12.

Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Synopsys makes a number of well-taken attacks on UNIL's fraud claims, primarily that UNIL was not a party to the MNDA and has not identified any fraudulent misstatements directed to it, as opposed to Ubiquiti. Those omissions are significant in the context of this case, where UNIL has repeatedly emphasized that it is a separate legal entity from Ubiquiti and that Tsai (the primary negotiator with Synopsys) did not work for UNIL. Given that context, it is questionable whether UNIL could plead reliance on the MNDA or on representations made by Synopsys, or damages suffered from a breach of the\n   MNDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   As to both defendants, Synopsys relies on the actual text of the MNDA-which is incorporated by reference given the repeated reference to it in UNIL's existing and Ubiquiti's proposed counterclaims. Synopsys argues that the information allegedly fraudulently procured from defendants-IP addresses, MAC addresses, user names, host names, user accounts, email addresses, workstation information, system administrators, IT system logs-is not included within the MNDA's definition of \"confidential information\" nor covered by the \"purpose\" of the MNDA. MTD 23-24; Oppo. at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   However, I need not analyze the language of the MNDA. The fatal problem with defendants' theory of fraud has been identified above; the current allegations are implausible because they rely on too many intervening steps that were beyond the control of Synopsys. Synopsys did not force either defendant to use its software beyond the period of the evaluation licenses. But that conduct-defendants voluntary use of Synopsys's software that defendants do not deny-lies at the heart of the fraudulent scheme alleged. As to plausibility, defendants offer no real response. At most they argue that because Synopsys let defendants impermissibly use its software for two years after the expiration of the evaluation licenses before it decided to have ITCA go after defendants, their theory is somehow plausible. MTD at 25. It is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   UNIL's fraud claim is DISMISSED with leave to amend. Ubiquiti's motion for leave to include a fraud counterclaim is DENIED without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Synopsys's motion to dismiss UNIL's counterclaims is GRANTED. UNIL's second through eighth counterclaims are DISMISSED with leave to amend. Ubiquiti's motion for leave to amend its existing counterclaims to assert ones consistent with UNIL's is DENIED without prejudice due to futility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SPECIAL MOTION TO STRIKE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Synopsys also moves to strike UNIL's state law counterclaims. It argues that it satisfies the first prong of the anti-SLAPP statute because the elements of UNIL's state law counterclaims demonstrate that those claims are aimed at chilling Synopsys's right to enforce its copyrights through pre-litigation demand letters and litigation. On the second prong, Synopsys argues that UNIL's state law claims are barred by the litigation privilege and that UNIL cannot otherwise prevail on those claims because Synopsys's terms of use in place during the relevant timeframe disclosed that Synopsys's software would communicate with Synopsys' servers to detect software piracy and verify only licensed use of its software.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration Norman F.

Synopsys's motion to strike is DENIED without prejudice.
