On November 13, 2016, Wright was confined at the jail when two inmates began \"picking on\" another inmate. (Doc. No. 1, Complaint \u00b6 8). This prompted the jail administrator to \"chastise[ ]\" the other inmates for not doing anything to stop the altercation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9). Shortly thereafter, Sheriff Cravens entered the housing unit and \"screamed at the inmates and told them they should not be able to look at themselves in a mirror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   He also challenged their collective manhood.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). When Wright spoke up on behalf of his fellow inmates, Sheriff Cravens became \"visibly irate\" and ordered Wright to follow him to the booking area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once in the booking area, Sheriff Cravens \"continued to berate\" Wright, and struck him in the head. Wright was then \"shot with a taser and incapacitated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). Thereafter, Wright was \"placed in a headlock and handcuffed, ... struck two (2) to three (3) more times in the head by [Sheriff] Cravens, and \"then kicked ... in the back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the assault, Wright was placed \"in an isolated, padded holding cell\" that had \"no running water or facilities of any kind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Four days later he was placed in a different, isolated, holding cell for an additional four weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). He was then allowed to return to general population where he served out the remainder of his sentence without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wright was not charged with a crime or a jail policy violation in relation to these events. Sheriff Cravens, on the other hand, was criminally charged in this Court with depriving Wright of his federal constitutional rights. Sheriff Cravens pled guilty to the charges on April 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wright claims that, as a result of the events that began on November 13, 2016, he \"suffered injuries and/or damages, including, but not limited to, mental anguish, physical and mental pain and suffering, embarrassment, and humiliation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16).

In\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   , the Mayor of Waterbury, Connecticut had sexual intercourse with minors in his office, home, and a police vehicle, using a city-owned cellphone to arrange the rendezvous. Notwithstanding the reprehensibility of those acts, municipal liability did not attach because neither the Sheriff or the Mayor was acting as a policymaker. Even though the Sheriff in\n   <em>\n    Wooten\n   </em>\n   allegedly \"used his 'blue lights and police light' to pull over [the] car, and utilized his 'uniform, badge and gun' to effectuate the rape, [the Sheriff] acted in the guise of a patrol officer making a traffic stop-not as chief law enforcement officer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Fed.%20Appx.%20143\">\n    92 Fed.Appx. at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Other times, he took inmates from the jail in a county truck to his trailer where he and the inmates would engage in sex. On a least one occasion, this was preceded by a stop at the local Dairy Queen for some ice cream. On some occasions, Sheriff Cravens was seen by members of the public riding alone with jail inmates, while other times \"[c]ounty deputies and employees facilitated the Plaintiffs' abuse by transporting plaintiff to locations within and outside the jail where the deputies and employees left the Plaintiff alone with Defendant Cravens for his sexual gratification.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs allege that Sheriff Craven \"routinely instructed employees of the Fentress County Sheriff's department to bring cigarettes and other favors to Jane Doe # 1 and Jane Doe # 2, in furtherance of his grooming the inmates for further sexual predation.\" Guards would also joke about the escapades....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3-4 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Doe # 1\n   </em>\n   , Wright does not allege a pattern and practice of civil rights violations by Sheriff Cravens, a\n   failure to train or enforce policies that would prohibit unconstitutional acts, or even that the Sheriff ran the department like a \"personal fiefdom\" that was widely known by county residents. Rather, Wright alleges a transient constitutional violation by Sheriff Cravens acting in his role as a policymaker for the Fentress County jail.
