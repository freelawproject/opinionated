In the case before me, Plaintiffs-TELA Bio, Inc. (\"TELA Bio\") and its individual co-founders, Anthony Koblish and Maarten Persenaire-seek a judicial declaration that Defendant, Federal Insurance Company (\"Federal Insurance\"), had a duty to defend them in the underlying state suit, under an insurance policy that Federal Insurance issued to TELA Bio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending are Federal Insurance's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, and TELA Bio's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. For the reasons that follow, Federal Insurance's Motion will be granted. Accordingly, I need not reach TELA Bio's Motion, which will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are derived from TELA Bio's Complaint and the exhibits attached thereto, which include the complaint in the underlying state suit and the insurance policy at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Underlying Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff in the underlying state suit, LifeCell Corporation (\"LifeCell\"), is a \"regenerative medicine company.\" Founded in 1986, LifeCell develops and sells \"tissue repair and replacement products\" used in reconstructive surgeries such as breast reconstruction and hernia repair. (Compl., Ex. 2 (cited hereinafter as \"LifeCell Suit Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, LifeCell's former director of research and development, David McQuillan, co-founded a new company, TELA Bio, allegedly to develop a hernia repair product to compete with LifeCell.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   To develop and market its competing product, TELA Bio allegedly recruited and hired more than 20 LifeCell employees, knowing that those employees were prohibited from working for TELA Bio due to non-competition covenants. Several of these employees allegedly provided TELA Bio with trade secrets and other proprietary information regarding both the design of LifeCell's products and LifeCell's strategies to market those products. (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 214-247, 251.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In March 2015, LifeCell filed suit in New Jersey state court. (This suit is referred to hereinafter as the \"LifeCell Suit.\") Named as defendants in the LifeCell Suit were TELA Bio and two individuals who, along with McQuillan, co-founded TELA Bio-Anthony Koblish and Maarten Persenaire. (The defendants in the LifeCell Suit, all of which are Plaintiffs in this action, are referred to hereinafter collectively as \"TELA Bio.\") The LifeCell Suit Complaint set out six causes of action against TELA Bio: (1) misappropriation of trade secrets in violation of the New Jersey Trade Secrets Act; (2) misappropriation of proprietary information under New Jersey common law; (3) unfair competition under the New Jersey Unfair Competition Act and New Jersey common law; (4) tortious interference with contract and prospective economic advantage; (5) civil conspiracy; and (6) unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6 10; LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 214-229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Insurance Policy Federal Insurance Issued to TELA Bio\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The insurance policy at issue is a commercial general liability policy issued by Federal Insurance to TELA Bio on February 5, 2013 (hereinafter \"the Policy\"). While the Policy contains numerous coverage provisions, TELA Bio seeks coverage for the LifeCell Suit under only one of these provisions, entitled \"Advertising Injury and Personal Injury Liability Coverage.\" This provision, in relevant part, covers \"damages and\n   <strong>\n    claimant costs\n   </strong>\n   that the\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   becomes legally obligated to pay ... for ...\n   <strong>\n    personal injury\n   </strong>\n   that is caused by an offense to which this coverage applies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy, in turn, sets out five \"offense[s]\" to which this coverage applies, only one of which is applicable here: \"electronic, oral, written or other publication of material that ... libels or slanders a person or organization (which does not include disparagement of goods, products, property, or services).\" (This provision is referred to hereinafter as the \"Libel and Slander Provision.\") The terms \"publication,\" \"libel,\" and \"slander\" are not defined in the Policy. (Compl. \u00b6 8; Compl., Ex. 1 (cited hereinafter as \"Policy\"), Doc. No. 1-3 at 73, Doc. No. 1-4 at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    According to the complaint in the underlying state suit, McQuillan co-founded TELA Bio surreptitiously, and in violation of non-competition, confidentiality, and other covenants.

The IP Rights Exclusion provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    A.

Believing that Federal Insurance would refuse to defend it, TELA Bio shortly thereafter brought this declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking a declaration that the LifeCell Suit is covered by the Policy's Libel and Slander Provision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Federal Insurance moved to transfer venue to this Court, and the Honorable Freda L. Wolfson granted that motion in an Opinion dated October 25, 2016. Following transfer of venue to this Court, the parties filed the motions presently before me. (10/25/2016 Op., Doc. No. 1-41.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In its Motion to Dismiss, Federal Insurance contends that TELA Bio has failed to state a claim for two reasons. First, Federal Insurance maintains that it had no duty to defend the LifeCell Suit because none of the factual allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint triggered coverage under the Policy's Libel and Slander Provision. Second, Federal Insurance contends that, even if the allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint triggered coverage under the Policy's Libel and Slander Provision, the Policy's IP Rights Exclusion precludes coverage for the entire suit such that Federal Insurance had no duty to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    For the reasons that follow, I conclude that Federal Insurance is correct on both points, and will therefore dismiss this action with prejudice for failure to state a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     II.\n     <em>\n      LEGAL STANDARD\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    To survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a complaint must \"contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v.

TELA Bio maintains that New Jersey law applies, noting that both Federal Insurance and LifeCell have their principal\n    place of business in New Jersey, and that the LifeCell Suit was filed in New Jersey state court and involved New Jersey state law claims. Federal Insurance contends that Pennsylvania law applies, noting that while its principal place of business is in New Jersey, the Policy was issued in Pennsylvania by a Pennsylvania broker, and that the insureds-TELA Bio as well as the individual insureds, Koblish and Persenaire-are Pennsylvania residents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    A federal court in Pennsylvania exercising diversity jurisdiction generally must apply Pennsylvania choice of law rules to decide which state's law applies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Klaxon Co. v.

In their ordinary sense, the terms \"libel\" and \"slander\" refer to one's defaming of another, differing only in whether such defamation was done by writing or speech.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    999 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \"libel\" as \"a defamatory statement expressed in a fixed medium, esp. writing\"),\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 1514 (defining \"slander\" as \"a defamatory assertion expressed in a transitory form, esp. speech\").

TELA Bio responds that it can be inferred from certain allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint that TELA Bio made defamatory statements about LifeCell to LifeCell's employees and potential customers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    These allegations are of generally three varieties: (1) allegations that TELA Bio described its own product as the \"next generation\" of one of LifeCell's products; (2) allegations that TELA Bio \"exploited\" or \"used\" LifeCell's \"reputation\" and \"goodwill\" to LifeCell's detriment; and (3) allegations that TELA Bio induced LifeCell's employees to leave LifeCell and join TELA Bio by telling them that it had a \"strategy\" to avoid violating their non-competition covenants. As discussed in greater detail below, even reading these allegations liberally, as I must, none of them support an inference that TELA Bio made defamatory statements about LifeCell, such that coverage was triggered under the Policy's Libel and Slander Provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    First, TELA Bio points to an allegation in the LifeCell Suit Complaint that a TELA Bio representative described its own product as the \"next generation\" of one of LifeCell's hernia repair products, \"Strattice.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 256 (\"[A] T[ELA] Bio representative has described T[ELA] Bio's product as 'next generation Strattice.' \") ) This statement, TELA Bio contends, \"is a defamatory publication,\" because it \"impugn[s] LifeCell's purported status as a state of the art participant in the hernia repair marketplace in which both companies compete\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    and because it \"necessarily claim[s] that LifeCell is not state of the art.\" (TELA Bio's Br. in Resp. to Federal Insurance's Mot. to Dismiss, Doc. No. 24 (cited hereinafter as \"TELA Bio's Resp.), 14.) I do not find \"defamation\" to be a reasonable inference from this alleged statement, which is no more than a typical marketing phrase about TELA Bio's own product. If anything, the statement affirms the quality of LifeCell's \"Strattice\" product by suggesting that TELA Bio has developed an enhanced version of it. But the statement does not suggest that LifeCell has not (or could not) itself develop a \"state of the art\" product, and it certainly does not implicate questions of harm to LifeCell's reputation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Second, TELA Bio points to several allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint that TELA Bio \"exploited\" or \"used\" LifeCell's reputation to its own benefit and to LifeCell's detriment. Specifically, TELA Bio references the following allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    \u2022 \"T[ELA] Bio's scheme allows T[ELA] Bio to compete\n    <em>\n     unfairly\n    </em>\n    with LifeCell for hernia repair business because ... [m]ost, if not all, of T[ELA] Bio's sales force consists of former LifeCell representatives that can use their former affiliation with LifeCell-and the reputation and goodwill associated with LifeCell's name and brand-to LifeCell's detriment.\" (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 253.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    \u2022 \"T[ELA] Bio's mass poaching and recruitment of LifeCell's former employees is unlawful appropriation of LifeCell's reputation and goodwill....\" (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 254.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    \u2022 \"[A]t least one customer that was approached by T[ELA] Bio had the impression that T[ELA] Bio was simply using the credibility of LifeCell employees to sell its product quickly.\" (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 255.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    \u2022 \"LifeCell is reasonably apprehensive that T[ELA] Bio will market its product as 'developed by LifeCell scientists' and 'sold by your trusted LifeCell reps.' That strategy exploits LifeCell's reputation and goodwill.\" (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 257.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    TELA Bio contends that these allegations \"evidence[ ] defamation\" because they suggest that TELA Bio \"question[ed] LifeCell's capacity to perform, emphasizing its loss of employees to TELA Bio\" and \"asserted that it possessed superior intellectual property rights.\" (TELA Bio's Resp. 3-4.) I disagree that these allegations create a reasonable inference that TELA Bio defamed LifeCell. Quite the opposite of suggesting that TELA Bio defamed LifeCell by saddling it (LifeCell) with a\n    <em>\n     bad\n    </em>\n    reputation, these allegations accuse TELA Bio of seeking to trade on LifeCell's\n    <em>\n     good\n    </em>\n    reputation in order to market its own competing product. And again, coverage is only provided for damages caused by publication of material that \"libels or slanders a person or organization.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Third, TELA Bio highlights allegations in the LifeCell Complaint that TELA Bio induced LifeCell employees to leave LifeCell and join TELA Bio by telling them that it had a \"strategy\" to avoid violating their non-competition covenants. Specifically, the LifeCell Suit Complaint contains the following allegations:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    \u2022 \"T[ELA] Bio's scheme violates 'fair play' because ... T[ELA] Bio designed a misleading 'strategy' to induce LifeCell sales representatives to leave LifeCell and breach reasonable non-competition covenants.\" (LifeCell Suit Compl. \u00b6 252)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    \u2022 \"T[ELA] Bio has improperly interfered with ... [LifeCell's] economic relationships [with its stolen employees] because ... T[ELA] Bio induced those employees to leave LifeCell by misleading those employees into believing that T[ELA] Bio had a 'strategy' that allowed them to violate their legal obligations to LifeCell.\" (LifeCell Suit Comp. \u00b6 267)\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    TELA Bio contends that, from these allegations, it may be inferred that TELA Bio made \"statements about LifeCell's inability to enforce non-competition agreements\" and that such statements are defamatory. (TELA Bio's Resp. 13.) While it may be reasonable to infer that TELA Bio made statements to LifeCell employees about having a \"strategy\" to employ them without violating those employees' non-competition covenants, such statements are not defamatory, because they do not impugn LifeCell's reputation. In arguing to the contrary, TELA Bio cites a case holding that a false allegation that a person \"commit[ed] illegal patent infringement\" was defamatory. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    TELA Bio's Resp. 13 &amp; n.62 (citing\n    <em>\n     OMI Holdings, Inc. v. Chubb Ins. Co. of Can.\n    </em>\n    , No. 95-cv-2519,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2030861\">\n     1997 WL 30861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7 (D. Kan. Jan. 7, 1997) ) (explaining that a \"wrongful accusation of an illegal act is an attack on one's good name or reputation.\") ) But unlike a false accusation of illegal patent infringement, TELA Bio's alleged statement that it had a \"strategy\" to avoid violating LifeCell employees' non-competition covenants does not accuse LifeCell of committing an illegal act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    In sum, read either separately or as a whole, the allegations in the underlying suit relied upon by TELA Bio have nothing to do with harm to another's reputation. Rather, the allegations pertain to a business dispute over stolen employees and confidential trade secrets. Because the LifeCell Complaint does not allege that TELA Bio made any statements that can reasonably be considered defamatory, coverage under the Libel and Slander Provision of the Policy was not triggered, and Federal Insurance did not have a duty to defend the LifeCell Suit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     D.\n     <em>\n      Applicability of the IP Rights Exclusion\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The lack of coverage for the LifeCell Suit under the Policy's Libel and Slander Provision suffices to establish that Federal Insurance had no duty to defend and that, therefore, TELA Bio's Complaint fails to state a claim. However, I hold alternatively that, even if the allegations in the LifeCell Suit Complaint triggered coverage under the Libel and Slander Provision, Federal Insurance would still have no duty to defend, because the LifeCell Suit falls within the Policy's IP Rights Exclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Britamco Underwriters, Inc. v.

For the reasons set out below, Federal Insurance is correct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    While Paragraph A of the IP Rights Exclusion excludes only losses \"related to\" a violation or assertion of intellectual property rights, Paragraph B is much broader.

For example, in\n    <em>\n     Vitamin Health, Inc. v. Hartford Casualty Insurance Company\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131895\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/712/#p720\">\n     186 F.Supp.3d 712\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 720 (E.D. Mich. 2016), the court considered an exclusionary provision which excluded from coverage \"any injury or damage alleged in any claim or suit that also alleges an infringement or violation of any intellectual property right ... regardless of whether this insurance would otherwise apply.\" The court held that this exclusion \"clearly and unambiguously bars coverage in situations where, as here, a claim of false advertising [which was otherwise covered by the policy at issue] is alleged in a suit that\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    alleges patent infringement claims.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131895\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/712/#p720\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12131895\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/186/712/#p720\">\n     at 720-721\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Likewise, in\n    <em>\n     Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. v.

Ariz. Jan. 13, 2010), the court considered an exclusionary provision that-in addition to excluding from coverage \"injury ... from any actual or alleged infringement\" of intellectual property rights-excluded \"any other injury ... alleged in a claim or suit that also alleges any such infringement or violation.\" While noting that this exclusion was \"potentially harsh,\" the court found it to be unambiguous, explaining that it was clear that the insurer \"intend[ed] to exclude from its ... policy any damages that arise from intellectual property violations\n    <em>\n     and any damages that arise from any other claims when a claim of intellectual prop\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     erty violation is asserted.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *20 (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Attempting to distinguish these cases, TELA Bio relies on\n    <em>\n     Align Technology, Inc. v. Federal Insurance Company\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678625\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/673/957/#p967\">\n     673 F.Supp.2d 957\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 967-969 (N.D. Cal. 2009), where the court found that an intellectual property rights exclusion was ambiguous. But the IP Rights Exclusion at issue here is far clearer than the language of the exclusion at issue in\n    <em>\n     Align Technology\n    </em>\n    , which provided as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    This insurance does not apply to any actual or alleged bodily injury, property damage, advertising injury or personal injury arising out of, giving rise to or in any way related to any actual or alleged:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    \u2022 assertion; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    \u2022 infringement or violation;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n    by any person or organization (including any insured) of any intellectual property law or right, regardless of whether this insurance would otherwise apply to all or part of any such actual or alleged injury or damage in the absence of any such actual or alleged assertion, infringement or violation.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678625\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/673/957/#p967\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678625\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/673/957/#p967\">\n     at 969\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    This exclusion contains nearly verbatim the language from Paragraph A of the Policy's IP Rights Exclusion. But it lacks the critical language found in Paragraph B-excluding \"the entirety of all allegations in any claim or suit, if such claim or suit includes an allegation of or a reference to an infringement or violation of an intellectual property law or right.\" With that critical language, it is clear the IP Rights Exclusion at issue here excludes an entire suit from coverage if that suit contains any allegation that the insured violated another's intellectual property rights.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    In sum, because the LifeCell Suit Complaint alleged that TELA Bio appropriated LifeCell's trade secrets and confidential information-indeed, this was the gravamen of the LifeCell Suit-the IP Rights Exclusion precludes coverage for the suit in its entirety. Accordingly, Federal Insurance had no duty to defend TELA Bio in the LifeCell Suit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    For the reasons set out above, Federal Insurance's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim will be granted and this action will be dismissed with prejudice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    An appropriate Order follows.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-100\">\n     Within two weeks of the filing of this action, Federal Insurance did, in fact, disclaim coverage for and refuse to defend the LifeCell Suit. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Decl. of Francis M. Conway in Supp. of TELA Bio's Mot. for Partial Summ. J., Ex. F, Doc. No. 21-10.)\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-101\">\n     Indeed, Judge Wolfson, in ordering venue transferred from the District of New Jersey to this Court, rejected TELA Bio's argument that \"New Jersey has a local interest in deciding\" this declaratory judgment action, \"especially since LifeCell alleges that T[ELA] Bio caused direct harm to a New Jersey corporation and residents.\" (10/25/2016 Op. 10.) In rejecting this argument, Judge Wolfson noted that this action \"is not a lawsuit between T[ELA] Bio and LifeCell,\" but between TELA Bio and Federal Insurance to establish who must pay the costs of TELA Bio's defense, a controversy in which New Jersey has no interest. (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     ) While Judge Wolfson's decision regarded venue, not choice of law, her conclusion as to New Jersey's interest in this matter is no less instructive here.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
