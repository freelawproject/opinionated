This is not a situation, as Defendants allege, where the question at issue is a result of a conflict between federal and state law.

The BIA attempted to address this concern in\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   by instituting its requirement that the State in which the adoption was entered expressly permit an adoption decree to be dated retroactively in order for a\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   decree to be recognized.\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20627\">\n    26 I &amp; N.

The BIA specifically states that they \"cannot give full faith and credit to a State adoption decree\" without regard to whether state law specifically allows an adoption to be dated retroactively. Therefore, this prong of the\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   test prong amounts to an assessment by a federal agency of whether a state court properly applied that state's law.

While the rule in\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   no longer discounts all\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   adoption decrees issued after the child reaches the age of 16, it now only recognizes such adoption decrees after it determines that state law allows\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   adoption decrees and, in cases where a decree was issued, that the state court acted consistently with that authority.\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20627\">\n    26 I &amp; N.

Thus, the BIA attempts to address fraudulent adoptions by paring down the total amount of allowed\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   adoption decrees by supplanting the state court's interpretation of state law with its own interpretation of state law, and not by determining whether there was actually a valid adoption. This is not a reasonable interpretation of the statute.

Therefore, the Court must consider whether the BIA's interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(E)(i) in\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. As no suspect class is involved and the only issue is whether Defendants' interpretation of the statute is rational, Plaintiff's equal protection argument can be \"folded into the APA argument\".\n   <em>\n    Ursack Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201375\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/949/#p958\">\n    639 F.3d at 955, 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the standard of review under the APA is identical to rational basis scrutiny).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted above, the BIA's holding in\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   is not rationally related to the legitimate government purpose of preventing fraudulent adoptions. Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   seeks to deter adoptions that are back-dated simply to confer an immigration benefit, but does not provide persuasive argument that the interpretation and rules set out that decision are rationally related to that purpose.\n   <em>\n    Huang\n   </em>\n   merely attempts to decrease the number of adoptions that are backdated\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   ; it does not take into account whether there is actual fraud or the individual circumstances of each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Fedoruk's circumstances are a perfect example of a situation where the BIA's interpretation of the statute minimizes the importance of family unity in favor of a rule that does not further the legitimate purpose of fraud prevention. Fedoruk's biological parents are not in contact with Plaintiffs and provide no support. Brown first filed a petition to adopt Fedoruk well before he was 16 years old. Due to circumstances that were out of Plaintiffs' control, they were unable to finalize this adoption until 2011. Yet, Brown's Form I-130 Petition was still denied. The Court notes that the conclusions reached in this Order are in keeping with the legislative history of the Immigration and Nationality Act. While Congress was concerned about the use of fraudulent adoption to gain immigration benefits, they provided children with liberal treatment because they recognized the importance of family unity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rept. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess. 468. In this case, the BIA's treatment of Fedoruk is not in keeping with history behind the statute at issue and the liberal treatment afforded to children. Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (Dkt. # 15) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   (Dkt. # 16). Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' petition for review and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDS\n   </strong>\n   this matter for further proceedings. Defendants are\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   to give deference to the state determination as to the effective date of Plaintiff Fedoruk's adoption.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Plaintiffs' request that the Court take judicial notice of the administrative record relevant to this case (Dkt. # 11) is granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Amponsah v.
