INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Josephine Chien is employed by the U.S. Department of State as an Assistant Regional Security Officer. Based on events that allegedly began with her initial assignment in the Foreign Service in 2010 and continued during subsequent assignments in various U.S. offices and embassies abroad, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Defendant Secretary of State under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, alleging race and sex discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation. Several motions to dismiss and amended complaints later, Defendant now moves for partial dismissal of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons stated below, the court denies Defendant's Second Renewed Motion for Partial Dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Josephine Chien, a Taiwanese-American woman, has been employed by the U.S. Department of State since 2009 and currently serves as an Assistant Regional Security Officer (\"ARSO\") within the Foreign Service. Pl.'s Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 19 [hereinafter SAC], \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Second Renewed Mot. for Partial Dismissal, ECF No. 21, Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Second Renewed Mot. for Partial Dismissal, ECF No. 21-1 [hereinafter Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot.], at 2. Because Plaintiff's allegations of discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation span over six years during her various Foreign Service assignments, and only some of those allegations are relevant to Defendant's present motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court provides only a brief summary of Plaintiff's employment history here, referring to her specific allegations in further detail below as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Assignment\n   </em>\n   : In March 2010, Plaintiff was assigned to a satellite office of State's Los Angeles Field Office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 10. While in L.A., Plaintiff was supervised by Michael Lodi, who Plaintiff alleges discriminated against her by frequently screaming at her in a disparaging and demoralizing manner and by refusing her training and overseas assignments requests.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. She also alleges that Lodi retaliated against her by threatening\n   to block her transfer to the main field office and by giving her an unwarranted negative performance evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-18. Plaintiff remained in the L.A. satellite office under Lodi's supervision until January 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Benghazi, Libya Assignment\n   </em>\n   : After Plaintiff was transferred out of the L.A. satellite office, she received a temporary duty assignment in Benghazi, Libya in May 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Plaintiff alleges that she was the only female agent on staff in Benghazi and that her new supervisors discriminated against her by denying her duty rotations and giving male agents preferential treatment and better assignments.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-24. She further alleges that her male colleagues harassed and discriminated against her by making \"routine and mundane requests to her on housekeeping issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Islamabad, Pakistan Assignment\n   </em>\n   : In February 2012, Plaintiff was assigned as an ARSO to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26, where she remained for approximately one year,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Plaintiff claims that she was harassed and/or discriminated and retaliated against in various ways during her assignment in Pakistan, but her allegations generally fall into one of four categories. First, Plaintiff alleges that in June 2012, her supervisor at the time, John Krajicek, reassigned to a male agent the decision-making responsibilities for one of the programs that Plaintiff was tasked with overseeing.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-31. Plaintiff also avers that Krajicek refused to communicate with her directly regarding her duties and programs, and that Krajicek did not do so with other agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, Plaintiff claims that she was \"blackballed or retaliated against\" after she broke a \"handshake\" agreement with State in April 2012 concerning an assignment to Dubai.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (explaining that Plaintiff had to negate her handshake agreement after a human resources officer informed her that the agency could not provide assistance to her then-boyfriend by including him as a member of household on the travel authorization due to Sharia law in Dubai). Plaintiff alleges that after the Dubai incident, she was not given the same opportunity as other officers when she re-bid for another foreign assignment in or around April 2012.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53. In that regard, Plaintiff also contends that State imposed \"a different standard for males versus females and/or ... Asians\" and non-Asians.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53-56. Plaintiff alleges that during the summer of 2012, when she was bidding on her next assignment to begin in 2013, she was told to apply only for domestic positions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 49-52. By contrast, Plaintiff says that similarly situated male agents who broke their handshake agreements still received foreign assignments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Relatedly, Plaintiff alleges that on at least two occasions, she was denied a foreign assignment in favor of a non-Asian man and woman, respectively, who were less senior than she was.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-56. In the end, Plaintiff was ultimately given a future\n   <em>\n    domestic\n   </em>\n   assignment in the Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations in Washington, D.C., scheduled to begin sometime after her Pakistan assignment.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Third, Plaintiff alleges that in January 2013, as part of her five-year background investigation update, she was interviewed by investigators about prior \"hook[ ] up[s]\" and her family in Taiwan.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-38.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soon thereafter, Plaintiff learned that,\n   as part of the investigation, the investigators had contacted her colleagues and asked them about whether Plaintiff \"had ever complained about work place harassment, a hostile work environment, discrimination or retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Plaintiff's white male colleague, however, was not asked any such questions during his five-year background investigation update.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Plaintiff therefore claims that the \"extra scrutiny\" she received was in retaliation for her protected EEO activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff alleges that in late January 2013, about a month before she left Pakistan, her career development officer instructed her to re-bid for her next assignment because the aforementioned Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations position in Washington, D.C. had been eliminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Plaintiff placed several foreign bids, but was informed that she would not receive a foreign assignment and, once again, was encouraged to consider only domestic assignments.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51. In particular, Plaintiff alleges that after the Regional Security Officer at the Embassy in Islamabad offered to call a senior career development and assignment officer about Plaintiff's bidding status, he told her that \"it all came down to Dubai,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 48, presumably a reference to Plaintiff breaking her handshake agreement to serve in Dubai.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Washington, D.C. Assignment\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following her assignment in Pakistan, which ended in or around late February 2013,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 48, Plaintiff continued to bid for \"forward assignments\" in foreign countries, to no avail,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Plaintiff alleges that she applied for roughly 30 positions between June 2013 and September 2013, and that she was denied all such positions because of discrimination and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 (listing positions);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57 (alleging that in August 2013, after she was denied 18 foreign assignments, Plaintiff was told that \"it ha[d] to do with something out of L.A.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Jakarta, Indonesia Assignment\n   </em>\n   : From September 2014 to August 2016, Plaintiff served as an ARSO in Jakarta, Indonesia, where she was supervised by Robert Castro, a Mexican-American male.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. As discussed below, the following allegations concerning Plaintiff's assignment in Jakarta led Plaintiff to file a separate administrative complaint and are generally referred to by both parties as the \"new allegations\" in the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 9, 2015, Plaintiff volunteered for a temporary duty assignment (\"TDY\") at the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Several weeks later at a staff meeting, however, Plaintiff learned that\n   one of her white male colleagues received the TDY.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Moreover, while Plaintiff applied to approximately 26 TDYs in other foreign countries during her Jakarta assignment, Plaintiff alleges that \"other non-Asian and non-female ARSOs\" were selected for these positions instead of her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Plaintiff claims that Defendant discriminated and retaliated against her by denying her these assignments, \"resulting in the loss of monetary benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   (alleging that \"TDYs are a factor in promotions and higher pay and are included as a factor in ... employee evaluation reports\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Castro created a hostile work environment and engaged in retaliatory acts against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68, 87. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Castro prevented her from performing her duties when supervising embassy guards in November 2015,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69, and attempted to make an unofficial request from an Embassy nurse regarding Plaintiff's sick leave in February 2016,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Further, Plaintiff alleges that after she filed a discrimination claim against Castro on March 7, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72, Castro retaliated against her by changing her work hours, placing her on AWOL status for one hour, assigning her to \"duty week\" without notifying her, restricting her leave requests, and deducting hours from her paycheck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-86;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82 (noting that with respect to her last-minute assignment to \"duty week,\" no other male or non-Asian ARSO was treated similarly).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 3, 2016, Plaintiff filed suit against Defendant under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging facts that generally correspond with those set forth in paragraphs 1 through 59 of the Second Amended Complaint and asserting claims of race and sex discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   SAC.

Defendant argued, among other things, that Plaintiff failed to timely exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her Title VII claims that arose prior to September 18, 2012 (i.e., more than 45 days after Plaintiff first contacted an EEO counselor), and that Plaintiff's retaliation claim based on the her security clearance investigation was non-justiciable under\n   <em>\n    U.S. Department of Navy v.

Accordingly, on August 8, 2017, Plaintiff filed her Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC.

With respect to the new allegations, Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for two independent reasons: (1) \"Plaintiff fails to allege an adverse action that can support a cognizable disparate treatment claim,\" and (2) \"Plaintiff fails to allege a sufficient causal connection between any adverse action and her race, gender, or any prior EEO activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant's motion is now ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

To recap, in his present motion, Defendant does not seek dismissal of Plaintiff's Title VII claims related to the allegations that Plaintiff \"was denied forward assignments for positions submitted in June 2013, July 2013, August 2013, and September 2013.\" Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 6 (citing SAC \u00b6 59). Rather, Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's remaining claims on three grounds. First, Defendant urges the court to dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII claims to the extent those claims are based on incidents that allegedly occurred prior to September 18, 2012. Because Plaintiff concedes that she cannot rely on pre-September 18, 2012 events to support her disparate treatment or retaliation claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC at 3 n.4, the only claim at issue is Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. Second, Defendant argues that to the extent Plaintiff's retaliation claim is premised on \"extra scrutiny\" she allegedly received during her security clearance investigation, that claim is non-justiciable and therefore must be dismissed. Third and finally, Defendant contends that the new allegations in the Second Amended Complaint fail to allege an adverse employment action or a causal connection between such action and Plaintiff's race, sex, or prior EEO activities. Because Defendant seeks dismissal of the new allegations in their\n   <em>\n    entirety\n   </em>\n   , Defendant presumably seeks dismissal of any hostile work environment claim based on the new allegations as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court will address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Hostile Work Environment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court begins with Defendant's first argument concerning exhaustion and Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim. The parties agree that Plaintiff failed to exhaust any Title VII claim based on actions that occurred prior to September 18, 2012, and thus, at the very least, that she cannot rely on such actions to support a claim of discrimination or retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC at 3 n.4. Defendant, however, also maintains that Plaintiff is barred from relying on such actions to support her hostile work environment claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 2-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 1 (\"Plaintiff fails to allege a plausible continuing violation theory that would permit her to recover vis-\u00e0-vis her hostile work environment claim based on acts that allegedly occurred more than 45 days prior to Plaintiff contacting an EEO counselor[.]\"). While Defendant acknowledges that earlier, time-barred incidents can qualify \"as part of the same actionable hostile work environment claim ... if they are adequately linked into a coherent hostile environment claim,\" Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

First, although Defendant clearly acknowledges that Plaintiff has asserted a hostile work environment claim in the Second Amended Complaint based on the new allegations\n   concerning Plaintiff's time in Jakarta, Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 5, 11-12, Defendant does not directly challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleading of that claim in his present motion. Rather, as to these new allegations, Defendant argues only that Plaintiff has failed to plead plausible claims of discrimination and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 8-14. He is entirely silent as to whether those same allegations support a hostile work environment claim. At least at the motion to dismiss stage, the court treats Defendant's silence as a concession as to the plausibility of Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim based on the events alleged to have occurred in Jakarta.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra v.

See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 1; Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 5. That argument, however, pertains only to the sufficiency of Plaintiff's pleading of a hostile work environment based on events occurring between September 18, 2012, and October 2013, i.e., before Plaintiff's assignment to Jakarta.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Renewed Mot. at 4-5; FAC at 3-14. Merely incorporating an argument about a different time period does not suffice to challenge Plaintiff's hostile work environment claim based on the later events occurring in Jakarta.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint states a hostile work environment claim that may proceed to discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, having concluded that Plaintiff has stated\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   plausible claim of a hostile work environment, the court will not attempt, at this stage, to parse the different time periods within the Second Amended Complaint to ferret out the alleged acts for which Defendant can and cannot be held liable under such claim.

Def.'s Mot. at 12, 14. This argument, however, misapprehends the nature of Plaintiff's claims. Here, Plaintiff does not allege that her security clearance was denied or revoked,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC at 8-10, or even that Defendant initiated review of her security clearance for retaliatory reasons,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (characterizing the inquiry as a five-year background investigation update). Rather, she claims that she received \"extra scrutiny\" during her security-clearance update investigation in retaliation for her prior EEO activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.

These questions, however, when considered at the motion to dismiss stage, have no apparent connection to national security or any \"[p]redictive judgment\" about Plaintiff's security-clearance worthiness and thus do not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601280\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/518/\">\n    484 U.S. at 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601280\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/518/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Rattigan\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

Plaintiff's New Discrimination and Retaliation Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the court turns to the new allegations in the Second Amended Complaint, which Defendant seeks to dismiss in their entirety. As discussed, Defendant does not address whether those allegations are insufficient to support a hostile work environment claim, and the court therefore will not dismiss the new allegations on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Instead, Defendant focuses on why the new allegations fail to state a claim of discrimination or retaliation under Title VII. Although the pleading of a prima facie case under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   is not required to survive a motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swierkiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p510\">\n    534 U.S. at 510-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108377\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/506/#p510\">\n    122 S.Ct. 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is helpful to set forth the elements of a prima facie case here in order to frame Defendant's arguments. To state a prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff must show that \"[1] she is part of a protected class under Title VII, [2] she suffered a cognizable adverse employment action, and [3] the action gives rise to an inference of discrimination,\" that is, \"an inference that [her] employer took the action because of [her] membership in the protected class.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Cir. 2014) (internal quotation mark omitted). To state a prima facie case of retaliation, a plaintiff must show that \"[1] she engaged in activity protected by Title VII, [2] the employer took [materially] adverse action against her, and [3] the employer took that action because of [her] protected conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772317,4331661\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/1085/\">\n    798 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1091-92 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baloch v.

First, Defendant contends that Plaintiff fails to allege any adverse employment action that can support her discrimination and retaliation claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 2, 8-13. Second, Defendant contends that, even if Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged adverse action, she fails to allege a causal connection between such action and her race, sex, or prior EEO activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 13-14.

Plaintiff says that her white and African-American male colleagues were treated better than she was because they were awarded the TDYs that she was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 1, 3 (citing SAC \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant urges the court to dismiss Plaintiff's new discrimination claim because \"[a] TDY denial is not considered an adverse employment action absent materially adverse consequences, which Plaintiff has not demonstrated.\" Def.'s 2d Renewed Mot. at 11 (citing cases). But Defendant reads the complaint too narrowly. Plaintiff here has alleged not only that \"TDYs are a factor for promotion and higher pay and are included as a factor in ... employee evaluation reports,\" but that in her case the denial of TDYs also \"result[ed] in a loss of monetary benefits.\" SAC \u00b6 67.
