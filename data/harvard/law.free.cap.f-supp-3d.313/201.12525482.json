Even a cursory review of the two complaints reveals that the factual allegations set forth in the complaints are practically identical. Although the present complaint purports to add new counts and to rephrase some statutory claims, both cases arise from Peek's request for loan modification, SunTrust's alleged mishandling of his payments during the three-month trial modification period, SunTrust's alleged refusal to enter into a permanent loan modification agreement, and the commencement of foreclosure proceedings against Peek. Thus, the first requirement for res judicata is satisfied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The second question is whether the two cases are between the same parties or their privies. The Court concludes yes. Peek is the plaintiff in both cases, and the defendants in the two cases are in privity. \"A privy is one so identified in interest with a party to the former litigation that he or she [or it] represents precisely the same legal right in respect to the subject matter of the case.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith v.

The order in the Virginia action held that \"none of plaintiff's claims state[d] a cognizable cause of action or [sought] an appropriate form of relief\" and dismissed the case under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n    <em>\n     Peek\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203258729\">\n     2017 WL 3258729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4.
