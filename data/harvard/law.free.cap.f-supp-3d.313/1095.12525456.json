It was filed on June 20, 2013, and issued on April 28, 2015. The two patents are related. Specifically, the '070 Patent is a continuation of\n   U.S. Application No. 13/573,311, which in turn is a continuation application of the '863 Patent. Thus, the '863 Patent and the '070 Patent contain similar claims, have identical figures, and have nearly identical specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The patents state that they relate \"in general to digital data networks and, more particularly, to network access and to minimizing unauthorized interception of data and denial of network services.\" '863 patent at col. 1: 26-29.

Thus, the Court conducts its step one inquiry by first identifying what the \"character as a whole\" of claim 1 of the '863 Patent and claim 1 of the '070 Patent (collectively, \"the claims\") are \"directed to,\" and then discussing whether this is an abstract idea.

Further, the specifications of both the '893 Patent and the '070 Patent, to the extent they describe toolbar updates, make no mention of adding or changing a button. Thus, updating toolbar software over a network without user intervention accurately captures what the \"character as a whole\" of the claims is \"directed to.\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Based on comparisons of the claims at issue \"to those claims already found to be directed to an abstract idea in previous cases,\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n    822 F.3d at 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court concludes that the claims at issue are directed to an abstract idea. First, the Court finds that the claims in the instant\n   case are similar to claims that fall within the category of gathering and processing information, which the Federal Circuit has established is an abstract idea. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit considered a set of claims that recited a method of detecting fraud and misuse of personal health information that \"collects information regarding accesses of a patient's personal health information, analyzes the information according to one of several rules ... to determine if the activity indicates improper access, and provides notification if it determines that improper access has occurred.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177193\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1089/#p1094\">\n    839 F.3d 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1093 (Fed.

Thus, similar to the claims in\n   <em>\n    FairWarning\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    West View Research\n   </em>\n   , the claims at issue \"do not go beyond receiving or collecting data queries, analyzing the data query, retrieving and processing the information constituting a response to the initial data query,\" and prompting a toolbar update in \"response to the initial data query.\"\n   <em>\n    West View Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12403990\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/685/923/#p926\">\n    685 F.

Further, this last step of initiating an update upon receipt of updated toolbar data is similar to \"generating a visual or audio response to [a] ... data query\" in that both processes involve prompting some sort of generic function in response to a transmission of data.\n   <em>\n    West View Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12403990\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/685/923/#p926\">\n    685 F.

Specifically, the claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    White Knuckle Gaming\n   </em>\n   were directed to a process that \"allows a gaming company to update the software parameters of sports video games to reflect recent real-life occurrences\"-including changes in \"performance statistics, athletes' appearances, and uniform appearances\"-by sending updated data from a data server to the video game console through the Internet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.

As Defendants point out, \"[t]here is nothing particularized or non-conventional about modifying a software system either by adding to or updating data in a database.\" Reply at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court also finds that the ordered combination of the elements in the claims at issue does not yield an inventive concept. MyMail seeks to invoke\n   <em>\n    DDR\n   </em>\n   , in which the Federal Circuit found that the challenged patent was valid because it \"specif[ied] how interactions with the Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result-a result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055750\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1245/#p1256\">\n    773 F.3d at 1258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the claims at issue do not recite a process for updating software that deviates from the \"routine and conventional\" updating process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055750\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1245/#p1256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the contrary, the claims disclose the conventional and commonsensical steps of checking toolbar data to determine whether the toolbar needs an update, and if so, updating the toolbar. Thus, much like the claims in\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I\n   </em>\n   , \"instead of overriding a routine sequence of events,\" the instant claims apply generic components performing their routine functions \"to automate the delivery of software updates.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268486\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/81/356/\">\n    81 F.Supp.3d at 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The specifications further confirm this conclusion because nothing in the specifications remotely suggests that the claims in the instant case produce a result that \"overrides the\n   routine and conventional sequence of events\" for updating software on a computer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055750\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1245/#p1256\">\n    773 F.3d at 1258-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, although the claims recite that certain steps are done \"automatically\" and \"dynamically,\" \"not every invention that automates a process ... is patentable.\"\n   <em>\n    Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v. Quantificare, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523154\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/288/1002/#p1021\">\n    288 F.Supp.3d 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1021 (N.D. Cal. 2017). Indeed, \"[a] general purpose computer with minimal programming can perform functions 'automatically' and 'dynamically,' and implementation of an abstract idea on such a computer is not an inventive concept.\"\n   <em>\n    Clear with Computers, LLC v. Altec Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20993392\">\n    2015 WL 993392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4 (E.D. Tex. Mar. 3, 2015). Accordingly, the Court finds that nothing in the ordered combination of elements recited in the claims at issue bring them outside the realm of the abstract idea of updating toolbar software over a network without user intervention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Because the Court finds at\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step one that the claims in the instant case are directed to an abstract idea and at step two that there is no inventive concept sufficient to save the claims, the Court concludes that the asserted claims are patent-ineligible under \u00a7 101. Defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings are therefore GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motions for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    \"ooVoo ECF No.\" denotes docket entries in Case No. 17-CV-4487-LHK,\n    <em>\n     MyMail, Ltd. v. ooVoo, LLC.\n    </em>\n    \"IAC ECF No.\" denotes docket entries in Case No. 17-CV-4488-LHK,\n    <em>\n     MyMail, Ltd. v.
