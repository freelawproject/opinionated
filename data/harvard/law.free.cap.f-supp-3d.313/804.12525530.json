Although the parties to this litigation are an American company and the U.S. Government (for taxes collected on its behalf by the Internal Revenue Service), the facts giving rise to the claim involve a Russian subsidiary company and the Russian Ministry of Finance. Pending before the court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment seeking a determination whether a payment made by a U.S. parent company, through a Cypriot entity, to a Russian subsidiary is deductible either as a bad debt (Dkts. 29 &amp; 31\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) or as an ordinary and necessary business expense (Dkts. 43 &amp; 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are largely undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the relevant time period, BJ Services Company (\"BJ Parent\") was the parent company of an affiliated group of corporations and subsidiaries throughout the world. Through a series of foreign and domestic holding companies, BJ Parent\n   conducted fracking services in Russia through a Russian subsidiary, ZAO Samotlor Fracmaster Services (\"BJ Russia\"). (Dkt. 29-2, 21-4). Plaintiff, Baker Hughes Incorporated, is the successor to BJ Parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2006, BJ Russia contracted with OJSC TNK-Management (\"TNK-BP\"), a joint venture between a Russian company and British Petroleum. (Dkt. 44, p. 5). Under the contract, BJ Russia agreed to provide pressure pumping services to TNK-BP in the Siberian oil fields. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The agreement guaranteed a minimum number of jobs for BJ Russia over the three years of the contract at a fixed rate, and was valued at approximately $44 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6; depo of Brett Wells, Dkt 44-3, p. 14). The contract required BJ Parent to extend a \"performance guarantee:\" if BJ Russia was unable to perform all of its obligations under the contract, BJ Parent would, upon demand by TNK-BP, be responsible to perform or to take whatever steps necessary to perform, as well as be liable for any losses, damages, or expenses caused by BJ Russia's failure to complete the contract. (Dkt. 29-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The contract was not as profitable as BJ Russia had forecast, and it sustained net losses in 2006 and 2007. (Dkt. 44, p. 9). In September 2008, BJ Russia informed TNK-BP that it would not renew the contract and would exit the Russian market at the conclusion of the contract in 2009. (Dkt. 44, p. 9; depo. of Brett Wells, Dkt. 44-3, p. 32). On October 21, 2008, the Russian Ministry of Finance sent a letter to BJ Russia advising the company it was in violation of articles 90 and 99 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and in danger of forced liquidation. (Dkt. 44-14). Those provisions require a joint stock company to maintain \"net assets\" in an amount at least equal to the company's chartered capital. (Dkt. 44-14). A company may reduce its chartered capital to match the level of its net assets, but the Civil Code sets a minimum level for chartered capital. If, at the end of year, the net assets fall below that minimum level, the company must be liquidated. (Dkt. 44-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Ministry of Finance informed BJ Russia that, by its calculations, the company's net assets cost for 2006 was -228,277,00 Rubles, and -570,683,000 Rubles for 2007. Since the net assets cost were below the chartered capital minimum,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Russian tax authority had the right to liquidate the company through the courts, a point it repeated three times in the letter. (Dkt. 44-14). The company was given until November 14, 2008 to \"improve [the company's] financial performance and increase the net assets.\" (Dkt. 44-14). BJ Parent considered this to be a credible threat, and analyzed the ramifications if BJ Russia was liquidated. (Dkt. 44, p. 10-11). It believed that if BJ Russia was liquidated, TNK-BP would force BJ Parent to finish the contract pursuant to the Performance Guarantee, and BJ Parent would have to pay a third party to complete the work. (Dkt 44, 11-12). BJ Parent estimated its potential exposure exceeded $160 million, and worried about the potential damage to its reputation if one of its subsidiaries defaulted. (Dkts. 44, p. 12; 44-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 13, 2008, BJ Russia assured the Ministry of Finance that it was \"taking steps to improve the financial and economic activities of the company and to increase the net assets in 2008.\" (Dkt. 29-9). After considering the options available in the limited time given, BJ Parent chose to transfer funds from BJ Parent to BJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Russia under article 251(11) of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, Federal law No. 117-FZ. (Dkt. 43-2). That provision allows a majority shareholder to transfer assets to a company without tax consequences for the receiving company. (Dkt. 43-2, 8-9). To comply with the statute, it was necessary to change the ownership structure of BJ Russia from two owners with equal shares of stock to a single majority shareholder. (Dkt. 43, p. 6). BJ Holding (Russia) Limited sold 1,050 shares of BJ Russia stock to a Cypriot entity, Samotlor Holding Limited, making Samotlor the majority shareholder of BJ Russia. (Dkt 43-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Samotlor then signed an agreement to provide \"Free Financial Aid\" in the amount of $52 million to BJ Russia. (Dkt 44-15). The funds would be transferred by BJ Parent, on behalf of Samotlor, by December 31, 2008. (Dkt. 44-15). It was agreed that the \"stated cash assets shall be used by the Company to execute its activities as stipulated by the Company's Charter\" and that Samotlor \"confirms hereby that its financial assistance is free and that it does not expect the company to return the funds to the shareholder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). BJ Parent then made a series of transfers in amounts between $2,000.00 and $6,000.00 to BJ Russia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 44-16). BJ Parent (now Baker Hughes Incorporated) claimed a deduction on its tax return of $52 million, but that deduction was disallowed by the IRS. Baker Hughes now seeks a refund of $17,654,000 in federal income taxes it paid on the $52 million, plus interest. Baker Hughes contends the payment is deductible as a bad debt under Section 166 of the Tax Code, or as an ordinary and necessary trade or business expense under Section 162.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20162\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issues of material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

It argues that courts have defined the term \"debt\" broadly, and have allowed payments that were made to discharge a guarantee to be deducted as bad debt losses. Baker Hughes further insists that Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.166-9 allows it to deduct this payment because \"a payment of principal or interest made...by the taxpayer in discharge of part or all of the taxpayer's obligation as a guarantor...is treated as a business debt becoming worthless in the taxable year in which the payment is made.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Baker Hughes argues that it made the payment to discharge its obligation to guarantee performance on the BJ Russia contract, and therefore satisfies this regulation. Baker Hughes' argument proceeds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1) The Russian Ministry was threatening to liquidate BJ Russia because it did not have sufficient capital;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2) Liquidation of BJ Russia would have caused it to default on the contract with TNK-BP);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   3) That default would have made TNK-BP a judgment-creditor and BJ Russia a judgment-debtor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   4) BJ Russia would have been obligated to pay TNK-BP a fixed and determinable sum of money potentially in excess of $160 million;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   5) BJ Parent guaranteed BJ Russia's performance, creating a creditor-debtor relationship between them and making BJ Parent liable for BJ Russia's debts; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   6) The payment to BJ Russia satisfies the debt created by BJ Parent's performance guarantee, and BJ Russia's inability to repay renders it a bad debt under IRC \u00a7 166.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Baker Hughes' arguments conflate two questions: 1) did BJ Parent pay a debt owed by BJ Russia to TNK-BP because it guaranteed that obligation; or 2) did the transfer of money by BJ Parent (through the shareholder company) to BJ Russia create a debt owed by BJ Russia to BJ Parent. The answer to both these questions is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A taxpayer is entitled to take as a deduction any debt which becomes worthless in that taxable year.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20166\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

There was no certificate or note evidencing a loan, no provision for or expectation of repayment of principal or interest, and no way to enforce repayment. Instead, the operative agreement stated clearly and succinctly that it was \"free financial aid\" and would not be paid back to BJ Parent or to Samotlor. (Dkt. 44-15). The intent of the parties was clear: it was not a loan and did not create an indebtedness. In fact, it could not be a loan because further indebtedness for BJ Russia would not have solved the net assets and capitalization problems identified by the Russian Ministry of Finance. (Depo. of Ronald Pinto, Dkt. 44-4, p. 11) (it could not be a loan \"because that would increase our liabilities which would make them shut us down.\"). BJ Russia's undercapitalization also supports the conclusion this was an infusion of capital and not a loan that created a debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Baker Hughes next argues that the payment was made pursuant to a guarantee to perform because if BJ Russia was liquidated, BJ Parent would be liable for the damages caused by the breach.

(Dkt. 31, p. 21). Those cases are not persuasive. It is true that BJ Parent executed a performance obligation with TNK-BP to guarantee the work would be done. However, BJ Russia never failed to perform its obligations, and TNK-BP never looked to BJ Parent to satisfy any requirements under the performance guarantee. (Depo. of Ronald Pinto, Dkt. 44-4, p. 46). The event that triggered the payment was not a demand by TNK-BP or other creditors of BJ Russia to perform, instead it was the notice from the Russian Ministry of Finance that BJ Russia was undercapitalized and at risk of being liquidated. No money was paid to TNK-BP, and no guaranteed debt or obligation was discharged by the payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in\n   the performance guarantee legally obligated BJ Parent to give $52 million to BJ Russia, it was only required to perform on the contract if BJ Russia could not. After the money was transferred to BJ Russia, both BJ Parent and BJ Russia had the same obligations under the performance guarantee that existed before the transfer. The payment neither extinguished, in whole or in part, BJ Parent's obligation to guarantee performance, nor reduced the damages it would pay in the event of a default. It also did not impact BJ Russia's obligations to perform; it merely reduced the risk that BJ Russia would be unable to perform due to liquidation for violation of Russian legal capitalization requirements. In short, this was not \"a payment of principal or interest made...by the taxpayer\n   <em>\n    in discharge of\n   </em>\n   part or all of the taxpayer's obligation as a guarantor,\" because there was no discharge of any obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff relies heavily on the case of\n   <em>\n    Myers v.

BJ Parent was under no obligation to make this payment to BJ Russia but chose to do so to avoid potential future losses. In response to a letter from the Russian Ministry of Finance threatening liquidation because of undercapitalization, BJ Parent decided to alter the stock ownership of BJ Russia and have the new majority shareholder (Samotlor) transfer free cash to BJ Russia. There was no obligation to return the funds, and BJ Russia was not restricted in how it could use them. BJ Russia then decided to use the money to pay down an existing loan to BJ International, another subsidiary of BJ Parent. As a result, BJ Russia recapitalized its balance sheet, reducing its liabilities and increasing its net equity, thereby eliminating the net asset problem identified by Russian authorities. BJ Russia was thereby enabled to continue operations and complete the contract. Under these circumstances, the transfer of funds under the Free Financial Aid Agreement fits squarely within the capitalization principle explained in\n   <em>\n    Fink\n   </em>\n   and specified in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 1.263(a)-2(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Second Circuit reached a similar conclusion on analogous facts in\n   <em>\n    Mills Estate v. Comm'r,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1260272\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/206/244/\">\n    206 F.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1953). A New York law required a certain level of net assets before a corporation could make a corporate distribution. In order to undertake the transactions necessary to satisfy the net asset test, the taxpayer paid legal fees. The court ruled that legal fees incurred in the recapitalization effort were not deductible as ordinary and necessary business expenses. Given the non-deductibility of transactional costs associated with recapitalization, it is hard to fathom how a different result could be reached when (as here) the disbursement at issue is the recapitalization itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To be sure, BJ Parent did receive other benefits as a result of the recapitalization and reorganization effected by the Free Financial Aid Agreement. By helping BJ Russia avoid liquidation and finish the TNK-BP contract, BJ Parent assured not\n   only that BJ Russia's valuable proprietary equipment and technology would be recovered, but also that BJ Parent's own reputation and future business operations would not be damaged. But these expected benefits were not realized solely, or even primarily, in the 2008-09 tax year. Instead, like any normal capital expenditure, these benefits to the taxpayer were expected to (and presumably did in fact) continue into the future, well beyond the tax year in which the payments were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Baker Hughes argues that the future benefits to BJ Parent's reputation and business operations do not preclude a current expense deduction here. It relies upon a line of cases holding that, when one taxpayer pays the expenses of another, the payment may be deductible under \u00a7 162(a) if the taxpayer's purpose is to protect or promote its own business interests such as reputation and goodwill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hood v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lohrke,\n   </em>\n   for example, the taxpayer sent a check to a third party customer to compensate for losses resulting from defective products sold by the taxpayer's corporation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6072720\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/48/679/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6072720\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/tc/48/679/\">\n    at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It points to cases allowing a \u00a7 162 deduction for payments made by a shareholder to repay his corporation's debt to a third-party lender, even though the underlying loan was not a deductible expense of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frazier v.

Yet the authority most heavily relied upon by Baker Hughes, a 1995 IRS Technical Advice Memorandum (No. 9522003), actually undermines its argument. The TAM restates the\n   <em>\n    Lohrke\n   </em>\n   exception in a manner fully consistent with the Government's position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A well-established exception to this general rule, however, permits taxpayers to claim a deduction for a payment made to extinguish another taxpayer's liability where the payment was made to protect and promote the payor's own goodwill\n   <em>\n    and is otherwise an ordinary and necessary business expense.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lohrke v.

The free financial aid provided by BJ Parent was untethered to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   actual expense of BJ Russia, deductible or not.

Even if it were, the factual circumstances described in the TAM No. 9522003 are materially different. A parent company had provided funding to pay debts owed by its subsidiary to non-shareholder creditors, in order that the subsidiary could be dissolved; the applicable law would not permit dissolution until all debts were paid. The TAM expressly noted that the payment was not intended to facilitate continued operations of the subsidiary, but rather to wind up those operations in a more orderly fashion. Dkt. 48-1 at 10. Here, BJ Parent was not providing funding so that BJ Russia might be shut down; to the contrary, it was infusing BJ Russia with sufficient additional capital to satisfy Russian regulations and continue business operations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lidgerwood Mfg.
