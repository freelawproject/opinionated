Jones (\"Jones\") and Jones Gill LLP (collectively, \"Jones Gill\"). Dkt. 32. Counter-plaintiff Nomad Land and Energy Resources L.L.C. (\"Nomad\") responded. Dkt. 52. Jones Gill replied. Dkt. 54. Nomad supplemented its response. Dkt. 58. Jones Gill supplemented its reply. Dkt. 61. Having considered the motion, response, reply, supplemental\n   briefing, record evidence, and applicable law, the court is of the opinion that Jones Gill's motion should be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute arises out of an oil and gas transaction. Counter-defendant and plaintiff Alexander O &amp; G, L.L.C. (\"Alexander\") and Nomad are oil and gas companies. Dkt. 32 at 1-3. Jones Gill is a law firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jones is an attorney at that firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2016, Alexander's president, Michael Mann (\"Mann\"), and Nomad's managing partner, John T. Bay (\"Bay\"), signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (\"PSA\") for a transaction involving mineral rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 15-1; Dkt. 32-1 at 3 (Jones Aff.). Jones Gill did not draft, review, or sign the PSA. Dkt. 15-1; Dkt. 32-1 at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The PSA defines Nomad as the \"Seller\" and Alexander as the \"Buyer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The PSA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon the execution and delivery of the Agreement, Buyer shall tender Seller, in an agreed escrow agent's account, an earnest money deposit of\n   <em>\n    $100,000.00\n   </em>\n   to help assure Buyer's performance hereunder, which deposit shall be non-refundable, except in the event that Seller shall be unwilling or unable to perform his obligations hereunder, in which case, the entirety of the earnest money deposit, and any interest or any other additions thereto, shall be refunded to Buyer. If the agreement closes, as contemplated, the earnest money, and any other additions thereto, shall be applied toward the satisfaction of the payment of the total consideration due and payable hereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dkt. 15-1 (underlined in original). The PSA does not mention or identify Jones or Jones Gill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nomad and Alexander used a third-party broker, Steve Fulton (\"Fulton\"). Dkt. 61 at 3. Fulton asked Bay about appointing an escrow agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Bay testified that he \"agreed\" and \"said 'anybody.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Before asking Jones Gill, Alexander suggested the parties could use the firm as the escrow agent. Dkt. 58 at 3; Dkt. 61. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In June 2016, Mann contacted Jones Gill about two transactions: one with Noroma Energy, L.L.C. (\"Noroma\") as well as the one with Nomad. Dkt. 32-1 at 1. For the first, Jones Gill gave Alexander instructions on wiring money to Jones Gill's IOLTA account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. But the parties to the Noroma-Alexander transaction agreed to use a different escrow agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the second transaction, Mann asked Jones Gill to \"hold the earnest money for the Nomad PSA\n   <em>\n    in the event\n   </em>\n   the parties agreed to the terms of the proposed sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added); Dkt. 61 at 3. Jones Gill \"agreed to hold the earnest money\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   all parties executed and returned an escrow agreement.\" Dkt. 32-1 at 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jones Gill attorney Brian Wittpenn inserted the names of the potential parties into a proposed escrow agreement (\"proposed agreement\"). Dkt. 15-2 at 2; Dkt. 32-1 at 2. Specifically, the proposed agreement was to govern Nomad as the \"Seller,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alexander as the \"Buyer,\" and Jones Gill as the \"Escrow Agent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wittpenn forwarded the proposed agreement to Alexander via email. Dkt. 32-1 at 2. Fulton sent it to Bay. Dkt. 61 at 3. But Bay did not sign it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 61 at 4. No one from Alexander or Jones Gill signed it, either. Dkt. 15-2 at 4; Dkt. 61 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 29, 2016, Alexander wired $100,000.00 to Jones Gill's IOLTA account. Dkt. 58 at 2-3. Alexander used the wiring instructions from the Noroma-Alexander transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jones Gill did not receive a signed copy of the proposed agreement from Alexander or Nomad. Dkt. 32-1 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 7, 2016, Mann told Jones Gill that the parties did not execute the proposed agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, Jones asked the firm's accountant and bookkeeper, Patty Blake, to wire the money back to Alexander.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 3. Blake completed the transfer on July 8, 2016. Dkt. 32-2 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On July 27, 2016, Bay emailed Jones. Dkt. 15-3 at 3. That email was the first contact that anyone from Jones Gill had with Bay. Dkt. 32-1 at 1. Bay's message included an unsigned copy of the proposed agreement that Fulton had sent him. Dkt. 15-3 at 2. Bay asked Jones to release the escrow balance to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 Jones replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Dear Mr. Bay: You have sent me an unexecuted escrow agreement. Neither you nor Alexander Oil and Gas executed this agreement. Jones Gill LLP returned the funds deposited in our IOLTA to Alexander Oil and Gas at its request. Alexander Oil &amp; Gas paid the funds into our IOLTA and it is the owner of those funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 23, 2016, Alexander sued Nomad to get a state court judgment declaring that the PSA had been terminated. Dkt. 1-4. Nomad removed to this court. Dkt. 1. On April 12, 2017, Nomad amended its answer to include third-party claims against Jones Gill for breach of contract, money had and received, breach of fiduciary duty, and, alternatively, promissory estoppel or partial performance. Dkt. 15. Jones Gill moves for summary judgment on all of Nomad's claims. Dkt. 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A court shall grant summary judgment when a \"movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"[A] fact is genuinely in dispute only if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Fordoche, Inc. v. Texaco, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723640\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/388/#p392\">\n    463 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (5th Cir. 2006). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v. Catrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    477 U.S. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). If the party meets its burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant and draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-movant.\n   <em>\n    Envtl. Conservation Org. v. City of Dall.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626680\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/519/#p524\">\n    529 F.3d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 524 (5th Cir. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Both parties object to each other's summary judgment evidence. Dkts. 52, 54. Jones Gill argues that, on the undisputed facts, it is entitled to summary judgment on each of Nomad's claims. Dkt. 32 at 2. The court will address the evidentiary objections before analyzing the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1. Jones' affidavit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Jones Gill offers Jones' affidavit to support its motion. Dkt. 32-1. That affidavit\n   addresses the events surrounding the transaction giving rise to the instant lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3626680\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/529/519/#p524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nomad objects to paragraphs 4-7 of Jones' affidavit. Dkt. 52 at 6-7. Nomad argues that each of those paragraphs are inadmissible because they are: (1) not based on Jones' personal knowledge; (2) contain hearsay; (3) do not contain the proper foundation; and (4) are not the best evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. However, those paragraphs are based \"fully and completely on ... Jones' personal knowledge of the facts in this case.\" Dkt. 54 at 1. Jones can also serve as a competent witness as to the Noroma-Alexander transaction because he served as counsel of record in a lawsuit arising from that transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 32-1 at 1. Because Jones' affidavit satisfies Rule 56(c)(4), the objections to that affidavit are OVERRULED.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (\"An affidavit ... used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant ... is competent to testify on the matters stated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   2. Termination e-mail\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Jones Gill offers Jones' email response to Bay's inquiry about the escrow balance. Dkt. 15-3. Nomad refers to this email as \"the termination e-mail.\" Dkt. 52 at 9. Nomad objects to it on the grounds that it \"was misaddressed, never received by Nomad[,] and was never produced during discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nomad fails to present an evidentiary objection. Additionally, when Jones Gill filed the instant motion, discovery had not yet closed. Dkt. 57. Accordingly, the court OVERRULES this objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3. Bay's affidavit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nomad offers Bay's affidavit. Dkt. 52-1 at 5-11. The affidavit addresses the events giving rise to the instant lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jones Gill objects to paragraph 2 on the grounds that Bay gives legal conclusions when he is neither qualified nor designated to serve as a legal expert. Dkt. 54-1 at 1 (citing Dkt. 52-1 at 5-6). The court agrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 701, 702 ; Dkt. 52-1 at 5-6. Accordingly, the court SUSTAINS that objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Jones Gill objects to paragraphs 5, 7, and 8 as irrelevant. Dkt. 54 at 2. Paragraph 5 addresses the escrow clause which is relevant in this case. Dkt. 52-1 at 7. However, Paragraphs 7 and 8 are not relevant as they address general details of the PSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9. None of those details relate to the claims analyzed in this order. Accordingly, the court OVERRULES the objection to Paragraph 5 but SUSTAINS it as to Paragraphs 7 and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Jones Gill also objects to paragraphs 6 and 7 as hearsay and as not based on personal knowledge. Dkt. 54 at 2. The court OVERRULES that objection as to Paragraph 6 but SUSTAINS it as to Paragraph 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the court will not consider Paragraphs 2, 7, and 8. However, the court will consider Paragraphs 5 and 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   4. Ferrar's affidavit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nomad offers the affidavit of its retained expert, William D. Ferrar. Dkt. 52-4 at 5-8. Ferrar provides his expert opinion on the PSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Nomad cites the affidavit to show that \"what [Alexander] was really worried about was not being able to market and otherwise fund the deal.\" Dkt. 52 at 8-9. Jones Gill objects to Ferrar's affidavit as irrelevant to the instant motion. Dkt. 54 at 2. The court agrees and SUSTAINS the objection.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 401,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52-4 at 5-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   5. Arguments by reference\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Jones Gill objects to \"Nomad's improper attempt to include, by reference, the arguments made by Nomad in its Response to\n   the Motion to Dismiss.\" Dkt. 54 at 2. The court will consider materials when, and to the extent that, the parties cite to the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) (\"[a] party asserting that a fact ... is genuinely disputed must support that assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the record\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) (\"[t]he court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record\"). Accordingly, the court OVERRULES this objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"A party's concession of an issue means the issue is waived and may not be revived.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Jones Gill argues that Nomad waived its claim for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 61 at 2 (citing Dkt. 51). The court agrees.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 52 at 14 (\"Nomad hereby waives its claim against the Jones Gill Parties for breach of contract.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9135364\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/760/#p770\">\n    328 F.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
