The Congressional Review Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1. Overview\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The CRA is a 1996 law which allows for congressional review of executive agency action. The CRA provides that \"[b]efore a rule can take effect, the Federal agency promulgating such rule shall submit to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General a report\" that includes \"a copy of the rule,\" \"a concise general statement relating to the rule,\" and \"the proposed effective date of the rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress then has a set period of time during which it can enact a joint resolution disapproving the rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [I]n the case of any rule for which a report was submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) during the period beginning on the date occurring-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (A) in the case of the Senate, 60 session days, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (B) in the case of the House of Representatives, 60 legislative days,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   before the date the Congress adjourns a session of Congress through the date on which the same or succeeding Congress first convenes its next session, section 802 shall apply to such rule in the succeeding\n   session of Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If a joint resolution is passed by both houses of Congress within the applicable time period and according to the proper procedures, the joint resolution becomes law once signed by the President.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once that occurs, the CRA dictates that the agency rule \"shall not take effect\" (the \"Disapproval Provision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Furthermore, the CRA provides that the invalidated rule \"may not be reissued in substantially the same form\" and \"a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued\" (the \"Reenactment Provision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, reenactment of the same or similar rule is permitted if \"the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2. CBD's Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   CBD appears to separately challenge the Disapproval Provision and the Reenactment Provision of the CRA. As to the former, CBD contends that the Disapproval Provision unconstitutionally allows Congress to alter DOI's authority without using bicameralism and presentment to amend the underlying statutes that give DOI its authority over National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD also asserts that \"even if the CRA and/or the Joint Resolution's declarations that a disapproved rule shall have no effect could be found constitutional, the CRA's prohibition on the issuance of a future rule in 'substantially the same form' \" (the Reenactment Provision) violates the separation of powers doctrine by \"creat[ing] a large and unconstitutional shadow effect that undermines Interior's rulemaking authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Article III standing requires that a plaintiff must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish\n   injury in fact, plaintiffs must establish that they suffered \"an invasion of a legally protected interest\" that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, CBD challenges two separate parts of the CRA. CBD must have standing for each claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1. Disapproval Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CBD's Amended Complaint alleges that Public Law 115-20's disapproval of the Refuges Rule will cause its members the following harm:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Members of the Center seek out opportunities to study, observe and photograph wildlife (as well as their tracks and other signs) in national wildlife refuges in Alaska, including wolves, grizzly bears and black bears. Because of the Joint Resolution and the CRA, aggressive predator control practices authorized by Alaska's Board of Game are no longer categorically prohibited and thus might now occur on Alaska refuges. Such practices would lead to fewer predators and reduced opportunities to encounter and otherwise enjoy such wildlife on Alaska refuges. This, in turn, threatens to injure the Center and its members' aesthetic, conservation, recreational, scientific, educational and wildlife preservation interests in observing and appreciating these animals in the refuges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, \"general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss [the court] presume[s] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD has adequately alleged injury to its members resulting from the disapproval of the Refuges Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other parties do not appear to directly contest CBD's standing to challenge the Disapproval Provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2. Reenactment Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Federal Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors Safari Club contest CBD's standing to challenge the Reenactment Provision of the CRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Federal Defendants emphasize the lack of \"ripeness,\" both Federal Defendants and Safari Club maintain that CBD has not identified a redressable injury stemming from the Reenactment Provision, in large part because of the speculative, non-imminent nature of any potential harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Federal Defendants contend Plaintiffs lack standing because \"Plaintiff has not alleged that the Department of the Interior has any intent to reissue the Refuges Rule (or any substantially similar rule) in the future and that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) is what stands in its way-Plaintiff only speculates that the Department of the Interior might be prevented from doing so at some future date.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Safari Club asserts that \"[f]or the reenactment prohibition to cause harm to CBD's alleged interests, it would have to be likely that Interior would, but for the prohibition, attempt to enact such a regulation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Safari Club maintains that because DOI \"likely would not reenact a regulation that the President rejected by signing the Joint Resolution,\" the Reenactment Provision does not give rise to a redressable injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show that it has \"suffered an 'injury in fact'-an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, CBD's challenge to the Reenactment Provision rests on its assertion that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [b]ecause Congress has not amended any of Interior's authorities and obligations with regard to managing the National Wildlife Refuge System, by barring any future rule in \"substantially the same form\" as a disapproved rule, the CRA, alone or in conjunction with the Joint Resolution, unconstitutionally impinges upon the authorities and obligations of an Executive Branch agency to \"take Care\" that the laws be \"faithfully executed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This assertion does not adequately allege an actual or imminent injury to CBD-it alleges only a hypothetical impingement. However, \"the Art. III requirements of standing are not satisfied by the abstract injury in nonobservance of the Constitution asserted by citizens.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is the Disapproval\n   Provision-pursuant to which Congress passed Public Law 115-20 -and not the Reenactment Provision-that is the reason why the Refuges Rule is not in effect. Therefore, the Disapproval Provision-and not the Reenactment Provision-is the source of CBD's alleged injury. Any injury caused by DOI's inability to promulgate a substantially similar rule, in the absence of any assertion that DOI would otherwise do so, is too speculative to constitute a concrete or imminent injury and is insufficient to confer Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   CBD also contends that \"the prohibition on a future rule in 'substantially the same form' makes it difficult, if not impossible, for Interior to carry out its statutory obligations, as Interior cannot reasonably discern what Congressional mandates still apply, or how, going forward, it can manage the National Wildlife Refuge System in Alaska consistent with those mandates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD provides little support for the assertion that Federal Defendants' actions will preclude DOI from carrying out its statutory duties, except to suggest that Congress's disapproval of the Refuges Rule somehow renders DOI uncertain as to its remaining authority. These unspecified and speculative allegations do not constitute a concrete or imminent injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if CBD could establish an injury-in-fact with respect to the Reenactment Provision, CBD has not alleged how invalidating that provision would redress such injury. For if the Disapproval Provision is valid, the Refuges Rule would remain without force and effect, having been disapproved through Public Law 115-20 pursuant that valid statutory provision. Without a stated intention by DOI to reinstate the same or substantially similar rule, the invalidation of the Reenactment Provision would not redress CBD's alleged injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD maintains that because it seeks reinstatement of the Refuges Rule, its alleged injury resulting from the Reenactment Provision is redressable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   But although reinstatement might occur if the Disapproval Provision were invalidated, reinstatement is not plausible if only the Reenactment Provision were invalidated. Therefore, CBD has not established a redressable injury and lacks Article III standing to challenge to the Reenactment Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Joint Resolution and the CRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court turns to the constitutionality of the Disapproval Provision of the CRA and the Joint Resolution enacted pursuant to it. In its Amended Complaint, CBD makes separate challenges to the Joint Resolution and the CRA. However, the bases for the claims are substantively identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD challenges both the Joint Resolution and the CRA on the basis that they violate the separation of powers doctrine because, through them, Congress restricted DOI's authority without amending the\n   underlying statutes that grant DOI its authority to manage National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD alleges that to the extent the Joint Resolution and the CRA were the bases for congressional disapproval of the Refuges Rule, both were \"contrary to law in violation of ... Interior's obligation to 'take Care' that the laws it is charged with administering be 'faithfully executed.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while CBD purports to make independent claims against both the Joint Resolution and the CRA, both claims rest entirely on the purported unconstitutionality of the CRA. If the Disapproval Provision of the CRA is constitutional, then the Joint Resolution was a valid exercise of congressional authority under the CRA; if the Disapproval Provision of the CRA represents an unconstitutional exercise of power, then the Joint Resolution was passed pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and is thus invalid. Because the constitutionality of the Joint Resolution is determined by the constitutionality of the CRA, the claims will be considered together in this order. Accordingly, the Court will evaluate CBD's first two claims in its Amended Complaint as a single challenge to the constitutionality of the Disapproval Provision of the CRA (\"Constitutional Claim\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Constitutional Claims to the Disapproval of the Refuges Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Pursuant to the requirements of the CRA, Public Law 115-20 was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President. However, CBD asserts that Public Law 115-20 violates the Constitution in two respects: it lacks bicameralism and presentment, and it violates the \"Take Care\" Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   1. Bicameralism and Presentment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution states that \"[e]very Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, a bill must have been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President in order to become law. The former requirement is known as bicameralism and the latter is known as presentment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, there is no contention that the CRA and Public Law 115-20 were not both passed in accordance with the constitutional mandates of bicameralism or presentment. However, CBD asserts that \"[t]o lawfully constrain or otherwise alter Interior's authority under these statutes, Congress must amend these laws using the constitutionally-mandated process of bicameralism and presentment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Public Law 115-20 limits DOI's rulemaking authority but Congress did not specifically amend the underlying sources of that authority, CBD maintains that a constitutional violation has occurred. Federal Defendants respond that joint resolutions passed pursuant to the CRA are consistent with the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   CBD cites to\n   <em>\n    INS v. Chadha\n   </em>\n   as support for its assertion that for Congress to alter\n   DOI's authority pursuant to the CRA, it must first have \"amended through bicameralism and presentment ANILCA, the Administration Act, the Improvement Act, or any other law which provided Interior the rulemaking authorities and mandates executed via the Refuges Rule.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD does not explain how\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   supports its position. In\n   <em>\n    Chadha\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court struck down the House of Representatives' practice of using a \"legislative veto,\" in which the House of Representatives would unilaterally override a decision of the executive branch to suspend an individual's deportation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   To carry out its legislative veto, the House passed a resolution that purported to deport an individual and \"was not submitted to the Senate or presented to the President for his action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court held that \"[t]o accomplish what has been attempted by one House of Congress in this case requires action in conformity with the express procedures of the Constitution's prescription for legislative action: passage by a majority of both Houses and presentment to the President.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, Public Law 115-20 was passed by both the House and Senate and submitted to the President for approval, as required by the CRA-which was also passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the requirements of bicameralism and presentment are met and CBD's separation of powers concerns fail to state a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   2. \"Take Care\" Clause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that \"[the President] shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\" (the \"Take Care Clause\"). The Supreme Court has held that \"[t]he duty of the President to see that the laws be executed is a duty that does not go beyond the laws or require him to achieve more than Congress sees fit to leave within his power.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, CBD contends that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [b]ecause Congress has not amended any of Interior's authorities and obligations with regard to managing the National Wildlife Refuge System, the CRA, alone or in conjunction with the Joint Resolution, in declaring that the Refuges Rule \"shall not take effect (or continue),\" unconstitutionally impinges upon the authorities and obligations of an Executive Branch agency to \"take Care\" that the laws be \"faithfully executed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   CBD reiterates its assertion that Congress must amend DOI's underlying statutory authority before it can disapprove a regulation\n   such as the Refuges Rule, but does not provide persuasive authority to support that assertion. Federal Defendants respond that \"Plaintiff's citations to the Take Care Clause should not be construed as adding anything meaningful to its existing constitutional challenges because the Clause does not provide an independent cause of action in this case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The authority of an executive agency comes from Congress and is subject to modification by Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   CBD appears to assert that whenever Congress delegates authority to an executive agency, it cannot alter or restrict that authority unless it first specifically amends the statutes originally granting that authority. CBD does not provide authority for this assertion, nor does the Court find a basis for it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   By framing its argument as relying on the Take Care Clause, CBD appears to\n   argue that if DOI abides by Public Law 115-20's express disapproval of the Refuges Rule, then DOI will violate the duty placed upon it by the Constitution to faithfully execute the laws of the United States, as enacted by Congress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument seems to require selectively defining \"the laws of the United States\" as referred to in the Take Care Clause to encompass the statutes granting DOI its authority over National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska but not Public Law 115-20, validly enacted pursuant to the CRA. Furthermore, given that the CRA is itself a law passed by Congress pursuant to the mechanisms outlined in the Constitution, CBD does not adequately explain how the Take Care Clause mandates that the executive branch should retain authority that Congress, with Presidential approval, withdrew from it through Public Law 115-20. Consequently, CBD's invocations of the Take Care Clause do not adequately state a claim for relief as to either the Joint Resolution or the Disapproval Provision of the CRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court finds that even construing all the facts in favor of CBD, CBD's constitutional claims fail to adequately allege a plausible basis for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Statutory Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   1. Administrative Procedure Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   CBD contends in the Amended Complaint that \"[t]o the extent Interior has relied upon the Joint Resolution to revoke, refuse to implement, or otherwise nullify the Refuges Rule, that decision is contrary to law in violation of the APA,\" citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   That provision of the APA requires that a court \"hold unlawful and set aside agency actions, findings, and conclusions\" if they are problematic for a specific set of reasons, including being \"contrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because CBD does not identify a particular basis for finding the CRA invalid under the APA, nor provide any specific support for its contention that an APA violation has occurred, the Court presumes that CBD's APA claim is relies on the alleged unconstitutionality of the CRA and Public Law 115-20. Therefore, unless CBD establishes a constitutional violation, it cannot state an independent claim under the APA. In light of the previous analysis of CBD's constitutional claims, CBD fails to state a plausible claim for relief under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ultra Vires\n   </em>\n   Revocation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In its second statutory argument, CBD contends that because the Refuges Rule fell under \u00a7 808 of the CRA, which exempts rules relating to hunting and fishing from certain provisions of that act, it was thus immune from congressional review and should have remained in effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Federal Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors PLF challenge the Court's subject matter jurisdiction over\n   this claim, the Court finds that it has jurisdiction and that CBD has failed to state a claim on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20808\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   provides that \"any rule that establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping ... shall take effect at such time as the Federal agency promulgating the rule determines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CBD asserts that this provision of the statute indicates that \"the CRA does not permit Congressional disapproval of regulations covered by Section 808 in a new session of Congress,\" and therefore the Refuges Rule could not have been properly disapproved under the CRA because \"it is plainly a 'rule that establishes, modifies, opens, closes, or conducts a regulatory program for a commercial, recreational, or subsistence activity related to hunting, fishing, or camping' \" and therefore falls under \u00a7 808.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Rules not falling within \u00a7 808 take effect pursuant to the timeline laid out in \u00a7\u00a7 801(a)(3)-(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 801(d)(1) provides for the mechanism used by Congress in passing the Joint Resolution in this case, allowing a new session of Congress to disapprove a rule passed at the end of the prior session of Congress. CBD contends that because \u00a7 801(d)(1) contemplates \"any rule for which a report was submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A),\" then 801(d)(1) does not apply to the Refuges Rule, because \"regulations covered by Section 808 do not require a Congressional Report because Section 801 only requires such a report '[b]efore a rule can take effect,' and by operation of Section 808, these regulations take effect irrespective of a Congressional Report.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, argues CBD, the Refuges Rule was not \"submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A),\" and therefore \"the Refuges Rule was not eligible for disapproval under Section 801(d)(1) in the new session of Congress.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   However, CBD's argument appears to impute more meaning to \u00a7 808 than its plain language will allow. There is nothing in the language of \u00a7 808 to indicate that it is intended to exempt rules related to fishing or hunting from Congressional review altogether. By its own words the provision allows the agency to determine the date that the regulation \"shall take effect,\" thus withdrawing it from the timeline established by \u00a7\u00a7 801(a)(3)-(4). Rather than having the kind of sweeping effect proposed by CBD, the language of the CRA indicates that \u00a7 808 merely alters the effective date of those particular types of agency rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Furthermore, as Federal Defendants argue, \"[ \u00a7 801(a)(1)(A) ] says that an agency 'shall submit' a CRA report when it issues 'a rule,' and specifies that the report include certain information about 'the rule.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Refuges Rule, despite falling\n   within \u00a7 808, is undoubtedly \"a rule;\" therefore, this Court sees no reason why it would not fall under \u00a7 801(a)(1)(A). In addition, \u00a7 801(d)(1) provides for review of rules \"for which a report was submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(A) [during the specified time period].\" Here, there is no dispute that a report was submitted for the Refuges Rule, within the time period specified in \u00a7 801(d)(1). Therefore, CBD's fails to state a cognizable claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Motions to Dismiss at Dockets 107, 110, 113, and 116 are GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Clerk of Court is directed to enter a final judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Federal Defendants filed their first motion to dismiss on June 26, 2017 at Docket 62.

Docket 104 at 12, \u00b6\u00b6 52-54; Docket 119 at 26-28. However, CBD provides no authority in its Amended Complaint or in its briefing to support this assertion except for citations to art. 1, \u00a7 7 of the Constitution and\n    <em>\n     INS v. Chadha\n    </em>\n    , neither of which articulates a requirement that Congress cannot restrict an agency's rulemaking authority unless it also amends the underlying statute through which Congress granted that agency its authority in the first place. Federal Defendants respond that \"there is simply no such requirement-constitutional or otherwise-that Congress take some clerical action to formally amend or repeal an older law (or regulation) before enacting a new inconsistent law\"; Federal Defendants maintain that \"even if there were such a requirement, Congress\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    amend the older statutes that led to the issuance of the Refuges Rule by declaring that, notwithstanding those prior statutes, the Refuges Rule shall have no force and effect.\" Docket 108 at 19-20. In CBD's reply, it characterizes Federal Defendants' response as an assertion that Public Law 115-20 constituted an \"implied repeal\" of DOI's statutory authority and reiterates its contention that bicameralism and presentment are required for Congress to withdraw delegated authority from an agency. Docket 119 at 22, 27-28. However, CBD acknowledges that there is no direct conflict between Public Law 115-20 and the statutes through which DOI derives its authority to regulate National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska, thus making it even less clear why repeal or amendment of those statutes is necessary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket 119 at 22 (stating \"there is no conflict at all\" between the Joint Resolution and either ANILCA, the Administration Act, or the Improvement Act).

Instead, CBD is claiming that DOI, at the behest of Congress, acted\n    <em>\n     ultra vires\n    </em>\n    in taking action beyond the authority provided by the CRA. Therefore, \u00a7 805's restriction on judicial review does not apply. The cases discussed by Federal Defendants do not persuade the Court otherwise.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket 108 at 29.\n    <em>\n     Montanans For Multiple Use v. Barbouletos\n    </em>\n    addressed the Forest Service's alleged failure to submit certain rules for congressional review pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(A).\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542843,3655515\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/225/\">\n     568 F.3d 225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 229 (D.C. Cir. 2009). The court held that \"[t]he language of \u00a7 805 is unequivocal and precludes review of this claim.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3542843,3655515\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/225/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    However, the same does not appear to be true here, because unlike in\n    <em>\n     Barbouletos\n    </em>\n    -in which the plaintiffs disputed the agency's compliance with the procedures of the CRA-CBD challenges the fundamental authority of the agency to take the action at issue. With regard to\n    <em>\n     Via Christi Reg'l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Leavitt\n    </em>\n    , Federal Defendants offer only a footnote from a case from the Tenth Circuit, whose authority does not bind this court.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331213\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/509/1259/\">\n     509 F.3d 1259\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1271 n.11 (10th Cir. 2007). Furthermore, Federal Defendants acknowledge that other courts have recognized challenges to agency non-compliance with the CRA. Docket 108 at 29 (citing\n    <em>\n     United States v. S. Indiana Gas &amp; Elec. Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031427523\">\n     2002 WL 31427523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (S.D. Ind. Oct. 24, 2002) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Federal Defendants further assert that CBD would only be able to establish this Court's subject matter jurisdiction through the\n    <em>\n     Leedom v. Kyne\n    </em>\n    exception, which permits judicial review of a claim that an agency acted\n    <em>\n     ultra vires\n    </em>\n    only if the agency acts \"in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition\" in its organic statute and \"deprived the professional employees of a 'right' assured to them by Congress.\"\n    <em>\n     Leedom v. Kyne\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651562\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/184/#p188\">\n     358 U.S. 184\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 188-89,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651562\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/184/#p188\">\n     79 S.Ct. 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651562\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/358/184/#p188\">\n     3 L.Ed.2d 210\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1958) ;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Docket 108 at 30. However, notwithstanding Federal Defendants' speculation, CBD did not make any assertions with regard to this exception. Therefore, the Court need not analyze and decide whether CBD has challenged an agency decision that qualifies for the exception. As described above, CBD has standing to challenge the disapproval of the Refuges Rule, and CBD's statutory claim alleges that this disapproval was executed in violation of the CRA. As a claim that arises under a federal law, and in light of the Court's rejection of PLF's and Federal Defendants' arguments to the contrary, this Court has jurisdiction to consider the claim. Regardless, the Court determines that CBD's interpretation of \u00a7 808 is incorrect and therefore does not state a plausible claim for relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Finally, to the extent that CBD challenges the CRA's procedures, the\n    <em>\n     amici\n    </em>\n    States assert that such \"challenge to the CRA's procedures would be a non-justiciable political question.\" Docket 84 at 12 (citing\n    <em>\n     Consejo de Desarrollo Economico de Mexicali, A.C. v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865517\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/1157/#p1171\">\n     482 F.3d 1157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1171-72 (9th Cir. 2007) ).
