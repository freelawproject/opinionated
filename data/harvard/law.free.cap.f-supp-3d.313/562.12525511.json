Both parties have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, Colbert's motion is denied and the Commissioner's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Colbert applied for Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") on January 7, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed Oct. 30, 2017 (Docket # 12) (\"R.\"), at 210-18. The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied Colbert's application and Colbert sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 102-08. A video hearing was held on January 20, 2016, before ALJ Jack Russak. R. 55-88. In a written decision dated February 1, 2016, the ALJ found Colbert not disabled within the meaning of the Act. R. 16-38. On May 12, 2017, the Appeals Council denied Colbert's request for review of the ALJ's decision, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-6. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearing Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Colbert was represented by attorney David E. Levine at the January 20, 2016 hearing before the ALJ. R. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Colbert testified to having psychiatric issues, alcohol and substance use disorders, and problems in her left knee caused by a torn meniscus. R. 60, 79. At the time of the hearing, she was seeing a psychiatrist once a month, having started in late 2012 or early 2013. R. 69. She also attended therapy once a week. R. 69. She said that she was currently taking psychiatric medication and blood pressure medication, which caused her to \"sleep a lot\" and increased her appetite. R. 70. She explained that one of the side effects of the medication she was taking is weight gain. R. 61-62. She said the medication helps \"because [she] do[es]n't hear the voices that [she] was hearing before as much.\" R. 70. Those voices would tell her to \"just drink and just go ahead and get high,\" and to \"just give up\" because \"[y]ou're never going to see your kids again.\" R. 75. She also testified to having concentration problems. R. 75. As for her knees, she explained that while she had undergone surgery on her knee, it was not successful: \"I can't even move it [now],\" and \"[s]ometimes it clicks and I can't do nothing with it.\" R. 77. She also now \"get[s] a lot of cramps in the knee,\" more than before. R. 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Her knee problems limit her daily activities. In addition to using a cane which she was prescribed, she \"can't get in the tub, in and out,\" R. 63, and can generally walk only \"a half a block,\" before stopping to catch her breath, R. 71. She has no problems dressing herself and taking a shower, however. R. 63-64. She said that she does not have any limitations in sitting, except that \"[i]f [she] sit[s] long enough, [she]'ll fall asleep,\" R. 71, but later explained that she also needs to have her legs elevated when she sits, R. 78. She \"can't stand at all because [her] lower back will start hurting ... [her] knee will start hurting,\" and \"so [she] can't stand\" for long at all. R. 71. For example, she cannot clean the apartment and so a friend will sometimes \"sweep and mop the floor\" for her. R. 72. She must sit down to \"prep [her] food\" when cooking, and after she has placed her food on the stove, she needs to \"go sit down and come back to it [later].\" R. 71-72. Despite these limitations, she does her own grocery shopping, \"because the supermarket is not far\" and she can take \"[her] shopping cart with [her].\" R. 72. She traveled to the hearing by bus and alone. R. 63-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When not performing routine household activities, she attends church, watches TV and movies, and sometimes reads the Bible. R. 65. She said that she attends church every Sunday and occasionally on Wednesday for Bible study, taking two buses to get there, but also later acknowledged that she sometimes stays home because\n   she dislikes certain other parishioners at the church. R. 64, 76. She does not make social calls to friends or relatives. R. 65, 72. She was married for 19 years, but it was a violent marriage and they divorced in 2010. R. 62-63. She has 15 children, but none of them are living with her at the moment and she does not see them. R. 64. Although she testified that a friend will visit her \"maybe ... once a week\" from New Jersey, she also explained that \"[s]he just comes and checks in on me,\" meaning that she'll ask \"how you're doing, you're okay, you need me to do anything for you\"? R. 73-75. As for how she spends her time, she said that she spends most days praying, watching TV, and eating. R. 73. She does not have access to a computer or a cell phone. R. 65-66. She survives off of food stamps and public assistance. R. 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the time of the hearing, Colbert was 48 years old. R. 61. She had not previously worked, except a few months in 2010 \"[braiding] people's hair that [would] come to [her] house, ... [so that they] give [her] a couple of dollars.\" R. 58, 67. She stopped because \"[t]here was nobody else's hair to do.\" R. 58. Before 2012, she was addicted to alcohol and cocaine, but has not used either since 2012. R. 73-74. She has obtained her GED and, while in recovery for drug addiction, completed a course to become a substance abuse counselor. R. 66-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A vocational expert (\"VE\"), Melissa Fass-Karlin, provided her opinion on Colbert's vocational capacity. R. 80-85. She described Colbert's past work as that of a hair stylist, demanding \"light\" exertion with a skill level of 6. R. 81. The ALJ asked Fass-Karlin whether a person of Colbert's age, education, and work experience could perform any work in the national economy if he or she was limited to sedentary work and could\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   climb ramps and stairs occasional[ly]; never climb ladders, ropes, [or] scaffolds; occasionally stoop, crouch, and kneel, but never crawl; [was] limited to jobs that can be performed by using a handheld assistive device required only for uneven terrain or prolonged ambulation. Nonexertional limitations will be the following: work is limited to simple, routine tasks; work in a low-stressed job defined as having only occasional decision-making, [and] only occasional changes in the work setting; work off task five percent of the day in addition to regular[ly] scheduled breaks; work with only occasional judgment required on the job, and finally no interaction with the public, [and] ... occasional interaction with coworkers\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   R. 81-82. The VE testified that such a person could not perform the work of a hairstylist, but could work as \"a bench hand,\" \"addresser,\" and \"document preparer.\" R. 83-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both Colbert and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 2-8; Comm'r Mem. at 2-10. The summaries are substantially consistent with each other. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Nov. 1, 2017 (Docket # 13), \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so. Accordingly, the Court adopts Colbert's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purposes of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The ALJ denied Colbert's application for SSI on February 1, 2016. R. 16. Following\n   the five-step test set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found at step one that Colbert had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity\" since January 7, 2014, which was the date on which she applied for benefits. R. 21. At step two, the ALJ found that Colbert had the following severe impairments: \"status post left knee arthroscopic surgery, pseudo brain tumor, hypertension, obesity, depressive disorder, and alcohol and crack cocaine dependence in remission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At step three, the ALJ concluded that none of Colbert's severe impairments singly or in combination met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. R. 22-24. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ considered Listing 1.02, Major Dysfunction of a Joint; Listing 4.00, Cardiovascular System; Listing 12.04, Affective Disorders; and Listing 12.09, Substance Addiction Disorder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 \u00a7\u00a7 1.02, 4.00, 12.04, 12.09. The ALJ determined that Listing 1.02 was not met because the record evidence did not \"demonstrate the requisite gross anatomical deformity with evidence of joint space narrowing, bony destruction, or ankylosis, resulting in inability to ambulate effectively.\" R. 22. Evidence in the record was similarly lacking to show any of the requirements to meet or medically equal Listing 4.00.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As for Listings 12.04 and 12.09, the ALJ found that Colbert did not meet any of the \"paragraph B\" criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 22-23. She was only mildly restricted in her activities of daily living, moderately restricted in her social functioning, concentration, and persistence or pace, and had not experienced any episodes of decompensation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The record also did not substantiate a claim that she met the \"paragraph C\" criteria, according to the ALJ. R. 23-24. Specifically, the ALJ found no evidence that Colbert suffered from \"a residual disease process that has resulted in such marginal adjustment that even a minimal increase in mental demands or change in the environment would be predicted to cause the claimant to decompensate,\" or a recent history of lengthy inability \"to function outside a highly supportive living arrangement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Having found that Colbert could not meet Listings 1.02, 4.00, 12.04, or 12.09, the ALJ next assessed Colbert's residual\n   functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 24-31. Upon review of the record, the ALJ found that Colbert\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   has the residual functional capacity to perform sedentary work as defined in 20 CFR 416.967(a) except she can only occasionally climb ramps and stairs, and never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds. She can occasionally stoop, crouch, kneel and never crawl. The claimant is limited to work that can be performed while utilizing a hand-held assistive device required for uneven terrain or prolonged ambulation. She could tolerate no exposure to moving machinery, unprotected heights, or driving motor vehicles. The claimant was limited to performing simple, routine tasks in a low-stress job, defined as requiring only occasional decision-making and judgment, and involving only occasional changes in the work setting, and occasional interaction with the public and coworkers. In addition, she is limited to work at a job allowing her to be off-task for 5% of the workday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   R. 24. In finding this RFC, the ALJ relied heavily on the medical notes and observations of Colbert's various treating and examining physicians, R. 26-31, giving \"great weight\" to the opinions of treating psychiatrist Dr. Tarsha Hunter, consultative psychiatric examiner Dr. Haruyo Fujiwaki, and consultative internal medicine examiner Dr. Vinod Thukral, R. 30-31. The ALJ awarded \"little weight\" to the opinion of treating psychiatrist Dr. Michael Hargrove, who found marked limitations in most functional areas, because the ALJ found his opinion \"in stark contrast with, and far more restrictive than the evidence of record, including Dr. Hargrove's own treating records,\" as well as Dr. Hargrove's assessed GAF score of 55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 31. It also \"does not adequately consider [Colbert's] own reported retained mental capacity to perform tasks [related to paragraph B criteria for a psychiatric disorder listing].\" R. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At step four, the ALJ found that Colbert could no longer work as a hair stylist, finding that job exceeded her RFC. R. 32. At step five, because the ALJ found that Colbert's RFC was less than the performance requirements for sedentary work under the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, the ALJ relied on the VE's testimony at the hearing. R. 32-33. At the hearing, the VE had testified that a hypothetical person with Colbert's RFC, age, work experience, education, and limitations could perform the jobs of \"bench hand, addresser, and document preparer.\" R. 33. Based on that testimony, which the ALJ found credible and reliable, the ALJ concluded that Colbert was \"capable of making a successful adjustment to other work ... in the national economy,\" and accordingly was not disabled under the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    GOVERNING STANDARDS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Judicial Review Under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A court reviewing a final decision by the Commissioner \"is limited to determining whether the [Commissioner's] conclusions were supported by substantial evidence in the record and were based on a correct legal standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Selian v.

R. 22-23. In the area of activities of daily living, the ALJ concluded that Colbert was mildly restricted, noting that she sometimes had trouble sleeping but otherwise has no \"psychological barriers to performing her personal hygiene tasks,\" does \"her own laundry, clean[s] her home, travel[s] independently via public transportation, and shop[s] in stores for toiletries, and snacks.\" R. 22. In the area of social functioning, the ALJ recognized that Colbert suffered more severe restrictions, finding that she has moderate difficulties as she does \"not spend time with others,\" \"isolate[s] herself when she [is] depressed,\" and experiences anxiety when contemplating a decision. R. 23. However, these challenges did not rise to the level of \"marked,\" because in the ALJ's view of the record, \"she denied [in February and April 2014] having any problems getting along with other people, including those in authority, and she had never lost a job because of problems getting along with others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She also regularly attended church and group therapy, and was able to travel on public transportation and shop in stores. R. 23.

Mem. at 10. Dr. Hargrove had filled out a \"Medical Source Statement\" on April 30, 2015, R. 699-703, indicating that Colbert had marked limitations in all areas related to her \"ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions,\" her \"ability to respond appropriately to supervision, coworkers and work pressure in a work-setting,\" her activities of daily living, and her social functioning. R. 701-02. Dr. Hargrove also opined that Colbert had \"frequent\" deficiencies of concentration, persistence, or pace and \"continual\" episodes of deterioration. R. 702. Such limitations were reportedly unchanged and persistent from the 1990s through to the 2015 evaluation. R. 703. The opinion also reported that Colbert's highest GAF score in the past year was 55, which was also her score at the time of the examination. R. 699. Had the ALJ deferred to this opinion, as Colbert desires, it plainly would have resulted in a finding of disability at step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As stated earlier, the ALJ gave this opinion \"little weight,\" finding it \"in stark contrast to\" Dr. Hargrove's own notes, the record as a whole, the reported GAF score, and Colbert's \"own reported retained mental capacity.\" R. 31.

In that case, however, the Court determined that the ALJ's stated reasons were insufficiently developed for review and therefore it ordered the ALJ to further \"develop the record on this issue on remand.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928182\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928182\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/335/\">\n    at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did not base its decision on the length of the treating relationship. The other case cited by Colbert,\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20637154\">\n    2009 WL 637154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2009), concerned an ALJ's reliance on the opinions of a non-examining state agency medical consultant instead of treating physicians who made contrary findings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *23-25.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   reasoned that the treating sources' opinions merited great weight, in part, \"[b]ecause the findings of the treating and examining physicians were consistent with each other\" while the non-examining physician's opinions \"were largely inconsistent with the examining physicians' findings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Here, the ALJ properly gave little weight to Dr. Hargrove's opinion of Colbert's functional limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, although Dr. Hargrove opined that Colbert was markedly impaired in all functional areas, going back to the 1990s, his reported GAF score of 55 at the time of that evaluation, R. 699, as well as at an October 2013 examination, R. 652, contradicts these findings because, as noted by the ALJ, R. 31, this score indicates only moderate symptoms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohler\n   </em>\n   , 546 F.3d at 262 n.1 (\"A GAF between 51 and 60 indicates '[m]oderate symptoms (e.g., flat affect and circumstantial speech, occasional panic attacks) OR moderate difficulty in social, occupational or school functioning (e.g., few friends, conflicts with peers or co-workers).' \") (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Indeed, at about that same time as the October 2013 examination, Colbert was assessed with a GAF score of 68 by Dr. Hunter, indicating only mild symptoms. R. 481;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maldonado v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20775829\">\n    2017 WL 775829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2017) (\"a score of 61-70 indicates some mild symptoms or some difficulty in social or occupational functioning, but generally functioning 'pretty well' \") (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, the ALJ correctly noted that Dr. Hargrove's opinion is inconsistent with his own treating notes. Specifically, at an October 2013 examination, Dr. Hargrove had stated that Colbert was \"calm and cooperative\"; that her \"speech is coherent, relevant, [and] goal directed\"; and that she exhibited \"no formal thought process disorder\" and denied \"[audio-visual] hallucinations and [suicidal] ideations.\" R. 651. He also observed that her \"memory and cognition are [within normal limits], ... judgment and insight are adequate, [and] reality testing good.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20775829\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Colbert also had reported to Dr. Hargrove that she did not at the time \"feel[ ] anxious or depressed,\" nor was she experiencing sleep or appetite issues. R. 650. His office notes from the October 2013 examination also indicated that he thought that no maintenance therapy was necessary and accordingly no return appointment should be made. R. 653.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, although Dr. Hargrove treated Colbert starting only in 2013 through 2015, he still opined that her functional limitations had begun in the 1990s and had continued through to the date he filled out the evaluation form. R. 703. Given the lack of support for the opinion that \"marked\" limitations existed for this lengthy period, the ALJ was correct to note it as a factor\n   for giving less weight to the opinion overall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Fourth, Dr. Hargrove's opinion, as noted by the ALJ, R. 31, was contradicted by the opinions and treating notes of three other psychiatrists. Dr. Hunter, in February 2013, noted that Colbert was \"well-groomed, cooperative,\" had \"normal\" speech, \"full\" affect, \"linear\" thought processes, good \"insight [and] judgment,\" and reported that Colbert \"found talk therapy/church to be helpful-didn't need meds after that.\" R. 479-80. Dr. Fujiwaki observed at an April 2014 examination that Colbert's \"manner of relating, social skills, and overall presentation was adequate,\" that her attention and concentration were only \"mildly impaired,\" as were her recent and remote memory skills. R. 630-31. Dr. Fujiwaki also opined that Colbert could \"follow and understand simple directions and instructions, [ ] perform simple tasks independently[, and] ... [was] able to maintain a regular schedule in a structured and supportive environment[,] ... [but was] moderately impaired in relating adequately with others, and appropriately dealing with stress.\" R. 631. Last, Dr. James Herivaux, a treating physician, noted at an October 2015 examination that Colbert had shown improvement over the last year, \"feel[ing] more relieved since she has more support.\" R. 729. In recording largely normal observations and improvement, these notes support the ALJ's assertion that Dr. Hargrove's opinion was \"in stark contrast with ... the evidence of record.\" R. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Fifth, despite Dr. Hargrove's opinion that Colbert had marked limitations in her ability to perform daily activities and to function socially, the record shows that Colbert was able to attend weekly therapy sessions, as well as monthly collateral and family therapy, on a consistent basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 648 (\"her attendance has been highly consistent\"), 729 (\"[Colbert] has been attending her weekly session and has been compliant with meds.... [She] complet[ed] the inpatient substance abuse treatment program. She has also completed the outpatient substance abuse program as well.\"). She also completed a 5-month outpatient program at United Bronx Parents, R. 727, and testified at the 2016 hearing to attending church on a regular basis, taking the bus independently, shopping, reading the Bible daily, doing her own laundry, and cooking, R. 63-65, 71-72, 76. Thus, substantial evidence supported the ALJ's finding that Dr. Hargrove's opinion did \"not adequately consider [Colbert's] own reported retained mental capacity to perform tasks such as activities of daily living, function socially, and maintain her concentration, persistence, and pace despite her severe mental impairments.\" R. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Colbert points to several facts in the record that she argues \"lend [ ] more credibility to Dr. Hargove's opinion,\" Pl. Mem. at 12, and that in her view undermine the ALJ's reasoning,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. In considering Colbert's arguments, we emphasize that the issue before us is not whether there exists substantial evidence to support Colbert's position but rather whether there exists substantial evidence to support the ALJ's determination.\n   <em>\n    Genier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3680065\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/46/#p49\">\n    606 F.3d at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Colbert notes that the Administration for Children's Services (\"ACS\") took away all of her children, including her most recent child who was removed from her in January 2013,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 310, 650, stating that this is consistent with a finding that she has \"marked limitations in social functioning,\" Pl. Mem. at 12 (citing R. 310, 650), and \"that her ability to make appropriate decisions was extremely limited,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. We reject this argument because these incidents took place prior to her disability onset date of January 28, 2014,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 21, Pl. Mem. at 1, over the course of many\n   years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 310, and thus they do not speak directly to her ability to function socially and maintain relationships during the relevant time frame of analysis-that is, the time between her alleged disability onset date (January 28, 2014) and the date of the ALJ's decision (February 1, 2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Provisero v.

Aug. 8, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20368009\">\n    2016 WL 368009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2016). Colbert herself admitted that she had been addicted to alcohol and cocaine \"[f]or years\" prior to 2012. R. 73-74. Indeed, there are extensive records showing treatment for substance abuse, R. 278-89, 305-12, 477-91, including a record that a fetus she was carrying was exposed to cocaine and alcohol, R. 306. Thus, that Colbert's children were taken from her does not suggest that the ALJ's assessment of her social functioning was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Colbert argues that increases in the dosage of her prescribed medications show that she continued to experience auditory hallucinations and depression during the relevant time period, undermining the ALJ's assertion that Colbert improved with medication. Pl. Mem. at 15 (citing R. 729). But Dr. Herivaux's records in October 2015 indicate that Colbert \"[o]ver the past year ... [has] shown improvement, she feels more relieved since she has more support.\" R. 729. These notes provide no support to Dr. Hargrove's opinion from earlier in that year which opined that Colbert had marked limitations since the 1990s. Colbert argues that it is categorically improper for an ALJ to employ a physician's remarks on a patient's improvement where the physician also increases the patient's medication. Pl. Mem. at 15. But the case cited,\n   <em>\n    Burton-Mann v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367973\">\n    2016 WL 4367973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2016), does not support this conclusion. Rather, it stands for the more limited principle that a person with a chronic disease should not be judged to have improved merely because of stray \"hopeful remarks\" in a record that otherwise suggests ongoing distress.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. In that case, the ALJ omitted any mention of information contained in a treating source's notes that corroborated the source's opinion, including that \"the plaintiff's current dosage of medication was increased,\" while seizing upon \" 'hopeful remarks' about a plaintiff's improvement to conclude that little weight [was] due to a treating source.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, by contrast, the ALJ accurately described Dr. Herivaux and Dr. Hargrove's notes, including Dr. Herivaux's \"recommended adjustment of [Colbert's] medication and continuation of psychotherapy.\" R. 29-30. Nonetheless, the ALJ found evidence suggesting that Colbert's symptoms had improved with consistent use of medication, including her own testimony at the hearing. R. 70. Thus, the increase in Colbert's medication regimen does not render the ALJ's opinion unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Colbert also argues that too much deference was given to the opinion of consulting psychiatrist Dr. Fujiwaki. Pl. Mem. at 13. Specifically, Colbert claims it was error to give great weight to Dr. Fujiwaki's opinion because Dr. Fujiwaki examined Colbert only once, the opinion preceded Dr. Hargrove's by a year, the opinion contradicted Dr. Hargrove's opinion, and the involvement of ACS in Colbert's relationship with her children suggested\n   much more severe limitations than Dr. Fujiwaki found.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   We have already considered and rejected the last point. As to the others, it is well-settled that a consulting psychiatric examiner's opinion may be given great weight and may constitute substantial evidence to support a decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

The ALJ determined that Dr. Fujiwaki's opinion merited great weight because \"it [was] supported by the evidence of record as a whole, which demonstrates depressive disorder with persistent symptoms despite the claimant's course of treatment of psychotropic medications and psychotherapy.\" R. 30. It also \"adequately considers the claimant's subjective complaints, as well as her own reported retained mental capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358597\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/552/#p577\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This determination is supported by substantial evidence, as the opinions and notes of Dr. Hunter, R. 479-81, and Dr. Herivaux, R. 729-31, as well as Dr. Hargrove's notes, R. 650-52, support Dr. Fujiwaki's findings that Colbert had depression with persistent symptoms but only mild to moderate restrictions in key functional areas. It is only Dr. Hargrove's opinion, R. 699-703, that stands out. Where there is a genuine dispute in the evidence, as there is here, the ALJ does not commit error in resolving it in favor of a consultative examiner's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Veino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319613\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/578/#p588\">\n    312 F.3d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we cannot find that it was error for the ALJ to accord Dr. Fujiwaki's opinion greater weight than Dr. Hargrove's. Inasmuch as Colbert also raises the relative timing of Dr. Fujiwaki's opinion and the fact that it was the result of one examination, these factors merely go to the weight given an opinion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.927\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)-(6), and do not render a consulting opinion valueless.

Colbert contends that her testimony indicates otherwise. Pl. Mem. at 12. While we recognize that Colbert testified at the hearing that she does not clean her apartment but rather relies on a friend to sweep and mop, R. 72, 74-75, the ALJ cited correctly to three other portions of the record where Colbert attests to an ability to clean and do her own laundry,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 22 (citing R. 253-63, 629-32, 633-37). Namely, Colbert stated in her \"function report,\" R. 255, that she can clean and do her own laundry, R. 258, except to the extent that cleaning required \"moving heavy objects,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dr. Fujiwaki reported that Colbert told him she could clean and do laundry, R. 631; and Dr. Thukral similarly reported that Colbert so stated, R. 634. Moreover, Colbert's testimony at the hearing suggested that it was her physical impairments that limited her from cleaning, while the issue being addressed by Colbert in her motion is to what degree her psychological impairments restrict her activities of daily living. On the basis of this record, the ALJ had substantial evidence for his factual conclusion that Colbert could in fact clean and do laundry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The second factual error Colbert points us too is that the ALJ improperly stated that Colbert \"had never lost a job because of problems getting along with others.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 13-14 (citing R. 23). As Colbert points out, she in fact has not held\n   a consistent job \"since 2000.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11959295\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/29/#p36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We agree that although technically accurate, the ALJ's assertion was misleading. Colbert has been unemployed since at least 2000, except for a couple of months of self-employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 67, 232, 245. She has thus had no opportunity to lose a job based on her ability to get along with others. But we do not view this error as rendering without proper support the ALJ's conclusion that Colbert is only moderately impaired in the area of social functioning. In support of that conclusion, the ALJ also noted that Colbert \"denied having any problems getting along with other people,\" attended \"group programming\" and church, traveled independently on public transit, and shopped in stores.

While in finding Colbert's testimony not \"entirely supported by the evidence of record as a whole,\" R. 26, the ALJ did not explicitly address the side effects of Colbert's medications, there is ample evidence in the opinion and the record to \"glean the rationale of the ALJ's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Mongeur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10606037\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/722/1033/#p1037\">\n    722 F.2d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notably, during the ALJ's summary of the record evidence, he noted numerous statements that contradicted or undermined Colbert's statements about the side effects of her medication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 25-32. For instance, while she attributed her drowsiness to her medicine, she also reported to Dr. Fujiwaki in April 2014 that she had difficulty falling and staying asleep at night. R. 29.

Mem. at 16-17. Specifically, she contends that the RFC should have included limits on her pushing, pulling, reaching, handling, and fingering, and vision-related limitations, on account of alleged wrist impairments, severe headaches and blurry vision caused by a pseudo tumor, and glaucoma.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In support of the pushing, pulling, and handling limitations, Colbert points to consulting examiner Dr. Vinod Thukral's 2014 opinion that Colbert had mild limitations in her ability to push or pull, R. 636, as well as Colbert's July 2015 diagnosis for\n   tenosynovitis in her right wrist, R. 807, and treatment for a painful mass on her right wrist, R. 814. Pl. Mem. at 16. She also claims that despite treatment, her wrist did not improve.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing R. 807). We find, however, that there was substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner's decision to exclude any such limitations from her RFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   First, Dr. Thukral's opinion stated that any recommended limitations were \"due to [Colbert's] left knee pain,\" R. 636, and that Colbert had full range of motion in her wrists bilaterally, intact hand and finger dexterity, and full grip strength bilaterally,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   He also did not diagnose her as having any wrist problems or note such a concern.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the opinion does not support any limitations in pushing, pulling, reaching, handling, or fingering on account of a wrist impairment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, it supports the ALJ's RFC determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Second, Colbert has cited no record evidence connecting her July 2015 diagnosis for tenosynovitis to any ongoing functional limitations. The evidence that Colbert cites to merely notes that her tenosynovitis had not improved over a six month period, despite treatment with splints, anti-inflammatory medications, and general rest. R. 807, 812. The only other record evidence addressing her wrist states that imaging shows \"no fracture or dislocation ... [,] minimal spurring at the first carpometacarpal joint ... [and] mild soft tissue swelling at the dorsal aspect of the wrist.\" R. 867.
