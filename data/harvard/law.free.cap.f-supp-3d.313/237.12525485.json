Upon assuming office in March 2017, Defendant Seema Verma, the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services-along with then-Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Tom Price-immediately circulated a letter to the Governors of all states to share her belief that\n   the ACA's Medicaid expansion \"was a clear departure from the core, historical mission of the program.\" Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., Dear Governor Letter (Mar. 14, 2017), https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sec-price-admin-verma-ltr.pdf. The letter encouraged states to apply for \"waiver[s]\" of some of the program's coverage requirements-especially for the expansion group-promising to \"fast-track\" approval of such petitions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Kentucky is one state to board that train. After the ACA went into effect, it elected to broaden Medicaid to include the expansion population, and by April 2016, more than 428,000 new residents had thereby received medical assistance. In July 2017, however, the state submitted an experimental plan to CMS called \"KY HEALTH,\" which is made up of several components, most significantly Kentucky HEALTH. That latter program promised to \"comprehensively transform\" its Medicaid program. Under that plan, the state would impose \"community-engagement\" requirements for the expansion population, along with some of the traditional population as well. This new mandate would require that those recipients work (or participate in other qualifying activities) for at least 80 hours each month as a condition of receiving health coverage. The project also called for, among other things, increased premiums and more stringent reporting requirements. Consistent with CMS's earlier invitation, the Secretary approved Kentucky's application on January 12, 2018, waiving several core Medicaid requirements in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are fifteen Kentucky residents, each of whom is currently enrolled in the state's Medicaid program. Together, they fear that Kentucky HEALTH will relegate them to second-class status within Medicaid, putting them and others \"in danger of losing\" their health insurance altogether. They have thus brought this action to challenge the Secretary's approval of Kentucky HEALTH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the Secretary is afforded significant deference in his approval of pilot projects like Kentucky's, his discretion does not insulate him entirely from judicial review. Such review reveals that the Secretary never adequately considered whether Kentucky HEALTH would in fact help the state furnish medical assistance to its citizens, a central objective of Medicaid. This signal omission renders his determination arbitrary and capricious. The Court, consequently, will vacate the approval of Kentucky's project and remand the matter to HHS for further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Secretary and Kentucky, they say, sought to do little more than \"knock people off Medicaid and undermine the Medicaid expansion enacted by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. With that view in mind, their nine-count Complaint-which relies almost exclusively on the APA-challenges nearly every component of Kentucky HEALTH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, they attack the project as a whole, claiming the Secretary erred by finding that it was likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl, Count VIII. Second, in Counts II-VII, they challenge each individual component of that program-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the community-engagement requirement, the premiums, the reporting requirements, the lockouts, the limits on NEMT and retroactive eligibility, and the penalties for non-emergency use of the emergency room. For the latter counts, Plaintiffs principally maintain that each of those features is unlikely to promote the Act's objectives. In Counts III and IV, Plaintiffs further allege that the Secretary could not permit certain premium or cost sharing (such as penalties on non-emergency use of the emergency room) through his Section 1115 authority. Beyond that, Plaintiffs challenge the Secretary's issuance of the SMD Letter (Count I), as well as allege violations under the Take Care Clause (Count IX).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For reasons discussed in more detail below, the Court need adjudicate only one count of Plaintiffs' Complaint to grant them full relief: Count VIII, which challenges the Secretary's approval of Kentucky HEALTH as a whole.

ECF No. 71 (Oral Argument Transcript) at 40:18-41:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court need not resolve this dispute because, even were Plaintiffs to keep their Medicaid coverage, Kentucky HEALTH will increase their monthly premium payments. Ordinarily, states can charge their Medicaid beneficiaries only \"nominal\" premiums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   .

Instead, he suggests that each named Plaintiff might be\n   <em>\n    exempt\n   </em>\n   from this requirement. Kentucky HEALTH, however, excepts only the following groups from premium payments: (1) former foster-care youth; (2) pregnant women; and (3) medically frail individuals. Although Kentucky has not yet defined medically frail, several Plaintiffs aver that they are \"healthy and do not have any ongoing medical problems.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF Nos. 33-13 (Affidavit of Katelyn Allen), \u00b6 6; 33-15 (Affidavit of David Roode), \u00b6 6; 33-17 (Affidavit of Quenton Radford), \u00b6 8. CMS concedes that David Roode is \"substantially likely not to be found exempt on the basis of medical frailty,\" CMS Br. at 30, and Kentucky has also submitted a supplemental declaration noting that Plaintiff Glassie Kasey, among others, had not been identified as \"medically frail by an MCO.\" ECF No. 69 (Notice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   CMS suggests that these Plaintiffs might nevertheless meet one of the other\n   two exemptions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CMS Br. at 30, but the Court cannot agree. Quite obviously, Roode, a 39-year-old man, is not a pregnant woman. Medical advances notwithstanding, Kasey, a 56-year-old woman, is also unlikely to meet that criterion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33-3 (Affidavit of Glassie Kasey), \u00b6 2. Plaintiffs also represent in their briefing that they will not \"be exempted as former foster care youth.\" Reply at 5. Although they could have made this point more clearly in their affidavits, the Court sees no reason to think they might fall within that exemption (and the odds would certainly suggest otherwise). The Court therefore finds it likely that at least those two Plaintiffs would be required to pay increased premiums and thus would suffer a concrete injury from Kentucky HEALTH. This is all that is needed to challenge the program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v.

To the extent Plaintiffs mean to argue that none of those features is\n   <em>\n    independently\n   </em>\n   likely to further the Act's objectives, such focus would be misplaced. As they now seem to concede,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply Br. at 24, Section 1115(a) asks whether a \"\n   <em>\n    project\n   </em>\n   \" would promote the Act's objectives, not whether each component, \"viewed in isolation,\" would.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

While it may be relevant to the Secretary's determination whether any given component is consistent with the Act's objectives, he must ultimately determine whether, on balance, the project as a whole passes muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court thus limits its analysis to Count VIII, which alleges that the Kentucky HEALTH program, \"\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   ,\" was neither \"an experimental, pilot or demonstration project[ ] nor ... likely to promote the objectives of the Medicaid Act.\" Compl. at Count VIII &amp; \u00b6 388 (emphasis added and capitalization altered). Defendants concede that such a challenge (if reviewable) is proper, but mistakenly construe Count VIII as a challenge to\n   <em>\n    KY HEALTH\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    writ large\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Br. at 17-18. During oral argument, however, Plaintiffs made clear that they target only the Secretary's approval of\n   <em>\n    Kentucky HEALTH\n   </em>\n   , leaving aside any challenge to other components of KY HEALTH, such as the SUD program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 57:18-21 (\"I just want to be clear [that] [w]hat we have ... challenged is something called Kentucky HEALTH, spelled out.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This distinction does not affect the Court's arbitrary-and-capricious review, as it would hold the Secretary's approval of either KY HEALTH or Kentucky HEALTH fell short of that standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.2,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . The difference matters enormously, however, for the appropriate remedy. Were the Court to treat this as a challenge to KY HEALTH, a decision in Plaintiffs' favor would invalidate not only Kentucky HEALTH but also Kentucky's recently implemented SUD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   program. None of the parties has an appetite for such a result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:7-16 (CMS);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:8-16 (Kentucky);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:9-17 (Plaintiffs). Fortunately for all, the Court can properly limit its review to Kentucky HEALTH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Although packaged inside the same application, Kentucky HEALTH was wholly distinct from other pieces of KY HEALTH, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the SUD program. As a refresher, the latter is available for all Medicaid beneficiaries, while the former applies only to adults without disabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2-3. The programs also have different start dates: SUD treatment became effective January 12, 2018, but Kentucky HEALTH does not take effect until July 1, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2. And, of course, they have different purposes: one was meant to \"ensure that a broad continuum of care\" was available to those with substance-abuse disorders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 83. The other proposes to add \"commercial market health insurance\" features to Medicaid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   It comes as no surprise, then, that the Secretary has solicited and regularly approved stand-alone SUD demonstrations in other states, without packaging in elements similar to Kentucky HEALTH.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Letter from Seema Verma, Adm'r, CMS, to Jen Steele, Medicaid Dir., La. Dep't of Health &amp; Hospitals (Feb 1, 2018), https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By Topics/Waivers/1115/downloads/la/la-healthy-oud-sud-demo-ca.pdf; Letter from Seema Verma to Cynthia Beane, Comm'r, W.

Although he nominally referred to the latter as a program within the KY HEALTH demonstration, that label did not control. Instead, he evaluated independently whether Kentucky HEALTH would promote various objectives of the Act, including by \"improv[ing] health outcomes, promot[ing] increased upward mobility and improved quality of life, increas[ing] individual engagement in health care decisions, and prepar[ing] individuals who transition to commercial health insurance coverage to be successful in this transition.\" AR 7. He then separately stated (1) which waivers were necessary \"for the Kentucky HEALTH program\" and (2) which were necessary for \"the KY HEALTH demonstration as a whole.\" AR 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 13-15. Similarly, he distinguished between the \"expenditure authorities\" needed to \"implement the Kentucky HEALTH program\" and those necessary \"to implement the KY HEALTH section 1115 demonstration.\" AR 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   This makes sense. When the Secretary concluded that the SUD program \"was likely to promote the objectives\" of the Act, he could not then piggyback other unrelated waivers onto that approval. Why not? Because he can issue only those waivers \"\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   \" to support the project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). In this case, the Secretary determined that hardly any waivers were needed to make the SUD program run. Simply by approving the SUD project, he ensured that all SUD costs were treated as reimbursable under Medicaid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1315(a)(2)(A). He then identified only one waiver needed to implement the program: he waived Section 1396a(a)(4) to \"the extent necessary to relieve Kentucky of the requirements to assure nonemergency medical transportation to and from providers for all Medicaid beneficiaries\" when such transportation\n   was \"for methadone treatment services.\" AR 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At the same time, the Secretary never considered whether (nor explained why) any of the Kentucky HEALTH components-including (1) retroactive eligibility, (2) premiums, (3) the community-engagement requirement, (4) lockouts, (5) reporting requirements, and (6) NEMT-were \"necessary\" to carry out the SUD program (or any other component of KY HEALTH as a whole).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3 (distinguishing \"additional waiver[s] and expenditure[s]\" that were necessary for \"the KY HEALTH demonstration as a whole\").

To address their objections, the Secretary cited Kentucky HEALTH's \"important protections for vulnerable individuals,\" such as exempting those who cannot work \"due to a disability\" or are \"medically frail\" from the community-engagement requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532365\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1057/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He also notes that the state had added flexible \"on-ramps,\" allowing those who lose coverage to regain it after meeting certain conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CMS Br. at 35-36. During the litigation, too, he stresses that these \"guardrails\" show that the Secretary considered coverage concerns \"in substance.\" Tr. 44:3-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   That response, however, is no answer at all. In its\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   application, Kentucky already exempted \"vulnerable individuals,\" such as those deemed medically frail, pregnant women, and children, from many of its project's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 5467 (explaining that pregnant women and children would be exempt from co-payments and premiums, while premiums would be \"optional\" for the medically frail). Likewise, the state included the same \"on ramps\" in its initial waiver application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5466-67 (allowing early re-entry for persons who (1) pay past debt; (2) pay a premium for reinstatement month; and (3) participate in financial or health literacy);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 5488-89 (comparing initial and amended application). Even with those reforms baked in, Kentucky estimated that 95,000 people would lose coverage. The commenters, too, expressed their concerns about coverage losses with those features in mind.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 3694-95, 3937 (noting problems with on ramp).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Although Kentucky's initial project may have thus included adequate protections for \"vulnerable\" individuals, this was not enough for the Secretary to rubber-stamp it. Rather, as the Secretary admits, it is \"obviously ... a purpose to provide medical assistance to the expansion population\" as well,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 36:15-17, a group broader than the vulnerable classes identified in Kentucky HEALTH. As explained in more detail below, the Secretary therefore cannot limit his review to only \"vulnerable individuals,\" such as persons with disabilities and the medically frail. He must consider coverage to all groups enrolled in the\n   project. Here, that included grappling with the fact that 95,000 people would lose Medicaid coverage, even with those \"guardrails\" in place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Beyond those features, the Secretary cites only one other \"guardrail\" against coverage loss: a \"good cause\" exemption. In an early exchange between him and Kentucky, the state agreed to \"provide good cause exceptions to the lockout for failure to pay premiums that would allow beneficiaries to re-enroll under certain conditions without completion of early re-entry requirements or waiting.\" AR 1540. The Secretary's final Special Terms and Conditions exempted from lockouts persons who were hospitalized, incapacitated, or disabled or whose immediate family members had died or become disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 7, 28-29.

It made no such finding below, however. While the agency spoke generally of \"creating incentives for individuals to obtain and maintain coverage through private, employer-sponsored insurance,\" AR 5, it cited no research or evidence that this would happen, nor did it make concrete estimates of how many beneficiaries might make that transition. And, of course, it is not obvious that the community-engagement requirement alone would help a person shift to private insurance. As the Secretary stresses, this is not a work requirement; individuals can meet it, for example, by volunteering in the community.

True, that program would cover all Medicaid beneficiaries' access to \"residential treatment, crisis stabilization and withdrawal management services.\" AR 85.

Even accepting that argument on its own terms, however, it would hardly justify his actions here. While Kentucky HEALTH largely affects the expansion group, it would impact some \"traditional\" recipients as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5422;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56:8-11 (noting that 20% of enrollees in Kentucky HEALTH would be part of the non-expansion group).

In such a case, Kentucky HEALTH's cost-saving reforms would be necessary to keep Kentucky's\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   Medicaid program afloat and thus preserve coverage for all recipients. It is an open question whether the Secretary could approve an \"experimental, demonstration, or pilot project\" on that basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532365\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/30/1057/#p1068\">\n    30 F.3d at 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He could hardly argue otherwise, as the record lacks substantial evidence that Kentucky's Medicaid program was in danger of collapse. First, the record shows that CMS, or at least Kentucky, may have misunderstood the projected cost savings. Both Defendants repeatedly highlight that\n   the program could save $2.2 billion. During argument, Kentucky's counsel represented that the\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   would save that amount even after federal reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 47:22-24. He is mistaken. The Commonwealth's own records show that while the total savings (state plus federal) would reach that figure, the state's actual savings would be $331 million-not a trivial number, to be sure, but still significantly below that cited by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5513.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Second, Defendants made no effort to contextualize those savings. The Court is sympathetic to \"the unique challenges the Commonwealth is facing,\" AR 4, including that \"[a]lmost twenty percent of [its] residents live in poverty\"; \"nearly one-third of Kentuckians are on Medicaid\"; its \"workforce participation is ... less than 60 percent\"; and it \"ranks third in the nation for drug related fatalities.\" AR 5432. But basic questions remain to assess whether the state's Medicaid program is actually at risk: What are Kentucky's current state revenues? What is its budget generally? Is the state running a deficit?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Nor did Defendants explain why cuts to the\n   <em>\n    expansion\n   </em>\n   population would be the best remedy for any budget woes. \"While Congress pays 50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals [traditionally] enrolled in Medicaid, \u00a7 1396d(b),\" the federal Government currently pays 94% of costs for the expansion group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NFIB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"320\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p583\">\n    567 U.S. at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p583\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(y)(1)(C). Even \"once the expansion is fully implemented [in 2020,] Congress will pay 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible persons.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p583\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d(y)(1)(E) ). Such numbers raise the question: why target only the group receiving the most federal aid if the goal is simply to cut the budget? Without data on those points, the Secretary could not make a reasoned decision that Kentucky would truly be \"unable to maintain access for currently enrolled populations.\" AR 5. Although the cost savings may have been a \"happy side effect,\" they thus cannot excuse the Secretary's failure to consider \"furnish[ing] ... medical assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396-1\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   iii. Self-sufficiency\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Finally, the Secretary flagged an interest in promoting \"greater independence\" and \"reduc[ing] reliance on public assistance.\" AR 4, 5. The Court has doubts whether such an objective is proper. The Secretary primarily cites Section 1396-1 in defense of that purpose, which appropriates money so that states can \"furnish ... rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care.\" From there, he excises the language about \"independence or self-care,\" treating those as stand-alone objectives of the Act. The text, however, quite clearly limits its objectives to helping States furnish\n   <em>\n    rehabilitation and other services\n   </em>\n   that might promote self-care and independence. It does not follow that\n   <em>\n    limiting\n   </em>\n   access to medical assistance would further the same end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   In any event, even accepting that argument, the Secretary never maintained that \"self-sufficiency\" is a substitute for considering healthcare (or even health). Instead, he suggests that even if the latter objective \"would suffer by reason of the project's operation,\" he could properly approve Kentucky HEALTH so long as he concluded \"that on balance the objectives considered together were likely to be advanced.\" CMS Br. at 21 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cal.

Cal. 1972) ). Whether the Secretary can make such tradeoffs, he must, at least, \"balance\" that objective with the statute's others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply at 2 (acknowledging the appropriations statute \"identifies\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   purpose of Medicaid\"). Yet, as discussed\n   above, the Secretary simply neglected the project's effect on medical coverage. Given that oversight, the Court cannot hold he made a reasoned decision that the Act's objectives \"considered together were likely to be advanced.\"\n   <em>\n    CWRO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3538510\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/348/491/#p497\">\n    348 F.Supp. at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   At the end of the day, even if the Secretary could properly consider other factors-such as health, cost, or self-sufficiency-his \"failure to address\" a \"salient factor\" in the Act-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , furnishing medical assistance-renders his approval arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Humane Soc'y\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275631\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/585/#p606\">\n    865 F.3d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not to say, of course, that the Secretary can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   approve demonstration projects that might adversely affect Medicaid enrollment or reduce healthcare coverage. After all, the point of the waivers is to give states flexibility in running their Medicaid programs, and experimental projects may (at least inadvertently) adversely affect healthcare access. While there may be limits to how much loss is too much,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23:3-12, the Court need not answer that question now. Rather, it holds today only that the Secretary must adequately\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   the effect of any demonstration project on the State's ability to help provide medical coverage.

Rather, Kentucky HEALTH has yet to take effect. Allowing it to do so during remand, on the other hand, could be exceptionally disruptive for Plaintiffs. Many of them suffer from various chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and mental-health conditions; they thus fear even a temporary implementation of Kentucky HEALTH could cause serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. MSJ, Exh. 1 (Declaration of Ronnie Stewart), \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8; Kasey Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10; Exh. 3 (Declaration of Lakin Branham), \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12; Exh. 4 (Declaration of Shanna Ballinger), \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n   <em>\n    Amici\n   </em>\n   report that those problems are common among the expansion population as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AARP Br. at 6-9. The Court therefore believes that preserving the status quo-including Plaintiffs' continuity of coverage-is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Defendants' \"best\" argument against vacatur is that the Court should preserve \"the substance abuse component of the waiver.\" Tr. at 45:7-16. That program, they say, \"is critically important to ensuring treatment to the people of Kentucky who are suffering from substance abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:8-16 (noting that the SUD treatment program was \"critical\" and its vacatur would be \"disastrous\"). Defendants' fears are unfounded. The Secretary's decision to approve Kentucky HEALTH is severable from his approval of KY HEALTH as a whole. As explained above, the Secretary separately considered the former program and issued waivers that were \"necessary\" only in its service. At the same, CMS has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to approving stand-alone SUD programs and has regularly done so for other states. The Court therefore has no \"substantial doubt\" that the Secretary would have approved the SUD project\n   without Kentucky HEALTH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    North Carolina v. FERC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"15960,3796800\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/730/790/\">\n    730 F.2d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 795-96 (D.C. Cir. 1984). It will therefore leave that program-along with the rest of KY HEALTH-intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will deny Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment. It will also grant Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment via Count VIII, vacate the Secretary's approval of Kentucky HEALTH, and remand to the agency.
