MOON, SENIOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is before the Court on Defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Plaintiff Robert Sanchez Turner (\"Turner\") alleges several claims for damages sustained at the August 12, 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally. These claims are asserted against Defendants Al Thomas Jr. (\"Thomas\"), former Chief of the Charlottesville Police Department; W. Stephen Flaherty (\"Flaherty\"), Virginia State Police Superintendent; and the City of Charlottesville (\"Charlottesville\"). Plaintiff's claims share a common question: whether there is constitutional duty under the Fourteenth Amendment for the police to intervene to protect a citizen from criminal conduct by third parties. Because I find this duty is not \"clearly established,\" his claims are barred by qualified immunity. Therefore, although Defendant Flaherty's jurisdictional argument under Rule 12(b)(1) fails, Defendants' motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants bring motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.

Facts as Alleged\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Charlottesville, Virginia, a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands in what was formerly called \"Lee Park.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-8). In June 2017, Defendant Charlottesville changed the park's name to \"Emancipation Park,\" (\"the Park\") and subsequently planned to sell the statue and have it removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7-8). In response, Jason Kessler, leader of the group \"Unity &amp; Security for America,\" organized the \"Unite the Right\" rally to protest the Park's name change and the decision to sell the statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kessler applied for, and was granted, a permit to hold a \"free speech rally in support of the Lee monument\" by the City. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). Less than a week before the event, the City revoked Kessler's permit, citing traffic and safety concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 21, 29). Allegedly, Kessler was initially promised that security measures would nevertheless remain in place for the revoked event. However, he was later informed that Defendant Thomas, as Chief of Police, allegedly \"changed his mind\" and would not provide any of the initially promised protections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kessler then brought suit, challenging the permit's revocation on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, seeking injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). U.S. District Judge Glen Conrad granted Kessler's request and reinstated the permit.\n   <em>\n    Kessler v.

Va. Aug. 11, 2017). Turner alleges that in response to Judge Conrad's ruling, Defendants Thomas and Flaherty became \"enraged,\" and instituted a \"special policy\" for the protest, \"ordering [their] officers to 'stand down' ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 44). This alleged \"stand down\" order mandated law enforcement to: \"refrain from intervening in any violent confrontations between\n   white supremacists and counter-protesters unless given a command to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-46). Turner alleges law enforcement followed this \"stand down\" order and even directly told counter-protesters they would \"not intervene unless given a command to do so.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is alleged that on August 12, 2017, Turner went to the Park as a counter-protestor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 52-53). As he allegedly protested peacefully on the sidewalk adjacent to the Park, \"KKK members/sympathizers\" exited the Park and began \"to engage counter protesters who were on the sidewalk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). Police allegedly looked on as protesters, unprovoked, sprayed Turner in his eyes with mace, subsequently beat him with a stick, and threw bottles of urine at him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55, 59, 64). He alleges that \"Charlottesville Police and Virginia State Patrol officers stood and watched [this] for more than thirty seconds, while doing nothing to intervene.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 61-63).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Turner now asserts several claims against Defendants premised on what is known as a \"state-created danger\" theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v.

He also alleges Defendants acted with \"deliberate indifference\" towards his assault (Count IV) in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Ultimately, Joshua's father beat him so violently that the boy suffered serious brain damage. Joshua's mother brought a \u00a7 1983 action on his behalf, arguing that the County and its employees had deprived Joshua of his liberty interests without due process by failing to provide adequate protection against his father's violent acts.
