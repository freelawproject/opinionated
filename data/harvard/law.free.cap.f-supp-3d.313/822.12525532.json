BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case relates to plaintiff Quentin W. Jiles's former job as a delivery specialist with WMT. Dkt. 27. Jiles started working as a WMT delivery specialist on May 28, 2013. Dkt. 31, Ex. A (Jiles Aff.). WMT's delivery specialists make \"pickups and deliveries of medical implants and instruments to and from local hospitals, surgery centers, clinics/doctor's offices, the airport, bus station[s], and other locations for expedited shipments.\" Dkt. 27, Ex. D (official job description). They also act as liaisons between the field office and customers, and they assist in the local warehouse with processing kits or sets and with inventory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During his tenure with WMT, Jiles would make ten to twelve deliveries and ten to twelve pickups per day. Dkt. 27, Ex. B (Jiles Dep.) at 19-20. He also regularly worked overtime, which WMT considered a \"principle responsibility\" of the job when \"required to accommodate emergency situations and facilitate changing surgical schedules.\" Dkt. 27, Ex. D at WMT 0052-53. The official job description lists overtime as an \"essential function\" of the job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First FMLA Leave and Workers' Compensation Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 4, 2014, Jiles was involved in an automobile accident while working. Dkt. 31, Ex. A (Jiles Aff.). Jiles saw a doctor regarding his injuries from the accident on April 7, 2017, and the doctor determined that Jiles suffered \"a cervical strain on his shoulder and upper arm,\" contusions on his face, scalp, and neck, and elevated blood pressure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The doctor said that Jiles was unable to drive a company vehicle for two weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, Jiles initiated a workers' compensation claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jiles asserts that he \"felt obvious tension coming from [his supervisor]\" when he informed him that the doctor had said that Jiles could not drive for two weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The supervisor reportedly stated that there was not enough light duty work to keep Jiles busy, a proposition with which Jiles disagreed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jiles was placed on medical leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") and short-term disability from April 7, 2014, through May 8, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jiles returned to work on or about May 8, 2014, with no restrictions. Dkt. 31, Ex. B (Jiles Dep.) at 50. Prior to the accident, Jiles had been the only delivery driver; after the accident, there were, including Jiles, three delivery drivers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 31, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Second FMLA Leave\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 28, 2014, Jiles saw a physician at Concentra Medical Centers at WMT's request. Dkt. 31, Ex. B. The doctor informed Jiles that Jiles's blood pressure was high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Jiles, he told his boss and hub manager about the high blood pressure, and they told him to continue working. Dkt. 31, Ex. A \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. In early June 2014, Jiles saw his own physician, Dr. Aldinger, and Aldinger determined that Jiles had high blood pressure\n   and needed to rest for two weeks. Dkt. 27, Ex. E (Brown Dep.) at 42; Dkt. 27, Ex. L (physician note); Dkt. 31, Ex. A (Jiles Aff.). Jiles commenced two weeks of short-term disability, which was a paid leave of absence. Dkt. 31, Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This leave extended beyond two weeks. On July 18, 2014, Jennifer Brown with the human resources department at WMT emailed Jiles to inform him that his short-term disability benefits would be exhausted as of July 21, 2014, and that if he was unable to return to work the leave would be non-paid FMLA leave. Dkt. 27, Ex. N. Jiles responded that he would like to use his remaining sick leave for July 24.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the meantime, on June 24, the hub manager for the Houston office, Tricia Hubenak, advised Brown that they needed a third driver in Houston as \"this guy is really hurting us with the Workman's comp and now this....What are my options with this employee?\" Dkt. 34-3, Ex. 8. The next week, when Jiles did not return to work, Hubenak asked Brown in an email if there were any updates as \"[t]his is killing us in Houston.\" Dkt. 34-3, Ex. 9. Hubenak again advised that WMT needed a third driver and that if Jiles could not perform his duties as a delivery specialist, then he \"need[ed] to get a desk job or something\" because they could not \"continue to operate with two drivers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She again asked what the options were and noted that the \"staff here is getting very frustrated and working overtime and I am going to end up losing good employees because of this.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Jiles Is Ready to Return to Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about August 4, 2014, Jiles stated that he was ready to return to work. Dkt. 31; Dkt. 32-1 (Jiles Dep.) at 116. Jiles's physician, Dr. Aldinger, had completed a WMT form entitled \"Update of Restrictions &amp; Return to Work Form.\" Dkt. 27, Ex. P. On this form, Aldinger indicated that Jiles could not work overtime or work in heat of 90 degrees or below 32 degrees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Aldinger specifically stated that Jiles could resume the work capacity profile attached, which was the work capacity profile for a WMT delivery specialist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 32-2, Ex. 6; Dkt. 33-1 (Aldinger Dep.) at 33. Aldinger testified that Jiles had uncontrolled hypertension and that he did not want to pressure Jiles with more than a routine 40-hour work week and did not want him unloading \"a bunch of stuff\" in the heat. Dkt. 27, Ex. H (Aldinger Dep.) at 48-49. Aldinger believed that there was a possibility the restrictions could have been lifted, but he could not testify as to how long they would need to be in place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. But WMT Is Not Ready\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   WMT did not permit Jiles to return to work on August 4. Dkt. 34-3, Ex. 16. Rather, after receiving Aldinger's recommendations, WMT consulted with a third-party medical reviewer, Dr. Robinson, regarding what WMT perceived to be restrictions placed on the type of work Jiles could do. Dkt. 27 &amp; Ex. Q (Robinson Dep.) at 23. Robinson advised that he \"would not concur with [Jiles] working as a driver in this particular job unrestricted\" until the medical restrictions were lifted. Dkt. 27, Ex. Q at 25-26. He did not feel any clarifications regarding Aldinger's restrictions were necessary, as \"[i]t was very straightforward.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 19, 2014, Brown (from WMT's human resources) sent Jiles an email to \"follow up on [their] ongoing conversation over the past few weeks regarding [his] leave of absence and [his] return to work.\" Dkt. 27, Ex. O. Brown advised Jiles that his FMLA leave would be exhausted on August 20, 2014, and that WMT had \"a significant safety concern\n   regarding [Jiles's] ability to perform the essential functions of [his] current position.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She requested a meeting with Jiles to \"discuss [Jiles's] current restrictions and any reasonable accommodation that would allow [him] to perform [the] essential functions within the restrictions provided by [his] physician and in a manner that is safe for [him] and others.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Dena Bangma, a human resources manager at WMT, Jiles acknowledged that he understood WMT's concerns when he spoke to her on August 20, 2014. Dkt. 27, Ex. G (Bangma Dec.). Jiles contends that he spoke with both Bangma and Brown on this day, and he \"sensed frustration on WMT's part\" and \"could hear Ms. Bangma sighing.\" Dkt. 31, Ex. A. He testified that he felt \"real low\" when Bangma told him that WMT was \" 'managing just fine without [him].' \" Dkt. 32-1 at 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Jiles's Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Brown noted the possibility of \"reasonable accommodations\" in her August 19 email to Jiles, WMT ultimately determined that there was no delivery specialist position that worked in a climate-controlled environment and that there were no vacant positions at the Houston hub for which Jiles was qualified. Dkt. 27, Ex. G (Bangma Dec.). Jiles's employment with WMT was terminated on August 27, 2014. Dkt. 27, Ex. R (separation notice). The decisionmakers were Brown, Bangma, and their manager, Lisa Stringer, in collaboration with the medical review officer, Robinson. Dkt. 35-1 (Bangma Dep.) at 85. The reason stated on the separation notice was \"Family Medical Leave exhausted...unable to accommodate restrictions.\" Dkt. 27, Ex. R (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Discrimination Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Jiles filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") on August 28, 2014, and received a right-to-sue letter. Dkt. 1. Jiles filed this lawsuit on July 13, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He initially asserted the following claims (1) disability discrimination pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"); (2) race discrimination pursuant to Title VII and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) retaliation pursuant to Chapter 451 of the Texas Labor Code for discharging Jiles for seeking benefits under the Texas Workers' Compensation Act (\"TWCA\"); and (4) violation of his rights under the FMLA, including interfering with, restraining, or denying him the exercise of the his FMLA rights and retaliation against him following his FMLA leave of absence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On November 15, 2016, Jiles filed an amended complaint that did not include the race discrimination claim. Dkt. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 29, 2017, WMT filed a motion for summary judgment. Dkt. 27. It argues that all of Jiles's claims should be dismissed because (1) Jiles could not safely perform the essential functions of his job with or without reasonable accommodations; (2) Jiles cannot prove a reasonable accommodation claim under the ADA; (3) Jiles cannot meet his prima facie burden for his FMLA claim; and (4) Jiles has no evidence of a causal connection between his termination and the filing of his TWCA claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Jiles asserts that summary judgment is improper because (1) WMT did not even explore reasonable accommodations; and (2) there is evidence that his supervisors were perturbed that he took Workers' Compensation and FMLA leave. Dkt. 31. Jiles contends that any alleged legitimate reason for his termination is pretext because his supervisors were unconcerned about him performing his job functions\n   after his Workers' Compensation leave but before his FMLA leave, yet when he returned from the FMLA leave there was allegedly a safety concern.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The motion is now ripe for disposition. The court will first discuss the legal standard for summary judgment and then will determine whether WMT is entitled to summary judgment for each of Jiles's claims\n   <em>\n    in seriatim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A court shall grant summary judgment when a \"movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"[A] fact is genuinely in dispute only if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Fordoche, Inc. v.

Disability Discrimination Under the ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Jiles contends that WMT discriminated against him in violation of the ADA. Dkt. 14.

Dkt. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The ADA provides that no entity \"shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to...the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees...and other ...privileges of employment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012112\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

He presents evidence that WMT gave Aldinger a form indicating that Jiles's regular work schedule is \"8-5; M-F.\" Dkt. 34-2, Ex. 6; Dkt. 34-1 at 45-46. Jiles also points out that WMT gave Aldinger a form-the work capacity profile-that showed no \"exposure to marked changes in temperature and humidity\" was required.

There is, however, a question of fact with regard to temperatures. The delivery specialist work capacity profile indicates that exposure to marked changes in temperature and humidity is not required and the job description does not specifically address temperature, yet Bangma asserts WMT considered it an essential function.

Amount of Time Spent on Function\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The next factor is the amount of time spent on the job performing the function.\n   <em>\n    Credeur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276308\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/785/#p792\">\n    860 F.3d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . WMT provides evidence that thirty-seven out of forty-two of its delivery specialists worked overtime during the pay cycle before Jiles's termination. Dkt. 27, Ex. G \u00b6 6. The overtime amount per employee ranges\n   from .5 hours to 30.75 hours, with an average (including the individuals who did not work overtime) of roughly 6.8 hours.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is hardly insignificant. Jiles worked 65.5 hours of overtime in 2013, and he worked 35.25 hours of overtime for the partial year he worked in 2014. Dkt. 27, Ex. J. Jiles contends that the overtime he worked is inconsequential because he was at times the only delivery driver in this market, thus making all of the overtime fall on him, and WMT had two additional delivery drivers at the time of Jiles's termination. Dkt. 31. However, WMT has demonstrated that all of the drivers in the Houston market worked overtime the week before Jiles's termination, which indicates that there was enough work for overtime to be required, at times, from all drivers in 2014. Additionally, WMT provides evidence that its business had increased significantly during this time period. Dkt. 44 &amp; Ex. D. WMT has shown that its drivers, including Jiles, worked overtime, and Jiles has not provided any evidence that creates an issue of material fact with regard to this factor as it relates to overtime. With regard to temperature, neither WMT nor Jiles provide evidence about how much time Jiles or other delivery specialists spent in the heat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Consequences of Not Requiring Jiles to Perform Functions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The next factor is the consequences of not requiring Jiles to work overtime or work in the heat.\n   <em>\n    Credeur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276308\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/785/#p792\">\n    860 F.3d at 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While there would presumably be business interests associated with Jiles not working overtime or being exposed to temperatures in excess of 90 degrees, neither party has presented evidence relating to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    v. Terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The fifth factor is the impact of collective bargaining agreements, but there is no evidence that there was a collective bargaining agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276308\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/785/#p792\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    vi.

Conclusion with Regard to Essential Functions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court finds that, with regard to overtime, the balance of factors weighs so heavily in WMT's favor that no reasonable juror could conclude that overtime was not an essential function of the delivery specialist job. The only fact that weighs in Jiles's favor is that WMT wrote that Jiles's regular hours were 9-5 on one of the forms it gave Aldinger. This is insufficient evidence to create an issue of material fact with regard to overtime when the written job description, which Aldinger also had, listed overtime as an essential function and provided the reasons why overtime was required, a letter to Aldinger written before Jiles even started the position noted the importance of overtime, and Jiles and the other delivery specialists in Houston all worked overtime. The court draws no conclusions with regard to exposure to temperatures, which is a much closer call. Because Jiles's physician restricted him from performing one of the essential functions of his job-overtime-the court concludes\n   that Jiles was not \"qualified\" for the job under the ADA. He thus cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Hypertension Controlled\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Jiles also argues that he was qualified because his hypertension was controlled when he requested to return to work on August 4, 2014. Dkt. 31. However, the record is clear that Jiles's physician, while releasing him to work, placed restrictions on what he could do. For example, Aldinger's physician testified that he placed restrictions on Jiles's return to work:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Q: Am I correct that you did, in fact, include restrictions on this form?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   A: Yes. There were-yeah the-yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Q: (By Ms. Harmon) Okay. And-and am I correct that the restrictions that were included by you were no overtime and not working in heat over 90 degrees Fahrenheit and not working in cold less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   A: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Q: Okay. So Mr. Jiles did, in fact, have restrictions upon his return to work-release to work; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   MS. PATRICK: Objection. Form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A: Uh-yeah what's-what's written here, correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Dkt. 45, Ex. B at 39-40. Thus, regardless of the extent to which Jiles's hypertension was \"controlled\" when he was cleared to return to work, his physician only cleared him to return\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    restrictions.\n   </em>\n   The overtime restriction rendered him unqualified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Because Jiles was not qualified to perform all of the essential functions of the delivery specialist position, he cannot make out a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA. WMT's motion for summary judgment on Jiles's ADA discrimination claim is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Safety Concern\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Because the court finds that Jiles thus cannot meet his prima facie burden on his ADA claim, there is no need to address WMT's argument that Jiles was not qualified due to safety concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Failure to Accommodate Claim Under the ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Jiles contends that WMT violated the ADA because it refused to accommodate him and refused to engage in interactive dialogue concerning his limitations. Dkt. 14 \u00b6 37.

The only evidence Jiles presents that there was potentially a \"desk job\" at the company is the email from the hub manager, Hubenak. Dkt. 31 at 22. In the email, Hubenak states: \"If he can't perform his job duties as a delivery specialist (obviously he can't) then he needs to get a desk job or something but we can't continue to operate with two drivers.

Hubenak does not refer to a desk job\n   <em>\n    at WMT.\n   </em>\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jiles, the statement does not lead to a logical inference that Hubenak meant that there was an open desk job at WMT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The ADA \"does not require an employer to transfer from the disabled employee any of the essential functions of his job,\" and a court cannot determine that a plaintiff can perform the essential functions of his or her job with reasonable accommodation \"if the only successful accommodation is for [the plaintiff] not to perform those essential functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Barber v.

O. Jiles also discusses in his affidavit a conversation he had with Bangma and Brown on August 20, 2014. Dkt. 31-1.

Jiles, instead, takes issue with whether overtime was even necessary.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 31-1 at 8-9. Since the court has already found overtime was an essential function and employers do not have to assign essential functions to other employees, Jiles's suggestion that WMT should have discussed changes to work hours is immaterial. WMT was not required to attempt to accommodate in this way.

Dkt. 14. WMT seeks summary judgment on this claim because (1) WMT did not interfere with Jiles's FMLA rights because Jiles received all the FMLA leave to which he was entitled; (2) WMT was not required to reinstate Jiles after his FMLA leave if Jiles could not perform the essential functions of his job; and (3) Jiles cannot establish that WMT retaliated against him because there is no similarly situated employee who was treated differently and, regardless, WMT had a non-discriminatory reason for terminating Jiles's employment.

Prima Facie Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The court will first consider whether Jiles can meet his prima facie burden. The third prong is the only prong in dispute. Jiles must present evidence creating an issue of material fac that he was either treated less favorably than an employee who had not requested leave under the FMLA or that the adverse decision was made because he sought protection under the FMLA. As to being treated less favorably, Jiles contends that he has comparators because WMT has hired seven new delivery specialists since his accident, none of whom have a disability or\n   filed a workers compensation claim and all of whom still have jobs. Dkt. 31 (citing Dkt. 31, Ex. I). The only showing of similarity between Jiles and these new drivers is that they occupied the same job. Jiles has not shown that any of these other employees were subject to medical restrictions. The court finds that there is not enough evidence of similarity in the record to create an issue of material fact with regard to the comparator element of the third prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Of course, having a comparator is only one of two ways to satisfy the third prong, and Jiles also presents evidence that supports his contention that WMT terminated his employment because he took FMLA leave. First, WMT discharged Jiles immediately after he took FMLA leave, so any inference arising from temporal proximity is strong. Second, there is evidence that Jiles's hub manager complained to human resources about the operational issues the company was having because Jiles was taking FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-3, Ex. 8 (email from Hubenak to Brown and Bangma stating that \"this guy is really hurting us with the Worker's comp and now this\" and asking what the options were). The hub manager was not the decisionmaker, but she was complaining to the decisionmakers. Jiles's burden at the prima facie stage is very light-he merely has to show that the protected activity and the adverse employment action are not \"completely unrelated.\" Jiles's assertion in his affidavit that he could hear Bangma \"sighing\" during his conversation with her relating to whether Jiles could return to work buttresses the inference that the hub manager's complaints impacted the decisionmakers. Dkt. 31-1. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Jiles, the court finds that the evidence presented creates an issue of material fact as to the third prong of the prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason and Pretext/Mixed Motive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Moving on to the next stage, WMT has presented sufficient evidence that it had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Jiles's employment-because he was no longer qualified for the position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 27. Thus, the burden shifts back to Jiles to show either that this reason is pretext or, under the mixed-motive framework, it is only one of the reasons and discrimination is another reason.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   With regard to the third prong, Jiles provides some evidence that his supervisor complained about Jiles needing to take off after his accident (\"Two weeks?!?! You can't drive for two weeks? What are we supposed to do?\") and that he ordered Jiles to continue working after Jiles reported that medical tests revealed he had high blood pressure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 31, Ex. A (Jiles Aff.) \u00b6 6; Dkt. 32-1 (Jiles Dep.) at 53-54. And, again, the hub manager complained to human resources about how she could not cover the volume of work without\n   hiring a new driver due to Jiles's absence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 34-3, Ex. 8. While neither of the individuals making these comments was responsible for the decision to terminate Jiles's employment (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 44, Ex. G at 63-64, 85), the court may consider this evidence under a \"cat's paw\" analysis, which is used when a plaintiff contends that a decisionmaker \"was influenced by others who harbored discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Roberson v.

The court finds that the evidence of animus from the emails and statements of Jiles's supervisor and hub manager, combined with the fact that the decisionmakers obviously needed to rely on managers in the field with regard to decisions about operations, and Jiles's assertion that Bangma was sighing during their conversation regarding his return to work, is sufficient evidence to create an issue of material fact on the third prong. A reasonable trier of fact could determine that the hub manager and supervisor influenced Brown and Bangma and that one of the reasons they decided to terminate Jiles's employment was because he took FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

There is no evidence of similarly situated employees who could not work overtime but did not take workers' compensation leave. And there is no evidence that the stated reason for discharge is false. In sum, the causation evidence is weak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Even if there were sufficient circumstantial evidence to infer causation, WMT can show that the discharge was unrelated to Jiles's workers' compensation claim because being able to work overtime is an essential function of the delivery specialist job and Jiles's physician restricted him from working overtime. Jiles has provided no evidence of a discriminatory motive that controverts WMT's legitimate reason for discharge. WMT's motion for summary judgment on Jiles's Texas Labor Code claim is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

WMT contends that it served the requests on April 24, 2017 and that, as of the date of WMT's motion for summary judgment (September 29, 2017), Jiles had not responded to the requests. Dkt. 27 at 2 n.1.

Dkt. 31. Jiles then reminds the court that it \"forgave Defendant's failure to respond to Plaintiff's\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     entire\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   first set of discovery, after a hearing and opportunity for all to be heard.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jiles appears to request that he also be allowed to respond late.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"If Defendant were to pursue such a motion to have admissions deemed admitted, Plaintiff would remind the Court of its prior ruling allowing Defendant to respond to Plaintiff's first set of interrogatories, production and admissions.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   WMT contends that it is not required to move to have the admissions admitted because Rule 36 is self-executing.

It also stated that Jiles had still not made an effort to respond to the requests as of the filing of the reply on October 31, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, WMT points out that the court did not previously forgive its failure to respond to requests for admission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the issue related only to interrogatories and requests for production.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   First, the court notes that the original discovery deadline was March 31, 2017. Dkt. 17. During the January discovery hearing, the court gave WMT until February 10, 2017, to respond to outstanding discovery, and it encouraged the parties to discuss extending the discovery deadline and attempt to reach an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 31, 2017 Dkt. Entry. The court thereafter granted a joint motion to amend the scheduling order, which set the discovery\n   deadline at August 31, 2017. Dkts. 23, 24. Not only was the deadline to respond to the requests for admission substantially overdue by the time WMT filed its motion for summary judgment, but the discovery deadline had passed. This is a completely different circumstance than the court was presented in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Second, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a)(3) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Rule 36(b) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. Subject to Rule 16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   These rules make clear that the requests were automatically admitted when Jiles failed to respond within thirty days and did not each an agreement to extend the deadline with WMT's counsel. It was then\n   <em>\n    Jiles\n   </em>\n   's responsibility to file a motion if he wanted relief from the deemed admissions. Jiles did not file such a motion. To the extent Jiles's argument can be construed as a motion to withdraw the deemed admissions, the motion is DENIED. The court's analysis on the motion for summary judgment above does not depend on any of the deemed admissions, as WMT did not significantly rely on these admissions in its briefing. Thus, there is no need to withdraw the admission to promote the presentation on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
