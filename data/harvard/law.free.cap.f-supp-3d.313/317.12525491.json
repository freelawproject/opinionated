BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As the events of recent months make clear, the question of how this nation will treat those who come to our shores seeking refuge generates enormous debate. While arriving foreigners may have myriad reasons for wanting to settle in the United States, a subset claims a fear of persecution in their native lands. They seek asylum here. Since 2009, the detention of\n   those asylum-seekers has, in part, been governed by a set of principles and procedures set forth in a \"Parole Directive\" issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a component of the Department of Homeland Security. This document establishes the process by which ICE must determine whether an individual who has passed a credible-fear interview-the first step toward gaining asylum status-will be released from detention on parole pending a full hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs (and other members of the class they seek to represent) are noncitizens being held at five ICE Field Offices who have received a credible-fear determination but have been denied parole. Although, in the past, individuals deemed to have a \"credible fear\" of persecution and thus a significant possibility of being granted asylum were overwhelmingly released, Plaintiffs contend that there is a new reality in place. Pointing to the fact that parole rates have plummeted from over 90% to nearly zero, as well as to testimony from detained asylum-seekers and their counsel, they assert that the Government is no longer following its own Parole Directive. Plaintiffs allege that, rather than providing individualized determinations and procedural safeguards, DHS is now engaging in systematic detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Seeking the protections spelled out in the Directive, Plaintiffs have now turned to the courts. They filed suit in March of this year against DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, as well as Thomas Homan, the Acting Director of ICE, U.S. Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, and the directors of the five ICE Field Offices. Their Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs have been denied parole in violation of the ICE Directive, and that the Government has thereby violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Defendants have now moved to dismiss, contending that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the various counts and that Plaintiffs have failed to state a viable claim for relief. The asylum-seekers both oppose dismissal and request a preliminary injunction requiring DHS to comply with the Parole Directive and to provide individualized parole determinations while this suit is pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finding that the circumstances here merit that extraordinary form of relief, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion. In so doing, this Opinion does no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance. Having extended the safeguards of the Parole Directive to asylum-seekers, ICE must now ensure that such protections are realized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are detained pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The Directive explains the agency's interpretation of \"public benefit\" for the purposes of determining parole and sets out a number of procedural requirements for assessing asylum-seekers' eligibility for release. On a broad level, the Directive states that \"[e]ach alien's eligibility for parole should be considered and analyzed on its own merits and based on the facts of the individual alien's case,\" and that if an asylum-seeker establishes his identity and that he presents neither a flight risk nor a danger to the public, \"[ICE]\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   , absent additional factors ... parole the alien on the basis that his or her continued detention is not in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.5\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20212.5\">\n    , \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .2 (emphasis added).

In support of this claim, Plaintiffs point to the steep descent of parole-grant rates in the initial months of the current administration.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the heart of Plaintiffs' suit is their assertion that, under the current administration, the parole practices at the five Field Offices have drastically departed from the policies and protections enshrined in the 2009 ICE Directive. Offering comparative statistics as well as declarations from detained asylum-seekers and their counsel, Plaintiffs contend that parole has been effectively eliminated as an option and detention has instead become the status quo. They attribute this shift in part to the Trump administration's emphasis on \"deterrence\" and \"zero-tolerance\" when it comes to the treatment of undocumented individuals. Defendants contest this characterization, claiming instead that there is no \"deterrence policy\" in place, that they continue to implement the ICE Directive, and that parole remains available to asylum-seekers at the five Field Offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before turning to its analysis of these issues, however, the Court must first address two threshold complications: justiciability and class certification. According to Defendants, the asylum-seekers' case cannot proceed because this Court lacks jurisdiction over their claims and because they do not present a proper class. Disagreeing on both fronts, the Court will discuss these points separately before tackling the merits of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants raise a bevy of jurisdictional objections. Specifically, the Government alleges\n   that Plaintiffs' claims challenging the parole process are barred by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(ii) and their request for classwide injunctive relief by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1).

It will, therefore, not inquire into the specific strengths or weaknesses of the parole decisions under dispute, including Plaintiffs' allegation that certain of the proffered rationales for denial were \"pretextual.\" ECF No. 24 at 8-10. Yet the asylum-seekers do not rest their case on a challenge to discrete parole determinations. Rather, they allege that ICE is, as a matter of general course, not complying with the policies and procedures of the Parole Directive. In other words, they are not challenging the\n   <em>\n    outcome\n   </em>\n   of ICE's decisionmaking, but the\n   <em>\n    method\n   </em>\n   by which parole is currently being granted (or denied).

As defined, the putative class includes only arriving asylum-seekers who have been or will be detained by the five ICE Field Offices after having been denied parole. Each of these individuals has suffered a concrete injury-detention imposed without the protections of the Parole Directive-from the Government's refusal to grant them the Directive's requisite processes and protections. Although the Government asserts that \"not all putative class members have been injured by Defendants' purported policy ... [as] not all persons detained at the Field Offices were denied parole,\" Opp. to Class Cert. at 28, this line of argument entirely ignores Plaintiffs' definition of the class as including only those asylum-seekers who are or will be detained \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   having been\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   parole.\" Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 15 (emphasis altered). The (albeit negligible) percentage of asylum-seekers released by the Field Offices does not, therefore, undermine Plaintiffs' classwide standing, as they are explicitly excluded from the definition of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For those individuals who\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   (or will be) detained after being denied release on parole, Plaintiffs adequately allege that the Government is engaging in injurious conduct, the resolution of which would likely be redressed by a favorable decision by this Court. According to Plaintiffs, their detention is the direct result of the Field Offices' current departure from the protections of the Parole Directive in favor of\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention-an allegation that, as discussed in more depth below, is robustly supported by statistics and other record evidence. In light of the prior substantial grant rates under the Directive and the near-uniform detention of asylum-seekers under the current administration, it is in no sense \"speculative\" that enjoining the Field Offices to implement the Directive would render Plaintiffs' release far more likely. As this Circuit has emphasized, \"A significant increase in the likelihood that [a litigant] would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered will suffice for standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n v.

Analyzing this issue thus requires only a common, programmatic analysis, as the specific facts of each denial matter not if Plaintiffs are correct in their claim that the Directive is no longer in force overall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Nor is commonality defeated by the fact that a small percentage of asylum-seekers were, in fact, released from two of the five Field Offices.

Here, although Plaintiffs identify \"deterrence\" as the motivating factor behind the lack of individualized parole determinations and compliance with the Directive, the Court need not find any such common intention in order to certify the class.

Here, it is clear from Plaintiffs' filings and affidavits that the nine named class members have each alleged a personal deprivation of the protections of the Parole Directive, contending that they have instead been denied the opportunity for release under the Field Offices' current practice of nearly uniform detention. Although the specific details of each named Plaintiff's parole adjudication may vary, the crux of their allegations is typical of the claims of the putative class that the Government is no longer providing asylum-seekers with the individualized determinations and opportunities for release required under the Directive. In light of the record evidence of a current no-parole regime in place at the five Field Offices,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Section III.

Once again, the Court cannot concur. Plaintiffs allege that the five Field Offices no longer follow the policies and procedures outlined in the 2009 Parole Directive. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring compliance with the Directive and mandating that the Field Offices provide the individualized parole determinations and protections required by such agency guidance. Contrary to the Government's argument that \"it is difficult to see how each individual alleged violation of the Parole Directive would be amenable to resolution on a classwide basis,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42, the asylum-seekers are not asking for this Court to remedy discrete errors in their parole determinations or to interfere with ICE's discretionary decisionmaking.

The Complaint provides three distinct grounds for such relief. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that DHS's actions: (1) are contrary to law under the APA by failing to follow the Parole Directive; (2) violate the APA by failing to conform with the INA; and (3) abridge Plaintiffs' due-process rights under the Fifth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. for PI at 1-3. Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' first theory warrants relief, it will focus its attention accordingly. In doing so, it addresses each of the four prongs of the preliminary-injunction analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Likelihood of Success\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To remind any reader whose attention may understandably have flagged: in Count I of their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that DHS is no longer complying with the ICE Directive, a practice they assert is \"contrary to law\" under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Likelihood of success, consequently, turns on the strength of their argument that Defendants are failing to follow the Directive, and that such a departure is unlawful. This is where the rubber meets the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants contest both the premise and the substance of Plaintiffs' APA claims. DHS contends that the asylum-seekers do not have a cause of action under the statute, that the Parole Directive does not provide a sound basis for the relief they seek, and that they do not demonstrate that the agency is in fact failing to follow the necessary procedures. Because Plaintiffs' argument in support of this count rests in large part on a somewhat obscure area of law-the so-called\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   doctrine-the Court will first lay out the fundamentals of this concept, next look at the question of whether Plaintiffs may raise such claims under the APA, and conclude with the alleged violations themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   a.

As discussed above, the premise underlying the\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   doctrine is that agencies can be held accountable to their own codifications of procedures and policies-and particularly those that affect individual rights. Here, the policies and procedures contained within the Directive establish a set of minimum protections for those seeking asylum, including an opportunity to submit documentation, the availability of an individualized parole interview, and an explanation of the reasons for a parole denial. The Directive\n   therefore falls squarely within the ambit of those agency actions to which the doctrine may attach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pacific Molasses Co. v. FTC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"839430\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/356/386/#p389\">\n    356 F.2d 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389-90 (5th Cir. 1966) (\"[O]nce an agency exercises its discretion and creates the procedural rules under which it desires to have its actions judged, it denies itself the right to violate these rules.\");\n   <em>\n    Pasquini v.

The ICE Directive provides that it \"is not intended to, shall not be construed to, may not be relied upon to, and does not create any rights, privileges, or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable by any party against the United States.\" Parole Directive, \u00b6 10. The Government points to this language in refuting Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   claims, stating in its briefing that \"the Parole Directive's statement that it places requirements on ICE and its officers without creating a private cause of action should be viewed by the Court as determinative evidence of the extent to which DHS intended to be bound by the Directive.\" Reply at 2-3. Yet the Government's subsequent statement at oral argument that the Directive is, in fact, binding compels the Court to find otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:12-13. It would seem that this representation is in fact the \"determinative evidence\" of the extent to which the agency \"intended to be bound.\" The Court will therefore take Defendants at their word that the Directive is binding agency policy and thus concludes that it can be challenged via an\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court additionally notes that, even absent such concession, the\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   doctrine could well apply to the ICE Directive. This case is distinguishable from a prior Opinion in this Circuit addressing the effects of disclaimer language in agency guidance,\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Subpoena, Judith Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996744,3453458\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1141/\">\n    438 F.3d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2006). In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , this Circuit held that DOJ guidelines for issuing subpoenas to the media-which contained language similar to that in the ICE directive-did not create legally enforceable procedural rights. Yet although\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   relied in part on the express reservation at issue in that case, it does not stand for the proposition that such a disclaimer would necessarily defeat Plaintiffs' claim that the Directive is binding upon and enforceable against DHS. Instead, Miller explicitly distinguished\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the procedures contained in the BIA manual at issue in that case were \"intended to benefit\" individuals, whereas the DOJ guidelines provided no such protections and instead \"exist[ed] to guide the Department's exercise\" of its internal decisionmaking to seek subpoenas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996744,3453458\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1141/\">\n    438 F.3d at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed above, the ICE Directive falls clearly on the side of\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   rather than Miller, as \"given the nature of the guidelines themselves, and the function they govern,\" the Directive was intended-at least in part-to benefit asylum-seekers navigating the parole process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996744,3453458\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1141/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996744,3453458\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1141/\">\n    at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As an initial matter, the Court briefly addresses Plaintiffs' assertion that the current practice at the five Field Offices of \"denying parole in virtually all cases\" is motivated by deterrence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. PI Reply at 2. This line of argument may well be true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Class Cert. Reply at 6 n.2 (contending that \"evidence of the Trump Administration's deterrence goals continues to accumulate\"), but, as Plaintiffs acknowledge, it is not necessary for the Court to delve into the\n   <em>\n    basis\n   </em>\n   for the agency's alleged departure from the Directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. PI Reply at 14-15 (\"Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction, regardless of whether Defendants have been motivated by deterrence.\"); Tr. at 5:17-19; 26:20-22. Because it need not resolve this issue of impetus, the Court turns instead to the record regarding the current parole regime at the various Field Offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It begins with the most compelling evidence in support of Plaintiffs' case: the raw numbers. Although Benjamin Disraeli decried \"lies, damn lies, and statistics,\" the numbers here are irrefutable. According to records obtained by the asylum-seekers, \"[D]uring the eight months from February to September 2017,\" ICE's El Paso, Philadelphia, and Newark Field Offices denied 100% of parole applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 1. During that same period, the Los Angeles and Detroit Offices denied 92% and 98% of applications, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Daher Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 5-1; Compl., \u00b6 38. These figures, Plaintiffs assert, \"constitute[ ] a marked departure from just a few years ago,\" when ICE was also implementing the Parole Directive and\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   parole to more than 90% of asylum-seekers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Compl., \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Government's response to these figures is underwhelming at best. Indeed, as counsel conceded at the hearing, in light of the numbers for the first months of the administration, \"there are questions\" as to whether the five Field Offices are following the Parole Directive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 19:19-25; Tr. at 20:17-25 (\"[T]hose statistics certainly look like outliers\" from the Parole Directive.); Tr. at 21:7-11 (Government is \"trying to get more information\" as to whether \"these five offices are following the\" Directive). Although Defendants now state that they are \"trying to get th[e] numbers\" for intervening years,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 20:7-8, and are \"in the process of retrieving more information on the parole data,\" ECF No. 31-1 (Decl. of David W. Jennings), \u00b6 10, the fact remains that the only statistics submitted in this case are those cited by Plaintiffs. While DHS may believe that such figures overcount the actual parole-denial rate, their speculation is not sufficient to rebut Plaintiffs' assertion that the current release rate at the five ICE Field Offices is approaching zero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Defendants' assertion that the statistics were \"cherry picked\" is similarly unavailing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PI Opp. at 14. The Government attempts to cast doubt on Plaintiffs' figures by arguing that they strategically selected the numbers from only five ICE Offices across the nations. Yet, as Plaintiffs very reasonably note, \"[I]t is those five Field Offices, and only those five, whose practices are at issue in this case.\" PI Reply at 4. It therefore seems to make perfect sense for them to present numbers from those specific locales. Nor can Defendants allege that the asylum-seekers have manipulated the figures from the five Field Offices at issue. The statistics presented by Plaintiffs include\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   parole request-more\n   than 800 cases-recorded by ICE at those offices during the first eight months of the current administration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Daher Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 5-11. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs' analysis adequately supports their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court notes, moreover, that the dramatic departure in parole-grant rates from years past has not been explained in any way by Defendants. The Government does not dispute Plaintiffs' assertion that \"there has been no significant change in the types of asylum seekers traveling to the United States,\" Pl. Reply at 1, nor does it indicate any other change in circumstances that would lead to a shift in how the Parole Directive is being applied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 3 (noting that \"Defendants do not suggest that asylum seekers detained in 2017 suddenly became more apt to flee or more apt to commit crimes than those detained earlier, and they make no other effort to explain the numbers\"). Instead, in February 2017, then-DHS Secretary John Kelly stated that the Parole Directive \"remain[s] in full force and effect,\" and the Government represented the same to the Supreme Court just last year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MTD, Exh. B at 9-10 (Kelly Memorandum); Pet. Suppl. Reply. Br.,\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Witte), \u00b6 3; 22-4-5 (Declaration of Rebecca Adducci), \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Such representations-and the dearth of data supporting the allegation that Plaintiffs' numbers are off-place the Government in an untenable position. Defendants cannot claim that the ICE Directive remains fully in effect, and yet, at the same time, provide no explanation for the sudden shift in the day-to-day treatment of asylum-seekers under the current administration. Indeed, as the Government stated at argument, \"The policy ... certainly envisions case by case determinations that will result in parole.\" Tr. at 20:23-24. Defendants concede that such an aim is \"clear from reading the Parole Directive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20727754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Faced with the current record, the reasonable conclusion is that the five ICE Field Offices are not in fact putting this language into effect on the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In addition to providing the Court with these troubling statistics, Plaintiffs support their claims with a number of declarations from asylum-seekers and their advocates. The record includes affidavits from each of the named Plaintiffs, all of whom assert various violations of the Parole Directive with respect to ICE's adjudication of their release requests.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.

Plaintiffs' evidence also includes the statements of attorneys such as Joan Del Valle, an experienced immigration lawyer, who asserts that she has been told by multiple ICE officials that \"there is no more parole.\" Pl.

Exh. 4 (Declaration of Jessica Miles), \u00b6 6 (stating that as an immigration attorney she has been told by ICE officers that agency is \"not granting parole\").

Mot. at 8 (collecting statements from nine declarations). In sum, Plaintiffs argue that \"the evidence demonstrates that similarly situated individuals who routinely were\n   <em>\n    granted\n   </em>\n   parole in prior years are being\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   parole under the current regime,\" and that the Parole Directive is thus no longer being implemented at these five locations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Apr. 18, 2018) (refusing to credit declarations from ICE officials when officials were not decisionmakers and instead based assertions on \"purported review\" of documents).

May 12, 2016) (denial of 215 out of 215 applications could support conclusion that agency had blanket policy of denying applications, even in light of evidence suggesting individualized review). Although Defendants have submitted copies of certain letters and forms sent to the named Plaintiffs regarding their parole determinations, these summary and often boilerplate records do little to shine light on whether the Field Offices did, in fact, provide individualized determinations and comply in full with the Directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Indeed, in certain cases, Defendants' evidences cuts against DHS's contention that it continues to follow the Parole Directive. In the case of Plaintiff H.A.Y., the Government has provided a declaration from Diane Witte of the El Paso Field Office, stating that the office denied H.A.Y.'s parole request because she was \"a recent entrant and thus presented a flight risk.\" Witte Decl., \u00b6 23. This reasoning is contrary to the very concept of giving each applicant an \"individualized determination,\" as \"recent entry\" is a categorical characteristic of most, if not all, asylum-seekers. For the El Paso Field Office to conclude that such entry is, itself, sufficient to demonstrate flight risk strongly suggests that it is not conducting the particularized assessments required by the Directive. Certain of Defendants' records similarly undermine their assertion that the processes mandated by the Directive remain in place, as they evince a lack of compliance with its enumerated procedures.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 22-6 (Declaration of Jennifer Ritchey), Exh. 2-5 (providing records showing that Plaintiffs Castro and Callol received letters advising them of the right to apply for parole only one day prior to receiving nearly identical boilerplate letters informing them of parole denial);\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23 (Decl. of Andre Quinones), \u00b6 4 (stating that \"parole interviews are not conducted in every case if the interview would be superfluous\") with Parole Directive, \u00b6 8.2 (\"Unless an additional reasonable period of time is necessary ... no later than seven days following a finding that an arriving alien has a credible fear, a [Detention and Removal Operations] officer ...\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   conduct an interview with the alien to assess his or her eligibility for parole\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202757219\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202757219\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Witte Decl., \u00b6 9 (discussing denial of parole for L.H.A. without interview).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In light of the drastic decline in parole-grant rates at the five ICE Field Offices, and the affidavits by the named Plaintiffs and their counsel regarding the processing of their parole applications, this Court finds that the asylum-seekers are able to demonstrate that individualized parole determinations are likely no longer par for the course. The Court therefore finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their\n   <em>\n    Accardi\n   </em>\n   claim that Defendants are not abiding by their own policies and procedures.

England\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311835,3594892\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/669/\">\n    758 F.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ). The injury must also be \"both certain and great; it must be actual and not theoretical.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311835,3594892\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/669/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Gas\n   </em>\n   , 758 F.2d at 674 ). Finally, the injury must be \"beyond remediation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs have satisfied this inquiry here. As discussed above, the evidence they present suggests that asylum-seekers are being denied parole without the protections of the ICE Directive. The record indicates that, instead, they are subject to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   \"no-parole\" reality, under which detention has become the default option. It is evident, moreover, that being deprived of the safeguards of the Parole Directive harms putative class members in myriad ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17-23 (Declaration of Allen S. Keller), \u00b6\u00b6 11-24 (discussing \"harmful effects of immigration detention on the health and well-being of asylum-seekers\");\n   <em>\n    Abdi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277829\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/280/373/#p385\">\n    280 F.Supp.3d at 407-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding irreparable harm when asylum-seekers detained at facility failing to follow Parole Directive). Although Defendants contend that Plaintiffs can seek parole redeterminations, and thus are not subject to irreparable harm, they make no showing that such requests are any more likely to be granted than the initial applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 24. Given that this Court has already agreed with Plaintiffs' contention that parole requests are being nearly uniformly denied at the five Field Offices, it makes little sense to seek redetermination under the same regime as a route to meaningful relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25-3 (Stambaugh Suppl. Decl.), \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10 (redetermination denial consisted solely of \"original boilerplate parole denial letter\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The injuries at stake, furthermore, are \"beyond remediation.\"\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5559864,3457358\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/290/\">\n    454 F.3d at 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Members of the proposed class do not seek monetary compensation for their injuries. Instead, they seek injunctive and declaratory relief requiring that Defendants follow their own parole policies. Unlike economic harm, the harm from detention pursuant to an unlawful departure from agency procedure cannot be remediated after the fact.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668318,5863479\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/1288/\">\n    571 F.3d 1288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (economic losses are typically not irreparable because compensation can be awarded after a merits determination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Balance of Harms and Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Under the circumstances of this case, factors three and four do not require in-depth analysis. As courts in this district have recognized, \"The public interest is served when administrative agencies comply with their obligations under the APA.\"\n   <em>\n    N. Mariana Islands v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3613953\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/686/7/#p21\">\n    686 F.Supp.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (D.D.C. 2009). The Parole Directive itself, moreover, states that the detention of asylum-seekers who are neither a flight risk nor dangerous is \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in the public interest\" and therefore requires an individualized parole determination as to whether they should be released.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Parole Directive, \u00b6 6.2 (emphasis added). In light of the Court's conclusion that DHS's current failure to follow the ICE Directive is likely unlawful, and that the parole practices in place at the five Field Offices cause irreparable harm to those seeking asylum, the Court finds that these last two factors favor Plaintiffs as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   To be clear, in finding that injunctive relief is warranted in this case, this Court is simply ordering that Defendants do what they already admit is required-follow the ICE Directive when adjudicating asylum-seekers' detention. The Directive provides a framework of minimum protections for those claiming refugee status, and, as Defendants acknowledge, it is binding on the Government. To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country-individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores-is no great judicial leap. Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   For the aforementioned reasons, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motions for a Preliminary Injunction and will grant provisional class certification. A separate Order consistent with this Opinion shall issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
