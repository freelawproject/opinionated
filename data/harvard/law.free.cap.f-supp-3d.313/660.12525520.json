(ECF No. 28.) The United States responded, (ECF No. 31), and Villarreal replied, (ECF No. 32). On May 11, 2018, the Court heard argument on the Second Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Motion to Dismiss is ripe for disposition. For the reasons discussed below, the Court will deny the Second Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Factual and Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Villarreal, a citizen of Mexico, first came to the United States in 1996 at the age of seventeen. He has six siblings, three of whom currently live in the United States. Villarreal also has three children, ages sixteen, twelve, and three. All his children were born in the United States to Villarreal and his partner, and they live in Hopewell, Virginia. While in the United States, Villarreal worked in construction and sent money to his parents in Mexico every month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Villarreal has twice been removed from the United States under orders of removal: first on September 1, 2014, and later on November 20, 2014. He also has been apprehended by United States Border Patrol and allowed to voluntarily return to Mexico five times: twice in 1998, and three times in 1999. Villarreal's criminal history currently includes nine criminal convictions within the United States-six misdemeanor convictions and three felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In February of 2014, Chesterfield County, Virginia, police officers arrested Villarreal for \"DWI, Third Offense,\" and Villarreal was found guilty. Villarreal's arrest and conviction prompted the police to notify immigration officials, who interviewed Villarreal, determined that he was removable, and lodged a detainer. On September 2, 2014, Villarreal appeared before an Immigration Judge in Arlington, Virginia, who ordered Villarreal removed from the United States (the \"September 2, 2014 Order of Removal\"). On September 11, 2014, immigration officials physically removed\n   Villarreal from the country and returned him to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 20, 2014, Villarreal attempted to re-enter the United States by presenting a passport that was not his at the El Paso, Texas, Port of Entry. After determining that the passport did not belong to Villarreal, immigration officials placed him into expedited removal proceedings and issued an Order of Removal (the \"November 20, 2014 Order of Removal\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The November 20, 2014 Order of Removal states that Villarreal was deemed removable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Expedited Removal Statute\") because immigration officials determined that he was inadmissible under sections 212(a)(6)(C)(ii),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Fraudulent Entry Statute\"), and (7)(A)(i)(I),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"No Entry Document Statute\"), of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The November 20, 2014 Order of Removal states that on November 20, 2014, Villarreal \"falsely represented [himself] to be a United States citizen ... [t]o gain entry into the United States,\" in violation of the Fraudulent Entry Statute, and that he also violated the No Entry Document Statute because he was \"an immigrant not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing card, or other valid entry document required by the Immigration and Nationality Act.\" (Second Mot. Dismiss, Ex. 1 at 10, ECF No. 28-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The next day, on November 21, 2014, the United States Attorney's Office in the Western District of Texas instituted a criminal prosecution of Villarreal for his attempted reentry. On December 17, 2014, a grand jury returned a two-count indictment charging Villarreal with Illegal Reentry, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Improper Use of Another's Passport, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201544\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Villarreal\n   pleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to fifteen months' imprisonment. On December 23, 2016, after he had served his sentence, immigration officials physically removed Villarreal from the country and returned him to Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 6, 2017, Villarreal was again found in the United States when Chesterfield County police officers arrested him for \"Obstruct Justice: Without Force,\" \"DWI: Previous Felon,\" and \"Driving While Suspended.\" The next day, officials in the Chesterfield County Jail notified Richmond immigration authorities that Villarreal was in their custody. On September 20, 2017, a grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia returned the instant one-count Indictment, again charging Villarreal with a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 5, 2018, Villarreal filed his first motion to dismiss (the \"First Motion to Dismiss\"). In the First Motion to Dismiss, Villarreal sought to collaterally attack both the September 2, 2014 Order of Removal and the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal, arguing that he was deprived of due process in both of those deportation proceedings. On February 15, 2018, the Court heard argument on the First Motion to Dismiss. Because the parties' briefing on the First Motion to Dismiss largely argued the merits as to success under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (the \"Collateral Attack Subsection\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court, identifying a threshold issue which neither party had squarely addressed, asked the parties to address the relevance of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute\"), to Villarreal's First Motion to Dismiss. It was not until questioning by the Court that it became apparent that Villarreal intended to challenge the constitutionality of that provision. Holding that Villarreal had \"not adequately raised [the] constitutional challenge ... in a way that the Court can decide,\" the Court denied the First Motion to Dismiss without prejudice. (Feb. 23, 2018 Mem. O. 7, ECF No. 27.) The Court allowed Villarreal to file a second motion to dismiss, which he timely did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Villarreal argues in the Second Motion to Dismiss that the Court must dismiss the Indictment because neither the September 2, 2014 Order of Removal nor the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal constitute valid orders of removal on which a prosecution for Illegal Reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) may be premised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Subsequent briefing and argument from both parties established that the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal is the only removal challenged at bar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Second Motion to Dismiss, Villarreal finally presents his constitutional challenge. Villarreal argues that either the Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute is unconstitutional when applied in context of a prosecution under the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute, or Congress intended that prosecutions under the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute could not be premised on expedited removals. The United States has responded, and Villarreal has replied. The constitutional question is therefore squarely before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D), the Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute, is unconstitutional to the extent it prohibits, in a subsequent prosecution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute, \"\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   meaningful review\" of an alien's claim that the underlying deportation proceeding, which constitutes an element of the criminal charge, was \"fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, because Villarreal cannot establish that the deportation proceeding underlying the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal was fundamentally unfair, the Court will deny Villarreal's Second Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute is Unconstitutional to the Extent it Prohibits\n     <em>\n      Some\n     </em>\n     Meaningful Review of a Deportation Proceeding on Which a Subsequent Criminal Prosecution is Based\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   requires that, \"where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction, there must be\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    481 U.S. at 837-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the Collateral Attack Subsection provides for judicial review of some orders of removal in the context of prosecutions based on the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute, the Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute, by its plain language, prohibits judicial review of the validity of an expedited removal, such as the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal, in the context of a prosecution under the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D). The Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute also expressly provides that the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute applies to aliens who were removed pursuant to the Expedited Removal Statute. But when an alien is prosecuted under the Criminal Illegal Reentry\n   Statute after being removed pursuant to an expedited removal order, that removal order constitutes an element of the subsequent criminal charge, which-through the combined operation of the Expedited Removal Statute and the Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute-cannot be reviewed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court therefore must conclude that the Jurisdiction-Stripping Statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(D), is unconstitutional to the extent it prohibits\n   <em>\n    \"some\n   </em>\n   meaningful review\" in a prosecution under the Criminal Illegal Reentry Statute of an alien's claim that the underlying deportation proceeding was \"fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    481 U.S. at 838-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Mendoza-Lopez\n     </em>\n     Requires\n     <em>\n      Some\n     </em>\n     Meaningful Review When a Subsequent Criminal Prosecution is Based on an Earlier Deportation Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   , two aliens were arrested in Nebraska, subjected to group deportation proceedings, and ordered deported to Mexico.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    481 U.S. at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/#p838\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the United States, Congress recognized that arriving aliens have fewer due process entitlements than those aliens present in the United States, meaning that Congress intended to-and, according to the United States, appropriately did-prevent arriving aliens subjected to expedited removal from collaterally attacking their orders of removal in any subsequent criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This is logical, argues the United States, because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [b]oth\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   and [the Collateral Attack Subsection] make explicit reference to due process violations being a necessary predicate to a collateral attack.

Villarreal's argument falters for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   First, the United States contends that the materials to which Villarreal refers are not in fact discoverable. (Resp. Second Mot. Dismiss 28 n.16.) Villarreal has filed no motion seeking to compel the United States to provide the requested documents. A motion to compel discovery is the proper procedural mechanism through which to argue the merits of Villarreal's contention that the United States has failed to turn over discoverable material. The Court declines to weigh in on a discovery issue improperly presented, as it is, in footnotes of the parties' briefs on the Second Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , E.D.

And, especially given the multiple opportunities this Court provided Villarreal to address these issues, Villarreal has waived any right to have this discovery matter considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   More importantly, in the context of the Second Motion to Dismiss, Villarreal bears the burden of establishing prejudice from any purported due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377154\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/506/#p509\">\n    316 F.3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The single documented instance which Villarreal says supports his argument of prejudice differs in important ways from Villarreal's particular circumstances leading to the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Villarreal attaches to his Motion to Dismiss a one-page document entitled \"Withdrawal of Application for Admission/Consular Notification.\" (Second Mot. Dismiss Ex. 1 at 12, ECF No. 28-1.) According to Villarreal, this document describes a\n   <em>\n    Duenas-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   qualifying \"other case\" in which an individual \"in an identical position to Mr. Villarreal\" was granted withdrawal of application. (Reply Second Mot. Dismiss 1.) The document, dated June 26, 2009, states that the individual \"came to the attention of [immigration officials] pursuant to his incarceration with the California City Correctional Center.\" (Second Mot. Dismiss Ex. 1 at 12.) The individual had been \"ordered excluded from the United States\" once before. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The individual had been convicted of False Statement to a Federal Officer, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The immigration officials allowed that individual to withdraw his application, and he thereby avoided an order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Villarreal cannot establish prejudice based on this single identified grant of withdrawal of application. First, the Court is disinclined to find that Villarreal could establish a reasonable likelihood-or even a realistic probability-by pointing to one single individual who, for unknown reasons, was allowed to withdraw his application five years before Villarreal tried to re-enter the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Garcia-Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275160\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/1175/#p1180\">\n    791 F.3d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"The mere fact that [one] other alien[ ] in a position arguably similar to [Villarreal's] position w[as] allowed (for reasons unknown) to withdraw [his] application[ ] for admission establishes nothing more than relief in that situation is\n   <em>\n    possible.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). Moreover, even assuming Villarreal\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   meet his burden by relying on one individual \"in an identical position\" who was granted withdrawal of application, this anonymous individual could never serve in that role because he differs from Villarreal in important ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, the information before the Court about the individual's criminal history reflects only a single conviction for False Statement to a Federal Officer. As of November 20, 2014, Villarreal had seven criminal convictions: six misdemeanors and one felony. (Stipulation 1-2.) This alone\n   places Villarreal in a materially different circumstance than the individual to whom he points. Second, immigration officials became aware of Villarreal's purported comparator because he was incarcerated-again, substantially different from Villarreal, who was apprehended attempting to cross the border with a false passport. Finally, the document includes no information about the individual's ties to the United States, which could prove important in deciding whether to grant withdrawal of application.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n    771 F.3d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, on November 20, 2014, Villarreal stood in a meaningfully different position than the individual on whom he seeks to rely to establish a realistic possibility that he would have been granted withdrawal of application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Villarreal also appears to rely on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n    771 F.3d 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to claim that Raya-Vaca might serve as a second comparator to show that withdrawal of application was plausible in Villarreal's situation. Villarreal's comparison of his own situation to Raya-Vaca's fails for reasons similar to those defeating his reliance on the anonymous individual included in his exhibit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Villarreal's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   likewise does not further his ability to establish prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, unlike the circumstances under which Villarreal entered the United States, the\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   court noted, \"[f]irst and foremost, Raya-Vaca committed no fraud, let alone obvious or deliberate fraud, when entering the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n    771 F.3d at 1207-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Villarreal, in contrast, violated the False Entry Statute by \"falsely represent[ing] himself ... to be a citizen of the United States for a purpose or benefit under the Act ... or any other Federal or State law.\" (O. Removal 2, ECF No. 28-1.) The\n   <em>\n    Raya-Vaca\n   </em>\n   court identified such fraud as \"a\n   <em>\n    crucial\n   </em>\n   consideration that ...\n   <em>\n    ordinarily militates against withdrawal.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n    771 F.3d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted) (emphasis added). The court also commented on Raya-Vaca's \"fairly minimal\" criminal history consisting only of misdemeanors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292325\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1195/#p1207\">\n    at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike Raya-Vaca, at the time of the November 20, 2014 Order of Removal, Villarreal had accumulated seven criminal convictions, including one felony DWI conviction.

Counsel clarified his assertion that Villarreal, when requesting the presence of counsel before answering the questions the immigration officers asked, sought to invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in that criminal proceeding. This explanation does not change the Court's analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Although declining to decide whether a Fifth Amendment right to counsel exists in the context of immigration proceedings, or whether the possibility of subsequent prosecution based on statements made in an immigration proceeding confers such a right, the Court notes that the Fourth Circuit has expressly held \"there is no Fifth Amendment right to\n    <em>\n     effective\n    </em>\n    assistance of counsel during the course of removal proceedings.\"\n    <em>\n     Cruz v.

He further asserts that, because these policies are \"directly relevant to whether there is a reasonable probability that [Villarreal] would have been granted such relief,\" counsel for Villarreal requested in discovery these policies from the United States, but never received a copy.

Rule 16(a)(1)(E) requires in relevant part that the United States must provide an item to the defendant if the item is \"within the government's possession, custody, or control and: (i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the government intends to use the item in its casein-chief at trial; or[,] (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs to the defendant.\" Fed.
