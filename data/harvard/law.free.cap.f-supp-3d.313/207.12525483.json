The Union's angst is caused by policies under which WMATA checks the criminal histories of applicants and, on occasion, employees. WMATA notes that this Court has already entered a permanent injunction with respect to the first two grievances, and that the third is covered by an agreement between the parties to postpone any arbitration pending final resolution of the lawsuit,\n   <em>\n    Little v. Washington Metropolitan\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Area Transit Authority\n   </em>\n   , Civil Case No. 14-1289 (D.D.C.), which is now on appeal. WMATA contends that the fourth grievance is not subject to arbitration because no WMATA employee has been adversely affected by the policy under attack. The Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Local 689's Grievances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Local 689 seeks to arbitrate four grievances, falling into three categories. First, the two 2014 Grievances, which claim that the 2012 Policy had a disparate impact on African Americans. This Court entered a permanent injunction against arbitration of both 2014 Grievances in 2015, which was affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WMATA v. Local 689, Amalgamated Transit Union\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363591\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/121/\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2015),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   638 Fed. App'x. 3 (D.C. Cir. 2016). Second, Local 689 moves to reopen a 2016 Grievance about the same allegedly discriminatory effect of the 2012 Policy. In 2016, this Court began to hear argument on the 2016 Grievance, but the parties entered into a written agreement to postpone consideration of that grievance until the\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   litigation concluded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5, Compl., 2016 Agreement [Dkt. 1-5] at 2-3. This Court's approval of the class action settlement agreement in\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   is currently on appeal at the D.C. Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   , Civil Case No. 14-1289, Dkt. 255, Notice of Appeal. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   litigation has not concluded and the parties' agreement to postpone the 2016 Grievance is still in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Local 689 brings a Question Grievance concerning the 2017 Policy. It initially argued that WMATA was required to negotiate with the Union before adopting the 2017 Policy but then conceded that WMATA is bound by the Court's order on the Settlement in\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   to keep that policy in effect for a year. After\n   discussion of the Order implementing the\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   Settlement Agreement, the Union changed its argument to demand that WMATA engage in effects bargaining over the 2017 Policy,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , bargaining as to how the 2017 Policy might affect current members of the bargaining unit represented by the Union. As modified, the 2017 Grievance is the only grievance the Union now seeks to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    E. This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 8, 2018, WMATA filed a Complaint against Local 689, alleging that the claims asserted in the grievances were not arbitrable and arguing that the arbitrations of three of the four Grievances were either precluded by this Court's prior permanent injunction or the 2016 agreement of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. WMATA seeks to enjoin the imminent arbitrations and any future arbitrations in which employee grievants seek to make disparate impact claims based on WMATA's criminal background screening policies and procedures; WMATA also seeks a declaratory judgment that the claims asserted by Local 689 in the grievances are not arbitrable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42. Shortly after filing its Complaint, WMATA filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction on June 13, 2018. WMATA's Mot. for TRO and PI (Mot.) [Dkt. 5];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of WMATA's Mot. for TRO and PI (Mem.) [Dkt. 5-1]. Local 689 opposed the motion on June 14, 2018, Local 689 Opp'n to Pl.'s Emergency Mot. for TRO and PI (Opp'n) [Dkt. 9], and the Court heard argument and discussion on June 18, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As described above, the arguments and discussion at the June 18 hearing clarified that the Union seeks to arbitrate the question of whether WMATA violated the Agreement by refusing to bargain with the Union over the effects of the 2017 Policy on bargaining unit employees and, if so, what the remedy would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Compact directs arbitration of labor disputes \"involving the Authority and [its] employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201107.01\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 1107.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (66)(c). WMATA and the Union have separately entered into a CBA, which lays out the relationship between the parties. Section 102(b) of the CBA states that the Union \"reserves the right to bargain and where necessary to seek interest arbitration concerning all issues relating to wages, hours and\n   <em>\n    working conditions\n   </em>\n   .\" CBA at 3-4. It also describes WMATA's exclusive prerogative to determine \"all matters pertaining to the management of operations, including ... the hiring and establishment of standards for selection and qualification of employees ..., and the development and enforcement of reasonable rules and regulations regarding employment ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201107.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Section 104(c) acknowledges that the Union may initiate Question Grievances for \"[q]uestions arising under the Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201107.01\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201107.01\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Union argues that the only remaining Grievance is a permissible Question Grievance which seeks to determine: (i) if WMATA was required to negotiate with the Union about the effects of the 2017 Policy because it is a \"working condition\" or (ii) if the Policy is a management prerogative to determine \"standards for selection and qualification of employees.\" The Union relies in part on a January 2017 decision of a Board of Arbitration in the Paper Suspension Policy Question Grievance, which held that disciplinary policies affect working conditions and, therefore, should have been negotiated under the Compact and CBA between WMATA and Local 689.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9, Opp'n, Opinion and Award in Paper Suspension Policy Grievance [Dkt. 9-9] at 23-25. WMATA argues that it cannot be compelled to arbitrate because no employee has been harmed and because the 2017 Policy is clearly management prerogative, which is not negotiable. WMATA cites this Court's earlier decision concerning these parties and issues, in which the Court interpreted the Compact to require, in those circumstances, that the Union name an employee grievant affected by the policy under attack.\n   <em>\n    WMATA v. Local 689\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363591\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/113/121/\">\n    113 F.Supp.3d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The current circumstances are materially different. The Union asks the Board of Arbitration to determine if WMATA must engage in effects bargaining; in that posture, the Union is raising a matter concerning the scope of its own right to bargain, for which a specific affected employee is not necessary. The question must be answered within the confines of the collectively-bargained contract language setting forth management rights and union rights; it is not a question to be determined by reference to the Compact. A Board of Arbitration is the entity to interpret contract language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that WMATA has not met its burden of establishing a likelihood of success on the merits to justify a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Irreparable Harm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   WMATA argues that it will suffer \"per se\" irreparable harm if it must arbitrate a dispute that it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mount Ararat Cemetery v. Cemetery Workers and Greens Attendants Union, Local 365\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11900968\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/975/445/#p446\">\n    975 F.Supp. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446-47 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) (finding that party \"may be presumed to suffer\n   irreparable harm if forced to arbitrate a dispute it did not intend to be subject to arbitration after its contract expired\"). However, as described above, the Union's Question Grievance concerns the scope of the parties' rights under the CBA, which is the bread and butter of labor arbitration to which WMATA has agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   WMATA also argues that if it is required to negotiate concerning implementation of the 2017 Policy, it will upset the Settlement in\n   <em>\n    Little v. WMATA\n   </em>\n   , which requires WMATA not to alter the 2017 Policy for one year after the Settlement's approval, all of which is reflected in a formal Court Order. The Court addressed this issue during the motion hearing and noted that the Arbitrator could fashion a remedy, if s/he decided in favor of the Union, that would not disrupt the Settlement's first year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that WMATA has not demonstrated irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Balance of Equities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In evaluating whether a preliminary injunction should issue, courts \"must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    555 U.S. at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p20\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, the balance of equities weighs in favor of Local 689 because it raised a Question Grievance subject to arbitration under the CBA, which can be resolved without injury to WMATA's adherence to the Settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of denying the motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   WMATA argues that \"[l]eaving the subject matter of the grievances to arbitration harms the public interest\" because \"[t]hese policies and practices are too important ... to be left to decision in a forum where there are no defined rights, no protections, no governing law, and an exceedingly limited right of review by the courts.\" Mem. at 30-31. Under the circumstances now pertaining, in which the Union acknowledges the binding nature of the Court's Order on the Settlement and seeks only to negotiate the effects of the 2017 Policy on bargaining unit employees, these generalized objections do not persuade. On balance, the Court finds that the public interest favors labor arbitration and disfavors an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As explained above, the Court will grant in part and deny in part WMATA's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction [Dkt. 5]. The Court will grant WMATA's motion as it pertains to the 2014 and 2016 Grievances and deny WMATA's motion as it pertains to the 2017 Question Grievance on the effects of the 2017 Policy. A memorializing Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The parties explained at oral argument that bargaining for a new collective bargaining agreement reached impasse and is in the process of interest arbitration, whereby a panel of three arbitrators (one from each party and a neutral) will set the terms for the new contract. As a result, the terms of the 2012-2016 CBA continue in effect. The Union chose not to bargain about the 2017 Policy during the collective bargaining for a new contract. It hopes to bargain a side agreement.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Citations within this document are to the ECF page number.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
