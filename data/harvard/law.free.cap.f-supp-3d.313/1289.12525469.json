Walker, United States District Judge\n   This is a proposed class action challenging Defendants' billing practices for air ambulance services. In May 2013, Plaintiffs Richard and Jennie Stout's minor daughter received emergency air ambulance transportation by Defendants Med-Trans Corporation (\"Med-Trans\") and Air Medical Group Holdings, Inc. (\"AMGH\"). Plaintiffs assert Defendants charged an amount that grossly exceeded the \"uniform, customary, and reasonable amount\" typically charged for similar services. ECF No. 20 at 8. Now Plaintiffs bring state-law claims for breach of implied-in-fact contract and unjust enrichment individually and on behalf of others who received emergency medical air transport by Defendants within the state of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss, arguing that the state-law claims are preempted by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (\"ADA\") and are otherwise deficient. And Defendants move to dismiss claims against Defendant AMGH for failure to allege any facts by which AMGH may be liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In anticipation of Defendants' preemption defense, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, asserting that application of the ADA's preemption provision violates their constitutional rights. This Court has considered, without hearing, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 27. The motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   for the reasons set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A complaint \"must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\" to survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Defendant Med-Trans provides emergency medical transportation by helicopter, often referred to as \"air-ambulance transportation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20 at 7; ECF No. 20-1 at 2. Defendant AMGH is a holding company that \"owns, controls, and directs the finances and operations of Defendant Med-Trans Corporation.\" ECF No. 20 at 7. In May 2013, Plaintiffs' minor daughter was involved in an accident for which emergency personnel determined she needed air-ambulance transportation and coordinated the necessary arrangements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 8. Defendants provided the air-ambulance transport from Ocala, Florida to Gainesville, Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. The flight was a total distance of 37 loaded helicopter miles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs claim Defendants knew the rate they intended to charge prior to transport but failed to disclose it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. After providing transportation, Defendants\n   sent Plaintiffs an \"Authorization Form,\" which stated, \"[d]on't forget to sign the form and return to us as soon as possible. Some health coverage cannot be filed without doing so, and you may be billed for the entire charge.\" ECF Doc. 27-1 at 3. Defendants subsequently billed a total of $24,361.16, which the Plaintiffs allege is an amount over 300% more than the customary charge for similar services. ECF No. 20 at 8. Plaintiffs' bill states that their insurance provider paid $5,671.17, leaving Plaintiffs liable for a balance of $18,689.99. ECF No. 20-2 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on these facts, Plaintiffs allege state-law claims for breach of implied contract and unjust enrichment. They also seek declaratory and injunctive relief based on the alleged unconstitutional application of ADA preemption to their state-law claims in the event Defendants' defense is successful. Meanwhile, Defendants maintain that the state-law claims are preempted by the ADA and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    B\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Normally, the existence of an affirmative defense like federal preemption of state law will not support a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     Quiller v.

To ensure that states wouldn't undo federal deregulation of the airline industry, the ADA included an express preemption provision prohibiting states from enacting or enforcing \"a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2040101\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    To start, this Court must determine whether Plaintiffs' claims implicate the ADA's preemption provision. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants are not protected under the preemption provision because they are not \"air carriers\" as defined by the ADA. Plaintiffs assert this is because the transportation at issue was entirely intrastate as opposed to interstate or foreign. This Court disagrees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Under the ADA, an \"air carrier\" is defined as \"a citizen of the United States undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide air transportation.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040102\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2). \"Air transportation\" is defined as \"foreign air transportation, interstate air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2040102\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 40102(a)(5).
