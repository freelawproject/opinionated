(\"Stemline\"), which develops a highly sophisticated and complicated drug for the treatment of an otherwise fatal blood cancer. The buyers contend they were misled by Stemline's claimed ability to remediate certain fatal side effects of its drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Lead Plaintiffs Adam Ludlow, Daljit Singh, and Kenneth Walsh, and Representative Plaintiff Marion Beeler (\"Plaintiffs\") bring this consolidated class action\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Stemline, its officers and directors,\n   Ivan Bergstein, Ron Bentsur, Eric L. Dobmeier, Alan Forman, David Gionco, Kenneth Zuerblis (\"Individual Defendants\"), and its underwriter, Jefferies LLC (\"Jefferies\"), alleging violations of: Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act (Counts I, II); and Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act (Counts III-V). Plaintiffs, who allegedly purchased Stemline securities (1) pursuant and/or traceable to Stemline's secondary public offering on or about January 20, 2017 (\"Offering\") and/or (2) on the open market between January 20, 2017 and February 1, 2017 (\"Class Period\"), claim that they suffered injury from Stemline's misleading statements in the Offering's prospectus concerning its ability to remediate side effects of the drug under development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Stemline, Individual Defendants, and Jefferies move to dismiss the Amended Complaint. ECF 42, 45. For reasons set forth below, the motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Its leading drug candidate and key value driver is SL-401. Amended Complaint (\"AC\"), \u00b6\u00b6 14, 30. SL-401 treats certain rare, blood-related and otherwise fatal cancers, including blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (\"BPDCN\") and acute myeloid leukemia (\"AML\"),\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2, 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Stemline began its clinical development program for SL-401 in July 2014, Upon achieving initial success, it broadened the trial into a pivotal trial with a plan to enroll at least 60 patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. The pivotal trial opened with a lead-in phase to evaluate the dosage and safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 36. The lead-in phase was followed by an expansion phase to determine whether the SL-401 drug treatment was efficacious against the blood cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 42. The lead-in phase was completed on June 30, 2015, and the expansion phase began thereafter, with the goal of submitting a marketing application to the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") during the second half of 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 7, 2015, Stemline reported on the clinical data of 29 patients treated with SL-401 during the lead-in phase and the on-going expansion phase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 40; ECF 43-6 at 9. Three of the treated patients had contracted severe capillary leak syndrome (\"CLS\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a now-known side effect of SL-401, two of whom had died from it and one of whom had experienced a life-threatening emergency.

Safety Measure Failure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On or about January 14, 2017, one BPDCN patient enrolled in the pivotal trial developed a serious side effect, after receiving two of the five treatment cycles of SL-401 that began on January 13, 2017. In accordance with the revised safety and dosage protocol, doctors ceased administering SL-401 to the patient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 73. On January 17, 2017, the patient's family reported that the patient had been \"diagnosed with Capillary Leak Syndrome, which [was] a known side effect of SL-401.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. On January 18, 2017, the patient died.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Stemline learned of the patient's death on the same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Secondary Public Offering and Offering Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 19, 2017, the day after the patient's death, Stemline announced the Offering of its common stock to fund the potential commercialization of SL-401.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. On January 20, 2017, Stemline filed the offering documents (Form 424B5), including the Prospectus, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and, on the same day, offered 4.5 million shares of Stemline common stock at $10.00 per share, totaling $45 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Offering's Prospectus detailed SL-401's prior and then-current trials, including the Pivotal Trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The Prospectus provided facts and assessments concerning prior clinical trials by incorporating prior SEC filings by reference.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-64. The Prospectus also stated that \"SL-401's safety profile has continued to remain predictable and manageable over increasing treatment duration, drug exposure, and patient experience,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65, and \"favorable clinical data\" have been observed as of the date of the offering documents,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. The Prospectus did not disclose the patient's death that Stemline had learned on January 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The article included several unfounded commentaries on SL-401 and the FDA approval process. For example, the article stated that \"a cancer patient in a clinical trial died from a severe side effect, a type of low blood pressure tied to the company's drug SL-401\" and \"[SL-401] is also now tied to three patient deaths,\" when the cause of the patient's death had not yet been determined. ECF 43-13 at 1, 2. The article also stated that \"[t]he inability to control serious, potentially fatal, side effects can derail otherwise highly effective experimental therapies, even cancer drugs,\" when the FDA actually granted the BTD status to SL-401 with the knowledge that it had caused two\n   deaths and one life-threatening condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; AC \u00b6\u00b6 40, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Later the same day, Stemline issued a press release, confirming that a BPDCN patient had developed CLS and had died, and that it had learned of the death on January 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. Stemline, however, clarified that \"[t]he cause of the patient's death [had] not yet been determined.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That day, Stemline's stock price fell by $4.15, from $9.75 to $5.60, or approximately 42.5%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69; ECF 43-16 (\"Stock Price Chart\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   .

The Prospectus and the incorporated documents were very clear that the data in the incorporated documents were historical only.\n   <em>\n    See supra,\n   </em>\n   n.4. In view of ample disclaimers, a reasonable investor could not have deemed the incorporated statements to be representative of the drug's performance as of the Offering date. Thus, the incorporated statements could not have created any duty to disclose the new occurrence of severe CLS, and the purported failure to disclose it could not have rendered the incorporated statements misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Affirmative Statements in Prospectus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While Plaintiffs' primary argument for their Section 10(b) claim is that Stemline falsely claimed it had eliminated the risk of CLS, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AC \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; Opp'n Mem. at 1, 2, 9, 10, 13, 14, 26), it is clear that Stemline never claimed that it had eliminated CLS risks; \"elimination\" is a fabrication by Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs also contend that following affirmative statements in the Prospectus were misleading:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) \"SL-401's safety profile has continued to remain predictable and manageable over increasing treatment duration, drug exposure, and patient experience.\" AC \u00b6 65.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) \"[F]avorable clinical data [were] observed to date with SL-401.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Stemline claims these statements were not misleading because they reflected opinions; and were not rendered misleading by a single adverse event. Stemline Mem. at 15-16. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The concerned statements-\"predictable and manageable\" and \"favorable clinical data\"-are expressions of opinion. Expressions of opinion may be actionable \"if a registration statement omits material facts about the issuer's ... knowledge concerning a statement of opinion, and if those facts conflict with what a reasonable investor would take from the statement itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Omnicare, Inc. v.

It is uncontested that the Prospectus was filed after the patient's death on January 18, 2017. The question is whether the patient's death \"conflict[ed] with what a reasonable investor would [have taken] from\" opinion statements in the Prospectus: \"predictable and manageable\" and \"favorable clinical data.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The question must be answered in the negative. To a reasonable investor, a recurrence of a known side effect, CLS, would not have been unexpected. CLS was a known fatal side effect of SL-401. It had caused two deaths in the past, and the deaths were not disclosed contemporaneously, but only later. AC \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 40. An additional case of severe CLS occurring in an on-going trial would not have been in \"conflict with what a reasonable investor would [have taken] from\" the concerned opinion statements.\n   <em>\n    Omnicare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587416\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1318/#p1329\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The concerned statements are not actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For these reasons, Plaintiffs have failed to plead that Stemline made misstatements or omissions actionable under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act. The Court draws the same conclusion with respect to Individual Defendants and Jefferies. Plaintiffs have failed to plead that Individual Defendants and Jefferies made actionable misstatements or omissions, or that any actionable misstatements or omissions could be attributed to Individual Defendants and Jefferies.\n   <em>\n    In re Fannie Mae 2008 Sec.
