Docket no. 119. Intervenor-Defendants Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, City of Uvalde, County of Uvalde, City of San Marcos, and New Braunfels Utilities have joined in the EAA's motion for summary judgment. Docket nos. 117, 122, 124, 129, and 137. The Texas Farm Bureau and Past and Current Members of the EAA Board of Directors have filed\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   briefs in support of the EAA's motion for summary judgment. Docket nos. 166, 182. The LULAC plaintiffs and San Antonio\n   Water System (\"SAWS\") filed a joint response in opposition to the EAA's motion for summary judgment (docket nos. 140-158) and the EAA filed a reply (docket no. 169). LULAC and SAWS also filed a response to the current and former board members'\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief. Docket no. 183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also pending before the Court is Plaintiffs' Joint Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on One Person, One Vote Equal Protection Claim. Docket no. 168. The EAA filed a response (docket no. 169) and Intervenor-Defendants Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, New Braunfels Utilities, City of San Marcos, City of Uvalde, and County of Uvalde joined in the EAA's response (docket nos. 170, 171, 172, 173, 174). Plaintiffs also filed a reply in support of their motion for partial summary judgment. Docket no. 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After reviewing the record and the applicable law, the Court finds that the EAA's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiffs' One Person, One Vote Equal Protection Claim (docket no. 119) should be granted and Plaintiffs' Joint Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on One Person, One Vote Equal Protection Claim (docket no. 168) should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Statement of the case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. The parties:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This lawsuit was filed by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Marie Martinez, Jesse Alaniz, Jr. and Ramiro Nava (collectively \"the LULAC plaintiffs\") against the Edwards Aquifer Authority in June 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 1. The City of San Antonio, acting by and through the San Antonio Water System (\"SAWS\") sought permission to intervene as a plaintiff in August 2012, and permission was granted. Docket nos. 8, 10. The LULAC plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint in January 2013 (docket no. 28) and their Second Amended Complaint in March 2013 (docket no. 38). The LULAC plaintiffs added the Secretary of State as a party defendant in their Second Amended Complaint. Docket no. 38. In August 2013, SAWS filed its First Amended Complaint in Intervention, also adding the Secretary of State as a defendant. Docket no. 70. All claims against the Secretary of State were dismissed on March 31, 2014. Docket no. 165. Several other governmental entities have intervened as defendants and are aligned with EAA, including the City of San Marcos, City of Uvalde, County of Uvalde, New Braunfels Utilities and Guadalupe Blanco River Authority. The City of Victoria, Past and Current Individual Members of the EAA Board of Directors, and the Texas Farm Bureau are not parties but they have filed\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. The claims:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The LULAC plaintiffs bring two causes of action challenging the current apportionment plan for the single member districts used to elect directors to the EAA. The first claim is brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; the second claim is brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201973\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, for alleged dilution of minority votes. Docket no. 38. Intervenor-Plaintiff SAWS brings only a cause of action under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (the one person, one vote claim). Docket no. 70. Both LULAC and SAWS seek declaratory and injunctive relief and a statutory award of attorneys fees and costs. Docket nos. 38, 70. The parties have agreed to stay LULAC's cause of action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and proceed with LULAC and\n   SAWS' Equal Protection claim. Docket no. 68. The motions for summary judgment address only the Equal Protection claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Summary judgment standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment is proper when the evidence shows \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

The\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of an Arizona statute providing that voting in elections for directors of an agricultural improvement and power district was limited to landowners and their voting power was apportioned based on the number of acres owned.

The District, formed as a governmental entity in 1937, subsidizes its water operations by selling electricity, and has become the supplier of electric power for hundreds of thousands of people in an area including a large part of metropolitan Phoenix. Nevertheless, the history of the District began in the efforts of Arizona farmers in the 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   century to irrigate the arid lands of the Salt River Valley, and, as the parties have stipulated, the primary purposes of the District have always been the storage, delivery, and conservation of water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   As noted by the Court of Appeals, the services currently provided by the Salt River District are more diverse and affect\n   far more people than those of the Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District. Whereas the Tulare District included an area entirely devoted to agriculture and populated by only 77 persons, the Salt River District includes almost half the population of the State, including large parts of Phoenix and other cities. Moreover, the Salt River District, unlike the Tulare District, has exercised its statutory power to generate and sell electric power, and has become one of the largest suppliers of such power in the State. Further, whereas all the water delivered by the Tulare District went for agriculture, roughly 40% of the water delivered by the Salt River District goes to urban areas or is used for nonagricultural purposes in farming areas. Finally whereas all operating costs of the Tulare District were born by the voting landowners through assessments apportioned according to land value, most of the capital and operating costs of the Salt River District have been met through the revenues generated by the selling of electric power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    451 U.S. at 357, 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Nevertheless, a careful examination of the Salt River District reveal[ed] that, under the principles of the\n   <em>\n    Avery,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hadley\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Salyer\n   </em>\n   cases, these distinctions d[id] not amount to a constitutional difference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs also make the broad assertion that the EAA has the \"power to control how property owners can use the surface of their land.\" Docket no. 168, p. 20. Again, however, the EAA imposes limited restrictions only insofar as necessary to carry out its legislative mandate to protect the aquifer from pollution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EAA Act, \u00a7\u00a7 1.08(a) (authority to \"protect the aquifer\" and \"prevent the waste or pollution of water\" in the aquifer); 1.08(c) (\"to prevent pollution and enforce water quality standards included within the authority's boundaries and within a buffer zone that includes all of the area less than five miles outside of those counties, [the EAA] shall apply pollution control regulations equally and uniformly throughout the area within the counties and the buffer zone\"); and 1.081 (\"[t]o protect the water quality of the aquifer, [the EAA] shall adopt rules regarding the control of fires in the aquifer's recharge zone\"). The rules implemented under this authority include restrictions meant to keep sources of pollution such as sewage, liquid waste, livestock or poultry yards, cemeteries, pesticide facilities, chemical storage, standing water, debris, and coal tar-based pavement away from aquifer wells and prevent spills that release into the environment within the recharge zone of the aquifer. Docket no. 119, exh. E, EAA rules. As Plaintiffs concede, the aquifer is \"highly vulnerable to contamination\" (docket no. 168, p. 20) and the EAA cannot carry out its duty to protect the aquifer without implementing specific preventive measures. But these protective measures have a special purpose and their enforcement does not equate to a general purpose governmental function. Plaintiffs further allege that the EAA performs \"classic governmental functions\" such as making rules, deciding which permits to issue, and determining penalties. Docket no. 168, pp. 21, 26-27. But this alone does not make the EAA a general purpose governmental entity. These functions are incidental to the EAA's primary purpose-to manage, protect, preserve, and conserve the water in the aquifer. It would have been meaningless for the Legislature to create the EAA without giving it the tools it needs to carry out its duties and responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The EAA is tasked with the power to carry out the legislative mandate to manage, protect, preserve, and conserve the water in the aquifer, but it does not have the authority to \"exercise the sort of governmental\n   powers that invoke the strict demands of\n   <em>\n    Reynolds.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    451 U.S. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In this case, the electoral franchise is not limited to only permit holders or landowners with wells; instead, all residents within the jurisdictional boundaries of the EAA are allowed to vote. However, the apportionment scheme for the EAA board of directors is carefully balanced to reflect the different water interests in the subregions that are disproportionately impacted by the EAA. In exercising its authority to manage the aquifer, the EAA must balance discharge and recharge, pumping and spring flow. Docket no. 119, exh. Z. The various interests, which vary by subregion, include agricultural needs, spring flow contributions, pumping demands, municipal use, industrial use, protection of threatened and endangered species, downstream protection, and recharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186170\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When it comes to municipal use, the City of San Antonio is responsible for the most discharge, but the City includes only about 0.4% of the area of the recharge zone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.

The various interests are constantly competing for this natural resource, and the decisions made by the EAA's board of directors have a disproportionate impact on voters in different counties and subregions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The EAA Act dictates how the districts are apportioned and it would not have been passed \"if it was ... a San Antonio-only bill.\" Docket no. 119, exh. E, R. Puente deposition at 58:1-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor would it have passed \"if it was too far slanted in the springs interest or the agricultural interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 93:15-94:4. There was an understanding that a balance of water interests was needed so that \"no one could control ... pumping permits, pumping withdrawals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:3-23.

This balanced approach, which took urban, agricultural, and spring\n   flow interests into account in terms of voting power on the board, was the primary focus of the Legislature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123:8-20. SAWS expressed its agreement with this balanced approach when the bill was being considered in the Legislature, as reflected in SAWS legal counsel's testimony before the Senate Natural Resource Committee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   The governing body of the board would be balanced among the regional interests ... If you compare the historical record, you can see that among aquifer beneficiaries, including the spring flow, usage is divided roughly one-third, one-third, one-third, in this fashion. Approximately one-third of the usage of this resource is by irrigated agriculture. Approximately one-third of the use of this resources is by municipal and industrial customers, primarily located in Bexar County, but spread throughout the five-county region. The remaining one-third of usage constitutes usage in the eastern counties or north eastern counties, Hays and Comal, but primarily spring discharge issuing from Comal and San Marcos springs, upon which that region and downstream users rely. The Senate Bill 1320 balances the governing board three, three, and three among those interests considering the Comal and Hays County interest as representing the spring flow requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Docket no. 119, exh. K, Senate Natural Resource Committee hearing transcript at 27:13-28:15. When the Texas Legislature amended the Act two years later, SAWS still agreed with the balanced interest approach. As Mr. Puente explained, \"[t]here will be an amendment offered that changes that elected board to a 5/7/5 board. The western counties will get an additional member, and the eastern counties will get an additional member; or the downstream people will get an additional member. Bexar County specifically will have seven members.\" Docket no. 119, exh. O, House Natural Resource Committee hearing transcript at 2:16-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Since the EAA's inception, the number of directors has changed and the original appointment scheme changed to a single member district electoral scheme, but the delicate balance of subregional interests has never changed. As cogently stated by Intervenor-Defendant NBU, \"[t]he scheme of proportional representation designed by the Legislature not only reflects the interest of the region, it was the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   for the legislative enactment required to conserve and protect the water resources of the Edwards aquifer.\" Docket no. 137, p. 3. Plaintiffs want apportionment by population rather than apportionment by subregional water interests, but population-based representation would defeat the purpose of the EAA and destroy the careful balance of interests upon which it was formed. SAWS complains that, as the largest permit holder, it bears the highest financial impact.
