In\n   <em>\n    Thales Visionix\n   </em>\n   , the patent disclosed an inertial tracking system for tracking the motion of an object relative to a moving reference frame. The system used inertial sensors and mathematical equations to track the position and orientation of the object. 850 F.3d at 1345.

However, such alarms provided audio or visual notification that may be ineffective when the user is \"operating in hectic environments ... and/or when bombarded with competing audio and/or visual stimuli.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267250\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; '299 patent at col. 1:65-col. 2:5. The '299 Patent improved the operation of these devices by adding haptic feedback, which enhances the usefulness of the devices in circumstances where audio or visual notification might not be effective. In one example described in the specification, the invention is embodied in a manual resuscitator that tracks the number of times an emergency responder has squeezed the resuscitator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '299 patent at col. 8:59-col. 10:20. \"Emergency rooms, trauma centers, ambulances, accident scenes, and other emergency environments are often chaotic and highly charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267250\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/1356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col.7:22-24.

In other words, a haptic notification overcomes the challenge of how to alert the user that a certain number of movements has been reached in environments where audio or visual notification may be ineffective.

Although claim 27 discloses a generic processor, the focus of the claim is on receiving various signals and determining resulting output signals. Specifically, the processor is configured to receive a first sensor signal related to the first device's movement, a second sensor signal related to an interaction with the first device, and a data signal from a second mobile device transmitted via a network interface. '301 patent at col. 28:26-35. Based on these signals, the processor determines a change in display and a haptic effect and then the processor outputs a haptic effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at col. 28:36-41. However, the claim does not provide any limiting rules or algorithms that describe how the processor performs these functions. The Court finds that claim 27 is thus directed to the abstract idea for two reasons, which the Court explains in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   First, the Court finds that claim 27 falls within the category of gathering and processing information, which the Federal Circuit has established is an abstract idea. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit stated that \"collecting information, including when limited to particular content (which does not change its character as information), [i]s within the realm of abstract ideas.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, the Federal Circuit has treated \"analyzing information by steps people go through in their minds, or by mathematical algorithms, without more, as essentially mental processes within the abstract-idea category.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   that claims for \"a process of gathering and analyzing information of a specified\n   content, then displaying the results,\" which did not use \"any particular assertedly inventive technology for performing those functions,\" were directed to an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    West View Research, LLC v. Audi AG\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12403990\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/685/923/#p926\">\n    685 F. App'x 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (unpublished), the Federal Circuit held that claims that \"do not go beyond receiving or collecting data queries, analyzing the data query, retrieving and processing the information constituting a response to the initial data query, and generating a visual or audio response to the initial data query\" were directed to the abstract idea of collecting and analyzing information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Here, the first three functions that the processor is configured to perform are receiving sensor and data signals. '301 patent at col. 28:26-35. This amounts to nothing more than gathering data, which is an abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elec.

The next two functions of the processor are determining a change in display signal and determining a haptic effect based on the received signals. '301 patent at col. 28:36-40. In other words, the processor receives the sensor and data signals and, presumably applying some unspecified rules or algorithms, analyzes how the display signal should change and what type of haptic effect should be produced as a result of the received signals. Without specifying what particular rules or types of rules are applied by the processor, claim 27 describes nothing more than generic data analysis.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McRO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n    837 F.3d at 1313-1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (claims relating to automating part of a 3-D animation method that are limited to the use of a specific \"genus\" of rules, rather than claiming the use of all rules, are not directed to an abstract idea at step one). Finally, the processor is configured to \"output[ ] the haptic effect.\" '301 patent at col. 28:41. It is not entirely clear from the claim itself whether the processor outputs the haptic effect or whether the processor transmits a signal to an actuator that transmits a haptic effect. The specification suggests it is the latter.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141487\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1299/#p1314\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 25:49-51 (\"Finally, the processor 110 transmits a haptic signal associated with the haptic effect to an actuator 118 configured to output the haptic effect.\"). Transmitting a signal to an actuator does not make the focus of the claim any less abstract because outputting a signal is no more than the transmission of data. Similarly, the Federal Circuit has held that displaying the results of collecting and analyzing information, without more, \"is abstract as an ancillary part of such collection and analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Elec.

The Federal Circuit held that the claims were directed to an abstract idea in part because the claims used \"result-based functional language\" such as \"converting,\" \"routing,\" \"controlling,\" \"monitoring,\" and \"accumulating records\" without \"sufficiently describ[ing] how to achieve these results in a non-abstract way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/\">\n    at 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    DIRECTV\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit held that a claim that broadly disclosed \"the function of wirelessly communicating regional broadcast content to an out-of-region recipient, not a particular way of performing that function,\" was directed to\n   an abstract idea. 838 F.3d at 1258. The Federal Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   While independent claim 1 refers to general components such as a cellular telephone, a graphical user interface, and a downloadable application, the claimed invention is entirely functional in nature. It recites software in the form of \"an application configured for execution by the wireless cellular telephone device\" that performs three functions: (1) it presents a listing of available media choices on a display on the cellular telephone; (2) it enables the telephone \"to transmit a request for the regional broadcasting channel\"; and (3) it enables the telephone \"to receive a streaming media signal in the ... device corresponding to the regional broadcasting channel\" when the device is outside the range of the regional broadcaster. There is nothing in claim 1 that is directed to\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   to implement out-of-region broadcasting on a cellular telephone.

In its step two analysis in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit reasoned that \"merely selecting information, by content or source, for collection, analysis, and display\" does not provide an inventive concept.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n    830 F.3d at 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor did the claim in\n   <em>\n    Electric Power Group\n   </em>\n   \"require a new source or type of information, or new techniques for analyzing it,\" or \"invoke any assertedly inventive programming.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349286\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1350/#p1354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Federal Circuit's analysis of the claim in\n   <em>\n    TDE Petroleum Data Solutions, Inc. v.

App'x 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2016) (unpublished), was similar. The claim in\n   <em>\n    TDE Petroleum\n   </em>\n   was drawn to an \"automated method for determining the state of a well operation\" that involved receiving signals from the well, validating the signals, and automatically selecting a state of the well operation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152270\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/657/991/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152270\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/657/991/\">\n    at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After holding at step one that the claim was directed to the abstract idea of data collection and processing, the Federal Circuit held at step two that nothing in the claim brought the claim out of the realm of the abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152270\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/657/991/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152270\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/657/991/\">\n    at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Federal Circuit wrote that any argument that there was an inventive concept in the ordered combination of the claim's steps \"would be unpersuasive given that they are the most ordinary of steps in data analysis and are recited in the ordinary order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12152270\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/657/991/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that nothing in the ordered combination of elements recited in claim 27 bring it outside the realm of the abstract idea of data collection and analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Because the Court finds at\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step one that the '301 claims are directed to an abstract idea and at step two that there is no inventive concept sufficient to save the claims, the Court concludes that the asserted '301 claims are patent-ineligible under \u00a7 101.
