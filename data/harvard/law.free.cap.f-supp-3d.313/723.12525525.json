His babysitter found him \"breathing too faintly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The babysitter repeatedly dialed 9-1-1 from her cellphone, but was placed on hold each time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Collectively, the babysitter was placed on hold for more than forty minutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Unable to connect to the 9-1-1 dispatcher, the babysitter contacted Brandon Alex's grandmother, Bridget Alex, who later drove him to an emergency room. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Unfortunately, Brandon Alex was pronounced dead soon after arriving at the hospital.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-45, 51-64). Detreasure Coker, alleged to be Brandon Alex's biological mother, also alleges wrongful death and survival claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-72). Defendants removed the case to this Court, but the case has been stayed pending the Court's resolution of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Statutory Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under Texas law, wireless service providers and manufacturers have some statutory immunity from claims arising out of their provision of 9-1-1 services under Section 771.053(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A service provider of communications service involved in providing 9-1-1 service, a manufacturer of equipment used in providing 9-1-1 service, [or] a developer of software used in providing 9-1-1 service ... is not liable for any claim, damage, or loss arising from the provision of 9-1-1 service unless the act or omission proximately causing the claim, damage, or loss constitutes gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, to qualify for statutory immunity, a defendant must be one of the covered entities involved in providing 9-1-1 services, and the claims against it must arise from the provision of 9-1-1 services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants meet both conditions. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants operate 9-1-1 communications services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18), create software used in providing 9-1-1 services, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58), or provide 9-1-1 capable cellphones, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12-13), and that their claims arise from the provision of 9-1-1 services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59 (\"The harm to Plaintiffs resulted directly from the software modifications that prevented Brandon's babysitter from reaching 9-1-1 in time to save his life.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 38-45).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the statutory immunity provided by Section 771.053(a) is not absolute. To overcome Defendants' claim of immunity, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege that Defendants proximately caused Brandon Alex's death and that Defendants' acts or omissions constituted gross negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   , 683 F. App'x at 319 (citing TEX. HEALTH &amp; SAFETY CODE \u00a7 771.053(a) ).

Similar allegations were held not sufficient in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez, Cook,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   because the chain of causation was too attenuated in those cases.

Medical personnel never checked on Sanchez's apartment. Police officers did not treat Cook's 9-1-1 call as serious and left without entering her home. The police dispatcher was required by Dallas Police Department's internal guidelines to send officers to Kelley's home, but chose not to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiffs in each case could not show that \"any of the intervening parties [i.e. the emergency responders] would have acted differently\" even if the 9-1-1 technology worked better or faster as plaintiffs allege it should have.\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   , 683 F.

His babysitter was\n   placed on hold for more than 40 minutes and never connected with any emergency responder. There is no chain of causation to analyze because there are no intervening factors. If Plaintiffs' allegations are proven, Defendants' defective 9-1-1 technology was a substantial-if not the only-factor that prevented Brandon Alex from receiving timely medical aid, and his death was a foreseeable consequence of the defect.

Many could not connect to the 9-1-1 call center at all, as a result of which Dallas residents, including Brandon Alex, allegedly did not receive timely medical treatment that could have prevented their deaths. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants knew of this risk, but failed to take any action.

Plaintiffs respond only that their allegations are sufficient to state a design defect claim. (Pl. Resp. at 23-24).
