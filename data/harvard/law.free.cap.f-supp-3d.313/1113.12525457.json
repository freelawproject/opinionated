BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Yahoo was founded in 1994 and has since grown into a source for internet searches, email, shopping, news, and many other internet services. FAC \u00b6 32. One of Yahoo's most important services is Yahoo Mail, a free email service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. Plaintiffs allege that \"[m]any users have built their digital identities around Yahoo Mail, using the service for everything from their bank and stock trading accounts to photo albums and even medical information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Yahoo also offers online services for small businesses, including website hosting and email services (hereinafter, \"Small Business Services\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Users must pay for Small Business Services, and users are required to provide credit or debit card information for automatic monthly payments for Small Business Services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to November 2015, Yahoo provided these services through a division called Yahoo Small Business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Since November 2015, Yahoo has provided its small business services through its wholly owned subsidiary Aabaco.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in order to obtain email services and Small Business Services from Defendants, users are required to provide personal identification information (\"PII\") to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. This PII includes the user's name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. For some Yahoo accounts, including the small business accounts, users are required to submit additional information, including credit or debit card numbers and other financial information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to the PII that Plaintiffs submitted directly to Defendants, Plaintiffs also allege that users used their Yahoo email accounts to send and receive a\n   variety of personal information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Each named Plaintiff alleges that he or she included sensitive information in the content of his or her Yahoo emails.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-21. The individual allegations of the named Plaintiffs, including allegations regarding the personal information that these named Plaintiffs included in their Yahoo email accounts, are discussed further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Earlier Data Security Issues Putting Yahoo on Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have a long history of data security failures that should have put Defendants on notice of the need to enhance their data security. For example, in 2008 and 2009, \"multiple hosts on Yahoo's corporate network were compromised.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. In 2010, Google notified Yahoo that attackers were using Yahoo systems to attack Google.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66. In 2011, then-Chief Information Security Officer (\"CISO\") Justin Somaini gave a presentation \"identifying gaping holes in Yahoo's data security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. In 2012, a third party informed Yahoo of a vulnerability within its system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Yahoo also experienced a breach in 2012. Although the Federal Trade Commission found as early as 2003 that \"SQL injection attacks\" were a known and preventable data security threat, \"in 2012, Yahoo admitted that more than 450,000 user accounts were compromised through an SQL injection attack-with the passwords simply stored in plain text.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78. Plaintiffs allege that according to news stories at the time, \"[s]ecurity experts were befuddled ... as to why a company as large as Yahoo would fail to cryptographically store the passwords in its database. Instead, [the passwords] were left in plain text, which means a hacker could easily read them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the 2012 hackers intended the 2012 attack as a wake-up call, and the hackers left a message stating: \"We hope that the parties responsible for managing the security of this subdomain will take this as a wake-up call, and not as a threat ... There have been many security holes exploited in Web servers belonging to Yahoo! Inc. that have caused far greater damage than our disclosure. Please do not take them lightly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. However, despite this warning, Plaintiffs allege that \"Yahoo's culture actively discouraged emphasis on data security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. Plaintiffs allege that \"former Yahoo security staffers interviewed later told Reuters that requests made by Yahoo's security team for new tools and features such as strengthened cryptography protections were, at times, rejected on the grounds that the requests would cost too much money, were too complicated, or were simply too low a priority.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Yahoo also hired security firms who identified problems with Yahoo's systems. For example, in 2012, Yahoo retained Mandiant, an outside cybersecurity firm, to perform a threat assessment; Mandiant's subsequent report detailed issues with Yahoo's security and attack groups in Yahoo's systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73, 75. Similarly, Dell SecureWorks and Leaf SR conducted security assessments at various times between 2013 and 2016 that turned up vulnerabilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84, 87-88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Three Data Breaches at Issue in the Instant Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The instant lawsuit involves three data breaches that occurred between 2013 and 2016. According to Plaintiffs, Defendants represented to users that users' accounts with Defendants were secure. For example, Yahoo's website stated that \"protecting our systems and our users' information is paramount to ensuring Yahoo users enjoy\n   a secure user experience and maintaining our users' trust\" and that \"[w]e deploy industry standard physical, technical, and procedural safeguards that comply with relevant regulations to protect your personal information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Similarly, Aabaco's website stated that \"[w]e have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect your Personal Information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Nonetheless, despite these representations, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants did not use appropriate safeguards to protect users' PII and that Plaintiffs' PII was thus exposed to hackers who infiltrated Defendants' systems. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege three separate data breaches: a breach that occurred in 2013, a breach that occurred in 2014, and a \"forged cookie breach\" that occurred in 2015 and 2016. The Court refers to these breaches collectively as the \"Data Breaches.\" The Court discusses each below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The 2013 Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The first breach occurred in August 2013 (\"2013 Breach\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133. Hackers gained access to Yahoo accounts and stole users' Yahoo logins, country codes, recovery emails, dates of birth, hashed passwords, cell phone numbers, and zip codes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. Significantly, the 2013 Breach also gave hackers access to the contents of users' emails, and thus exposed any sensitive information that users included in the contents of their emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that users used their Yahoo emails for a variety of personal and financial transactions, and thus that Yahoo email accounts contained \"credit card numbers, ... bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, passport information, birth certificates, deeds, mortgages, and contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 14, 2016, more than three years after the 2013 Breach occurred, Yahoo disclosed the 2013 Breach but underestimated its true scope.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133. Specifically, Yahoo stated that \"an unauthorized third party ... stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Almost a year later, on October 3, 2017, Yahoo announced that the 2013 Breach had actually affected\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   user account-approximately three billion, not one billion, accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-46. Plaintiffs allege that the 2013 Breach occurred because Yahoo did not timely move away from an outdated encryption technology known as MD5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. According to Plaintiffs, it was widely recognized in the data security industry long before the 2013 Breach that MD5 was \"cryptographically broken and\n   <em>\n    unsuitable for further use.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. Nevertheless, Yahoo did not begin to upgrade from MD5 until the summer of 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93. Plaintiffs allege, however, that Yahoo's move from MD5 in the summer of 2013 was too late to prevent the 2013 Breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The 2014 Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second breach occurred in late 2014 (\"2014 Breach\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102. Plaintiffs allege that \"the 2014 breach began with a 'spear phishing' email campaign sent to upper-level Yahoo employees. One or more of these employees fell for the bait, and Yahoo's data security was so lax, that this action was enough to hand over the proverbial keys to the kingdom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154 (footnote omitted). Through this attack, hackers gained access to at least 500 million Yahoo user accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, in August 2016, a hacker posted for sale on the dark web the personal information of 200 million Yahoo users.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122. Plaintiffs also allege that \"a geographically dispersed hacking group based in Eastern Europe managed to sell copies of the database to three buyers for\n   $300,000 apiece months before Yahoo disclosed the 2014 Breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Yahoo knew about the 2014 Breach as it was happening, but that Yahoo did not publicly disclose the existence of the 2014 Breach until September 22, 2016, approximately two years later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 126, 129. Plaintiffs allege that Yahoo's announcement of the 2014 Breach \"came just two months after Yahoo announced Verizon's plan to acquire its operating assets, and just weeks after Yahoo reported to the SEC that it knew of no incidents of unauthorized access of personal data that might adversely affect the potential acquisition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126. Plaintiffs allege that Yahoo delayed notifying users or the public about the 2014 Breach while \"Yahoo solicited offers to buy the company. Reportedly, Yahoo wanted the offers in by April 19, 2016,\" and thus waited to disclose the breach until September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that \"[b]y intentionally failing to disclose the breach in a timely manner as required by law, Yahoo misled consumers into continuing to sign up for Yahoo services and products, thus providing Yahoo a continuing income stream and a better chance of finalizing a sale of the company to Verizon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. In the September 22, 2016 announcement of the 2014 Breach, Yahoo stated that the affected \"account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Yahoo's claim that it had not known about the 2014 Breach for two years was \"met with immediate skepticism.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128. Indeed, in a 2016 10-K filing with the SEC, Yahoo revealed that an independent investigation determined that Yahoo had contemporaneous knowledge of the 2014 Breach, yet failed to properly investigate and analyze the breach, due in part to \"failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting\" that led to a \"lack of proper comprehension and handling\" of the 2014 Breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Forged Cookie Breach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The third data breach occurred sometime in 2015-2016 (\"Forged Cookie Breach\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117. According to the FAC, the attackers in the Forged Cookie Breach used forged cookies to access Yahoo users' accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Cookies\" are text files that Yahoo places on users' computers to store login information so that users do not need to reenter login information every time the users access their accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By forging these cookies, hackers were able to access Yahoo accounts without needing a password to the accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. Moreover, by forging cookies, hackers were able to remain logged on to accounts for long periods of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the attackers in the Forged Cookie Breach are \"thought to be the same parties involved in the 2014 Breach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that \"the hackers in the 2014 Breach used some of the data obtained in the 2014 Breach to then forge cookies, help others forge cookies, or use the cookies to gain actual access to specific accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119. \"The 2014 Breach and Forged Cookie Breach have since been attributed to two Russian FSB agents, a Russian hacker, and a Canadian hacker.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153. Plaintiffs allege that in a 2016 10-K filing with the SEC, Yahoo disclosed that an independent committee of Yahoo's Board of Directors had determined that Yahoo's information security team knew, at a minimum, about the Forged Cookie Breach as it was happening, \"but took no real action\n   in the face of that knowledge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149. Instead, Plaintiffs allege, Yahoo \"quietly divulged\" the existence of the Forged Cookie Breach in Yahoo's 10-Q filing with the SEC on November 9, 2016 and did not begin notifying users about the Forged Cookie Breach until February 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139, 142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Allegations of Individual Named Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The FAC is brought by nine named Plaintiffs on behalf of four putative classes and one putative subclass. The Court briefly discusses the allegations of these individual named Plaintiffs below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Named Plaintiffs Representing the United States Class and California Subclass\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs Kimberly Heines, Hashmatullah Essar, Paul Dugas, Matthew Ridolfo, and Deana Ridolfo (\"United States Plaintiffs\") assert claims on behalf of the putative United States Class, which consists of all free Yahoo account holders in the United States whose accounts were compromised in any of the Data Breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-22, 161. Additionally, California Plaintiffs Heines and Dugas assert claims on behalf of the putative California subclass, which consists of all California Yahoo account holders whose accounts were compromised in any of the Data Breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20, 163.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff Kimberly Heines, a resident of California, alleges that she used her Yahoo email account in conjunction with Direct Express, which is the service through which Plaintiff Heines receives her Social Security, and thus her Yahoo email account \"included ... information relating to her account with Direct Express.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. In 2015, Plaintiff Heines discovered that her monthly Social Security benefits had been stolen from her Direct Express account and used to purchase gift cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Plaintiff Heines fell behind on her bills, and she paid late fees as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the theft, Plaintiff Heines began receiving debt collection calls for debts she had not herself incurred, and she saw unfamiliar debts on her credit report, which harmed her credit score.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Heines alleges that she has spent over 40 hours dealing with the consequences of the identity theft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff Hashmatullah Essar, a resident of Colorado, used two free Yahoo email accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Plaintiff Essar used these accounts \"for all of his personal, financial, and business needs\" including receiving bank statements, applying for jobs, and securing a mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Essar began receiving \"phishing emails from a credit card company purporting to be affiliated with American Express, asking him to follow a link to log-in to his 'Serve' account,\" which Plaintiff Essar did not own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Plaintiff Essar was notified of the 2014 Breach, he signed up for and has paid $35.98 per month for LifeLock credit monitoring service.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In February 2017, \"an unauthorized person fraudulently filed a tax return under his Social Security Number,\" and in March 2017 he was denied credit and had freezes placed on his credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff Paul Dugas, a resident of California, used four Yahoo email accounts \"for his banking, investment accounts, business emails, and personal emails.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. In April 2016, Plaintiff Dugas was unable to file his personal tax return because a tax return had already been filed under his Social Security Number.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, \"both of his college-aged daughters missed deadlines to submit\" their financial aid applications, and Plaintiff Dugas was forced to pay $9,000 in educational expenses that he otherwise would not have had to pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Plaintiff Dugas has also experienced\n   numerous fraudulent charges on his credit cards, he has had to replace his credit cards, and he has had to pay money to three different credit bureaus to freeze his accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs Matthew Ridolfo and Deana Ridolfo, a married couple, are residents of New Jersey.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. They both \"used their Yahoo accounts for nearly twenty years for general banking, credit card management and communications, a mortgage refinance, and communication with friends and family.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both Plaintiffs Matthew and Deana Ridolfo experienced numerous instances of credit card fraud as a result of the Data Breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, eleven credit card or bank accounts were opened or attempted to be opened in Plaintiff Matthew Ridolfo's name, and at least eight accounts were opened or attempted to be opened in Plaintiff Deana Ridolfo's name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ridolfos experienced fraudulent charges on their credit cards.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Ridolfos eventually purchased and enrolled in LifeLock to help monitor their credit and finances, and they each pay $30.00 per month for these services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Nonetheless, as late as January 31, 2017, an unauthorized person attempted to open an additional credit card in Plaintiff Deana Ridolfo's name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

First MTD Order at 39. The Court explained that \"Plaintiffs' imminent risk of\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   costs as a result of the Data Breaches ... is not sufficient to allege 'lost money or property' under the UCL.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=246%20P.3d%20877\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot's amended allegations fare no better.

As the Court has already concluded, such reliance on the threat of future harm does not satisfy the UCL's \"lost money or property\" standing requirement. Indeed, Plaintiffs concede that, based on the Court's prior ruling, the UCL claims of Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot cannot proceed. Opp. at 4 n.6. Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion to dismiss the UCL unlawful and unfair claims of Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot. The Court dismisses with prejudice because Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot have failed to cure the deficiencies addressed in the First MTD Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court reaches a different conclusion as to Paid Users Plaintiff Mortensen. To the extent that Plaintiff Mortensen claims a \"greater risk of identity theft and other fraud,\" FAC \u00b6 28, like Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot, he has failed to allege \"lost money or property\" under the UCL. However, Plaintiff Mortensen offers further allegations beyond those of Plaintiffs Rivlin and Granot. Plaintiffs argue that these allegations establish standing under the UCL because he has alleged lost benefit of the bargain. Opp. at 4. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff Mortensen's allegations are sufficient to allege that he suffered benefit-of-the-bargain losses. In particular, Plaintiff Mortensen pleads that he has paid $19.95 each year since December 2007 for Yahoo's premium email service. FAC \u00b6 28. Defendants represented that their email services were \"secure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Plaintiff Mortensen alleges that he \"would not have provided [his] PII to Yahoo or signed up for the supposedly secure services\" had he known that Yahoo's email service was not as secure as Defendants represented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 285.

These allegations closely parallel the Small Business Users Plaintiff Neff's allegations, which the Court concluded adequately alleged lost benefit of the bargain. First MTD Order at 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants' central response is that Plaintiff Mortensen does not allege that he was deprived of the premium services for which he paid. Mot. at 6.

Ultimately, a critical question is whether the declaratory relief \"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    McGraw-Edison Co. v.

FAC \u00b6 258. Defendants argue that because \"Plaintiffs allege no additional facts or otherwise meaningfully differentiate the contract and declaratory relief claims,\" the declaratory relief claim is \"wholly redundant.\" Mot. at 15. Plaintiffs respond that the contract and declaratory relief claims are distinct. While the contract claims seek \"past damages\" for Defendants' conduct, the declaratory relief claim seeks \"a forward-looking declaration\" of the unenforceability of provisions in Defendants' Terms of Service. Opp. at 17. The Court concludes that the declaratory relief claim may move forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Based on the pleadings, the contract claims and the declaratory relief claim seek different relief. The contract claims request retrospective relief-namely, damages-for the past harms that Plaintiffs have suffered as a result of Defendants' failure to keep their promises about adequate security. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 243, 247, 254. In contrast, the declaratory relief claim asks the Court to declare that certain provisions of Defendants' Terms of Service are unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 257. Although Plaintiffs' contract claims are similarly premised on claims that those provisions are unconscionable, those arguments are merely a means to obtaining damages for the harms already suffered. A declaration of unconscionability would govern ongoing interactions between Plaintiffs and Defendants and clarify the parties' legal rights under the Terms of Service. Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' declaratory relief claim appears to serve a distinct purpose from the contract claims and thus should not be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Other courts have allowed plaintiffs to pursue declaratory relief in similar circumstances when such relief is premised on other viable claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Easysaver Rewards Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219669\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/737/1159/#p1175\">\n    737 F.Supp.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (S.D.

Cal. 2008). Indeed, one case from outside this district noted the distinction between forward-looking and retrospective relief in concluding that the plaintiff could maintain its declaratory relief claim with its breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    Kenneth F.

Fla. 2010). Many of Defendants' cited authorities are inapposite. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Solarcity Corp. v. Sunpower Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff agreed that its declaratory relief claim overlapped with its other claims, and the Court was simply faced with the question whether to dismiss with or without prejudice.

May 4, 2017). In\n   <em>\n    In re Zappos.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that a declaratory relief claim was \"on its face duplicative\" where it asked the court to declare that the defendant had violated the same state and federal laws already pled in the complaint.

Sept. 9, 2013). Here, the FAC provides a sufficient basis to conclude that the declaratory relief claim seeks something distinct from the contract claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' declaratory relief claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    E. CLRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In Count Eleven, Paid Users Plaintiff Mortensen asserts a claim against Yahoo under the CLRA, which prohibits \"unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or that results in the sale or lease of\n   goods or services to any consumer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n    Cal.

First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff Mortensen does not sufficiently allege reliance as required for a CLRA claim. Mot. at 16. Second, Defendants argue that Yahoo's email platform does not qualify as a \"good\" or \"service\" within the meaning of the CLRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Defendants first contend that Plaintiff Mortensen does not plead reliance. Mot. at 16. Specifically, Defendants fault Plaintiff Mortensen for failing to include any allegations that he \"actually read\" the alleged misrepresentations in the Terms of Service that give rise to Plaintiff Mortensen's CLRA claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs counter that Plaintiff Mortensen's claim is not premised on a misrepresentation in the Terms of Service but instead on Defendants' material omissions about the security of their databases and the resulting breaches. Opp. at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Defendants' arguments fail for familiar reasons. Like with Plaintiffs' deceit by concealment claim, Defendants point to a portion of this Court's First MTD Order where the Court required Plaintiffs to plead that they actually read and relied on Defendants' Privacy Policy. First MTD Order at 48-49. However, such an allegation was necessary in that situation because Plaintiffs' theory depended on misrepresentations in the Privacy Policy. Here, in contrast, Plaintiff Mortensen's theory is not that Yahoo made misrepresentations but instead that Yahoo was obligated to disclose certain material facts. FAC \u00b6 281. Plaintiff Mortensen alleges that Yahoo had exclusive knowledge about the inadequacy of its security and contemporaneous knowledge about the 2014 Breaches and Forged Cookie Breach but actively concealed those facts from customers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FAC supports that, had Yahoo disclosed the breaches, the significant media and expert attention would have alerted Plaintiff Mortensen and he would not have provided his PII or signed up for Yahoo's services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201770\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 4, 132, 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These allegations are sufficient to conclude that if Yahoo had disclosed the security inadequacies and breaches, Plaintiff Mortensen would have been aware and would have acted differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendants cannot overcome this conclusion by noting that they disclosed that Yahoo Mail would not necessarily be secure because \"no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\" FAC, Ex. 13, at 1. Such a disclosure does not undercut Plaintiffs' contention that Yahoo had \"exclusive knowledge of material facts not known or reasonably accessible to\" Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Collins v. eMachines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4246141\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/202/249/\">\n    202 Cal.App.4th 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20588\">\n    134 Cal.Rptr.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (2011). Nor can Yahoo escape liability just because Plaintiff Mortensen does not claim that he stopped using Yahoo Mail after learning of the breaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 28. As explained in the deceit by concealment section, Plaintiff Mortensen can simultaneously plead that he took little action after learning of the security defects but that he would have acted differently if he had been informed beforehand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 285. Thus, Plaintiff Mortensen has adequately alleged that he relied on Yahoo's omissions. The Court next turns to Defendants' broader argument that the CLRA is inapplicable because Yahoo did not provide a \"good\" or \"service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Good\" or \"Service\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Defendants next contend that Yahoo Mail is neither a \"good\" nor a \"service\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   and so does not come within the ambit of the CLRA.

Thus, the Court analyzes Defendants' motion regarding punitive damages pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Defendants advance two arguments in support of dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims to the extent those claims seek punitive damages. First, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged that an officer, director, or agent of Defendants committed an oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious act. Mot. at 28. Second, Defendants raise particular objections to certain of Plaintiffs' claims-namely, the claims for negligence, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the CRA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27. The Court first addresses Defendants' argument as to all claims, then addresses Defendants' argument as to individual claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Acts by Agent, Officer, or Director\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendants first move to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims to the extent those claims seek punitive damages on the ground that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that an officer, director, or agent committed the oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious acts. Mot. at 28. By statute, where a plaintiff proves \"by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant has been guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, the plaintiff, in addition to the actual damages, may recover [punitive] damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203294\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Nevertheless, a corporate entity cannot commit willful and malicious conduct; instead, \"the advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, ratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part of an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203294\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3294(b) ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. v. Tela Innovations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-00362-BLF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203705350\">\n    2014 WL 3705350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D. Cal. July 24, 2014) (\"[A] company simply cannot commit willful and malicious conduct-only an individual can.\"). Therefore, Plaintiffs must plead that an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendants committed an act of oppression, fraud, or malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Plaintiffs satisfy that standard by focusing on particular conduct by the CISOs. For example, then-CISO Justin Somani found \"gaping holes in Yahoo's data security\" as early as 2011, FAC \u00b6 67, and also knew about the 2014 Breach as it was happening,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104, but took no specific action in response. When Bob Lord became CISO at Yahoo in October 2015, he identified the \"security and endemic culture issues\" as a problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110. Moreover, although he was aware that a nation state actor may have been involved in the 2014 Breach and that the company's response had been to \"sweep it under the rug,\" his approach was to continue to hide it from the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 111-12. Indeed, the FAC notes that Yahoo's internal documents, including those between Bob Lord and Yahoo's general counsel, \"contradicted [Yahoo's] public statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125. When Yahoo finally revealed in its 2016 10-K filing with the SEC that it had contemporaneous knowledge of the 2014 Breach, the 10-K filing failed to mention that both Bob Lord and Yahoo's general counsel knew about the 2014 Breach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129. These circumstances make plausible Plaintiffs' claim that high-ranking executives and managers at Yahoo, including its CISO, committed oppressive, fraudulent, or malicious conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Defendants read their cited authority too broadly. In\n   <em>\n    Xerox Corp. v. Far WesternGraphics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court found the pleadings defective because the plaintiff failed to \"allege any conduct by an officer, director or managing agent of [the defendant] sufficient to support the imposition of punitive damages against [the defendant].\" No. 03-CV-4059-JF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202271587\">\n    2004 WL 2271587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 2004). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Taiwan Semiconductor\n   </em>\n   , the punitive damages allegations were insufficient because the plaintiff failed to \"include the names or titles of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual actor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203705350\">\n    2014 WL 3705350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. In contrast, Plaintiffs here include the names and titles of individual actors who are alleged to have committed malicious conduct supporting an award of punitive damages. Plaintiffs' allegations are significantly more robust than those in\n   <em>\n    Taiwan Semiconductor\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Far Western Graphics\n   </em>\n   . Plaintiffs have adequately pled that an officer, director, or managing agent of Defendants committed an act of oppression, fraud, or malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Because Defendants make no other punitive damages arguments with respect to the deceit by concealment and misrepresentation claims, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' deceit by concealment and misrepresentation claims to the extent those claims seek punitive damages. Defendants make additional arguments for dismissal of the claims for negligence, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the CRA to the extent those claims seek punitive damages. The Court therefore turns to these remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Individual Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Defendants next move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for negligence, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of the CRA to the extent those claims seek punitive damages. Mot. at 26-27. The Court addresses these individual claims one at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   First, Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for negligence. It is true that conduct which may be described as unreasonable or negligent generally\n   \"does not satisfy the highly culpable state of mind warranting punitive damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v.

Because Plaintiffs cannot pursue punitive damages for this claim as a matter of law, the Court grants dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Third, and finally, Defendants move to dismiss the California Plaintiffs' claims under the CRA. \"[W]here a statute\n   <em>\n    creates\n   </em>\n   new rights and obligations not previously existing in the common law, the express statutory remedy is deemed to be the exclusive remedy available for statutory violations, unless it is inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Brewer v.
