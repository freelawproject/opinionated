Manafort, Jr. has moved to suppress the evidence obtained when the FBI executed a search warrant issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and it seized business records contained in boxes and a filing cabinet in a self-storage unit in Alexandria, Virginia. Manafort argues that the search was unlawful because the agents entered the storage unit and looked around without a warrant the day before they presented their request for a warrant to the court. While they did not open the boxes or review the papers filed in the drawers on that day, they described the exterior of the containers they observed, including the labels on the boxes, in the warrant application. Therefore, Manafort claims, the warrantless initial entry tainted the later search of the files that was authorized by the warrant. He also argues that the warrant itself was too broad to comport with the Constitution for a number of reasons, including that it was not limited to a particular time period and it called for broad categories of financial records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant's motion will be denied. Law enforcement agents do not need a warrant to enter a location if they have voluntary consent, and they do not need to\n   have the consent of the person under investigation if they receive permission from a third party who has, or who reasonably appears to have, common authority over the place to be searched. Here, the agents obtained a copy of the lease for the storage unit. The person identified as the lessee or \"occupant\" of the storage unit was an employee of a company owned by Manafort who had a key to the premises, and he unlocked the door for the agents and gave them written permission to enter. Therefore, the preliminary inspection of the unit falls within the consent exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Furthermore, the agents did obtain a search warrant in compliance with the Fourth Amendment for the containers within the storage unit before they opened any of the boxes or drawers or examined the records inside. A review of the warrant affidavit reveals that even if the initial survey of the unit was unlawful, that finding would not invalidate the seizure of the records that was carried out in accordance with the warrant. The affidavit in support of the warrant application set out the agent's reasons to believe that Manafort had been engaged in criminal activity in the conduct of his business, and that his business records had been moved to, and remained in, the locker rented for that purpose. So, if one were to excise the challenged information from the application, and presume that the Magistrate Judge was presented with a warrant application that did not include the few paragraphs describing the contents of the storage unit and the labels on the boxes, the affidavit would still support a finding of probable cause to believe that a crime or crimes had been committed and that records related to those crimes were likely to be found in the unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Finally, the warrant was not overbroad since it called for records related to specific offenses detailed in the application and in the warrant itself. And even if this Court were to conclude that the warrant could or should be have been more tightly drawn, the agents relied in good faith on a warrant that had been reviewed and signed by a United States Magistrate Judge, and therefore, the evidence seized during the execution of the warrant should not, and will not, be excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Neither the Ninth Circuit nor the Tenth expressed reservations based on the fact that the associates in those cases rented the units at the defendants' direction; what was persuasive in each situation was the fact that each lessee could have exercised his right to enter the premises at any time, and that each had actually made use of his right of access by depositing material in the unit. Those facts are present here as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Most important, unlike the associates in\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   , the employee in this case retained possession of a key. FBI Aff. \u00b6 31. It was defendant Kim's retention of the only key to the unit that led the\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   court to characterize Wee's control over the premises as something other than \"joint control for most purposes\" under\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644616\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/105/1579/\">\n    105 F.3d at 1582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But one can easily find joint control, and therefore, actual authority, on the facts present here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the lessee of the unit here was not simply\n   an \"associate\" hired solely for the purpose of facilitating illegal activity; he was and continues to be an employee of the business, which strengthens the finding that Manafort entrusted him with control over the unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Manafort likens the situation to a search of a hotel room authorized by a hotel employee, and he points to authority that holds that the mere fact that the employee has a key to a guest's room does not establish that the employee had the right to admit others and intrude upon the guest's reasonable expectation of privacy in his room during his stay. Def.'s Mot. at 7-8; Tr. at 12, citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This precedent would have some force if the agents had gained entry through an employee of Public Storage, the owner and lessor of the storage facility on Holland Lane, which reserved its right to enter the unit under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lease \u00b6 9 (\"Right to Inspect and Repair\"). But here, the third party who granted the FBI access to the premises was the less\n   <em>\n    ee\n   </em>\n   , the individual with the right \"to use and occupy a space in the self-service storage facility.\" Lease \u00b6 1.

It was reasonable for the agent to believe that the occupant of the unit had the right to permit the inspection of the premises.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The facts that underlie the Court's view that the search was approved by a third party with authority over the premises also made it reasonable for the agent to conclude that the occupant of the unit had the authority to consent to the search, even if that conclusion was incorrect. In other words, whether he had the actual authority or not, the occupant had the apparent authority to consent, and that made the entry into the premises lawful. The touchstone for resolving a challenge to government action under the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness, and the Court finds that the agent's actions were reasonable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Manafort argues, though, that the information provided to the agent-in particular, the statement that the employee moved items into the storage unit \"at the direction of Manafort,\" FBI Aff. \u00b6 28-made the terms of the employee's control of the premises sufficiently ambiguous that it was unreasonable for the agent to conclude that the employee could grant permission to enter without additional investigation. But a common sense analysis of the situation points in the opposite direction, and the cases Manafort relies upon are not analogous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   It is worth noting that the agent's understanding was not simply derived from the unambiguous lease and the key; the other significant fact in the calculus is that the agent presented the employee with a formal consent to entry form and the employee signed it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent Form. If the person who signed the lease did not equivocate, and he did not act as if\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   perceived the situation to be ambiguous, why would it have been unreasonable for the agent to fail to treat it as if it was?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant points to\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529316,5681959\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/939/1071/\">\n    939 F.2d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Def.'s Reply at 2, but there were specific facts in the record in that case that led the D.C.

The Court of Appeals did not hold that the prosecution would have to show that the mother occupied the room for strictly personal purposes to make \"mutual use\" of it; it bemoaned the lack of any evidence that she cleaned the room, visited her son in it, or \"made use of [it] at any time\n   <em>\n    for any purpose\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Whitfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529316,5681959\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/939/1071/\">\n    939 F.2d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). By contrast, here, as in\n   <em>\n    Trotter\n   </em>\n   , the Manafort employee's \"position as lessee of the unit and his active participation in renting\n   <em>\n    and using\n   </em>\n   the facility,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743889\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/694/\">\n    483 F.3d at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added)-that is, delivering items to it and placing them inside-gave rise to a reasonable basis to conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Matlock\n   </em>\n   test had been satisfied.

This is a mischaracterization of the circumstances. The application for a warrant to search the storage unit sought the court's express permission not only to enter the unit, but to open the boxes and filing cabinet inside. The agent's application for the warrant before he did so is a manifestation of the government's adherence to the cases cited by Manafort, in which courts have recognized that an individual may have a heightened and separate expectation of privacy in a container or enclosed space that is located within otherwise shared premises.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peyton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237817,5900443\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/745/546/\">\n    745 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Donovan v.

While Griffith, the individual under investigation, lived in an apartment leased by his girlfriend, \"the warrant did not stop with any devices owned by Griffith, which already would have gone too far.

This compounded the problem the Court of Appeals had already identified that \"the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to believe that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cell phone (or other electronic device) containing incriminating information about [the defendant's] suspected offense would be found in the apartment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1279 (emphasis\n   in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1278 (\"[T]he affidavit sought, and the warrant granted, authorization to search for and seize every electronic device found in the home.
