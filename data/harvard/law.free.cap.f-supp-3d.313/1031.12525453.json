The plaintiffs allege that Whole Foods has been mislabeling certain household and body-care products that it sells as \"hypoallergenic\" despite the fact that they actually contain known allergens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs bring this suit as a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 on behalf of themselves and other consumers who bought these \"hypoallergenic\"-labeled products. They define three classes: a nationwide class, a California\n   class, and a New York class. The plaintiffs' operative Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") asserts claims for (1) breach of express warranty, (2) unjust enrichment, (3) unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201750\">\n    Cal.

The plaintiffs name as defendants (1) Whole Foods Market, Inc. (\"WFMI\"), the parent Whole Foods holding company, (2) Whole Foods Market California, Inc. (\"WFM California\"), a subsidiary that operates Whole Foods retail stores in northern California, (3) Whole Foods Market Services, Inc. (\"WFM Services\"), a subsidiary that provides various administrative services to other Whole Foods entities, and (4) Whole Foods Market Group, Inc. (\"WFM Group\"), a subsidiary that operates Whole Foods retail stores in various eastern states, including New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants move to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6). First, the defendants argue that the court does not have personal jurisdiction over the non-Californian defendants WFMI, WFM Services, and WFM Group, or over Ms. Starr's non-Californian claims, and that the court should dismiss these defendants and claims under Rule 12(b)(2). Second, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged plausible claims for false or misleading advertising or for breach of express warranty and that the court should dismiss these claims under Rule 12(b)(6). Third, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs do not have standing to pursue claims for any products other than the ones that the plaintiffs themselves purchased and that the court should dismiss these claims under Rule 12(b)(1). The defendants also move to strike allegations about products that the plaintiffs themselves did not purchase and product representations that the plaintiffs themselves did not see or rely on from the SAC under Rule 12(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court finds this matter suitable for determination without oral argument. N.D. Cal. Civil L.R. 7-1(b). The court grants the defendants' motion in part and (1) dismisses WFMI, WFM Services, and WFM Group for lack of personal jurisdiction, (2) dismisses Ms. Starr's claims for failure to state a claim against WFM California, and (3) dismisses the plaintiffs' claims for products for which they identify no ingredients (and therefore identify no allergens) for lack of standing. In all other respects, the court denies the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court denies the defendants' motion to strike. The court grants the plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint within 14 days of the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

This states a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The defendants raise a number of arguments, but none of them is availing. First, the defendants state that the two products that Ms. Kellman purchased \"do not simply say 'hypoallergenic.'

This argument fails. It is certainly plausible at the pleading stage that a reasonable customer would understand a representation that a product has been independent-lab tested and determined to be hypoallergenic to mean that the product actually\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   hypoallergenic. The defendants cite no cases that support their argument that adding the words \"[i]ndependent lab results show this [product] is\" before the word \"hypoallergenic\" somehow renders their representation less misleading if (as sufficiently alleged here) the product is in fact not hypoallergenic. If anything, saying that the \"hypoallergenic\" representation is based on lab results may make it more misleading, not less.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Clorox Consumer Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4279242\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/894/1224/#p1234\">\n    894 F.Supp.2d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1234 (N.D.

The court dismisses these claims, with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   By contrast, the court holds that the unpurchased products for which Ms. Kellman does allege ingredients are sufficiently similar to the products that Ms. Kellman bought to give rise to standing. The unpurchased body-care products-baby and kids' foaming washes, lotions, shampoos, and bubble baths-are an easier case. Like the purchased products, all are either lotions or cleansing products. All come into direct contact with the body. All bear the same representation as the purchased products: that they are \"hypoallergenic.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of them share common ingredients with the purchased products that Ms. Kellman alleges are known allergens and skin sensitizers.

Like the unpurchased body-care products, the laundry detergents bear the same \"hypoallergenic\" representation as the purchased products and share common ingredients with the purchased products that Ms. Kellman alleges are known allergens and skin sensitizers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   They differ from the purchased products in that they are not used directly on the skin or body in the same way that the purchased products are. But they are similar in that they come into contact with the skin or body (through clothes washed in those detergents), even if they are not used directly on the skin or body. Significantly, the alleged consumer injury is substantially the same as between the laundry detergents and the products Ms. Kellman bought, namely, that people buy them believing them to be hypoallergenic when in fact they contain sufficiently high concentrations of skin sensitizers that they may cause reactions in a substantial number of people when they are used. As one of the cases the defendants cite cautions, \"courts 'should not be too rigid in applying standing requirements to proposed classes.' In particular, when evaluating whether a plaintiff has standing to sue on behalf of others who have suffered similar, but not identical injuries, ... [courts] must be careful not to employ too narrow or technical an approach.
