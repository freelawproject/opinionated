San Diego Municipal Code (\"SDMC\") \u00a7 33.3601.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A police permit is required to operate an adult entertainment establishment or perform as an adult entertainer. (SDMC \u00a7\u00a7 33.3603 &amp; 33.3604.) Section 33.0103 (the \"Inspection Provision\") confers authority on police officers to inspect police-regulated businesses, including adult entertainment establishments.

(Doe Compl. at 3; Tanya A. Compl. at 4.) The officers interrogated the entertainers and photographed each in a nearly nude state claiming they had to document their tattoos. (Doe Compl. at 3-4; Tanya A. Compl. at 4-5.) The entertainers who objected to detention or photographs were threatened with arrest, and armed officers were posted at the doors to prevent the entertainers from leaving. (Doe Compl. at 3-4; Tanya A. Compl. at 4-5.) They were detained for one hour or more. (Doe Compl. at 4; Tanya A. Compl. at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these incidents, two nearly identical actions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were filed in state court alleging violation of federal constitutional rights, as well as other causes of action. Defendants removed both actions to this Court based on federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1441.

(Doe Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35 &amp; 129-32; Tanya A. Compl. \u00b6 36.) In their opposition, Defendants counter that \"the Court cannot grant the motion[s] given that there are clearly multiple factual disputes by and between the parties as to how the inspections at issue were conducted.\" (Opp'n, 14cv1941, doc. no. 70 (\"Opp'n\") at 3.) \"A facial challenge is an attack on a statute itself as opposed to a particular application.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v.

Defendants' denials and admissions of Plaintiffs' factual allegations regarding the searches conducted at Cheetahs and Expose are irrelevant to the facial attack claims. In their answers, Defendants do not dispute this. They assert that the facial attack allegations \"contain[ ] legal conclusions, legal argument, and questions of law to be determined solely by the Court, to which no response is required.\" (Ans. to Pl.'s First Am.

They proffer this contention in a conclusory fashion without argument to show how any of their defenses could defeat Plaintiffs' facial attack. (Opp'n at 2-3.) Upon review of the operative answers in both actions, none of the affirmative defenses\n   is sufficient to preclude deciding Plaintiffs' motions on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants raised lack of subject matter jurisdiction and standing as affirmative defenses.

Defendants' argument that there is a factual dispute whether Plaintiffs' constitutional rights were violated during the searches at issue (Opp'n at 3) is irrelevant to the facial attack claims as well as to Plaintiffs' standing to assert them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants also alleged failure to state a claim. (Doe Ans. \u00b6 136; Tanya A. Ans. at 37 \u00b6 2.) They had moved twice for dismissal on this ground in each case, and the Court issued orders which allowed the facial attack claims to proceed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   case no. 14cv1941 docs. no. 18 &amp; 35; case no. 14cv1942 docs. no. 11 &amp; 23.) The affirmative defenses of failure to state a claim therefore do not preclude Plaintiffs' motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller Fin., Inc. v.

(Doe Ans. \u00b6 147; Tanya A. Ans. at 38 \u00b6 13.) Affirmative defenses are subject to the pleading requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    Heller Fin.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536752\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/1286/#p1294\">\n    883 F.2d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants alleged no facts in support of their defense, and asserted no argument in the opposition brief. Defendants' answers with their bare legal\n   conclusions are insufficient to preclude ruling on the merits of Plaintiffs' motions. Moreover, Plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief as remedies for their claims. (Doe Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 131-32; Tanya A. Compl. at 17 \u00b6 1.) The conclusory defense that Plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief is a variant of Defendants' contention in their answers that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim, and is insufficient for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, in their opposition Defendants referenced statute of limitations, res judicata and qualified immunity as affirmative defenses.
