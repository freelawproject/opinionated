The trial court concluded that these factors could be considered in determining the results of such examinations and rendered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The plaintiffs are members of the permanent staff of the fire department in the taxation district. The defendants are the chief of the department, the three members of the board of fire commissioners and the personnel director for the state. The personnel director conducted an examination to set up a list of eligible candidates for the position of assistant fire chief, which was vacant. He professes to have acted under the provisions of, and in conformity with, No. 262 of the 1957 Special Acts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 Spec. Laws 356. Prior to the passage of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>act, vacancies in the permanent staff could be filled only as the result of an open competitive examination conducted by a committee of three citizens selected by the board of fire commissioners. 22 Spec. Laws 798, No. 399, \u00a7 7. This section of the law was superseded by 1957 Special Act No. 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The plaintiffs, since they withdrew the first count of their complaint, which sought an injunction, have not questioned the authority of the personnel director to conduct the examination. Nor have they made an issue of the assumption by the board of fire commissioners of the duties of the personnel director when the board appointed a committee of three persons to set up the qualifications for the examination. The report of this committee was promulgated by the personnel director as the schedule determining the duties and qualifications of the appointee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the evaluation of the factors upon which the results of the examination were to be based. A written and an oral examination were each to eount as 40 per cent of the result; 10 per cent was allotted to service efficiency and 10 per cent to seniority. These last two factors are the precipitants of this action. Service efficiency was to be determined by adding the departmental efficiency rating to an established norm of 70 per cent; seniority credit was to be determined by adding 1 per cent for each year of service on the permanent staff to a norm of 70 per cent. Service efficiency ratings of members of the department by their superior officers had not been made or kept prior to the compilation of the schedule for the examination and the announcement of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">No. 262 of the 1957 Special Acts is vague and uncertain. While it directs the state personnel department and its director to conduct all examinations held pursuant to the act, it establishes no standards or principles to guide the department in executing this legislative directive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>126 Conn. 623, 628, 13 A.2d 586; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 655, 116 A.2d 420. The act did not incorporate by reference or otherwise the provisions of the General Statutes on the nature and conduct of examinations which apply to state employees under the merit system; \u00a7\u00a75-25, 5-26, 5-27; nor those governing municipal employees where a local merit system has been adopted. \u00a77-413. As the examination for assistant fire chief is the first since the passage of the act, the only standards governing the examination are to be found in subdivision (e) of the act, that is, the last sentence. It provides that the examination must be competitive and open to all members of the permanent staff who have held the status of first-grade fire fighter for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>two years. This requirement renders inapplicable in this examination the provision in subdivision (b) of the act that in promotional examinations one year\u2019s service in the rank next below that for which the examination is taken is a prerequisite. And it also shows that the legislature did not make provision for consideration of seniority. The examination must be open to all who are able to meet the minimum requirements for candidates; <em>Almassy </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Civil Service Commission, </em>34 Cal. 2d 387, 398, 210 P.2d 503; and competitive in that it has to employ an objective standard or measure. <em>Matter of Fink </em>v. <em>Finegan, 270 N.Y. </em>356, 361, 1 N.E.2d 462. Service efficiency ratings worked up for the occasion of the examination not only inject a subjective feature into it but destroy the open competitive feature the legislature sought to ensure.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Under the limitations of subdivision (e), service efficiency and seniority should not have been included as factors to be considered in weighing the competence of the candidates for the post of assistant fire chief, and they should be eliminated in computing the standings of the eligible candidates. That portion of the prayer for a declaratory judgment which seeks advice as to the proper conduct of future examinations should not be answered. It concerns contingencies involving unknown and unascertainable candidates, and therefore the subject is not a proper one for a declaratory judgment at this time. Practice Book \u00a7 277(a), (b), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\u201c[Spec.
