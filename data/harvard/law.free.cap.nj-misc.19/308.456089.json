Slone of the separate defenses is involved on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The proofs for plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s signature as maker of the note was admitted; that plaintiff advanced the sum of $590 for the note to Jacob Weinberg, the payee whose name was endorsed on the back of the note; that the note was offered and received in evidence; and that there was due on said note the sum of $590'plus interest from its- date, amounting to $224.85, or a total of $834.85. Jacob Weinberg is not a party to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Defendant moved for a nonsuit. The ground urged in support of that motion was that plaintiff had failed to prove the signature of Jacob Weinberg, the payee and endorser. Defendant relied upon the cases of <em>Van Syckel </em>v. <em>Egg Harbor Coal and Lumber Co., </em>109 <em>N. J. L. </em>604; 162 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>627; 85 <em>A. L. R. </em>300, and <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Ollendorf, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>404; 189 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>82. The trial judge granted the motion and judgment of nonsuit was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Thereafter the trial judge on plaintiff\u2019s timely application granted a rule to show cause why the judgment entered should not be set aside and a new trial granted. The ground in support of that rule was that the jrrdgment was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The trial judge by his order under date of June 7th, 1940, without opinion, made the rule absolute and ordered the case be set down for a new trial. It is from that order that the present appeal is taken. Since Jacob Weinberg was not a party to this suit his signature was not put in issue. Hor did the general denial have that effect. <em>Cf. Mechanics Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>374, 376; 184 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>744. See Supreme Court rule 58. The authenticity of Jacob Weinberg\u2019s signature, therefore should have been taken as admitted. <em>R. S. </em>2:98-3; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2:98-3. But be all this as it may, the trial judge had full control over his judgment. Upon timely application and sufficient cause shown, he could, as he did, in the exercise of his sound discretion grant a new trial. <em>Cf. Dorman </em>v. <em>Usbe Building and Loan Association, </em>115 <em>N. J. L. </em>337, 340; 180 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>413, 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">This brings up plaintiff\u2019s motion in case number seven to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal. Two grounds are urged in support of that motion. The first is that the appeal was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>properly perfected and the second (the only one argued) is that no appeal lies from the \u201cjudgment\u201d (inaccurately referred to as \u201cverdict\u201d in the rule to show cause) granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Until there is a final judgment, no appeal lies therefrom. <em>R. S. </em>2:27-349. The order'under review is not a final judgment. It is an order which clearly rests upon the exercise of the sound discretion by the trial judge. Defendant does not go without day and no abuse of discretion is made to appear. <em>Cf. Heuser </em>v. Rothenberg, 123 <em>N. J. L. </em>319; 8 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>391. No appeal, therefore, lies from the order under review. <em>Benz </em>v. Miller, 12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>630; 174 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>167; <em>Kople </em>v. <em>Zalon, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>422; 5 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>570.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Accordingly the motion in ease number seven is granted. The appeal in case number six is dismissed. Costs to abide the re-trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
