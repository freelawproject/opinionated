J.</author>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Defendant and the state have filed a joint motion to remand this case to the trial court for entry of an amended judgment deleting, as a condition of defendant\u2019s probation, a requirement that he complete a sex offender treatment program. We grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In the cases underlying this consolidated appeal, defendant was convicted of giving false information to a police officer and failing to perform the duties of a driver. He was placed on probation. The state moved to revoke defendant\u2019s probation when he failed to complete sex offender treatment directed by his probation officer. The trial court treated the state\u2019s motion to revoke as a motion to modify defendant\u2019s probation and ordered defendant to complete sex offender treatment. Defendant appeals from the order imposing that condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">We accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court erred in imposing the sex offender treatment requirement either as a general or a special condition of probation. Although, in 1990, defendant was convicted <em>in Colorado </em>of sexual assault, the court could not impose sex offender treatment as a general condition of probation because defendant was not \u201cpreviously convicted of, a sex offense <em>under ORS 163.305 to 163.467 </em>* * *.\u201d ORS 137.540(1)(m) (emphasis added). Moreover, the court was not authorized to impose sex offender treatment as a special condition of probation because defendant was not convicted in the present cases of a sex offense or an offense that may have involved a sexual purpose. <em>See State v. Mack, </em>156 Or App 423, 427, 967 P2d 516 (1998) (holding that the imposition of a \u201csex offender package\u201d as a special condition of probation under ORS 137.540(2) requires such a showing).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Order modifying probation vacated; remanded for entry of amended judgment deleting condition of probation requiring sex offender treatment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
