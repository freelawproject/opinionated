J.</author>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The state appeals pretrial orders suppressing evidence of a marijuana grow operation in the basement of a business operated by defendants Paul Arthur Makuch and Leigh Ann Riesterer. ORS 138.060(1)(c). The trial court concluded that ORS 9.695(1) and (4) required suppression. As explained below, we hold that neither that statute nor Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution compels suppression. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are complex and involve three separate searches that occurred on the same day, July 7,1998: (1) the search of the residence of Jeffrey Husk in Portland; (2) the subsequent search of the residence of defendants\u2019 attorney, Lawrence Neal, in Vancouver, Washington, including the search of Neal\u2019s organizer/day planner, which disclosed defendants\u2019 names and addresses; and, finally, (3) the search of defendants\u2019 place of business in Milwaukie, Oregon, which revealed a marijuana grow operation. We describe the searches in sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">On July 7, 1998, Officer Brian Schmautz of the Portland Police Bureau sought and obtained a warrant to search Husk\u2019s home in Portland. The affidavit in support of the warrant revealed that Schmautz had received information from an informant who had seen marijuana growing at Husk\u2019s residence. The informant told Schmautz that Husk had said that he had a partner and was involved in marijuana distribution. The informant also told Schmautz that Husk had told him that his partner would be coming to Husk\u2019s residence. Thereafter, the informant saw only one person visit the residence and wrote down the Washington state license plate number of that visitor. After the visitor left, Husk told the informant that the visitor was his partner, Larry, an attorney in Vancouver, and stated that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>traded marijuana cuttings with his partner. Schmautz determined that the license plate was for a vehicle registered to Lawrence Neal of Vancouver, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Schmautz went to Husk\u2019s home and talked with Husk, who eventually led Schmautz to his garage, where Schmautz observed marijuana leaves and potting soil from marijuana plants. Schmautz asked Husk for consent to search his home, and Husk responded that he could not allow a search unless he contacted his friend and attorney, Larry Neal. Schmautz then obtained a warrant to search Husk\u2019s residence, and the ensuing search yielded numerous marijuana plants, as well as a recent telephone bill that showed a call to \u201cL. Neal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Meanwhile, Schmautz had contacted Detective Charles Drake of the Clark County, Washington, Sheriffs Office concerning Lawrence Neal. Drake applied for a warrant to search Neal\u2019s home in Vancouver for marijuana plants and related evidence. In his affidavit, Drake recounted information that he had obtained from Schmautz concerning the informant\u2019s conversations with Husk and the informant\u2019s observation of the Washington license plate. Drake\u2019s affidavit also stated that marijuana had been found in a search of Husk\u2019s residence. Finally, Drake\u2019s affidavit indicated that he had sought and received records showing that the amount of electricity used in Neal\u2019s home was significantly greater than the amount used by the previous occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">While waiting for the Washington magistrate to issue the warrant, Drake received word that Husk, who was in custody, was going to be given the opportunity to make an outside call. Because he was concerned that Husk would call Neal and warn him, Drake ordered police officers to \u201csecure\u201d Neal\u2019s residence pending issuance of a warrant. Those officers entered Neal\u2019s house and discovered a marijuana grow operation before the magistrate issued the warrant. The issuing magistrate was not informed, before he issued the warrant, that officers had already invaded the premises and, in doing so, had already discovered a marijuana grow operation without the benefit of a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Thereafter, Schmautz arrived at Neal\u2019s residence and assisted the Washington officers with the execution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the warrant. Neal admitted to the police that he grew and sold marijuana. When Drake told Neal that his home was being searched because Portland police had just served a warrant on one of his \u201cOregon associates,\u201d Neal hung his head and then blurted out, \u201cPaul and Leigh Ann.\u201d Neal said that he had known \u201cPaul and Leigh Ann\u201d since their arrest in Multnomah County for growing marijuana several years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">As the search progressed, Schmautz discovered Neal\u2019s \u201cpersonal organizer\u201d in an upstairs bedroom. That \u201corganizer\u201d was a zippered, book-sized looseleaf binder, which was clearly marked on the first page: \u201cATTORNEY/ CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVILEGE CLAIMED ON ALL CONTENTS.\u201d The personal organizer contained an address section that listed several \u201cPauls\u201d and \u201cLeigh Anns\u201d or \u201cLeanns,\u201d but only one \u201cPaul\u201d and one \u201cLeigh Ann\u201d \u2014 these defendants \u2014 who shared the same addresses. One of those addresses was a T-shirt business in Milwaukie, Oregon. Shortly thereafter, Neal admitted to Drake that \u201cPaul and Leigh Ann\u201d had a grow operation in Clackamas County in the previous year and that he had sold them marijuana recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Schmautz and another officer went to defendants\u2019 T-shirt shop in Milwaukie at about 3:30 on the afternoon of July 7. They approached the open front door of the shop. Once inside, they passed a sign that said, \u201cPrinting in Progress, Please Do Not Disturb,\u201d and another sign that said, \u201cAuthorized Personnel Only,\u201d which may have been obscured by garments. They approached defendants, asking if they knew Husk or Neal. Defendants denied knowing either. The officers then told defendants that they had information of a marijuana grow and asked to look around. Defendants consented. In the backroom of the shop, Schmautz smelled what he recognized as the odor of growing marijuana. When asked about the basement, defendants denied that they had access to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Schmautz then spoke with the owner of the business next door, who said that defendants did have access to the basement. Schmautz also called defendants\u2019 landlord, who verified that defendants were the tenants of the basement as well. Schmautz then returned to the T-shirt shop and asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to do a more thorough search. At that point, defendant Riesterer became agitated and insisted that the police leave. Schmautz told defendants that he would take them into custody if they ordered him out of the shop and further stated that he would attempt to get a search warrant. Defendant Makuch then showed the officers around again and, after smelling marijuana in a darkroom, Schmautz lifted up a carpet and saw a quarter- to half-inch long piece of marijuana leaf near a trap door to the basement. Electrical cords also appeared to lead to the basement. When defendants continued to deny that they had access to the basement, Schmautz left to obtain a search warrant, leaving several other officers in the shop. The ensuing search of the basement under the T-shirt shop revealed more than 40 growing marijuana plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Defendants were charged in Clackamas County with manufacture, delivery, and possession of a controlled substance. ORS 475.992. Neal was charged in Clark County, Washington, with crimes relating to the marijuana grow operation found in his residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Neal moved in Clark County Superior Court to suppress the fruits of the search of his home. The superior court concluded that the Washington officers\u2019 actions in securing Neal\u2019s residence before the warrant was issued was an unlawful search, but that the evidence inevitably would have been discovered once the warrant had been executed. However, the court further concluded, under the Washington Constitution, that probable cause was lacking: \u201cThe affidavit contains no factual information establishing a nexus of criminal activity to any particular residence except Jeffrey Husk\u2019s. There is no factual basis isolating criminal activity to Larry Neal\u2019s home.\u201d In so holding, the court noted that Drake had failed to follow the correct statutory procedure for procuring power consumption records \u2014 but concluded that, even if the power consumption records were considered, probable cause did not exist to search Neal\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">After the Washington trial court ruled, defendants in this case moved to suppress evidence of the marijuana and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>other evidence seized from their T-shirt shop and to controvert the affidavit in support of the warrant. Defendants argued, as pertinent here, that the evidence was obtained through exploitation of the previous unlawful search of Neal\u2019s residence in Vancouver. In so moving, defendants relied not only on Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution but also on ORS 9.695. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201c(1) Notwithstanding ORS 133.535, the files, papers, effects or work premises of a lawyer relating to the provision of legal service by the lawyer shall not be subject to search or seizure by any law enforcement officer, either by search warrant or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201c(2) The provisions of subsection (1) of this section do not apply where there is probable cause to believe that the lawyer has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201c(3) As used in this section, lawyer\u2019 means a member of the Oregon State Bar or a person licensed to practice law in any court of this state or any court of record of the United States or of any state, territory or other jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201c(4) Evidence or the fruits thereof obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in any criminal or civil action or proceeding, except for an action or suit brought for violation of this section or the rights protected thereby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The state responded by conceding that \u201cpolice acted unlawfully in their search of Larry Neal\u2019s residence in Washington.\u201d The state argued, however, that that illegality was irrelevant to any issue in this case because defendants lacked a protected privacy interest in Neal\u2019s residence or in his organizer. The state further contended that the Washington court\u2019s ruling was not dispositive of the question of the applicability of the exception contained within ORS 9.695(2) concerning probable cause to believe that a lawyer has committed a crime. Finally, the state argued that, given the later-enacted ORS 136.432,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 9.695(4) did not authorize suppression of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The trial court initially denied defendants\u2019 motions in part, on the ground that they had no privacy interest in Neal\u2019s personal organizer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, the court reconsidered that decision in light of <em>State v. Thompson-Seed, </em>162 Or App 483, 986 P2d 732 (1999), in which we held that ORS 136.432 was intended to constrain courts from creating new rules of exclusion, and was not intended to repeal existing statutory rules of exclusion. After we issued <em>Thompson-Seed, </em>defendants argued that ORS 9.695(4) contained an express exclusionary rule that was not abrogated by ORS 136.432. The trial court agreed and ordered suppression under ORS 9.695(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">On appeal, the parties raise a dazzling, and potentially bewildering, array of ingenious interlocking statutory and constitutional arguments and responses. Some of those contentions are properly preserved and presented for our consideration. Many are not. Stripped to its essentials, however, the case reduces to two fundamental issues: Does ORS 9.695(4) compel suppression? If not, is suppression otherwise required on constitutional grounds?</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As explained below, we answer both of those questions in the negative. Defendants are not entitled to suppression pursuant to ORS 9.695(4) because, at the time Schmautz opened and inspected Neal\u2019s organizer, discovering defendants\u2019 names and addresses, police had probable cause to believe that Neal had committed a crime. <em>See </em>ORS 9.695(2). Further, defendants were not entitled to suppression under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution because they had no constitutionally cognizable protected privacy interest either in their attorney\u2019s residence or in the information\u2014 their names and addresses \u2014 found in Neal\u2019s organizer. Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 cross-assignment of error concerning the lawfulness of the initial police entry into their business premises and the validity of their consent to the search of the premises. Consequently, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We begin with the statutory argument. The state contends that ORS 9.695 does not require suppression for a variety of reasons, including (1) ORS 9.695 applies only to protect \u201cconfidential\u201d information, and defendants\u2019 names and addresses were not \u201cconfidential\u201d; and (2) regardless of whether the statute would otherwise encompass the search of Neal\u2019s organizer, including defendants\u2019 names and addresses, this case falls within the statutory exception to protection because there was probable cause to believe that Neal was engaged in criminal activity. ORS 9.695(2). We do not address and resolve the first contention in this context because the second is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Before addressing the particular facts establishing probable cause for purposes of ORS 9.695(2), we emphasize that the referent for that statutory \u201cprobable cause\u201d inquiry materially differs from the generic criminal probable cause inquiry. Under the criminal law generally, before an item can be lawfully searched and seized, there must be probable cause to believe that the item itself is evidence of a crime or is contraband. Conversely, under the exception described in ORS 9.695(2), the files, papers, and effects of an attorney are not subject to the protections of ORS 9.695(1) and (4) if there is probable cause to believe that the <em>lawyer </em>has been, is, or is about to be, engaged in criminal activity. Thus, subsection (2) focuses the probable cause inquiry on the lawyer, and not on the item that is searched and seized. Most simply, a lawyer\u2019s papers and effects are not subject to protection under subsection (1) and (4) if there is probable cause to believe that the lawyer has committed a crime <em>even if there is no probable cause that those papers or effects will yield evidence of that crime or any other crime.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">That is not to say, of course, that there are not other grounds or mechanisms for suppressing a lawyer\u2019s papers or effects if such items are searched and seized <em>solely </em>on the basis that probable cause exists that the lawyer is criminally involved. For example, if a lawyer\u2019s papers and effects are searched without probable cause that those items themselves contain evidence of a crime, the results of that search might be suppressed on the basis of Article I, section 9, or the Fourth Amendment. <em>See </em>ORS 133.673. Such evidence might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>also be subject to exclusion at trial on the basis of attorney-client privilege. <em>See </em>OEC 503. But that evidence cannot be suppressed <em>pursuant to ORS 9.695(1) and (4).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">With the statute so understood, the question presented here is not whether there was probable cause to search Neal\u2019s residence or his personal organizer, but whether, at the time of that search, there was probable cause to believe that Neal had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. ORS 9.695(2). There was.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On appeal, the state makes two related arguments as to the existence of probable cause before Schmautz opened and read Neal\u2019s organizer. First, the state asserts that the evidence obtained solely as a result of the Husk search established probable cause that Neal had engaged in, or was engaging in, criminal conduct. That is, probable cause for purposes of ORS 9.695(2) existed even before the initial entry into Neal\u2019s home, without reference to the fruits of the Washington search. Second, the totality of the evidence from the search at Neal\u2019s home, including conversations with Neal, up to the point that Schmautz searched the organizer, established probable cause that Neal had committed or was committing a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We do not address the state\u2019s first argument because it was not raised before the trial court. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Pfaff, </em>164 Or App 470, 480 n 6, 994 P2d 147 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>331 Or 193 (2000) (\u201c[Although it is axiomatic that we may affirm on grounds not argued to the trial court, there is no authority for the proposition that, without invoking \u2018plain error,\u2019 we can <em>reverse </em>the trial court on grounds not argued to it.\u201d (emphasis in original)). However, the state\u2019s second argument was preserved and is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The state asserts, particularly, that, at the time Schmautz searched the organizer, he had probable cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>believe that Neal had committed a crime because, by then, marijuana had been found in Neal\u2019s home and Neal had admitted to selling marijuana. Defendants respond that the Washington trial court\u2019s determination that the entry into Neal\u2019s home was unlawful under Washington law effectively precludes Oregon courts from considering information gained from that search in determining whether there was probable cause for purposes of ORS 9.695(2). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Defendants first posit that \u201cissue preclusion\u201d bars the \u201crelitigation\u201d of the issue. That argument fails because the issue here was not identical to the issue in the Washington proceedings. <em>See generally Drews v. EBI Companies, </em>310 Or 134, 139-40, 795 P2d 531 (1990) (describing issue preclusion requirements). Here, the question is whether there was probable cause for purposes of ORS 9.695(2) that <em>Neal </em>had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime. The question before the Washington court was whether probable cause existed to search Neal\u2019s <em>home. </em>While there is some overlap, those issues are by no means identical.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Underlying defendants\u2019 arguments is the broader premise that information obtained in violation of Washington law cannot be considered in determining probable cause for purposes of ORS 9.695(2). That premise is invalid. As defendants correctly point out, the state failed to preserve any argument that the validity of the Washington warrant should have been determined under <em>Oregon </em>constitutional law. However, it does not follow that the application of Washington constitutional principles by a Washington court to a particular search has any relevance to an Oregon court\u2019s later determination of whether the \u201cattorney crime\u201d exception in ORS 9.695(2) applies to the same set of facts, albeit in the context of a different legal issue concerning different defendants. Defendants cite no authority for their implicit premise, and we are aware of none. Indeed, the law is generally to the contrary. <em>See generally </em>1 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 1.5(c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>144-55 (3d ed 1996) (discussing interstate variations on the now-defunct \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine and concluding that evidence obtained in violation of the law of one state is not rendered inadmissible in another state based solely on that violation).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">The application of ORS 9.695(2) to these facts is straightforward. A lawyer\u2019s \u201cpapers\u201d are removed from the protection of ORS 9.695(1) if there is \u201cprobable cause to believe that the lawyer has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime.\u201d ORS 9.695(2). At the time Schmautz searched Neal\u2019s personal organizer \u2014 which constitutes \u201cpapers\u201d for purposes of ORS 9.695(1) \u2014 he was aware that marijuana had been found growing in Neal\u2019s residence and that Neal had admitted to growing and selling marijuana, a crime under Washington law. <em>See </em>ROW 69.50.401. That the information establishing Neal\u2019s criminal involvement had been obtained in violation of Washington law did not alter the fact that, at the time Schmautz read the organizer, he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d for purposes of ORS 9.695(2) to believe that Neal had committed a crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In sum, Neal\u2019s personal organizer was not protected by ORS 9.695(1). Consequently, the trial court erred in determining that the evidence gained as a result of the search of Neal\u2019s personal organizer must be suppressed under ORS 9.695(1) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number> That conclusion does not end our analysis. In response to the state\u2019s arguments, both defendants assert an alternative basis for affirmance \u2014 that, even if the trial court erred in suppressing the evidence based on ORS 9.695, they nonetheless were entitled to suppression of the evidence because it was the fruit of an <em>unconstitutional </em>search of Neal\u2019s personal organizer. As noted above, the state conceded in the trial court that the Washington search was properly ruled unconstitutional under Article I, section 7, of the Washington Constitution. Thus, we assume for purposes of this case that the search of Neal\u2019s residence and of his personal organizer were unconstitutional under the Washington Constitution. Nevertheless, as explained above, a violation of the Washington Constitution does not provide a basis for suppressing evidence in an Oregon criminal proceeding. However, <em>Oregon </em>constitutional protections apply to evidence used in Oregon criminal proceedings that was gathered in other states. <em>See generally State v. Davis, </em>313 Or 246, 834 P2d 1008 (1992) (discussed in note 7, above).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Thus, for defendants to prevail on their alternative basis for affirmance, they must establish that the evidence gained as a result of the search of Neal\u2019s personal organizer violated their rights under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state contends that defendants had no protected privacy interest in the information pertaining to them \u2014 -defendants\u2019 names and home and business addresses \u2014 that was noted in Neal\u2019s personal organizer. In that connection, the state invokes <em>Little v. Dept. of Justice, </em>130 Or App 668, 674, 883 P2d 272, <em>rev den, </em>320 Or 492 (1994), in which we held that the attorney-client privilege, OEC 503, codified the common-law rule that, \u201cabsent peculiar circumstances, the attorney-client privilege did not shield the identities of clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">We appreciate that the scope of constitutional protection under Article I, section 9, for information in an attorney\u2019s possession is not <em>necessarily </em>congruent with the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>attorney-client privilege. Nevertheless, the latter is, at least, instructive with respect to the former. <em>See generally State v. Campbell, </em>306 Or 157, 170, 759 P2d 1040 (1988) (\u201cOne explanation for the absence of a constitutionally protected interest against certain forms of government scrutiny may be the absence of any freedom from those forms of scrutiny in society at large\u201d). Consequently, we conclude that, given the general principle expressed in <em>Little, </em>in the absence of \u201cpeculiar circumstances,\u201d a person has no constitutionally protected privacy interest in the listing of his or her name in an attorney\u2019s identification of clients. We need not explore the contours of the \u201cpeculiar circumstances\u201d exception to that principle because defendants do not contend here that their identities were somehow less susceptible to scrutiny than the names of clients generally. In sum, Schmautz\u2019s search of Neal\u2019s organizer did not invade any constitutionally protected privacy interest with respect to defendants\u2019 names.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We further conclude that the same operative principle controls with respect to the disclosure of a client\u2019s home or business address, as memorialized in an attorney\u2019s papers or effects. That is, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, a home or business address is assumed to be \u201cnonprivate.\u201d In general, home and business addresses are easily obtainable and available to the general public. That is not to say that there are not, and cannot be, circumstances in which a client wishes to maintain the confidentiality of his or her address,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> but \u2014 as with client names \u2014 those circumstances are properly understood to be the exception, not the rule. Here, there is no showing of any exceptional circumstance in relation to defendants\u2019 names or the address of their T-shirt shop. Consequently, Schmautz\u2019s discovery of defendants\u2019 names and home and business addresses in Neal\u2019s organizer did not invade any constitutionally protected privacy interest in that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Schmautz\u2019s discovery of defendants\u2019 names and addresses did not violate defendants\u2019 rights under ORS 9.695 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>or Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Consequently, Neal\u2019s subsequent disclosure to Schmautz that defendants\u2019 marijuana grow operation was located at their Milwaukie business address was not the unlawfully exploited product of any prior illegality. <em>See generally State v. Hall, </em>183 Or App 48, 50 P3d 1258 (2002) (reiterating adherence to exploitation test described in <em>State v. Stanley, </em>139 Or App 526, 534, 912 P2d 948 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>325 Or 239, 935 P2d 1202 (1997)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nor, by the same reasoning, was the Oregon officers\u2019 ultimate search of defendants\u2019 business and discovery of the marijuana grow operation the product of any prior illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Finally, defendants cross-assign error to the trial court\u2019s determinations that Schmautz\u2019s initial entry into their T-shirt shop was lawful and that their consent to search was valid. We reject that cross-assignment of error without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Orders of suppression reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\"> The trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on us if there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support those findings. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993). We review to determine whether the trial court applied legal principles correctly to the facts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> The record does not disclose what charges, if any, were filed against Husk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\"> ORS 136.432 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cA court may not exclude relevant and otherwise admissible evidence in a criminal action on the grounds that it was obtained in violation of any statutory provision unless exclusion of the evidence is required by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201c(1) The United States Constitution or the Oregon Constitution!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> At the same time, the trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence seized from their automobile.

Davis, </em>313 Or 246, 834 P2d 1008 (1992), corroborates our conclusion that Washington law is not relevant to our analysis. In <em>Davis, </em>the question was whether the trial court properly suppressed evidence gained in the course of a Missouri search. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">\u201cIf the government seeks to rely on evidence in an Oregon criminal prosecution, that evidence must have been obtained in a manner that comports with the protections given to the individual by Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. It does not matter <em>where </em>that evidence was obtained (in-state or out-of-state), or <em>what </em>governmental entity (local, state, federal, or out-of-state) obtained it; the constitutionally significant fact is that the Oregon government seeks to use the evidence in an Oregon criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 254 (emphasis in original). Although <em>Davis </em>did not involve any questions of Missouri statutory or constitutional law, it does stand for the broad proposition that suppression of evidence in an Oregon criminal prosecution is to be based on Oregon or federal constitutional law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> The parties agreed that Neal\u2019s residence is not protected under ORS 9.695(1). We further note that, even as a matter of Oregon constitutional law, defendants could not have successfully contested the search of Neal\u2019s residence, at least up to the time that Schmautz found and searched the organizer, because defendants could not have established a constitutionally cognizable protected privacy interest in their attorney's <em>residence. See State v. Tanner, </em>304 Or 312, 745 P2d 757 (1987). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Accord </em>185 Or App at 310-12 (holding that defendants did not have a protected privacy interest in their names and addresses noted in the organizer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\"> Defendants do not invoke the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\"> Consider, for example, the circumstance in which a battered woman leaves her home and consults with an attorney but does not want her husband or partner to know of her whereabouts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\"> We note that, without Neal\u2019s previously volunteered identification of \u201cPaul and Leigh Ann\u201d as the \u201cOregon associates,\u201d the revelation of the names and addresses in Neal\u2019s organizer would not have led to the search at issue in this case. Again, however, defendants had no constitutionally protected privacy interest with respect to events antedating the discovery of the organizer. <em>See </em>185 Or App at 309-10 n 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
