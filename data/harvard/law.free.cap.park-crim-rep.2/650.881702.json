When it is alleged that the prisoner is in custody by virtue-of legal process, the existence of the process and its validity upon its face become a legitimate subject of inquiry; but there can be no reexamination of any matter which occurred anterior to the judgment, and warrant of commitment. Matters which entitle a prisoner to his discharge, such as- the expiration of the period of time for which he was sentenced, a reversal of the judgment, an executive pardon, or the payment of the fine imposed upon him as a punishment, are subjects upon which the officer issuing the writ may hear proof and when established, constitute good cause for the prisoner\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">\u201c When the imprisonment is under process, valid on its face, it will be deemed <em>prima facie </em>legal, and the prisoner must assume the burthen of impeaching its validity by showing a want of jurisdiction in the magistrate or court where it emanated. If he fail in thus impeaching it, his body is to be remanded to custody. Error, irregularity, or want of form, is no objection. Nor is any defect which may be amended or remedied by further entry or motion.\u201d (3 <em>Hill, </em>661, <em>note, </em>31; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Nevins, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>154; <em>Case of the Sheriff of Middlesex, </em>11 <em>Adolp. &amp; Ellis </em>273; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Cassels, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>164.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Courts of Oyer and Terminer are courts of superior criminal jurisdiction, having power: !. To inquire by the oath of good and lawful men of the same county, of all crimes and misdemeanors committed or triable in such county: and 2d, to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>and determine all such crimes and misdemeanors. (2 <em>R. S. 2d ed. p. </em>132, \u00a7 29.) It is apparent therefore, that the court of Oyer and Terminer of the county of Kings, had jurisdiction over the offence of which the prisoner, Cavanagh, was con victed, and its jurisdiction over his person will be presumed In <em>Hart </em>v. Seixas, (21 <em>Wend. </em>40,) the record did not show that the court below had acquired jurisdiction by the service of process, or the appearance of the defendant, and it was held that a court of general jurisdiction is not bound to show the regularity of its proceedings expressly, but that every thing necessary to confer jurisdiction over the person of the defendant would be presumed. The learned justice who delivered the opinion quoted with approbation the rule to be found in <em>Peacock </em>v. Bell, (1 <em>Sand. </em>73,) \u201c that nothing shall be intended to be out of the jurisdiction of a Superior Court, but that which specially appears to be so, and nothing shall be intended to be within the jurisdiction of an inferior court, but that which is expressly alleged.\u201d (<em>Vide also Foot </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>17 <em>Wend. </em>483,) It appeared by the return to the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in this proceeding, and also by the petition upon which it was granted, that the prisoner John Cavanagh was in the custody of the sheriff of the county of Kings, in the county jail, by viutue of a commitment, being an extract from the minutes of the court duly certified by the clerk, which expressed, that at a court of Oyer and Terminer holden in and for the county of Kings, on the 12th day of September, 1854, before the Hon. W. Rockwell, one of the justices of this court, Henry A. Moore, county judge, Nicholas Stillwell and Samuel Striker justices, &amp;c., John Cavanagh was convicted of misdemeanor, <em>\u201c </em>whereupon it was ordered and adjudged by the court, that the said John Cavanagh for the misdemeanor aforesaid, whereof he is convicted, be imprisoned in the common jail of Kings county, for the term of thirty days, and pay a fine of $250, and in default of the payment of such fine, he be imprisoned for a further term not exceeding six months.\u201d The return was not traversed except so far as to deny the sufficiency of the commitment to detain the prisoner in custody. The 42 section of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the act concerning writs of <em>habeas corpus, &amp;c. (2 R. S. 469, </em>470,) directed that if the return show that the prisoner is detained\"in' custody \u201c by virtue of the final judgment or decree of any competent court of civil or criminal jurisdiction, or of any execution issued upon such judgment or decree,\u201d it shall be the duty of the officer before whom the proceedings are had forthwith to order the prisoner to be remanded. The authority for the form of the commitment upon which Cavanagh was detained,\"is to be found in the 5th section of the act concerning judgments, &amp;c., in criminal cases, (2 <em>R. S. </em>618,) which requires the clerk <em>\u201c </em>whenever a judgment, upon any conviction, shall be rendered in any court, to enter such judgment fully in his minutes, stating briefly the offence for which such conviction shall have been had.\u201d Section 11 of the same act provides that a transcript of the entry of such conviction, duly certified by the clerk, shall be delivered to the sheriff which shall be sufficient authority for him to execute such sentence, which he shall execute accordingly.\u201d The learned justice, before whom the proceedings under review were had, made an order that Cavanagh be discharged from his imprisonment, upon the ground that the transcript of conviction was not evidence of the final judgment of a competent court of criminal jurisdiction, because no offence was stated. The entry asserts that the prisoner was convicted of misdemeanor, and the court thereupon adjudged that <em>\u201c </em>for the misdemeanor aforesaid, whereof he is' convicted, he be imprisoned, <em>See.\u201d \u201c </em>The misdemeanor aforesaid whereof he is convicted,\u201d is the offence particularly set out in the indictment, and whenever the record was made up in pursuance of the fourth section of the act last referred to, it would have disclosed the particular acts which constituted the crime, and the nature and character of the misdemeanor of which the prisoner was convicted. In the transcript of the conviction, the crime is briefly stated as a misdemeanor, which is precisely what the act requires. No other term could have been employed more apt and significant. Besides, it has been shown that the want of form is no objection, nor is any defect or omission which may be supplied or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>remedied by further entry or motion. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Nevins, </em>the rule upon which the defendant was committed for a contempt, was quite as brief and inexplicit as the entry in the present case. The court say, \u201c the sum for the nonpayment of which a man is committed for contempt, should no doubt be specified by the rule; but that may be directly, or by reference to a proceeding taken to ascertain the amount through the proper officer, whose report, on its being filed and confirmed, becomes the act of the court and is then to be read , as part of the rule. <em>Id cerium est quod cerium reddi </em>potest.\u201d For illustration the court refer to \u201cthe little slip called a bail piece, on which a man may be arrested, and under a short committitur endorsed by a judge, incarcerated, either before or after judgment, at the pleasure of his manucaptors. So in this case, if it became material to know of what particular misdemeanor the prisoner was convicted, in order to determine that the commitment was legal, resort might have been had to the record, if one had been made up and filed, and if not, to the indictment upon which he was tried and convicted, and to which the entry in the minutes referred. But no resort to the record or the indictment, was necessary to give effect to the entry as evidence of a conviction for a crime. It expressed that the prisoner is convicted of misdemeanor, and for the misdemeanor aforesaid, whereof he is convicted that he be imprisoned, &amp;c. At the common law, the term misdemeanor is generally used in contradiction. to felony, and misdemeanors comprehend all indictable offences which do not amount to felony, (4 <em>Black. Com. </em>5.) There are, it is true, a numerous class of offences, acts of omission and commission, which are specially declared by the statutes to be misdemeanors. There is also a general provision, section 45 of the act concerning offences punishable by imprisonment in the county jail by fines, (2 <em>R. S. </em>582,) which declares \u201c that when the performance of any act is prohibited by any statute and no penalty for the violation of such statute is imposed, either in the same section containing such prohibition, or in any other section or statute, the doing such act shall be deemed a misdemeanor.\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>46 prescribes the .punishment for such misdemeanor, which is imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year, or by fine not exceeding $250, or by both such fine and imprisonment. A misdemeanor is therefore a distinct and well defined offence, with its appropriate punishment declared by the statute. It was no more necessary in the entry of the conviction and sentence upon the minutes of the court, to state or to refer to the particular facts which constitute the misdemeanor, then it would have been to set out or refer to the particular acts which constituted the murder, manslaughter or larceny, had the prisoner been convicted and sentenced for either of those crimes. The <em>offence </em>is described in the entry by the name and designation given to it by the law, and that was all that could be required Let us suppose (what I understand was actually the case,) that Cavanagh was one of the commissioners of excise of the city of Brooklyn. That he united with his co-commissioners in doing some of the acts prohibited by the law concerning excise, and the granting of licenses. And for this breach of public duty he had been indicted by the grand jury and convicted at the Oyer and Terminer. His offence would have fallen within the general provision of section 45 of the act concerning offences, punishable by imprisonment in the county jail and by fine. It would have been a misdemeanor, and by no other name could it have been appropriately and legally designated in the entry of the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">I therefore conclude that in making the. order for the discharge of Cavanagh from his. imprisonment, the learned justice erred. The moment it appeared that he was in the custody of the sheriff upon the conviction, and in execution of the s\u00e9ntence mentioned in the return, the injunction of the 42 section of the act concerning writs of <em>habeas corpus, </em>&amp;c., because positive and peremptory, and he should have been remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">There is no force in the point raised that Cavanagh should have been sentenced to the penitentiary and not to the county jail. We must assume that the Oyer and Terminer determined it had the power to pronounce the sentence under which he was imprisoned. If it was- an error to designate the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>jail as the place of his confinement, (which I by no means assert,) it can not be reviewed and corrected in this proceeding. It forms'no ground for his discharge upon <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The proceedings reversed and the prisoner remanded, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
