Whether there is any good reason for this distinction, it is unnecessary to inquire on the present occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Beales, although a joint defendant, was admitted as a witness against Donnelly in this case, without discharging him from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered,</p>\n<author id=\"b182-10\">Mitchell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay4U\">In 1 <em>Ryan &amp; Moody, </em>401, <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Rowland and </em>others,) the counsel for the crown moved to have an acquittal against two of the defendants, that he might use them as witnesses. It was treated as necessary and allowed. (See also the note there.) So a case is stated in <em>Cases Temp. Hardwicke, </em>163, where on an information at the suit of the crown, it was deemed necessary to enter a <em>nol. pros, </em>against one of the defendants before examining him against the others. Our own courts have decided that one defendant in an indictment can not be a witness for another; it can not be on the ground of interest, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>there is no interest either way; and if it be because he is a party to the record, it applies whether he be called for the people or his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
