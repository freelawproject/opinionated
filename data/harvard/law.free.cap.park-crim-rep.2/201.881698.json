I think I heard \"Justice Winne say that Warren Benjamin was arrested and brought into court for an assault and battery committed on me in December last; Winne asked Benjamin what he had to say, guilty or not guilty; 1 think Benjamin said not guilty; I was sworn after that. Esquire Winne asked me what Benjamin did to me; I answered that he kicked me three or four times in the face, down at the house; I think it was all that I swore, to the assault and battery; what I then swore to is the same that I swore to here; I left immediately after being sworn.

The court compelled me to testify, notwithstanding my unwillingness; I simply stated in. as few words as possible what had been done; I was not cross-examined; Esquire Winne asked me the questions. I left the court immediately after I testified; don\u2019t know what occurred after I left; defendant\u2019s father, William Benjamin, and Peter Johnson, defendant\u2019s counsel, were there.

The proceedings of a Justice\u2019s Court may be proved by the justice, who is a competent witness to verify his minutes, which must be produced and can not be proved by parol. Though not technically a court of record, the proceedings are in the nature of a record. (11 <em>John. R. </em>166.)

If the proceedings of an inferior court are not entered in the books, they may be proved by the officer of the court, or some person conversant with the facts. <em>(Roscoe Cr.

The injured person was not complainant, but was a very reluctant witness, and his counsel objected to the whole proceeding. It was evidently an attempt to get off the defendant with a very light punishment for a very atrocious offence. But it failed of its object.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Under the plea of <em>not guilty, </em>the defendant had no right to prove a former trial and sentence, nor even that a proceeding was then <em>pending </em>before a different tribunal for the same of-fence. <em>(Arch. Cr. Pl. </em>92, 94.) The rule is that under a plea of <em>not guilty, </em>the defendant may give in evidence everything which negatives the allegations in the indictment or complaint and all matters of excuse or justification. Where a defendant wishes to avail himself of a former trial and judgment, he must plead <em>auterfois acquit </em>or <em>auterfois </em>convict, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">In this case the defendant pleaded not guilty, and the cause was tried upon that issue alone. If, after the joining of issue, any thing occurred which might be available as a defence, the defendant could only avail himself of it by a subsequent plea, and by presenting a new issue for trial. That was not done, and the evidence of the trial and sentence before Esquire Winne, was properly excluded upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">We think the objection to the species of evidence, by which the facts were offered to be proved, was also well taken. The record of conviction, if it had been filed, or a duly certified copy of it, would have been the proper evidence. (2 <em>R. S. </em>717, \u00a7 38,39, 40.) If it had been shown that no record of conviction had been filed, the secondary evidence might have been received. (2 <em>R. S. </em>739, \u00a7 10: <em>Barb. Cr. L. </em>407, <em>2d ed.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
