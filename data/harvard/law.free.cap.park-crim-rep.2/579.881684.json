A juror when examined as a witness for the purpose of sustaining a challenge to the favor, will not be excused, from answering whether he has any prejudice or bias against a religious sect, on the ground that such answer would disgrace him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b579-10\">Where on the trial of several defendants on an indictment for a riot, it appeared that a secret society had been organized for the purpose of repressing the class or sect to which the defendants belonged, it was held to be competent to require a witness, who had been called and testified on the part of the prosecution, to answer on his cross-examination, whether he was a member of such secret society</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-11\"><em>Certiorari </em>to the New York General Sessions. The defendants were jointly indicted for riot, committed in the ninth ward of the city of New York, on the 4th day of July, 1853; the defendants pleaded not guilty; and on the 14th day of December, 1853, the issue of traverse so joined, came on to be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>before Hon. Francis Tillou, recorder, &amp;c., the defendants being tried jointly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\">On the first juror, Samuel Carson, being called, he was challenged for principal cause by the defendants, on the ground of his having formed or expressed an opinion of the guilt of the prisoners, or some of them. This challenge was denied by the people, and issue was thereupon joined. The defendant\u2019s counsel, John McICeon, offered as a witness, to prove the challenge, the juror himself. This was objected to by the people, and the objection sustained by the court; to which decision the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">' It was admitted for the purpose of' the argument as to the challenge of jurors, that on the 4th day of July last past, there was a procession of a society called the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a society composed of Irishmen and Roman Catholics; that the defendants were members of that society. And it was admitted, for the purpose of the argument as to the challenge of jurors, that a portion of the\u2018defendants are Catholics, and a portion foreigners; that the alleged riot took place in the neighborhood of Abingdon square, in the ninth ward of the city of New York, through which the procession passed, and that during the riot, expressions of a hostile -and -insulting character were used-by some of the parties engaged, as for instance, \u201c kill the d\u2014d Irish,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>kill the d\u2014d Popish kill the d\u2014d Yankees.\u201d It was' also contended by the defendants\u2019 counsel, for the purpose of the challenge to jurors, that a strong prejudice existed amongst the police and inhabitants of that section of the city against Irish and Roman Catholics.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-9\">Several jurors were called and rejected; some were peremptorily challenged; one of the jurors being called and challenged to the favor, on the ground that he had a bias, prejudice or impression against the prisoners or so'mb of them, triers were appointed by court'; one juror so challenged for favor was rejected by the triers, when James Black was called as a juror, who was'challenged to the favor by defendants\u2019 counsel, on the ground that the juror called had a bias, preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dice or impression against the defendants or some one of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-5\">This challenge was denied by the people, and issue was thereupon joined. The same triers as in the former cases were, by consent, in this case appointed. The defendants called as a witness to prove the challenge, the juror so called, who, after answering several questions in relation to the ground of challenge, was asked the following question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">Q. Have you any bias or prejudice against Roman Catholics!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-7\">To this question the district attorney objected, and contended that the juror was not bound to answer, if he thought it would disgrace him. The court sustained the objection of the district attorney, to which decision the counsel for defendants excepted: The court thereupon informed the witness that he was not bound to answer the question, if in his opinion the answer would tend to disgrace him; to which instruction and decision the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. On the question being put, the juror declined to answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-9\">The defendants then moved the court to compel the juror, as being a witness, to answer the question, which the court refused to do. To which decision and refusal the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-10\">Timothy H. West was called as a witness on the part of the prosecution, and testified as follows: That he lived in No. <em>23 </em>Eighth avenue; is a house carpenter; saw the procession; there was a space of twelve feet or more through which the stage driver passed; heard the expression\u2014\u201c Kill the d\u2014d son of -.\u201d After witness left his son in Troy street, witness returned to the stage. He then met a policeman and told him the \u201c Order of Hibernians had attacked the stage-driver, and were about to murder him on the spot.\u201d McPherson went in and told them to disperse; two men made a pass at him; I stepped back to Eighth avenue; he did not see the marshal at the time of the affair with the stage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-11\">On being cross-examined, the witness was asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-12\">Q. Do you belong to the Order of United Americans!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-13\">This question was objected to by the people. The objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>was sustained by the court, and to this decision the counsel for the defendants excepted. The following question was then put:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-5\">Q. Do you belong to any order!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b582-6\">This question was objected to by the people. <em>The </em>objection was sustained, and to which decision the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-7\">N. <em>Bowditch Blunt </em>(District Attorney) for the people.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b582-8\"><em>John McKeon </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b582-9\"><em>By the </em>Court, Morris, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbV\">At the foundation of American jurisprudence, is the right to be tried by an impartial, unprejudiced jury, it is a right paramount to all others, and is not to be sacrificed to the fear or apprehension of wounding the feelings of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">In this case, a new trial should be ordered for the following error<em>s:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">1st.
