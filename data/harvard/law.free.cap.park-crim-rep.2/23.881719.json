There was no communication between the shop and the other part of the house, which was occupied by Stratton\u2019s family, except by an outside door which opened into a yard surrounding the whole building. The whole building was erected together under the same roof; and some of the rooms occupied by the family were above and some on the same floor with, and some below the room occupied as a shop.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-8\"><em>S.

As in an indictment for petit treason, the prisoner may be acquitted of that offence and convicted of murder or of manslaughter. And in an indictment for burglary, where a felonious taking of the goods is also charged to constitute the crime of burglary, the prisoner may be acquitted of the breaking and entering the dwelling house in the night time, and may be convicted of the simple larceny. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The court is also of opinion that the shop, as it was situated in this case, constituted a part of the dwelling house. It was under the same roof, built at the same time, occupied by the same person, was nearly surrounded by rooms occupied by his family, and the whole was separated from the street by a common enclosure <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Prisoner convicted of burglary. \u2019</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\"><em> </em>Rex vs. Gibson et al, 1 Leach, 357; Archbold, 166.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
