It has been frequently decided by our courts that the giving of a promissory note was not an acquittance or discharge of the debt. This is undoubtedly a <em>casus omissus </em>in the statute, and not being a felony at common law, the prisoner can not be impri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>soned in the state prison.
