The prisoner had become very angry; apd after they had beep parted th.e last time, as Van Der Carr turned to go from him, the prisoner seized a nail hammer which lay near him, and running .up behind him struck him with it on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>back of his head and knocked him down; and he gave him a second stroke before Sillman, the other person present, discovered him. Sillman then attempted to get the hammer from him, but the prisoner struck him and drove him back, and gave to Van Der Carr a third stroke; and he was in the act of re-* peating it when his arm was arrested by another person who came to their assistance. A surgeon, who examined the wounds, testified that each blow of the hammer had broken through Van Der Carr\u2019s skull; and that the ordinary effect of such blows would be to destroy life.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\"><em>G.

But it was not every case of taking life in a sudden affray, or in the heat of passion, which could be mitigated into manslaughter. Malice might be, and frequently was inferred from the particular circumstances of the case; as where the prisoner commenced the attack and made use of such weapons as would be likely to endanger life. In this case, if the prisoner intended to take the life of Van Der Carr, he was guilty of the offence charged in the indictment, and would have been guilty of murder if he had succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">Verdict, guilty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
