I suppose it is advisable to put the questions, on the ground that here was a party about to die; the circumstances were of recent occurrence. \"What he then said, was a dying declaration, and therefore he had no motive to misrepresent the truth. The impression produced on the mind of the physician by the symptoms was that the deceased wmuld not recover, and such was the belief of the deceased. The question was as to the admissibility of this testimony. He supposed it was admissible under the strict rule of the courts, in such cases. The true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>rule would be, he thought, to admit these declarations, and then instruct the jury the weight to which they were entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">Judge Harris: I do not think the declarations would be ad- \u2022 missible. The man himself said bethought he should die; the physicians did not apprize him that he was likely to die, but encouraged him to hope that he would recover. Now, Lanagan may have had the impression that he was going to die; but to constitute dying declarations, the person making them must be convinced that he was dying; must see death staring him in the face. Mr. Lanagan was not in this state, for when he expressed the belief that he would not recover, his medical attendants encouraged him to believe and hope that he would.

There were others: burning sensation at the throat; constant retching; severe evacuations from the bowels; cramps, often; great prostration of the system; these comprise pretty much all the symptoms; the incessant retching and severe burning sensation at the throat are not common to other diseases. Independent of the severe burning of the throat, all the other symptoms mentioned are common to a variety of other diseases; this burning at the throat, I do .not think is limited to any particular variety of poison; in all cases of suspected poison I understand it is customary to' analyze the contents of the stomach; it is done by the faculty to satisfy themselves as to the cause of the death; without that, it is not I think in the power of our profession definitely and certainly to determine the cause of death; I have had occasion to attend a case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>cholera; in those cases there was great thirst, and a complaint of irritation of the throat, but not as severe as is common to cases of poison; I have found in the course of my practice that the r\u00e9covery of the patient depends much upon the constitution, the will, and power to endure; severe retching, great pain in the stomach, &amp;c., are strong symptoms of cholera, as is also, sudden and severe prostration, if accompanied by other symptoms, such as rice-colored evacuations, severe cramps, <em>Sec.; </em>these evacuations do not always result from the progress of the disease and rapid dissolution of the patient; we should not always expect death to follow such evacuations; we find these rice-colored evacuations in no other disease than cholera, that I am aware of; they may sometimes occur in cholera morbus, a disease that assimilates to cholera; I would not like to give a definite opinion as to whether a safe conclusion as to the cause of this man\u2019s death, could be arrived at without an analyzation of the stomach; I understand the stomach was analyzed; I attended deceased\u2019s family for four or five years previous to his death; he was not a man of vigorous constitution; his habits I believe were regular, and he was a temperate man as far as I knew.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\"><em>Direct </em>resumed.\u2014He was able to attend to his ordinary affairs, I believe, up to the time of this transaction; I was in the habit of seeing or meeting him most every week. \u00b0 He was about thirty-five years of age at the time of his death; the symptoms he exhibited were not those of cholera; the evacuations in no respect resembled cholera; I think I could pronounce with confidence that he did not die of cholera; independent of analysis I think I have a decided opinion as to the cause of his death, and it is such as I have named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>By Mr. </em>Beach.\u2014:My question to you, doctor, was whether, without an analysis, you could form a satisfactory conclusion as to the cause of this man\u2019s death; did I understand you correctly'?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">Witness: You did.

I did not know a Mrs. Robinson at that time; 'should know her now, if she would raise her veil. \"That'is the lady'sir; she was in my store s\u00e9veral times in the month of May, 1853; in that month she purchased arsenic at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>my store; it was in the form of a white powder; it was between the 10th and the 25th of May; she bought, as near as I recollect, two ounces; she was also at'my store on the 25th of May, between five and seven o\u2019clock, about half an hour previous to her arrest; had conversation with her at that time; when I came in from tea, I found her in the store very much excited; she said she was in trouble; had been charged with poisoning a couple of persons; I think she mentioned Lanagan\u2019s name for one, and said they resided opposite where she did; I asked her why they should suspect her of the crime; and she said she supposed it was out of revenge, because she would not lend them a hundred dollars; that she did not want to draw that amount of money out of the bank in the absence of Mr. Robinson; she said she was very much in fear of the neighborhood, and wanted my advice as to what she should do to be protected; I referred her to the chief of police, Amasa J.

there were three or four percussion caps on the hammer of the pistol, but the lock was so rusty that I doubt if it could be fired off; I think the cap on the barrel loaded, the one that I probed, was in good order; on the Saturday evening previous to the arrest, Mrs. Robinson was at my store, and had a pistol with her; it was about 10 o\u2019clock in the evening when she came in; on her visit to my store on the 25th, she said she had gone over to the grocery in search of her gardener, and that while there she xvas about drinking beer with Mrs. Lanagan and others, there was some confusion about the handling of the tumblers and that Mr. Lanagan was taken sick, and they accused her of putting poison into the beer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\"><em>Cross-examined by Mr. </em>Beach.\u2014I furnished a written statement of the transaction I have related, about the time of the meeting of the first grand jury after the arrest was made;

that she was living in the vicinity of Boutwell\u2019s Mills, and rats were abundant there; this was voluntary on her part, while I was putting up the article; I think she got the arsenic within two or three days of the 10th of May; she called in the store again the same day, and within an hour\u2019s time after the purchase of the arsenic; she was very much excited at the second time she called; I never noticed anything peculiar in her appearance only when she called the second time after the purchase of the arsenic, and on the 25th; this last time she appeared fearfully apprehensive and restless; she looked around apprehensively; did not appear like the same woman, either in dress or manner; she was standing when conversing with me on the 25th;

This inquest was held on the evening of the 25th day of May, 1853; I made a post mortem examination of the body; this was done at the house of the deceased, the following day; quite a number were present; I think the jury were, as well as Dr. Skilton and Dr. Seymour. I was associated with Prof. Dakin in making an analysis of the stomach; I took the stomach from the body myself; we analyzed the contents of the stomach during the latter part of May and in the month of June; the analysis continued two or three weeks; we applied chemical tests with a view to ascertain the substances which the stomach contained; we found-poison in the stomach; it was arsenic. We applied several tests; thef all resulted in showing arsenic; we found forty grains of arsenic in the intestines, wlych had passed through the stomach; theie were enough to produce death; I can state professionally that he died of arsenic. Saw and took charge of a box of sugar at the house of Lanagan; it was white, granular sugar; I got the sugar from Mrs. Lanagan; it was behind the counter, in the store part of the house, on one of the shelves; she told me it was all the sugar there; saw no other sugar. The box was in such a situation that it could not be touched, except by a person getting over the counter; of the sugar there was perhaps three or four pounds; I took possession of the sugar and kept it until the time of the analysis. Professor Dakin and myself analyzed the sugar; we tested for arsenic; discovered none; there was none; we discovered no foreign ingredient. In analyzing the sugar we applied one or two tests previously applied in analyzing the stomach, and those were the most delicate tests, the proper ones. I am not a professional chemist; Professor Dakin is. We tested the beer at Lanagan\u2019s by drinking it; it produced no unpleasant effect; it didn\u2019t kill me; there was no poison in the beer; some of the jurors drank it, as did one or \u2022 two other persons; I know of no injurious effects being produced; it was drawn by Mrs. Lanagan from a barrel in the store; I saw her draw it. I went to the house of Mrs. Robinson; I was not acquainted with ^Mrs. Robinson previous to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>transaction; had never seen her; her house was nearly opposite, a little above the place of Lanagan\u2019s. There were many things in the house usually found in dwellings; we found arsenic there; it was in the back parlor. There was a bed-iin this room; the arsenic was in the southeast corner of the room, under the carpet, between the bed and the south wall; it was wrapped up in a paper somewdiat soiled, and as near white as may be; the arsenic was not done up in regular form; it was not in apothecary style; there was one drachm, about sixty grains, of the arsenic; I took a portion of it; it was the article commonly known as arsenic; we tested it and found it to be arsenic. On the 25th of May I saw a person named Catharine Lubee, alleged also to have been poisoned; saw her at the house of James Lanagan, a relative of the deceased person; it was about nine o\u2019clock in the evening of the 25th; the coroner\u2019s jury was also there; I took them there for the purpose of taking her evidence on the inquest of Lanagan; she was sworn, and I took her evidence in writing; she was lying in bed at the time; she appeared ill; she appeared sick at the stomach; occasioned, as I supposed at the time, from something taken into the stomach; she vomited; did not purge, to my knowledge; think she asked for drink one or more times -while I was there; did not complain of a burning sensation in her throat.

The court overruled the objection, and the counsel for the defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\">I examined the stomach of Miss Lubee after her death, in company with Prof. Dakin; found arsenic there, and think she died of the effects of that poison; applied the same tests in her case as in the case of Lanagan.

There then seemed to be a prevailing impression about the room that she would not recover; I approached the bed and put my hand on her pulse., and spoke a few words to her; I told her that I thought she would recover; she said that she felt very sick. I did not change my opinion about her recovery before I left, and communicated no different opinion to her from the one I first expressed to her. I held an inquest on her body on the 26th of May, in the morning about nine a. m. I made the post mortem examination of Miss Lubee before I did that of Mr. Lanagan. The arsenic that I found in the stomachs of these two persons was of the same kind I found at the house of Mrs. Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-5\"><em>Cross-examined by Mr. </em>Pierson.\u2014The tests were principally conducted by Prof. Dakin. First saw Mrs. Robinson on the evening of the 25th, after nine o\u2019clock; she was not, to .my knowledge, at either of the coroner\u2019s inquests; I conversed with her in the jail; ,at the jail I conversed with her; she seemed much excited, and not entirely rational; she was dressed in a short gown; her person was not exposed; I took from her her key on that occasion; I went with it to the house where she had been residing; found the arsenic as before stated; found, also, under the carpet, and by the arsenic, a box of jewelry, a watch and chain; will not be positive about a locket; think there was one; the watch and chain, I think, were in the box; there were breastpins, cuffpins, earrings and .articles of that description. I next saw Mrs. Robinson in jail the day following; conversed with her then; it was much the same as on the evening before) I thought she was not rational; she acted strangely and quite unnatural; her answers to questions were not satisfactory; I did not get the information I asked for; I went to ask her about her furniture; her answers were not pertinent to the questions I put to her; I staid with her on .this .occasion t,en or fifteen minutes; there was a wild, unnatural appearance to her eyes; I can\u2019t say her motion was any way .peculiar; I mean her .gesticulations; she was sitting at the time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Before I came away she left her chair and walked to the window; I saw her on several occasions during a fortnight after the occurrence; two or three times a week I might have visited the jail; I was always impressed with the idea that she was not rational. I told her once that I heard that Lanagan and Miss Lubee were dead; she took no notice of the remark that I could see; so far as I could judge, I think she did not know what I meant. I did on one occasion charge her with poisoning those persons; it was during the second or third week of my visits; my expression was this: \u201c You- know you have poisoned those people, and I want you to tell me about it; all about it.\u201d She made no answer to this, but went on clattering away with the same jumble that she had usually had over; I could not see that she comprehended what I meant. From the beginning to the end of my visits to the jail, I became satisfied that on all the occasions I saw her, she was not a rational woman. The jewelry, &amp;c., found at Mrs. Robinson\u2019s house, I gave up to Dr. Hegeman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\"><em>To Mr. </em>Hogeboom.\u2014I should say my visits lasted some two -or three weeks; may have been longer; no person employed me to visit her; I was not requested to attend her; it is possible that she may have requested me to call; I do not recollect that she ever sent for me, or requested me to come and see her; I have not been paid for those visits; I never saw her before the evening of May 25th, \u201953, to my knowledge; after I had relieved\u2019myself of the care of her property, my visits were discontinued; I attended her person as long as I had charge of her property. I have been called upon to see insane persons to testify in regard to insanity, but not with a view of treating them medically; I never had a person under my charge for the treatment of insanity; my residence has been in this city since I have been in practice, with the exception of one year -when I was in Brazil, South America; I should say I have been called upon to inspect some twenty or thirty persons supposed to be insane; so called upon in and about this city; these persons were not charged with crime, nor were they in hospitals; it has usually occurred in private practice; and I was called upon to testify before a judge in order to get them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>asylum; all of them were not cases of this description; some of the subjects were inmates of the almshouse; the examinations were for the most part single examinations; called upon them once; recall one whom I examined twice; I am thirty years of age. On the evening of the 20th of May, when I first called at the jail, and during my interview with Mrs. R., Charles Burns, Francis Bowman, Nathan H. Camp, and the officers of the prison were present; I was there about ten minutes; I told her I had come to search her person; I forget what reply she made, but she was laughing at the time; I recollect that she made replies to that remark; the reply was not touching the subject; I did search her person; she facilitated the search by standing passive, and raised her hands; she offered no resistance to my search; I made the remark that I had come to search her person when I first entered the room; she was in a distant part of the room, but what I said was audible, and as I approached her, she elevated her hands, as I have stated; I can not repeat the remark, or the substance of a remark or question that I made to her on that first interview; I considered her' dressed unusually at that time; singularity of dress was not one of the elements of the judgment I formed as to the state of her mind; her eyes had an unnatural and wild appearance, and her countenance an unusual expression; when a person is fearful or terrified, the eye will sometimes assume a wild and unnatural appearance, and the countenance an unusual expression. This will be more or less the case sometimes in a person in liquor, or of the use of liquor, even before the approach of delirium tremens; insanih ia sometimes simulated or feigned; I don\u2019t think I ever saw a person who feigned insanity; don\u2019t now recollect of having seen one. I read journals on insanity, periodical publications; have never made it a particular study; think I have read some works on insanity; from what I have read, I have the impression that it is laid down that it is not difficult to distinguish between real or feigned insanity; in some cases, I think it requires a close and long continued examination; I think, I will not swear with certainty on that point; think the longest interview with Mrs. Robinson at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the jail was as long as twenty minutes; my usual visits were as long as ten or fifteen minutes. I think Mrs. R. complained of being ill, or the jailer told me she was ill, on one or two occasions. The jailer\u2019s name I do not recollect; it was not Dr. Hegeman; I can\u2019t state at which interview I was told about Mrs. R.\u2019s illness, only that it was not at the first; I did not prescribe for her at the time; I did not attend her for medical purposes; my visits generally were in reference to her affairs, her property; I had the keys of her house; I made up my mind at the first interview that she was not rational.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">Q.

There were no inducements held out to me, sir; at the first interview, I asked her for the keys of her house; I forget whether she handed me the keys, or .whether I took them from her pocket or dress; when I asked for the keys, she made no reply, but kept on talking; I think I got the keys shortly after I asked for them; there was nothing about the transaction of getting the keys from her that produced the impression in my mind that she was not rational that I now recollect; I can not tell what she did talk about at the first interview; I do not recollect her remarks, or the substance of them, at. that interview; do not recollect that at this interview Mrs. R. requested that her clothes should be sent down to her from her house; I have forgotten entirely the details of the conversation at the second interview; I do not now recollect any thing she siad then in substance; my remarks to her were something about her property; I think she said nothing to me about her property at the second interview; I recollect that she was talking and laughing about, but I do not recollect any observation she made, or the subject of it; I forget whether the jailer was present at this interview or not; Mr. Price, or his deputy, Dr. Hegeman, may have been tnere; can not state positively that any one was present; my impression is that one of those I have named was in the room or at or near the door; I was inside; I think the door was not locked; I think she did me no bodily harm; I recollect one day of having remarked to her that I had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>heard that Lanagan and Miss Lubee were dead; she. made some observation, I think -not in reference to it; I know she made no observation in reference to it; she talked about something else; it had no reference to the subject; I can\u2019t tell what she said did relate \"to; my remark made no change in her countenance; she did not seem shocked or startled at what I said; one day I asked her if I should give up certain .articles (some utensils, a boiler and spider, and a bonnet, I believe) to Mrs. Lanagan; I told her Mrs. L. wanted those things; had been to me for them; Mrs. Robinson replied, \u201c Why not?\u201d 3 think this was the only allusion-she-ever made to me in regard to Lanagan or his wife; the articles were asked for, as I understood it, as Mrs. Lanagan\u2019s articles; I regarded the answer as pertinent to the subject\u2014as rational; at some of the interviews she talked about dresses, .but I do not recollect distinctly what she said about them; I don\u2019t think it -irrational to talk about dresses, but the remarks about them at this time I regarded as irrational,\" because the remarks were disconnected with any other subject; I sent down dresses to Mrs., R. from her house: do not? recollect whether this was in pursuance of a request from her; it was either herself or some person connected with the prison, who requested it, I think; don\u2019t know that I sent them down to her in\" consequence of the remark of hers about dresses; don\u2019t\" recollect that she requested dresses to be sent down; if such a request was made to me by her, I have forgotten it; I-do not recollect that she put any questions to me about the jewelry; Dr. Hegeman, I believe, was my successor in the charge\"of-her property; I gave the keys to him; no person requested me to do so, she did not; I did tell' her on one occasion, \u201c you know you have poisoned these people, and I want you to tell me all about it,\u201d and she made no reply to it; it seemed strange to me that the remark did not affect her expression or manner; it did not seem strange to me that she did not admit the charge: it was not an evidence of the absence of reason; it would not be strange in a sane person to rather evade such a question, but I should think she would \"say something in regard to it; I made remarks at all these interviews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>about her property, but what they were, or the substance of them, I do not now recollect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\"><em>To Mr. </em>Beach.\u2014In the course of my medical practice I have often had patients temporarily delirious, &amp;c; my practice has been tolerably extensive; I have managed to get a living by it; I have repeatedly had occasion to consult with Dr. Brinsmade; was associated with him in business some ten years; at my first interview with this lady, the expression of her eyes did not strike me as that of drunkenness, neither did her face indicate a state of drunkenness; in the course of my several interviews with her, I directed my attention to the condition of her mind; partial alienation of mind is a form of insanity; my recollection of those interviews is, that her answers to my questions were not generally responsive; at most every visit she appeared full of levity; her failure to reply directly to my questions was one of the reasons that led me to believe that she was not rational; I do not know whether she had access to stimulating drinks after her confinement in jail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\"><em>Prof. Francis E. </em>Bakin, of Albany, sworn.\u2014By profession, I am a chemist; I have been for several years in the habit of analyzing various substances; I conducted the analysis of the contents of the stomach of Mr. Lanagan and Miss Lubee, in connection with Dr. Bontecou, at his house; we discovered arsenic in both the stomachs; we applied five or six different tests; each resulted in showing the presence of arsenic; I have no doubt of the presence of arsenic; we found the arsenic and the compositions we obtained from the stomach are before you in the jar; we found arsenic in considerable quantities, I should judge to produce death; I am not a physician; we analyzed the sugar also; found no arsenic in that; Dr. Bontecou\u2019s family used the sugar afterwards; we analyzed the forty grains of arsenic taken from the stomach, and I took the mucous found in the stomach of Miss Lubee, and found arsenic in that; the contents of the paper found at Mrs. Robinson\u2019s residence we also analyzed, and found it to be arsenic.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">The prosecution here rested and the following evidence was given by the defence:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number><em>William H.

It was perhaps between nine and ten o\u2019clock; her dress was disordered, it was hanging loose on her, was dirty, as though long worn without being washed. It was a slate colored morning dress; the one she came to the jail in; she had no other there then; I procured some thing for her from her house ; her trunk was sent to the jail before; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>she dressed better after this, when she dressed at all; never saw her without a dress; have seen her in her night dress all day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">At the time I speak of her eyes had a wild appearance; it seemed impossible to catch her eye; this is not so much the case now; should not think this a sure mark of insanity; some persons differ in the appearance of the eye; some have that wild appearance of the eye more than others; I think she. is of unsound mind yet; but not to so great an extent as formerly; think she has been partially of unsound mind ever since she has been in the jail; more so at some times than at others; by partially of unsound mind, I mean that it was more apparent to me at one time than at another; I think the appearance of unsoundness is not so extensive to-day as I have seen it; not so readily observed; can\u2019t say why not so readily observed, unless because she is or seems more cautious; her countenance is not now so expressionless as it was when I saw her on the 26th of May. On that day her eye was wild; but I could not gather from the expression of her countenance as to what she wanted; I had no considerable conversation with her; when asked if she would like another room; I am not certain that she made any reply; if she did make a reply, it was neither of assent or dissent; I know this because I thought it strange that she gave me no answer; I know that I asked her the question; whether she answered or not I don\u2019t know. To the question: do you possess that degree of medical knowledge and skill that would justify you in passing an authoritative opinion on a person\u2019s sanity, witness answered, perhaps not. In my private medical practice, never had but one case of insanity. I was the attending physician in that case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">We have had three or four cases in jail; the case of one man was brought in from the country; those who brought him there said they could not well take care of him, and wished to have him kept there. The cases I speak of were not desperate cases of insanity; irritability and sullenness do not always attend insanity; don\u2019t think sitting still on a chair, when a person is seated, is remarkable; the night of the 27th, when I watched at her door, I was apprehensive she might destroy- herself; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>think I was not told to watch; she seemed to be raving; called on the watch and police to protect her; could not hear all she said, and do remember only the words watch and police, and saying she should be killed; at this time she hadn\u2019t been supplied with any liquor, to my knowledge; do not know that opium was sent for, for her; don\u2019t know that she requested it; don\u2019t think she had any; I do not know that during her stay in jail she has been supplied with any other stimulants than liquor and snuff. It was two or three days after she was committed that I spoke to her about the funeral; don\u2019t think I mentioned to her, in speaking of the funerals, the names of deceased persons; think I said the funeral of the man and woman supposed to have been poisoned, is taking place now. The answer she made was <em>\u201c </em>it is queer, isn\u2019t it?\u201d and commenced talking about some articles of her dress; I arrived at the conclusion that she is reluctant to be thought insane, recently. I did not at any time communicate to her that if on the trial she was found insane, she would not be discharged but would be sent to an asylum; a few persons have seen her in the jail; I think it was at the Oyer and Terminer, in February, that I first thought she didn\u2019t like to be thought insane; she told me so; she said she was not insane now, that was the time we had conversation; she didn\u2019t tell me when she stopped being insane.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">It was last winter some time that she broke up the chairs; she broke up five out of six; she had a rocking chair of her own; that she didn\u2019t break; this was after she had been indicted; she had been brought into court to answer to the indictment; she broke the chairs in pieces and burned them up; I think she was mad at somebody; don\u2019t know she said so in words; she had no particular difficulty at that time with any one; she was of violent temper; there were other things in the room which she didn\u2019t destroy; three tables, a wash stand, a looking glass, wardrobe, bed, &amp;c.; some of the dishes were hers; others were not; she tried to melt the silver cake basket; I asked her why she destroyed them; she said they were hers, and she would do with them what she pleased; I did not pie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>scribe anient spirits daily; supplied her with brandy part of the time; sometimes wine; mostly brandy.

she offered to show me no steps of dancing, or anything of the kind; I think I laughed at the performance; we parted good friends; I think it was at the same interview that she told me her father was a French lord; I don\u2019t remember what I said when she told me that; didn\u2019t say who the \u201c poor man \u201d was that she married; Mrs. Robinson told me at one time that she was twenty-seven years of age; don\u2019t remember at what time she came for her dresses; I think I took them home; this, I think was the first time I was ever in Mrs. Robinson\u2019s house; don\u2019t remember how long I remained; think I staid there two hours and a half; was in conversation with Mrs. Robinson all that time; the reason I staid so long was that she did not want to have me go; I wanted to go; she did not detain me by force, but by persuasion; I think she told me stories then which I did not believe to be true, but I do not remember them; I think she told the story about being in Mr. Galvin\u2019s at that time; her conversation was as pleasant and agreeable as on former occasions, part of the time; part of it was not; every now and then her conversation was not so agreeable; think it was coarse; she used profane language; when I left she asked me to come and see her again; th.nk I told her I would; no person to my knowledge, lived in ihe house with her at that time; I did go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>see her again; I think it was the next day; she had been to our house before I repeated my visit the second time; our interview at our house was very short; she came over for me to go back with her; I went with her; I staid there all that day; it was somewhere between the hours of eight and ten in the morning that I went; I took dinner with her; did not take tea; think I began to feel on intimate terms with Mrs. R.; this familiarity of intercourse continued for about two weeks after-wards; I visited frequently at her house, and she at ours; almost every day I saw her, but was not at her house every day; there were about four days she was not at our house, and I didn\u2019t go to hers; I had a very pleasant visit at her house the day I spent there; it was pleasant, part of the time; her conversation was pleasant, part of the time; there was something in her conversation that made it unpleasant another part of the time; don\u2019t remember what it was; it consisted in a peculiarity of language; such language as ladies don\u2019t, use; it was profane language; she used obscene words; at this time or some other, I think she said something about the man she had married; she said her husband was a contractor on the railroad; his name was Mr. Robinson; do. not recollect at which conversation it was she told me she was educated at Mrs. Willard\u2019s Seminary; think she told me at one time what her maiden name was, but I do not recollect what she said it was; when she said she was educated at a nunnery, she did not tell me where it was; never heard Mrs. Robinson speak French to any person; she told me she could speak French; Mr. Lanagan\u2019s family were Mrs. Robinson\u2019s associates; Marietta Curtiss and my sister also associated with Mrs. Robinson; another sister older than the or.e here yesterday, and older than I; Marietta Curtiss lived a short distance from my father\u2019s house; she is'a friend of mine; don\u2019t know that she ever went to Mrs. Robinson\u2019s; Mrs. Robinson used to go to her house; know of her going there only once; I have seen Mrs. Robinson drink strong beer and peppermint cordial; don\u2019t know which maybe the strongest; have frequently seen her drink strong beer; she drank some at her own house on the day I spent there, I think; won\u2019t be posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tive; I did, during these interviews, see her on qccasions when I thought she was a little worse for strong beer or peppermint cordial; don\u2019t recollect that I thought so on the night she came to our house, for my sister to go after Dr. Buswell; I thought she seemed strange,that night; I know Dr. Buswell; know Mr. Boutwell by sight; he lives on River street, next opposite to Mrs. Robinson\u2019s; I don\u2019t know that Mr. Buswell has a dam; know he has a mill; know there is a dam in the river a short distance above Mrs. R.\u2019s house; the mill is on the bank of the river, I think a quarter of a mile from the dam; it is between the dam and Mrs. Robinson\u2019s house; it was about a week after that I became acquainted with her that she told me about Boutwell\u2019s stopping the navigation; I was standing then on the bank of the river with Mrs. R.; between Mrs. R.\u2019s house , and the river, and running down to it is a vacant lot; there is a door leading from Mrs. R.\u2019s yard to this vacant lot; on the bank of the river are some rocks; we went to the bank of the river, because Mrs. R. saw a boat from her window coming down; she said Mr. Boutwell had stopped the navigation, and she didn\u2019t believe the boat could pass; Mrs. R. had been observing this boat from her window; the boat rvas below the dam, coming down the river; it was not a sail; when we first saw the boat I could see it was coming down the river; saw it from Mrs. Robinson\u2019s window; she said she didn\u2019t believe the boat could pass Mr. Boutwell\u2019s mill; I had never heard of Mr. Boutwell\u2019s stopping the navigation before Mrs. R. said so; I don\u2019t think she told me the story of poisoning the dog with Dr. Bus well\u2019s medicine at this time; it might have been the same time or afterwards that she told me about her father sending her $150 to buy a dress to appear in court against Boutwell; it was at this time on the bank of the river that she told me about her swimming; do not know that Mrs. R. can swim; had seen her drink no beer or peppermint cordial that day, that I remember of; it was some weeks after I became acquainted with her that she came to my house with no dress on, think it was in March or April, between four and five o\u2019clock in the morning; do not remember whether it was light; she put the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>dress on at our house; think it was daylight when she put it on; she told me she had forgot her dress and didn\u2019t want to go back after it;. I don\u2019t think I heard her speak of David Smith before; she said she was going to get a warrant for David for breaking into her house and stealing her revolver; said nothing about the difficulty she had with him at Lanagan\u2019s that time; it was a mousseline de laine dress I let her have; it was neither my best nor poorest dress; it was not my ordinary dress; it was such an one as I sometimes walk in; I received the dress uninjured; when Mrs. R. said it was not her husband she wanted Dr. Buswell to see, but that she wanted Dr. B. to come up there that she might shoot him, she appeared very angry; used very profane language on that occasion; called I'.im bad names; I don\u2019t wish to say what the names were; she used obscene language concerning him; I never saw Dr, B. at Mrs. R.\u2019s house; I do not wish to repeat the language she used relating to Buswell, because it was both profane and obscene language; I don\u2019t think I kept up my familiarity with her long after this time; I could not tell how long before her arrest it was that we ceased to associate together; I told her once to go home; this was after she came to our house at eleven o\u2019clock at night; the next time, she came she said she had come with a warrant for me; that I had been talking about her; there was no quarrel; there was a little dispute; we made it all up again before we parted, and she kissed me; I don\u2019t think I ever went to her house after this time; at my various visits to Mrs. R.\u2019s house, I saw Mrs. Lanagan\u2019s sister there, who just came to the door and returned again; my father came in there; he was at work in the garden; saw a man there one day; don\u2019t know who it was; had a slight glimpse at his face; he was a middle aged man; she told me at one time it was her husband; she told me again that it was another person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-5\"><em>To Mr. </em>Pierson.\u2014When Mrs; R. told me that her father was an Irish lord, I don\u2019t recollect that I thought she was in liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">Further evidence of the singular conduct of the prisoner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>introduced for the purpose of supporting her defence of insanity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\"><em>Mr. Beach </em>asked the court how it would rule in regard to the use of medical works touching insanity; if citations fromi those works should form part of the argument?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">The court said such was the usual course.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\"><em>Mr. Beach </em>stated that the evidence for the defence had now closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Some testimony was then introduced on the part of the prosecution for the purpose of explaining her conduct, by showing that the prisoner had sometimes been <em>\u201c </em>the worse for liquor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">The testimony was here closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">In the course of his charge to the jury the presiding judge said: It is my duty to say to you, gentlemen, that, if she ivas intoxicated, even to such an extent that.she was unconscious of what she was doing, still the law holds her responsible for her act. It is true to constitute the crime of murder there must be killing of a human being with a premeditated design to effect death. But this design need not be proved. Where the act is committed the law imputes the design. It proceeds upon the simple principle that a man may reasonably be presumed to intend to do what he in fact does. Thus, if a man will draw from his pocket a pistol and deliberately shoot down his fellow man, the law, without further proof, adjudges that it was in his heart to kill him. If he would excuse himself he must show affirmatively that he had no such guilty purpose. Then, and then only, can he be exonerated from guilt. If it appear that by the inscrutable visitation of Providence the faculties of his mind had become so disordered that he was no longer capable of discriminating between right and wrong in respect to the act he has committed, then the law, in its justice, pronounces him innocent of crime.

It has been adj\u00fadged that the precept must be issued to summon a petit jury, and without such precept, judgment will be arrested.

The precept was clearly not a venire, for the following among-other reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">1. The statute does not call it such, ncr invest it with the form, qualities or functions of one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">The <em>venire </em>is a common law process directed to the <em>sheriff, </em>(or coroner) commanding the summoning of a specified number of persons, (usually twelve) of certain qualifications, to make a jury in a specified cause, to determine the matters in issue therein. Each case had a separate venire. It was to be <em>returned </em>to the county clerk, and become a matter of record. The selection of the jurors was left to the sheriff. (3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>352; 1 <em>Burr. Pr. </em>227, 228.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">The inconvenience of this introduced the present mode of drawing juries by particular officers, from a list previously selected and returned by others, to make trial juries in all the cases for a particular court. The list thus drawn is <em>certified </em>and delivered to the sheriff and constitutes his authority to summon the individuals named, and upon this list he makes his return. (1 <em>R. L. </em>328, \u00a7 11.) The venire was at that time retained as a matter of form, though its office was spent. (1 <em>R.L. </em>326-7, \u00a77, 9; <em>see also </em>2 <em>R. S. </em>721, 722, 733.) But now, except in justices\u2019 courts and certain special proceedings, the venire is no longer in use, and is expressly abolished. (2 <em>R.

For, though a <em>venire </em>is issued <em>(Yates\u2019 Pl. </em>64; 1 <em>Humphrey\u2019s Prac. </em>236) to the foreign sheriff, his duty is to notify the clerk who draws the jury as in ordinary cases, makes and certifies a list of the drawing, and delivers it to the sheriff, who then summons the jurors not upon the venire, but upon the clerk\u2019s list.

The providing of another process, (the jury list) on which the sheriff was to summon and make <em>return, </em>evinces the legislative intent, that the <em>precept </em>was not intended to be either in <em>form </em>or substance the <em>venire. </em>(2 R. <em>S. </em>414, \u00a7 29, 30, <em>as to petit jur\u00f3rs; 2 R.

That case was decided under the Revised Laws, by which a <em>venire </em>was still necessary. The venire was a matter of <em>record, </em>and its absence was a defect apparent on the <em>record, </em>and <em>that </em>venire having no <em>seal </em>was <em>nugatory. </em>But that <em>venire </em>was a different process from the <em>precept.

It loses sight of <em>other </em>differences between the precept and the venire, (e. g.)

Again trial jurors are not summoned for the <em>Oyer and Terminer </em>but only for the <em>Circuit; </em>and the Circuit jurors are declared to be jurors for the Oyer and Terminer. Now the district attorney\u2019s <em>precept, </em>if it is to be regarded as a <em>venire, </em>would command the summoning of jurors for the Oyer and Terminer and for that alone, and this is contrary to the statute just referred to. <em>(See </em>2 <em>R.

The objection of the want of a <em>precept </em>is in the nature of a <em>challenge to the array, </em>and this challenge (to a grand jury) \u2022 is abolished by statute, and with it must fall the incidents and elements of this species of challenge.

Now being obtained in a different way, that provision was abolished, and a <em>precept </em>was unnecessary. Hence its abolition by 2 <em>R. S. </em>724; <em>See Notes of Revisers, </em>(3 <em>R.

The statute as to the precept, no doubt, was merely <em>directory. </em>It was not <em>necessary </em>for the sheriff, nor to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>jurisdiction of parties or subject matter, or jurors. It gave no new or additional power, and imposed no duties that were not otherwise imposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">VII.

No such objection can touch the validity of the indictment, <em>after trial. </em>The judgment record begins with the <em>indictment. </em>If that is not <em>quashed, </em>or is hot bad <em>upon its face, </em>it operates as a solid foundation stone for the judgment. Before trial it may be set aside, but not after. It does not affect the guilt or innocence of the accused. Unless impeached at the proper time, like every other record, it imports absolute verity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hulbert, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>133; <em>Peopled. Griffin, 2 Barb. </em>427.) So also in regard to a trial jury. <em>(Dayharsh </em>v. <em>Enos, </em>1 <em>Selden, </em>531; 2 <em>R.

' Hence the requirement of the district attorney\u2019s precept to the sheriff as a matter of <em>precaution </em>to <em>ensure </em>notice of the <em>time and place </em>of holding same. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>It was no more a <em>venire </em>than the <em>clerk\u2019s list </em>or the <em>statute </em>itself, although it directed the summoning of jurors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"195\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\"><em>2. </em>After the constitution of 1821, the terms of circuits and of Oyer and Terminer were fixed for two years in advance, by appointments of the circuit judges, which were notified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"196\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">(1.)

If the precept applies to the <em>stated </em>terms, then the district attorney, must, without delay, issue <em>precepts </em>for <em>each </em>of the terms embraced in the appointments; and the sheriff must, in like manner, publish his <em>proclamations </em>for <em>each </em>of said terms, making numerous publications and heavy expenditures.

This is in accordance with all the authorities. <em>(Coke Litt. </em>247; 1 <em>Russ, on Crimes, </em>7, 8; 4 <em>Black. Com. </em>26; <em>Roscoe\u2019s Cr. Ev. </em>783; 1 <em>Arch. Cr. Pl.

By the common law it was necessary in all cases to establish the existence of <em>malice, \u201c </em>malice aforethought,\u201d in order to constitute murder. It was an essential ingredient of the crime. <em>(See above cases.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"219\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-9\">3. It is equally clear that by the common law, voluntary, intoxication, even when carried to such an extent as to deprive a party temporarily of reason, did not mitigate, but rather aggravated the crime. It was still <em>murder; </em>and it was so pronounced, not precisely because it necessarily implied the existence of malice, but principally from motives of public policy, because such a construction was essential to the safety and j protection of the citizen. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>5 <em>Mason, </em>28.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>McGluz, </em>1 <em>Curtis, </em>1; 1 <em>Beck\u2019s Medical Juris. </em>627; <em>Cornwell </em>v. <em>The State, Martin &amp; Yerger, </em>157; <em>Swan </em>v. <em>The State, </em>4 <em>Humph. </em>136.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"220\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-11\">4.

The language of <em>this </em>section, as reported by them, is precisely like that adopted by the legislature, except the word \u201c other.\u201d Their intention was in this particular, in defining the crime, to make <em>\u201c </em>no departure from the present law,\u201d by changing the phraseology. <em>(See Revisers\u2019 Notes to this section, </em>3 <em>R.

The words \u201c premeditated design,\u201d have the sam\u00e9 meaning as \u201c malice aforethought.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark,. </em>3 <em>Selden, </em>385; <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>The State, </em>8 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>418; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, </em>24 <em>Wend. </em>552.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"224\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\">In this case the court say: \u201cIn its definition of murder, our statute (Mississippi) instead of \u201c malice aforethought,\u201d uses the words \u201c prem\u00e9ditated design.\u201d In legal effect we regard them as the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"225\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-6\">(3.) The same principles of public policy and legal construction, which before the Revised Statutes made the drunken homicide (though temporarily bereft of reason) sufficiently chargeable with \u201c malice aforethought,\u201d to make the killing <em>murder, </em>also charge him now with \u201c premeditated design,\u201d and a murderous intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"226\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-7\">(4.) If the intoxication of the prisoner exculpates, her from the charge of murder, it exempts her from punishment <em>entirely, </em>or at most, makes her crime manslaughter in the fourth degree, which may be punished by a merely <em>nominal </em>fine or imprisonment in a cohhty jail. (2 <em>R. S. </em>662, 663.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"227\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-8\">(5.) The indictment is under the common law form, charging the act to have been done with <em>malice aforethought, </em>and this is proper. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Enoch, </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>159; <em>People </em>v. <em>White, 22 Wend. </em>176; 24 <em>id. </em>537, 571.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"228\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-9\">And the proof required to bring the case within the present statutory definition of the offence is-no more than was necessary under the former law. <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 <em>Selden, </em>385.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"229\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">Hence the old authorities apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"230\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-11\">(6.) The true test of criminal responsibility for murder, (except in cases of fixed or habit.ua! insanity) is to be sought for in the <em>nature </em>and <em>characteristics </em>of the act of homicide, and the <em>means </em>by which it is perpetrated. If these indicate <em>malice </em>and ah <em>intent </em>to kill, the crime is perfect, without reference to the state of <em>sobriety </em>or <em>intoxication </em>of the accused party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"231\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-12\">(7.) The cases decided under the laws of other states, where different degrees of murder obtain, do not necessarily <em>conflict </em>with the views abov\u00e9 expressed, and should not <em>control </em>this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"232\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>(a.)

They merely decide that evidence of the <em>fact </em>and <em>degree </em>of intoxication is proper for the <em>consideration o\u00ed </em>the jury to enable them to judge of the quality of the act.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM2\">In charging the jury, the learned judge made use of the following expression. <em>\u201c </em>It is my duty to say to you, gentlemen, that if she (the prisoner) was intoxicated to such an extent that she was unconscious of what she was doing, still the law holds her responsible for her act.\u201d And afterwards in another portion of the charge, the judge said, \u201c though the prisoner may have been excited by strong drink at the time of the alleged offence, even to such an extent as not to know what she was doing, she must answer for the consequences; her self-inflicted insanity must not be allowed to avail her for her defence. The law still imputes to her a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>murderous intent. Exceptions were taken by the prisoner\u2019s counsel to each of these parts of the charge, and their alleged erroneousness constitutes the first ground on which they now rely for a reversal of the proceedings of the Oyer and Terminer.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">If the proposition, that the law would hold the prisoner responsible for her act though she was intoxicated to such an extent that she was unconscious of what she was doing, stood alone and unexplained by the context, so as to be distinctly presented for adjudication, I should have no hesitation in saying that it could not be sustained, for by conceding the unconsciousness of the prisoner it contains within itself, a relinquishment of the legal presumption, that the prisoner must have intended the natural consequences of her own acts. It would, therefore, condemn the act as the result of premeditated design, when it concedes on its face that none existed. The proposition standing by itself, would apply to a person reduced by intoxication to a state of insensibility; and would impute to him a premeditated design to take life, if he should by chance kill a person by stumbling against him or by rolling against him in a gutter. It would convict of murder a drunken mother, who should smother her infant in her embrace, or by overlying it in bed, however strong might have been her affection for her offspring. It is hardly necessary to say, that no sound legal construction could bring such a transaction within the statute definition of murder, which requires, in all cases like that now before us, a premeditated design to effect death. (2 <em>R. S. </em>657, \u00a7 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">But it is apparent that it was not the intention of the judge to lay down any such proposition. The portion of the charge excepted to must be considered with reference to the facts of the case, and in connection with other parts of the charge which are necessary to a proper understanding of its import and meaning. The offence charged was that of murder by administering poison. The defence principally relied upon was insanity. It was not claimed, nor was there any evidence to warrant a claim, that the prisoner was so much intoxicated as to be bereft of her senses or unconscious of what she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>doing. On the contrary, design was apparent throughout the whole transaction. Whether that design was conceived and entertained by a mind sober or excited by strong drink, was not material, and whether by a mind sane or insane, was a proper subject for the consideration of the jury. The whole charge taken together shows, I think, that when the judge said the law would still hold the prisoner responsible, for her act, though she was intoxicated to such an extent as to be unconscious of what she was doing, he had reference, not to a state of insensibility, but to a state of excitement or madness, the immediate consequence of indulgence in strong drinks. For, after putting a case by way of illustration, inconsistent with the construction claimed by the prisoner\u2019s counsel, and then stating that if it appeared that by the inscrutable visitation of Providence, the faculties of a man had become so disordered that he was no longer capable of discriminating between right and wrong, in respect to the act he had committed, then the law would pronounce him innocent of crime, he added: \u201c But if his derangement be voluntary\u2014if his madness be self-invited \u2014the law will not hear him when he makes his intoxication his plea to excuse him from punishment.\u201d The whole of this portion of the charge taken together and the explanation contained in the other part of the charge excepted to, show, very satisfactorily, that the judge intended only to charge, that self-inflicted insanity, the immediate consequence of drink, would constitute no defence; and it could, I think, have been understood by the jury in no other sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">To that extent, the rule has long been established at common law. (4 <em>Coke, </em>125; 1 <em>Co. Litt. </em>247; 1 <em>Hale, </em>31; 4 <em>Black. Com. </em>26.) \u201c A drunkard \u201d says Lord Coke, \u201c hath no privilege thereby; but what hurt or ill soever he doeth, his drunkenness doth aggravate.\u201d <em>(Coke Litt. </em>247.) Russell says, (1 <em>Russ, on Cr. </em>7,) \u201cwith respect to a person <em>non compos mentis </em>from drunkenness, a species of madness which has been termed <em>dementia affectata, </em>it is a settled rule, that if the drunkenness be voluntary, it can not excuse a man from the commission of any crime, but on the contrary must be considered an aggravation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>of whatever he does amiss.\u201d \u201c <em>Nam omne crimen ebrietas incendit et detegit \u201d </em>has become a maxim of the law. (4 <em>Black. Com. </em>26.) The rule is otherwise when the drunkenness is not voluntary; as if a person by the unskillfulness of his physician, or by the contrivance of others, and without any volition or. his own part, eat or drink such a thing as causes frenzy, this puts him in the same condition as other insane persons, and equally excuses him. <em>(Barb. Cr. L. </em>268.) And in cases of <em>delirium tremens </em>or <em>mania apotu, </em>the insanity excuses the act, the frenzy being, not the immediate effect of indulgence in strong drink, but a remote consequence superinduced by antecedent drunkenness. (B<em>arb. Cr. L. </em>268; <em>Dean\u2019s Med. Jur. </em>587; 3 <em>Am. </em>Jurist? 5, 20.) These general principles are fully recognized in the modern English cases, <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>7 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>145; <em>R. </em>v, <em>Meakin, id. </em>297; <em>Burrow\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Lewin C. C. </em>75; <em>Rennie\u2019s case, id. </em>76; <em>R. </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>8 <em>Car. &amp; P.820,) </em>and also in decisions in this country, <em>(McDonough\u2019s case, Ryon Med. J. </em>294; <em>cases cited in </em>1 <em>Beck\u2019s Med. Jur. </em>627; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>State, Mart. &amp; Yerg. </em>133; <em>Cornwell </em>v. <em>State, id. </em>147; <em>Schuller </em>v. <em>State, </em>14 <em>Miss. </em>502; 6 <em>Law Rep. n. s. </em>563; 1 <em>Wright\u2019s Ohio Rep. </em>30; 8 <em>Iredell, </em>330; <em>Wilson\u2019s case and Birdsall\u2019s case, reported in Ray\u2019s Med. Jur. </em>\u00a7 405, 406; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 <em>Smedes &amp; Marsh, </em>518; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Clarke, 2 Cranch C. C. R. </em>158; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>McGhee, </em>1 <em>Curtis C. C. R. </em>1; <em>State </em>v. <em>John. </em>8 <em>Ired. </em>330; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Drew, 5 Mason, </em>28.) In the latter case, Mr. Justice Story'reiterates and approves all the rules above quoted: At common law, therefore, there can be no doubt of the correctness of the charge on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">But it is supposed our statute has so far changed the common law definition of murder as to be inconsistent with the proposition that drunkenness does not excuse but aggravates the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In those states in which murder has'been divided by statute into degrees, it has been held, that if the accused was intoxicated to such an extent' as to deprive him of the power to form a design, the offence would be no more than murder in the second degree. In Pennsylvania, murder in the first degree is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>where the offence is perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, or by any other willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, and is punishable with death. Murder in the second degree, in that state, embraces \u201c all other kinds of murder,\u201d and' is punishable by solitary confinement, at labor in the penitentiary. <em>{Perm. Stat. </em>1794.) In that state, it was held in the case of Haggerty, tried at the Lancaster Oyer and Terminer in 1847, that the prisoner could not be convicted in the first degree, if deprived by voluntary intoxication, of the power to form a deliberate design- to perpetrate the act. The very able charge of the learned President Judge in that case will be found reported at length in <em>Lewis\u2019s U. S. Cr. Law, 402. </em>A similar opinion was expressed by Mr. Justice Daniel in the <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, (1 Leigh, </em>612,) the statute of Virginia, on the subject of murder, being substantially like that of Pennsylvania. (Vir<em>ginia Stat. </em>1796.) In Tennessee also, where a like division of murder into degrees is made by statute, it was held in <em>Haile </em>v. <em>The State, </em>(11 <em>Humph. </em>154,) that in all cases where the question is between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree, the fact of drunkenness may be proved, to shed light' upon the state of mind of the defendant, so as to enable the jury to determine whether the killing sprung from a premeditated purpose, or from passion excited by inadequate provocation; and the degree of drunkenness need not be such that it deprives the defendant of the capacity to form a deliberate and premeditated design to take life. All these cases proceed upon the principle expressly declared by Judge Reese in <em>Swan </em>v. <em>The State, </em>(4 <em>Humph. </em>136,) that although drunkenness, in point of law, constitutes no excuse or justification for crime, still when the nature and essence of a crime are made to depend upon the peculiar state and condition of the criminal\u2019s mind at the time, and with reference to the act 'done, drunkenness may be a proper subject for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">All these decisions to which I have referred, as being made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>in states where, by statute, murder is divided into degrees, were made in cases where death was caused by violence and where it became necessary to ascertain whether the act was deliberate and premeditated, so as to fall within the first degree. I am by no means prepared to hold that it might not be proper under our own statute to show the degree of drunk enness of the accused, for the purpose of ascertaining whether he had the power to premeditate the act, though, in the case of Haggerty above cited, Lewis, J., expresses the opinion that it is only in those states where murder is divided into degrees that drunkenness \u2019 can be set up as a defence. <em>(Lewis'\u2019 Cr. L. </em>405.) Our statute has not divided the crime of murder into degrees, but it has limited and defined the offence; and a case can not be brought within the first subdivision of the section unless there be a premeditated design, in fact, to effect the death of the person killed or of some human being. The proposition laid down in <em>Swan </em>v. <em>The </em>State, seems to me to be incontrovertible and to be universally applicable, viz: that-where the nature and essence of the crime are made by law to depend upon the peculiar state and condition of the criminal\u2019s mind at the time with reference to the act done, drunkenness may be a proper subject for the consideration of the jury, not to excuse or mitigate the offence but to show that it was not committed. There are many cases recognizing this distinction. <em>(Rex </em>v. Grindley, 1 <em>Russ, on Cr. </em>7, <em>subsequently questioned in Rex </em>v. <em>Carrol, 7 Car. &amp; P. </em>145; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Moore, cited </em>6 <em>Law Rep. </em>N. S. 561; <em>Marshall\u2019s case, </em>1 <em>Lewin C. C. </em>76; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Cruse, </em>8 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>541; <em>Pigman </em>v. <em>The State, </em>14 <em>Ohio, </em>555; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Thomas, 7 Car. &amp; P. 817; Rex </em>v. <em>Meakin, ib. </em>297; <em>Pirtle </em>v. <em>The State, </em>9 <em>Humph. </em>663; <em>Add. Rep. </em>257; <em>Wharton\u2019s Law of Homicide, </em>369; <em>Wharton\u2019s Cr. L. </em>92.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">But it is only in cases where death is caused by personal violence that it becomes necessary even in those states where murder is divided into degrees to inquire whether the act was deliberate and premeditated, for the purpose of ascertaining the degree. For in all these states \u201c poisoning \u201d is specially placed under the head of murder in the first degree. Even in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Pennsylvania, Virginia and Tennessee, the defence of drunkenness could not, if proved, reduce the offence to murder in the second degree. The very term \u201c poisoning \u201d implies design and could not be criminally committed by a person in such a state of mind as to preclude premeditation. No case could possibly occur in which the act could be perpetrated by a person in a state of insensibility from intoxication; and the degree of drunkenness, if less than that, would not be a material subject for inquiry, for if there were enough mind left to conceive and perpetrate the act, there would be enough to subject the offender to legal responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u2022 If, in the case before us, the prisoner mingled arsenic with the drink of Lanagan for the purpose of effecting his death, or the death of any other person, she was guilty of murder, though excited, no matter to what degree, by intoxication at the time. There was no pretence that the mingling of the poison was the result of accident, but the most satisfactory evidence to the contrary. A person, stimulated even to the highest pitch of frenzy by strong drink, may still be capable of planning and executing a criminal design, and in such case, it is quite clear, that neither under our statute, any more than at common law, can drunkenness be alleged as an excuse for the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">If I am right therefore in the construction I have put upon the language of the charge, no error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">If I am wrong in that construction, and, if the abstract proposition excepted to can not properly be considered as modified and explained by other parts of the charge, still it seems to me the exception taken is not available under the decision of the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Shorter </em>v. <em>The People, </em>(2 <em>Comst. </em>173.) The proposition excepted to standing alone and as interpreted by th\u00e9 prisoner\u2019s counsel had no applicability whatever to the case, and could have no influence on the minds of the jury. There was not a fact or circumstance in the case to warrant an inference that the accused was in a state of unconsciousness or insensibility from intoxication. No case was presented calling for any expression of opinion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>such a state of mind. If' therefore the charge was erroneous in that respect, under the authority last cited, it would not furnish a legal ground for awarding a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">It is secondly alleged for error, by the counsel for the pri soner, that the omission of the district attorney to issue a precept to-the sheriff of Rensselaer county, twenty days before the Court of Oyer and Terminer was held, requiring him, among other things, to summon a grand jury, was an omission fatal to the conviction in this case. This objection applies only to the grand jury, and not to the petit jury, before \"whom the issue was tried at a subsequent court. It is not claimed that there was any irregularity in drawing or summoning the grand' jury. There has been no omission at all affecting the substantial rights of the prisoner. Every thing was done by the sheriff which he would have done if a precept had been issued' and as he would have done it. At most, therefore, the objection is merely technical and was not made in form until since conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In the view that I take of this objection, I do not propose to examine or decide whether the requirement of the statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>206, \u00a7 37) is applicable to the stated courts of Oyer and Terminer or only to extraordinary courts of Oyer and Terminer and jail delivery, specially appointed: nor whether,, if applicable to the former, it is intended to take the place of the <em>venire, </em>with all the incidents belonging to that process at common law, or is merely directory; nor the other questions which were so fully and ably discussed by counsel on the argument and which would properly have arisen before the court of Oyer and Terminer on a plea in abatement or a motion to quash the indictment for the alleged defect. Independent of these questions, it seems to me to be an obvious and conclusive answer to the supposed error that it is too late now to make the objection. The most that can be claimed for the alleged defect is, that it was an irregularity in the proceeding to organize the grand jury in no respect bringing in question the qualifications of the grand jurors or their fairness towards the accused. No injustice has been done to the prisoner. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>now, after pleading to the merits, and after trial and conviction, this mere irregularity is for the first time suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">No adjudged case has been brought to our notice in which it has been held that the want of a precept as to the grand jury was available after verdict. In the <em>People </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>recently decided in the fifth judicial district, such an opinion was expressed by Pratt, J., but the decision of the court in that case, as well as in the <em>People </em>v. <em>McKay, </em>(18 <em>John R. </em>212,) was put solely upon the ground that the petit jury by which the cause was tried was summoned without a <em>precept </em>or <em>venire. </em>In the <em>State </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>(2 <em>Southard Rep. </em>539,) the question arose on a motion to quash the indictment, and the defendant was permitted to withdraw his plea of not guilty, to enable him to make the motion. So, too, in the <em>State </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>(1 <em>Spencer R. </em>218,) the question was presented on a motion to quash the indictment. In both these cases- the indictment was quashed on the ground that the grand jury was summoned by the sheriff without process. In the <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>(1 <em>Rich. Rep. </em>188,) and the <em>State </em>v. <em>Dozier, </em>(2 <em>Speers R. </em>211,) motions were made in arrest of judgment, on the ground that both the grand and petit juries were summoned by writs of <em>venire </em>without seals. According to all the authorities cited on this point, it was a sufficient reason for arresting the judgments -in those cases that there was no valid <em>venire </em>for the petit jury, and the motions would have been granted without reference to the grand jury. When the indictment is sufficient on its face, there seems to me good reason for not going back of the petit jury and the trial, in inquiring, after conviction, into the regularity of the proceedings. There is here no question of jurisdiction. The court had jurisdiction both of the person and of the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The statute has limited the grounds of challenge to individual grand jurors and required such challenges to be made before the jurors are sworn, (2 <em>R. S. 724, </em>\u00a7 27,) and <em>(id. </em>\u00a7 28) it has abolished challenges of grand jurors to the array. Judge Nelson is said to have held in the Circuit Court of the U. S. in the- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>\u201c Jerry rescue\u201d </em>cases, that by taking away the right to challenge grand jurors to the array, the statute had, by implication, taken away the right to raise the objection in any form. But, in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>Mr. Justice Pratt expresses his dissent from such a conclusion. At the least, I think it is fair to say that the statute seems to discourage objections to the grand jury, who can do no more than make the accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We are not without authority for holding that it is too late to raise a question of this character, for the first time, after conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In the <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>( 2 <em>Barb. S. C. R. </em>427,) after the petit jury had been impanneled and the case on the part of the people had been gone through with, the defendant sought to avail himself of the objections, that the presiding judge was not present when the clerk administered the oath to the grand jury who found the hill of indictment, and that the required oath was not administered at all to some of the grand jurors: but the Supreme Court said \u201cthe objection was clearly too late,, and it would have been unprecedented to allow this collateral issue to be raised at so late a period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">In <em>Wa-Kon-chaw-neck-Kaw </em>v. <em>The United, States, </em>(1 <em>Morris Iowa Rep. </em>332,) one of the grounds of error was that the record did not show that the indictment was endorsed by the foreman of the grand jury as \u201c a true bill; \u201d and it was held, that the endorsement required by statute was merely directory, and that if there was other proof on the record that the grand jury returned the bill, it was sufficient. That the object of the bill of indictment was merely to put the party accused upon his trial, and that after a defendant had so far admitted the sufficiency of the indictment as to consent to go to trial, especially after the unanimous verdict of the petit jury, it was too late to question the irregularity of the proceedings\u2019 by which he was put on trial. In that case the court refused to \"follow the decision in <em>Webster's case </em>(5 <em>Greenleaf, </em>432,) where a similar omission was held fatal on motion in arrest, the court in Maine having treated it as a defective indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In the <em>State </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>(5 <em>Iredell, R. </em>96) and <em>State </em>v. <em>Duncan, (ib. </em>98.) a new trial was moved for, on the ground that the grand jury had been drawn by a boy of thirteen years of age, in violation of the statute, and that such illegal drawing might have affected the composition of the petit jury, and it was decided that the objection, if a valid one at any time, came too late, and that it should have been made before the petit jury was sworn, in the form of a challenge to the array.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">And it seems to be well settled in most of the states that an objection to the qualification of grand jurors, or to the mode of summoning or impanneling them, must be made by a motion to quash or by a plea in abatement, before pleading in bar. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Martin, 2 Iredell, </em>101; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamon, 3 Hawks, </em>175; <em>State </em>v. <em>Herndon, </em>5 <em>Blackf. </em>75; <em>Vattell </em>v. <em>State, </em>4 <em>ib. </em>72; <em>State </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>6 <em>ib. </em>248; <em>State </em>v. <em>Seaborn, </em>4 <em>Dev. </em>305. On this subject see also, <em>Wharton's Cr. L. 3d ed. </em>226, 229, 975; <em>Arch. Cr. Pl. </em>67; 9 <em>Mass. </em>107; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Chauncey, 2 Ashmead, </em>90.) By our statute (2 <em>R. S. </em>728,) no trial, judgment or proceeding on an indictment <em>can </em>be affected by reason of any defect or impefection in matters of form which shall not tend to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Having came to the conclusions above expressed, this case presents no point in our judgment, which would require, cr authorize this court to grant a new trial. It may be, as is claimed by the defence, that the evidence of insanity strengthened by the absence of any apparent motive for the act called for a different verdict, but if the jury erred on that question of fact, this court has no power to correct the error. The only remedy for such a mistake lies with the Oyer and Terminer, on a motion for a new trial, (1 <em>Park. C. R. </em>625,) or with the executive, on an application for pardon.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Proceedings of the Oyer and Terminer affirmed and order made that the indictment, bill of exceptions, and all the proceedings be remitted to the court below, to the end that judgment might be rendered on the verdict.
