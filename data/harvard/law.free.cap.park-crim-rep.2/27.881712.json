She and her husband were transient persons and foreigners, and there were strong reasons to believe they had been hired to go off by the friends of the prisoner. Brown, the principal witness, who resided in Canada, had been offered a sum of money if he would \"not appear against the accused. Brown testified that in passing along the road, in a retired place near evening, he heard -the cries of a woman for help. Passing over a small hillock in the road, he discovered the prisoner who had hold of <em>Mrs. Cubes, </em>and was apparently attempting to drag her into a small piece of woods adjoining the road. She was screaming and appeared much frightened. \"When the witness came up, she requested him, though a stranger, to go with her to her residence. The prisoner ordered the witness to be off; who thereupon called for assistance to others who came in sight, and the prisoner on discovering them, fled into the woods.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>J.

This is only a question of intention. That question the jury must determine from the cireumstahces of the case. And I can hardly imagine how they could he made stronger, if the woman was herself a witness. If she could explain these circumstances so as to make them consistent with the innocence of the prisoner, it was his duty to procure her attendance at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The jury found the prisoner guilty, and he was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment, in the state prison.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
