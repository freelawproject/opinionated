In their petition for review, the petitioners argue that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s order because they had demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). We have jurisdiction only over a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed within 30 days. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1). The BIA\u2019s dismissal of the petitioners\u2019 appeal in its initial order was a final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). The petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review of the final order of removal. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1543-44, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Because the petitioners did not file their petition for review until September 6, 2005, more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s initial order dated May 20, 2005, their petition was not timely, and we lack jurisdiction to review this order. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Accordingly, to the extent that the petitioners are seeking review of the BIA\u2019s initial order, the petition for review is dismissed, in part, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Because the petition for review is timely with respect to the BIA\u2019s order denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen or reconsider, which constitutes a separate final order, we have jurisdiction to review that order. <em>See Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394-95, 115 S.Ct. at 1543-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">We conclude that the petitioners have abandoned any claims they may have had regarding that order by failing to raise any argument concerning the denial of their motion to reopen or reconsider in their brief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). The petitioners\u2019 brief contains no law relevant to a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, and there is no argument as to why the BIA\u2019s denial of the petitioners\u2019 motion was erroneous. In addition, although the IJ considered petitioners\u2019 asylum application on the merits, it also found that the application was untimely. The BIA affirmed this finding, and we therefore have no jurisdiction over any challenge to the denial of the asylum application. <em>See Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Furthermore, even if we had jurisdiction and petitioners had not abandoned their arguments, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion because petitioners have failed to demonstrate that they had any new material evidence that was not considered by the IJ and reviewed by the BIA and have failed to establish that the BIA made any errors of fact or law in its prior decision. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir. 2003); <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. Accordingly, the petition for review is denied, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED in part, and DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
