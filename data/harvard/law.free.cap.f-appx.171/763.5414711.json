Hurtado argues that (1) the district court violated his rights to trial by jury and due process, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by declining to apply a four-level reduction for Hurtado\u2019s minimal role in the conspiracy and (2) the district court clearly erred by denying the reduction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>In October 2004, the U.S. Coast Guard observed <em>Aventurero, </em>a fishing boat, refueling an unnamed \u201cgo-fast\u201d vessel in international waters in the Pacific Ocean. The Coast Guard suspected that the go-fast vessel was being used to transport cocaine into the United States and boarded the vessel to inspect its cargo. The Coast Guard discovered 2193 kilograms of cocaine and arrested the five-member crew. The following day, the Coast Guard boarded the <em>Aventurero, </em>found five 55-gallon fuel drums \u2014 four empty and one full\u2014 along with hoses, pumps, and towlines, and arrested the seven men on board, including Hurtado. All 12 men were indicted on two counts: possession with intent to distribute cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1903(a), (j). Hurtado pleaded guilty to both charges on January 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">At his sentencing hearing, Hurtado conceded the factual account of the presentence investigation report. Hurtado objected to the failure of the report to recommend a four-level reduction for being a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the conspiracy but did not argue that failure to apply the reduction would violate the Constitution. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). The district court overruled Hurtado\u2019s objection but granted a two-level reduction for being a \u201cminor participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). The district court calculated Hurtado\u2019s total offense level to be 27 and his advisory guidelines range to be 70 to 87 months of imprisonment and sentenced Hurtado to 70 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a sentence, <em>see United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005), but where the defendant fails to preserve his argument for appeal, we reverse for plain error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">We first address Hurtado\u2019s constitutional challenge to his sentence. Hurtado argues that the district court violated his rights to trial by jury and due process by failing to reduce his sentence for being a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the conspiracy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.2(a). Hurtado contends that <em>Booker </em>prohibits the district court from \u201cfinding that Mr. Hurtado was more than a minimal participant\u201d because Hurtado \u201cdid not admit to being anything more than a minimal participant\u201d and \u201cit was not found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">We have held that <em>Booked </em>s prohibition against extra-verdict enhancements is dependent on the mandatory nature of the guidelines. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331 <em>(\u201cBooker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d). Even if the failure to grant a reduction under section 3B1.2(a) could be viewed as an \u201cenhancement,\u201d the district court sentenced Hurtado under an advisory guidelines scheme. Because the district court did not consider the guidelines to be mandatory, Hurtado\u2019s sentence does not violate <em>Booker. See id. </em>The district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Hurtado also argues that the denial of a reduction for being a \u201cminimal participant\u201d was clearly erroneous. We disagree. Section 3B1.2(a) provides, \u201cIf the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.2(a). To qualify for this reduction, the defendant must be \u201cplainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a <em>group.\u201d Id. </em>cmt. 4. We require the defendant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he played a \u201crelatively minor role in the conduct\u201d and that his \u201crelative culpability vis-a-vis that of any other participants\u201d was minimal. <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>289 F.3d 1339, 1348-49 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The district court did not clearly err by finding Hurtado was not a \u201cminimal participant\u201d under section 3B1.2. Hurtado admitted that he helped to refuel a boat containing nearly 2200 kilograms of cocaine, and the district court correctly considered the amount of cocaine in determining Hurtado\u2019s culpability. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943. Further, Hurtado failed to present evidence that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant,\u201d but instead argued that some others were more culpable. The district court properly looked to all members of the conspiracy to which Hurtado pleaded guilty and found Hurtado no less culpable than the other crew members of the <em>Aventurero. </em>Because Hurtado did not satisfy his burden of proving that he was \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,\u201d the district court did not clearly err in denying the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Hurtado\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
