Martyak appeals an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to his ex-wife, Judith A. Martyak, for Mr. Martyak\u2019s improper removal of a state case to federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">In 1991, Judith A. Martyak initiated dissolution of marriage proceedings in Florida state court against Mr. Martyak, and alimony was awarded in favor of Ms. Mart-yak. Mr. Martyak brought several appeals in Florida courts challenging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>judgment, but the award of alimony was affirmed in each appeal. In August 2005, Mr. Martyak filed a notice of removal in federal district court and sought reversal of the alimony award on the ground that it violated several provisions of the U.S. Constitution. The district court concluded that Mr. Martyak\u2019s claims sought federal review of a final state court judgment and it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1311, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). The district court remanded the case to state court and, because Mr. Martyak sought removal in violation of well-settled law, ordered Mr. Martyak to pay Ms. Martyak $8850 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We review an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Fowler v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>915 F.2d 616, 617 (11th Cir.1990). Section 1447(c) provides, \u201cAn order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1447(c). \u201cCentral to the determination of whether attorneys\u2019 fees should be granted is the propriety of the defendant\u2019s decision to remove.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Amfels, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 585, 587 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Mr. Martyak\u2019s removal of the case was clearly improper. \u201c[A] United States District Court has no authority to review final judgments of a state court in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 466 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482, 103 S.Ct. at 1315). The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
