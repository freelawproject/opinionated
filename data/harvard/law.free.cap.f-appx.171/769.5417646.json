Sinquefield was prosecuted in a Georgia superior court pursuant to a grand jury indictment for computer theft and computer trespass in violation of O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 16-9-93(a) and (b), and exonerated when the trial judge directed a verdict of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case. Claiming that her prosecution was malicious and selective (on account of her race, black), Sinquefield seeks damages against the County, a number of County Commissioners, and two county employees for violating her rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and state common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On September 12, 2005, the district court entered an order granting the defendants summary judgment on Sinquefield\u2019s federal claims and dismissing her state law claims without prejudice. Sinquefield now appeals. She contends that the district court erred because the material fact issues remain to be litigated on whether she was \u201cseized\u201d in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments; selectively prosecuted on account of her race; and denied due process because the defendants failed to provide her with a name-clearing hearing before they pursued criminal allegations against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We find no merit in Sinquefield\u2019s appeal. As the district court observed in its September 25 order, the material facts are not in dispute. We conclude that the court correctly analyzed Sinquefield\u2019s federal claims and properly applied the legal precedent in disposing of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
