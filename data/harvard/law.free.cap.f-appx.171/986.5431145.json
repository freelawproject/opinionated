Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>398 F.3d 306 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2558, 162 L.Ed.2d 285 (2005). Washington was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm after Joseph Gilmore called the police alleging that Washington had assaulted him. Gilmore led Baltimore City Police Officer Todd Tugya to Washington\u2019s home at 3037 Monument Avenue. At trial, Officer Tugya identified Washington as the man who opened the door holding a loaded handgun, then dropped the gun and fled. Gilmore later recanted his statements to police and his identification of Washington from a photo array, claiming that he had been coerced by the police. Mrs. Washington testified at trial that James Hill, another man with whom she was romantically involved, was at her house that night and that Washington had moved out some time earlier. The district court determined on remand, as at the first sentencing hearing, that Washington obstructed justice by suborning his wife\u2019s perjured trial testimony. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2004). Washington contends that the district court erred in so finding. For the reasons explained below, we affirm the district court\u2019s determination that Washington obstructed justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-18\">The government suggests that, in light of <em>Booker, </em>this court need not review the district court\u2019s decision to enhance Washington\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3C1.1 because the ultimate sentence was reasonable. However, after <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe district court must consider the correct guideline range before imposing a sentence.... \u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 556 (4th Cir.2005). Therefore, we will address the propriety of the \u00a7 3C1.1 adjustment. We review the court\u2019s fact finding concerning obstruction of justice for clear error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Obstruction of justice includes \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)). Obstruction of justice is not defined in the guidelines. Application Note 3 to \u00a7 3C1.1 states that \u201c[obstructive conduct can vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness.\u201d Application Note 4 provides a \u201cnon-exhaustive list of examples of the types of conduct\u201d to which the adjustment applies. The list includes, but is not limited to, \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)). Subornation of perjury consists of three elements: (1) \u201cthe suborner should have known or believed or have had good reason to believe that the testimony given would be false;\u201d (2) \u201cshould have known or believed that the witness would testify willfully and corruptly, and with knowledge of the falsity;\u201d and (3) have \u201cknowingly and willfully induced or procured the witness to give false testimony.\u201d <em>Petite v. United States, </em>262 F.2d 788, 794 (4th Cir. 1959), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>361 U.S. 529, 80 S.Ct. 450, 4 L.Ed.2d 490 (1960); <em>see also United States v. Heater, </em>63 F.3d 311, 320 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cSubornation of perjury consists of procuring or instigating another to commit perjury.\u201d). On remand, Washington\u2019s attorney conceded, albeit reluctantly, that the first two elements \u201cwere probably met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The district court inferred that Washington took an active part in procuring his wife\u2019s false testimony, although there was no direct evidence that Washington had instigated his wife\u2019s testimony. The court based its determination in part on its belief that Washington knew in advance that she would give false testimony, in part on Washington\u2019s marital relationship with his wife, and in part on its belief that Washington had influenced Gilmore to keep him from testifying for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">We noted previously that the case presented a question unresolved in this Circuit: \u201cwhether the calling of a witness whom the defendant knows will testify falsely could constitute obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1,\u201d <em>Washington, </em>398 F.3d at 313 n. 8. Several circuits have upheld an adjustment for obstruction of justice in this circumstance, based in each case on an inference that the defendant suborned the false testimony. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Avila, </em>322 F.3d 505, 507 (8th Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>159 F.3d 1106, 1112-13 (7th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Lowder, </em>148 F.3d 548, 552-53 (5th Cir.1998). We conclude from these decisions that the district court\u2019s determination that Washington obstructed justice by knowingly calling his wife to give perjured testimony could be affirmed if the court\u2019s factual finding is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">However, we need not reach the question of whether Washington suborned his wife\u2019s perjury. In the circumstances of this ease, the district court\u2019s determination that Washington knowingly based his defense on his wife\u2019s perjured testimony is not clearly erroneous and is sufficient to warrant the adjustment. Washington\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony was central to his defense. The defense attorney\u2019s emphasis on Mrs. Washington\u2019s testimony in his opening statement indicates that he knew what her testimony would be. The court\u2019s conclusion that Washington also knew how she would testify is not clearly erroneous. Mrs. Washington\u2019s testimony contradicted the testimony of Officer Tugya, who testified that the door to Washington\u2019s house was opened by a man who resembled Washington rather than her description of James Hill. Her testimony also contradicted Washington\u2019s statement at arrest that he lived at 3037 East Monument Street, and contradicted Gilmore\u2019s initial state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>ments to the police and identification of Washington as his assailant. Even if Washington did not induce his wife\u2019s false testimony, when Washington knowingly presented her false testimony as his defense, he evinced a clear attempt to obstruct the administration of justice.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Although the district court made the additional finding that Washington suborned perjury, we may affirm the judgment for any reason appearing by the record. <em>United States v. Swann, </em>149 F.3d 271, 277 (4th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 830 (4th Cir.2001) (sentence enhancement may be affirmed on the basis of \u201c \u2018any conduct [in the record] that independently and properly should result in an increase in the offense level\u2019 by virtue of the enhancement.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Ashers, </em>968 F.2d 411, 414 (4th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1017-9\"> Because of Gilmore's decision to recant his prior statements, Mrs. Washington\u2019s failure to tell the police that her husband was not home on November 11, 2001, and defense counsel\u2019s focus on Mrs. Washington\u2019s testimony in his opening statement, this case is distinguishable from <em>United States v. Lesczynski, </em>86 Fed.Appx. 551 (4th Cir.2004) (No. 02-4431).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
