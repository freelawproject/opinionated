Tapias-Vera argues that in refusing to grant a variance from the guidelines, the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">We have jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006). We have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable guideline range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[Njothing n <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Tjhe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient to indicate that it considered the factors, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">After reviewing the record and both parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, accurately calculated the guideline range, explicitly considered the evidence of Tapias-Vera\u2019s family and poverty, and sentenced Tapias-Vera at the low end of the guidelines range, concluding that TapiasVera was not in a unique position that made a guidelines sentence inappropriate. We cannot say that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
