In his motion, Leach argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the district court\u2019s use of the Typical Weight Per Unit Table from the 2002 Guidelines Manual, the manual in effect at the time of his sentencing, rather than the table from the 2001 Guidelines Manual, the manual in effect at the time of his offense, in reaching its drug quantity calculation. Leach contends the district court\u2019s use of the table in effect at the time of his sentencing resulted in him receiving a harsher sentence, and, thus, violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-15\">The district court denied Leach\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, finding that Leach\u2019s claims were barred by his collateral appeal waiver. The district court, alternatively, held that Leach\u2019s attorney did not render ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the district court\u2019s drug-quantity and weight calculations. Subsequently, the district court granted Leach\u2019s motion for a COA on the following issues: (1) whether \u201cthe [district] [c]ourt\u2019s use of the Typical Weight Per Unit Table in effect at the time of [Leach\u2019s] sentencing, rather than the table in effect at the time of his offense, resulted in a harsher sentence, and thus violated the Constitution\u2019s ex post facto clause;\u201d and (2) whether the \u201c[district] court erred in finding that the collateral appeal waiver contained in [Leach\u2019s] plea agreement prevented his raising the ex post facto claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-16\">On appeal, Leach argues that the limited appeal waiver contained in his plea agreement does not preclude him from challenging sentencing errors. Specifically, Leach asserts that his <em>ex post facto </em>claim falls within the exception to the waiver for findings by the court regarding relevant conduct because the district court made find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ings regarding the drug-quantity that was attributable to him. Leach further argues that, because the terms of the limited appeal waiver limit the waiver to \u201cthe maximum extent permitted by federal law,\u201d it does not bar a collateral attack based on <em>ex post facto </em>grounds even if such a collateral attack is not specifically excepted from the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>320 F.3d 1230, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Sentence-appeal waivers are valid if they are made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993). Whether a defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446 (11th Cir.1997). For an appeal waiver to be enforced, the government must show that either: (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the sentence appeal waiver during the plea hearing, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351. During the plea colloquy, it is insufficient for the district court to merely inform the defendant that he may appeal \u201cunder some circumstances.\u201d Id. at 1352-53. Rather, the court must explain to the defendant, with specificity, the nature and extent of the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Buchanan, </em>131 F.3d 1005, 1008 (11th Cir.1997). An appeal waiver includes a waiver of the right to appeal difficult or debatable legal issues, including blatant error. <em>United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1169 (11th Cir.1999). In <em>Williams v. United States, </em>396 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2005), we held that a valid sentence-appeal waiver precludes \u00a7 2255 claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Because the express language of the appeal waiver provides that Leach retained his right to appeal the district court\u2019s relevant conduct findings on direct appeal but waived his right to collaterally attack his sentence on any ground, Leach\u2019s argument that his <em>ex post facto </em>claim falls within the exception to the appeal waiver for findings by the court regarding relevant conduct is without merit. Additionally, because the record demonstrates that Leach knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to directly or collaterally attack his sentence, we enforce the sentence-appeal waiver and affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the waiver precluded Leach from raising the ineffective assistance of counsel claims that he asserted in his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Leach next argues that the district court\u2019s use of the Typical Weight Per Unit Table from the 2002 Guidelines Manual, the manual that was in effect at the time of his sentencing, rather than the table from the 2001 Guidelines Manual, the manual that was in effect at the time he committed the instant offense, resulted in him receiving a harsher sentence, and, therefore, violated the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause. Specifically, Leach notes that, while the Typical Weight Per Unit Table in the 2002 Guidelines Manual listed the typical dosage of MDMA as .25 grams per tablet, the Typical Weight Per Unit Table in the 2001 Guidelines Manual listed the typical dosage of MDMA as .10 grams per tablet. Leach contends that, if the district court had utilized the Typical Weight Per Unit Table that was in effect at the time he committed the instant offense, his base offense level would have been two levels lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Although the district court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on this issue, this issue is problematic because the district court, in alternatively ruling on the merits of Leach\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, never addressed the issue of whether its use of the Typical Weight Per Unit Table in effect at the time of Leach\u2019s sentencing, rather than the table in effect at the time that Leach committed the instant offense, resulted in a harsher sentence, and, therefore, violated the Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause. Instead, the district court addressed the issues that were raised by Leach in his motion, namely, whether his attorney rendered ineffective assistance by (1) failing to object to the district court\u2019s use of the Typical Weight Per Unit Table that was in effect at the time of his sentence, rather than the table that was in effect at the time of his offense, and (2) causing him to procedurally default his direct appeal. Accordingly, the district court erred by granting a COA on an issue that Leach did not raise and on which the court did not rule. In any event, we need not consider this issue, because, as noted above, the valid sentence waiver contained in Leach\u2019s plea agreement precluded him from collaterally attacking his sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Leach\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
