Woodall asserts that the Government \u201cposed several questions to witnesses that could easily have left the jury with the impression that, once the charged extortion and bribery were exposed, the policy was replaced.\u201d He submits that it was \u201ccritical\u201d to his defense to show that \u201cno influence or reward would have made sense in the context of the history of [his] votes on the insurance issue.\u201d Moreover, the precluded evidence would have shown that his support was not necessary for the policy\u2019s continued renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s grant of a motion <em>in limine. United States v. Thompson, </em>25 F.3d 1558, 1563 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cWhen employing this standard, we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248,1255 (11th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 732, 163 L.Ed.2d 576 (2005) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Among other things, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(1)(B) prohibits an agent of a local government, which receives federal funds, to \u201ccorruptly ... accept[ ] or agree[ ] to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such ... government ... involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more.\u201d In our view, the evidence Woodall sought to introduce was not relevant to the charges lodged against him and had the potential to confuse the jury; hence, the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the Government\u2019s motion in <em>linine. See Lyons, </em>403 F.3d at 1256 (finding no abuse of discretion where the evidence excluded was \u201cexceedingly marginal\u201d and \u201cmay have confused the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Woodall next contends that the court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding bribery was erroneous. According to Woodall, the instruction allowed the jury to \u201cconsider the actions of [Woodall] as if he was charged with an illegal gratuity or ... a violation of the Hobbs Act, neither of which requires the quid pro quo of a bribery charge.\u201d In addition, the instruction \u201cremoved the requisite showing of influence or reward by the prosecution\u201d and allowed the jury to convict him \u201cmerely upon his admission that he accepted money.\u201d He insists that the Government should have been required to show that his official action was \u201cin some manner affected\u201d by the payments that he received.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">\u2018We apply a deferential standard of review to a trial court\u2019s jury instructions.\u201d <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1148 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cUnder this standard, we will only reverse if we are left with a substantial and eradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). As noted above, \u00a7 666 prohibits an agent of a local government, which receives federal funds, to \u201ccorruptly ... accept[ ] or agree[ ] to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such ... government ... involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">We are satisfied that the court\u2019s jury instructions accurately stated the requirements of \u00a7 666. We therefore reject the challenge to the instructions, and turn to Woodall\u2019s final argument: that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on any count of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>According to Woodall, if Michael Tillery\u2019s testimony that he thought the payment to Woodall was a bribe was \u201cremoved from the record,\u201d the record would be \u201cvoid of any evidence from which the jury could even draw an inference of guilt.\u201d He also poses as an issue of first impression this question: \u201cwhether a prosecution for lying during an investigation can rest upon a difference of opinion between an accused and a prosecutor about whether admitted conduct is illegal.\u201d He points out that he never contested any of the facts underlying the transactions that served as the basis for his indictment; he \u201cmerely\u201d asserted that the payments he received were campaign contributions instead of bribes. Woodall also contends, regarding Count 5, which alleged that he knowingly made a fraudulent statement during the course of an investigation by federal agents, that the evidence provided by the Government \u201cproved the truth of [his] assertion\u201d and \u201cit remains unclear ... how this Count was allowed to be submitted to the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 452 (11th Cir.1994). In so doing, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in its favor. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt, provided that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">As stated above, \u00a7 666 prohibits an agent of a local government, which receives federal funds, to \u201ccorruptly ... accept[] or agree[] to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business, transaction, or series of transactions of such ... government ... involving any thing of value of $5,000 or more.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">Section 1001(a) states in pertinent part: Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully: ... (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">18 U.S.C. 1001(a) (1996). \u201cProof of five elements is essential to sustain a conviction under the false statement proscription of \u00a7 1001:(1) a statement, (2) falsity, (3) materiality, (4) specific intent, and (5) agency jurisdiction.\u201d <em>United States v. Lange, </em>528 F.2d 1280, 1287 (5th Cir.1976) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The record contains the testimony of the federal agent who interviewed Woodall. That testimony, considered in the light of the other evidence presented, was more than sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to convict Woodall of each of the offenses charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">For the foregoing reasons, Woodall\u2019s convictions are due to be, and are,</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
