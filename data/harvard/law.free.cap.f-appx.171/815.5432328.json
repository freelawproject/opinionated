Hill argues on appeal that the district court erred in determining his base offense level under the United States Federal Guidelines (\u201cfederal guidelines\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Hill, along with two co-conspirators, Joseph Steinberg and Anthony Fusco, with committing the above-referenced conspiracy between August 1999 and May 2000. Hill entered into a plea agreement with the government, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to this conspiracy offense, and he acknowledged that the amount of funds that were structured for purposes of relevant conduct, and pursuant to the fraud table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l), was $902,732.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">During Hill\u2019s plea colloquy, the government proffered that, as part of the conspiracy, Hill received $902,732 in checks, which were broken up into amounts less than $10,000, with the checks either made out to Hill, or cashed by his employees for him. On further questioning from the court, the government agreed that an \u201cultimate goal\u201d of the conspiracy was \u201cso [that] someone\u2019s tax liability was not fully recognized.\u201d The government explained that the IRS would not be able to compute Hill\u2019s income from the scheme. However, Hill also acknowledged that another goal of the conspiracy was to avoid reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">Hill\u2019s PSI included that Tap Pharmaceuticals (\u201cTap\u201d) manufactured drugs and sold them to licensed doctors for Medicaid and Medicare patients at a much lower cost than wholesale prices, so that these physicians could sell the drugs at a lower cost to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>their patients. Supreme Distributors (\u201cSupreme\u201d), a licensed wholesale-distributor company, bought wholesale-prescription drugs from other licensed wholesale distributors and then sold these drugs to other wholesalers or pharmacies. In April 2000, Supreme contacted the Federal Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) about a shipment Supreme had received from Ideal Marketing Concepts (\u201cIdeal\u201d), another licensed wholesale-distribution company that purchased and sold prescription drugs and that had Steinberg, Hill\u2019s co-conspirator, as its President and Chief Financial Officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FDA investigation revealed that this shipment from Ideal contained a tampered box of an oncological drug, Neupogen, which had a pharmacy label and a patient name on it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was valued at $80,000, and was regulated by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The PSI further included that Hill, who was a licensed osteopathic physician in the State of Florida, would receive prescription drugs from Tap and other sources and then sell them to Ideal in exchange for either checks or cash. If Ideal paid Hill by check, each check was structured to be less than $10,000. Hill was responsible for using nominee bank accounts, a check-cashing store, and his employees to cash checks in the total stipulated amount of $902,732, with all of these transactions structured to avoid currency-transaction reports. Hill then would use these sale proceeds to purchase assets and place them in the names of various nominees, who were mainly members of Hill\u2019s family. During 1999, Hill failed to report at least $532,364 of taxable income, which amount was derived from checks drawn on Ideal\u2019s bank account, and which resulted in a tax liability of $202,390.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">In addition to summarizing this offense conduct, the PSI calculated Hill\u2019s offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3 (2000)\u2014 the guideline applicable to offenses involving \u201cStructuring to Evade Reporting Requirements.\u201d Under \u00a7 2S1.3(a), the PSI began with an offense level of 6, and then added the number of offense levels from the fraud and deceit table in \u00a7 2F1.1 that corresponded to the value of the funds relevant to the conspiracy. Because the stipulated amount of funds was $902,732, the PSI added 11 levels, resulting in Hill having a total base offense level of 17. Moreover, because Hill knew or believed that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity, this level was increased two levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">Hill objected that his PSI incorrectly calculated his base offense level and also increased it two levels, pursuant to \u00a7 2S1.3(a) and (b)(1), because the offense conduct did not involve money laundering or any illegal activity. The probation offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>cer responded that, because Hill pled guilty to both objects of the conspiracy, including evading the reporting requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 5313 and 5324, \u00a7 2S1.3 was the proper guideline to use in calculating his offense level. The probation officer also explained that, although Hill bought and sold some drugs legitimately, he illegally (1) routinely bought drugs from Medicare and Medicaid patients through \u201crunners,\u201d and (2) resold drugs that had been re-labeled or re-packaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">At sentencing, the district court discussed that, although the federal guidelines now were advisory, both the Supreme Court and this Court had explained that district courts still must consult these guidelines, which includes properly calculating them. Hill then renewed his objection to the PSI\u2019s calculation of his offense level under \u00a7 2S1.3(a) &amp; (b)(1). The government, in turn, offered the testimony of Eric Larson, a Special Agent with the FDA assigned to investigate the case, who testified as follows about information he learned from interviewing employees and business associates of Hill. As part of the instant conspiracy, Hill was engaged in the unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, such as Serostim, Neupogen, and Lupron, which were used primarily for treating cancer and AIDS. Hill obtained some of his prescription drugs from Michael Deagan, an unlicensed \u201cstreet dealer,\u201d who delivered these drugs to Hill\u2019s office in a black bag, and who reported profits of $50,000 to $75,000 from his Serostim sales to Hill. Hill, in turn, was Ideal\u2019s main supplier of Serostim, selling them through Steinberg\u2019s associates, Wall and Jay Vegotsky. After receiving drugs from Hill and other physicians, as well as from other unlicensed wholesalers, via \u201crunners\u201d who went to these sources, Ideal sold these drugs to Supreme and other licensed wholesalers, without disclosing the true illegal sources and chain of pedigree of the drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331 and 333.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The government argued that the offense level provided by \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l) was applicable because (1) one object of the conspiracy involved structuring financial transactions to avoid reporting requirements, and (2) Hill knew or believed that the relevant funds were from purchases and sales of prescription drugs from an unlicensed wholesaler and, thus, the proceeds of unlawful activity. Hill responded that, because the government failed to charge, and Hill did not admit during his plea colloquy, that the relevant funds were the proceeds of unlawful activity, it could not be a factor in determining his sentence. Hill also contended that evidence showing that he purchased quantities of pharmaceuticals on the \u201cgray market\u201d did not establish that the underlying conduct was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Based on its determination that the government had established by the preponderance of the evidence that Hill knew or believed that the funds involved either were the proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity, the court overruled Hill\u2019s objection to setting his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2S1.3. The court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeM\">Dr. Hill being a licensed medical doctor. Drugs that are issued in the name of other people, and we are not talking, by the way, about, for instance, say, a stronger Aspirin or something else you need a doctor\u2019s prescription for, but we are talking about highly regulated drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>that are very, very expensive. I think the Neopogen was valued at somewhere [between] $1[,]500 or $1[,]700 for a small vial of it. These are anti-cancer drugs, and some of these drugs were, obviously, labeled for other patients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-5\">We know, ultimately, when they were received at Ideal, the patients names were removed, [the PSI] talks about the process for removing labels and repackaging them, so on, so forth. No effort at maintaining the pedigree which is so important in this area so if there is a need to recall the drugs, that could be done, and the transactions are just huge. It is remarkable that we are talking about transactions, [$]50 to $75,000 in terms of quantity. We are looking at a doctor purchasing these drugs from someone who is unlicenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Furthermore, the court rejected Hill\u2019s argument that the court, nevertheless, should apply the cross reference in \u00a7 2S1.3(c) and, thus, the tax table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T4.1, because the conspiracy did not involve a tax offense as its only object. After concluding that Hill had a resulting guideline range of 27 to 33 months\u2019 imprisonment, and after granting the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the court sentenced Hill to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, constituting a sentence below Hill\u2019s advisory guideline range, 2 years\u2019 supervised release, and $202,390 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Hill argues on appeal that the district court erred in calculating and considering his advisory guideline range because, in adopting the PSI\u2019s recommended offense level of 17, pursuant to \u00a7 2S1.3(a) &amp; (b)(1), the court wrongly concluded that Hill knew or believed that the funds either were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity. Hill also contends that the court erred in refusing to apply the cross reference in \u00a7 2S1.3(c) to the tax guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T4.1, when Hill\u2019s indictment, plea agreement, and plea colloquy reflected that he was charged with, and pleading guilty to, tax evasion. Additionally, Hill asserts that, although this guideline range only was advisory, this Court should vacate and remand his sentence because, if the advisory range had been lower, a reasonable probability exists that the court would have departed downward below the 21-month sentence that it ultimately imposed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we continue to review a district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir. 2005) (explaining that <em>Booker </em>did not alter either our review of the application of the guidelines, or our standards of review). We cannot find clear error unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1177 (quotation omitted). On the other hand, we review questions of law arising under the federal guidelines <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 1178. Under <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. \u201c[T]he district court remains obliged to \u2018consult\u2019 and \u2018take into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>account\u2019 the [guidelines in sentencing.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178. \u201cThis consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the [g]uidelines[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). \u201cAfter it has made this calculation, the district court may impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and its accompanying regulations require banks and other financial institutions to file a report with the government for any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a); 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22(b)(1). A financial institution also must file this report, known as a Currency Transaction Report (\u201cCTR\u201d), if it knows that a person is making multiple transactions in a single day that result in either deposits or withdrawals totaling over $10,000. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22(c)(2). It is illegal under \u00a7 5324 either to cause or attempt to cause a financial institution to fail to file a report, or to structure cash transactions \u201cfor the purpose of evading\u201d the filing of a CTR. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(3). This anti-structuring law \u201caims to prevent people from either causing a bank to fail to file a required report or defeating the government\u2019s efforts to identify large cash transactions by splitting up a cash hoard in a manner that avoids triggering a bank\u2019s reporting requirements.\u201d <em>United States v. Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In examining whether the district court correctly calculated Hill\u2019s advisory guideline range based on his conviction for conspiring to, among other things, evade the reporting requirements in \u00a7 5313(a) and \u00a7 5324, the relevant version of \u00a7 2S1.3\u2014 the guideline applicable for \u201cStructuring Transactions to Evade Reporting Requirements\u201d \u2014 provided for a base offense level of six, \u201cplus the number of offense levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit) corresponding to the value of the funds.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(a) (2000). This guideline also provided that, \u201c[i]f the defendant knew or believed that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">On the other hand, this guideline also provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-8\">If (A) subsection (b)(1) does not apply; (B) the defendant did not act with reckless disregard of the source of the funds; (C) the funds were the proceeds of lawful activity; and (D) the funds were to be used for a lawful purpose, decrease the offense level to level 6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(2) (2000). Moreover, under the cross reference in \u00a7 2S1.3(c), courts are to apply the \u201cmost appropriate guideline from Chapter Two, Part T (Offenses Involving Taxation)\u201d if (1) the offense was committed for the purpose of violating tax laws, and (2) the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Hill contended at sentencing that \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l) was not applicable, and that he, instead, should have been sentenced under \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(2), because the government failed to establish that he \u201cknew or believed that then funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity.\u201d When a defendant objects to a factual finding, such as in the instant case, the government bears the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>In <em>Vazquez, </em>the defendant argued that the district court improperly enhanced his base offense level under \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l), based on the court\u2019s finding that the defendant \u201cknew or believed that the funds were criminally derived property.\u201d <em>See Vazquez, </em>53 F.3d at 1226. The defendant\u2019s PSI reflected that, although the defendant only was charged with structuring transactions amounting to $1.5 million, a total of approximately $7.5 million had been processed through the four accounts controlled by the defendant and his co-conspirator, and that this amount far exceeded the defendant\u2019s legitimate annual income of $15,000. <em>See id. </em>at 1226-27. The district court found that, although it could not be certain of the source of the money, it did not believe the defendant\u2019s alternative story. <em>See id. </em>On appeal, we determined that this factual finding was not clearly erroneous, explaining that the district court was entitled to infer that the defendant\u2019s false explanation was a cover for some type of criminal endeavor. <em>See id. </em>at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In the instant case, Special Agent Larson testified at sentencing that, as part of the instant conspiracy, Hill obtained some of his prescription drugs from Michael Deagan, an unlicensed \u201cstreet dealer,\u201d who delivered these drugs to Hill\u2019s office in a black bag, and who reported profits of $50,000 to $75,000 from his Serostim sales to Hill. Special Agent Larson also explained that, after receiving drugs from Hill and other physicians, as well as from other unlicensed wholesalers, via \u201crunners\u201d who went to these sources, Ideal sold these drugs to Supreme and other licensed wholesalers, without disclosing the true illegal sources and chain of pedigree of the drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331 and 333. The PSI discussed that, at Ideal, the patient labels on the drugs would be removed and repackaged, using a heat gun and shrink wrap, such that the invoices and pedigrees then false information regarding the drug\u2019s origin, age, and National Drug Code Number. Thus, similar to the facts in <em>Vazquez, </em>the court did not clearly err in concluding that the government had established by the preponderance of the evidence that Hill knew or believed that the fund involved either were the proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">To the extent Hill also is contending that the court erred in failing to apply the cross section referenced in \u00a7 2S1.3(c)(l), based on his argument that the conspiracy to which he plead guilty was for the purpose of violating tax laws, he cites in support to the government\u2019s comment during his plea colloquy that the \u201cultimate goal\u201d of the conspiracy was \u201cso someone\u2019s tax liability [would] not [be] fully recognized.\u201d Hill\u2019s two-pronged conspiracy, however, also had as an object for the co-conspirators to evade the reporting requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a) and 5324. Indeed, the government proffered, and Hill agreed during his plea colloquy, that a separate goal of the conspiracy was to avoid reporting requirements. The PSI also included, and Hill failed to refute, that he was responsible for using nominee bank accounts, a check-cashing store, and his employees to cash checks in the total agreed sum of $902,732, with all of these transactions structured to avoid currency transaction reports. Additionally, \u00a7 2S1.3(c)(1) was not applicable because the offense level of 16 that would have resulted from the court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(a)(l),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>less than 17 \u2014 the offense level that resulted from the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2815(a) &amp; (b)(1). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(c) (requiring as a condition that the resulting offense level from the tax table be greater than the offense level in \u00a7 2S1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Hill \u201cknew or believed that then funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity,\u201d for purposes of applying \u00a7 2S1.3(a) &amp; (b). Furthermore, the court did not err in finding inapplicable the cross section referenced in \u00a7 2S1.3(c), for violating tax laws. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-13\">. Hill's presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) reflects that the 2000 edition of the federal guidelines were used to avoid an <em>ex post facto </em>violation because (1) the offense conduct ceased in October 2001, and (2) the 2000 edition was more favorable to Hill.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-6\">. Hill agreed during his plea colloquy that, when Steinberg was incarcerated on state charges from October 1999 through May 2000, Steinberg hired co-conspirator Fusco to assume his duties as Ideal's Chief Financial Officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ab4q\">.

The PSI explained that, in accordance with statutes and regulations that cover how wholesale-prescription drugs are sold and purchased, a paper trail, which is referred to as a \"pedigree,\u201d must follow a drug from the point of origin to the point of dispensing, and the shipment of prescription drugs from the manufacturer to various wholesalers, up and to the point of resale at a pharmacy. This pedigree, which includes the name of the previous owner, the drug itself, and a National Drug Code Number, is necessary so that, in the event of a manufacture recall, the product can be traced and recalled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b846-5\">. The PSI further discussed that, at Ideal, the patient labels on the drugs would be removed and repackaged, using a heat gun and shrink wrap, such that the invoices and pedigrees contained false information regarding the drug's origin, age, and National Drug Code Number.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">.
