Speights (\u201cSpeights\u201d), a Florida prisoner serving an enhanced life sentence for robbery with a firearm, appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for entry of judgment as to a motion for summary judgment he had filed as part of his petition for writ of habeas corpus brought under <em>28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because the record demonstrates that the district court entered final judgment as to Speights\u2019s habeas petition, we conclude that the district court properly denied Speights\u2019s motion for entry of judgment as unnecessary since the claims as addressed were rendered moot by the earlier final judgment on the habeas petition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Speights\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion for entry of judgment as to a motion for summary judgment that he had filed as part of his petition for writ of habeas corpus brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
