Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, Defendant-Appellant Pedro Jaquez-Tenorio has submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing the impact of <em>Booker, </em>to which the Government has responded with a motion to reinstate our prior affirmance of his conviction and sentence. Jaquez-Tenorio opposes the Government\u2019s motion. For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">Jaquez-Tenorio pled guilty to and was convicted of being in the United States unlawfully following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. This offense carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines was 8, but the district court imposed a 12-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) based on a prior aggravated felony conviction. With a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s total offense level was 17. This, combined with a criminal history category of II, resulted in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 27 to 33 months. The district court sentenced Jaquez-Tenorio to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. Jaquez-Tenorio objected to the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>on <em>Apprendi</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>grounds because it exceeded the statutory maximum, which objection the district court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Jaquez-Tenorio appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing that because the indictment did not state a \u00a7 1326(b) offense because it did not allege a prior conviction, his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of the Constitution. In the alternative he challenged the constitutional validity of \u00a7 1326(b). In his brief on appeal Jaquez-Tenorio acknowledged that his arguments were foreclosed by precedent, but raised them only to preserve them for possible review by the Supreme Court. We affirmed the conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jaquez-Tenorio then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. After <em>Booker </em>was decided, Jaquez-Tenorio submitted a supplemental petition for certiorari in which he challenged his mandatory Guideline sentence. As noted above, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Jaquez-Tenorio raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his supplemental petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy the plain error standard, he certainly cannot satisfy the extraordinary circumstances standard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s claim does not survive plain error review, we need not address the question of extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines (1) constitutes error, and (2) that error is plain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In his supplemental letter brief, Jaquez-Tenorio concedes that \u201cthe district court made no particular remarks disagreeing with the requirements of the mandatory guidelines,\u201d or otherwise indicating that it would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, Jaquez-Tenorio calls to our attention \u201cmitigating circumstances surrounding [his] illegal reentry offense that support a finding of a reasonable likelihood of a lower sentence.\u201d He invites us to draw the conclusion that it was \u201c[apparently due to these mitigating circumstances [that] the court imposed [a] sentence at the bottom of the calculated guideline sentence range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he fact that the sentencing judge imposed the minimum sentence under the Guideline range ... alone is no indication that the judge would have reached a different conclusion under an advisory scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his supplemental letter brief, Jaquez-Tenorio attempts to distinguish <em>Bringier </em>from his case based on factual differences. But these differences \u2014 for example, that Bringier was a \u201clarge-scale drug trafficker\u201d while Jaquez-Tenorio was \u201can illegal alien who. merely crossed the border\u201d- \u2014 -have no bearing whatsoever on the question whether we may infer from a Guideline-minimum sentence that the defendant would have been sentenced differently under an advisory scheme. The significance of any factual differences is, of course, borne out in the sentences imposed: ' Bringier was sentenced to a Guideline-minimum 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, compared to Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s 27 months\u2019. Yet, in neither case may we conclude that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory scheme. Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Bringier </em>is simply unconvincing. As he fails to demonstrate from the record that his sentence would have been significantly different under an advisory Guidelines scheme, he has not carried his burden to establish error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Jaquez-Tenorio next expresses his disagreement with our application of the plain error standard, as articulated in <em>Mares, </em>in order to preserve a challenge for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">As Jaquez-Tenorio has failed to satisfy plain error review, we do not reach his argument that error in his sentencing seriously affected the fairness, integrity and public reputation of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Jaquez-Tenorio\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
