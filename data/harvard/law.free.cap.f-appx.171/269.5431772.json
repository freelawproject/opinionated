Salinas-Cruz first argues that he should have received a minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 because he was less culpable than the other members of the conspiracy, and because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) is designed to punish couriers of drugs less harshly than buyers and sellers. According to Salinas-Cruz, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3) challenges the validity of our ruling in <em>United States v. De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>Salinas-Crus also contends that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. The government argues that we lack jurisdiction to consider the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As a preliminary issue, <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>is still the guiding law in this Circuit, and we have repeatedly upheld it. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2002). Moreover, the portion of the sentencing guidelines to which Salinas-Cruz refers, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), requires a defendant to first qualify for a minor-role reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), U.S.S.G. SuppApp. C, Amend. 640. As the Sentencing Commission specifically adopted and affirmed <em>De Var\u00f3n\u2019$ </em>analysis for qualification for a minor-role reduction, Salinas-Cruz\u2019s arguments regarding the application of the guidelines and <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>are meritless. U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We have held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact, to be reviewed for clear error. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 934. The guidelines allow a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if the court finds the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant who \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal\u201d is a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). Under the requisite standards articulated in <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in denying the downward departure here.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">In considering Salinas-Cruz\u2019s reasonableness argument, we first note that we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir.2006). Sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines system are reviewed for unreasonableness. With regard to reasonableness, we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir. 2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable guideline range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>rence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[N]othing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors, and concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In this case, the district court explicitly mentioned the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and accurately calculated the guideline range. Although, the district court noted that it believed the large quantity of cocaine on the boat justified a guidelines sentence, it sentenced Salinas-Cruz at the low end of the guidelines range. Based, upon this record, we cannot say that the sentence imposed was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
