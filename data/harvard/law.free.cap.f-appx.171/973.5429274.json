Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Clay admitted to possessing four stolen firearms, but the district court attributed twenty-seven stolen firearms to him, resulting in a six-level increase in Clay\u2019s offense level. This enhanced Clay\u2019s sentence based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by Clay. However, there is no Sixth Amendment error where a defendant\u2019s sentence does not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts he admitted. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). The four guns Clay admitted to support a two offense level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>(2005), yielding a total offense level of fourteen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With Clay\u2019s category III criminal history, Clay\u2019s sentencing range would have been twenty-one to twenty-seven months. Clay\u2019s sentence of twenty-seven months falls within that range. As Clay\u2019s sentence did not exceed the maximum authorized by the facts of the offense to which he pled guilty, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Clay also contends that the district court\u2019s \u201cstatutory <em>Booker </em>error\u201d \u2014 treating the sentencing guidelines as mandatory\u2014 requires resentencing. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 414 (4th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[A] court commits statutory error [under <em>Booker </em>] if it treats the Guidelines as mandatory, rather than as advisory.\u201d). Clay preserved this issue by objecting under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and our review thus proceeds under a harmless error analysis. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 415-16. The government bears the burden in harmless error review of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. Because the district court gave no indication of the sentence it would have imposed under a system of advisory Guidelines, we conclude that the government has failed to establish that the error in treating the Guidelines as mandatory was harmless. <em>See id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Clay\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-19\">. Clay does not appeal his conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">. As in <em>Evans, </em>416 F.3d at 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), for purposes of determining whether a Sixth Amendment violation occurred, the sentence imposed on Clay is compared against the guideline range he should have received, based on a jury verdict or admitted conduct, excluding the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
