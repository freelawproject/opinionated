Gutierrez-Piza was sentenced to imprisonment for thirty-seven months. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">Counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the sentence imposed by the district court was reasonable. Although Gutierrez-Piza was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.2006) (No. 05-4270).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">Gutierrez-Piza\u2019s thirty-seven month sentence was both within the guideline range of thirty to thirty-seven months, and well within the statutory maximum of twenty years. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, properly calculated and considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
