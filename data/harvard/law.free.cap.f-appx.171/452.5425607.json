Padr\u00f3n claims that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it treats prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors. Padron\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Padr\u00f3n contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Padr\u00f3n properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in the light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent; he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">Padr\u00f3n also contends that the district court erred in sentencing him under the mandatory guideline regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) <em>(Fanfan </em>error). Because Padr\u00f3n preserved the issue in district court, the Government must show the <em>Fanfan </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). The sentencing transcript is devoid of evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory regime; therefore, the Government has not borne its burden. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
