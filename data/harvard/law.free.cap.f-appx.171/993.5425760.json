Piccard\u2019s first-floor tenant, a medical clinic, vacated the premises for four months while the premises were being restored and, during that period, paid only one-half the rent otherwise due, causing Piccard to sustain a loss of rental income in the amount of $80,394.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">After Piccard restored the building, it submitted a claim to National Fire for the cost of repair and its loss of rental income. National Fire paid Piccard the $50,000 policy limit for property damage caused by a sewer backup, but it refused to pay Pic-card\u2019s claim for its loss of income, asserting that the policy did not cover loss of business income caused by a sewer backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-17\">Piccard commenced this action against National Fire in Maryland state court for $80,394.52, plus interest, costs, and attorneys fees. National Fire removed the case to federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Following the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered judgment in favor of National Fire, concluding that the policy that it issued to Piccard did not cover loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>business income from a sewer backup. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The policy \u2014 a \u201cBusiness Account Package Policy\u201d \u2014 provides in \u00a7 A that it will pay for \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to\u201d Piccard\u2019s property \u201ccaused by or resulting from any <em>Covered Cause of Loss\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In \u00a7 A.5.f(l), the policy provides \u201cadditional coverage\u201d for \u201cthe actual loss of business income\u201d incurred during a suspension of operations \u201ccaused by or resulting from any <em>Covered Cause of Loss\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The term \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d is defined in \u00a7 A.3 to include all risks of direct physical loss unless excluded in \u201cSection B. EXCLUSIONS.\u201d The exclusions in \u00a7 B provide that losses from sewer backups are not \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d Specifically, \u00a7 B.l.f(3) provides that National Fire \u201cwill not pay for loss or damage caused\u201d by \u201cwater that backs up from a sewer or drain.\u201d The exclusion, however, does not, by its terms, stop coverage under \u00a7 A.6.q, the \u201cBack Up of Sewer or Drain Water Damage Coverage Extension.\u201d The coverage extension in \u00a7 A.6.q provides that National Fire will pay for \u201closs or damage to covered property caused by water that backs up from a sewer or drain.... The most we will pay for direct physical damage is [$50,000].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Thus, while the policy provides coverage under \u00a7 A.6 for <em>property damage </em>caused by a sewer backup, it does not provide coverage under \u00a7 A.5 for business income loss. A loss of income is covered only when it is the result of a \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d and a \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d does not, under \u00a7 B, include a loss caused by a sewer backup. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Piccard argues that because National Fire paid $50,000 for property damage under \u00a7 A.6.q (the coverage extension for sewer backup losses), the loss caused by sewer backup is a \u201ccause of loss\u201d that is \u201ccovered\u201d by the policy such that the business-income-loss provision also applies because that provision applies to losses \u201ccaused by a Covered Cause of Loss.\u201d Piccard\u2019s argument asks us to interpret the clause \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d loosely so as to include any loss paid for under the policy. This interpretation, however, would obliterate the specific language of the policy which defines \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d to exclude losses caused by a sewer backup (except for $50,000 in physical property damage). In determining whether a policy provides coverage, we must apply the terms of the insurance contract as written, and if the policy defines terms, we must likewise apply those terms as defined. <em>See Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. Utica Mutual Insurance Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 779, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Piccard also argues that the language of \u00a7 A.6.q is written so as to afford coverage not only for physical damage to covered property but also for other types of \u201closs,\u201d such as business income loss. Section A.6.q provides coverage for \u201closs or damage to covered property\u201d whereas other sections, such as \u00a7 A, use the phrase \u201closs <em>of </em>or damage to covered property\u201d (emphasis added). Piccard maintains that by leaving out the preposition \u201cof,\u201d the policy provides separate coverages (1) for all loss and (2) for damage to covered property, thus delinking \u201closs\u201d from \u201ccovered property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">We do not find Piccard\u2019s construction to be the natural reading of the policy, especially when we consider the same omission of the preposition \u201cof\u2019 in other places within the policy. In those provisions, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 A.6.c(l), A.6.e, and A.6.f, if we were to delink \u201closs\u201d from \u201ccovered property,\u201d the policy would make little sense and render other policy provisions redundant or su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>perfluous. For instance, under Piccard\u2019s argument, which reads \u201closs\u201d to stand alone, \u00a7 A.6.c(l) would read that National Fire \u201cwill pay for direct physical loss ... caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss,\u201d a meaningless phrase, especially when we consider the language as it relates to the object of coverage \u2014 valuable papers. As written, \u00a7 A.6.e(l) provides coverage of \u201cdirect physical loss [of] or damage to \u2018valuable papers and records\u2019 ... caused by or resulting from a Covered Cause of Loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Thus, we read the phrase \u201closs or damage to covered property\u201d to have the same meaning as the phrase \u201closs of or damage to covered property.\u201d Under both clauses, the word \u201closs\u201d is linked to \u201ccovered property.\u201d When applied to \u00a7 A.6.q, therefore, \u201closs\u201d refers to \u201closs of covered property,\u201d not to business income loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Because no provision of National Fire\u2019s policy covers Piccard\u2019s loss of rental income caused by a sewer backup, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
