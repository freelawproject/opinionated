In the first appeal, Cascade Crossing II, LLC (\u201cCascade Crossing\u201d) appealed the district court\u2019s ruling on waiver only. A panel of our court reversed the district court\u2019s ruling on waiver, and declared that Cascade Crossing was the only prevailing party and was therefore entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The case was remanded to the district court for a determination of the amount of past due rent and attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid by Radioshack Corporation (\u201cRadioshack\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-29\">On remand, the parties agreed on the amount of past due rent and interest but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>could not agree on the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees. Cascade Crossing argued that the full amount of attorneys\u2019 fees it sought should be awarded, but Radioshack argued that the fee award should be capped by the percentages set forth in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13 \u2014 1\u2014 11. The district court ruled that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-1-11 did not apply, and Cascade Crossing was awarded the full amount of attorneys\u2019 fees ($282,924.53) incurred in this litigation. Radioshack then perfected this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Ortega-Torres, </em>174 F.3d 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Although Radioshack does not dispute that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Cascade Crossing under Section 31 of the Radioshack lease was proper, it argues that the district court erred in awarding Cascade Crossing the full amount of its attorneys\u2019 fees accrued during the litigation. More specifically, Cascade Crossing argues that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees should have been calculated pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-l-ll(a)(2), which caps such attorney fee awards at 15% of the first $500.00 of past due rent and interest owed, and 10% of the remaining past due rent and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">From the district court\u2019s brief mention of this issue, it is impossible for us to discern the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. In its order of August 12, 2005, the district court found that \u201cthe limits contained in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-1-11 are inapplicable to plaintiffs claim for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (R. Vol. 5 Doc. 105 at 2.) The court gave no reason for this finding. Moreover, in open court proceedings, which occurred on August 10, 2005, the court stated in a conclusory manner: \u201c[i]nsofar as the defendant relies on Georgia Code 13-1-11, I have concluded that that code section is not applicable to the plaintiffs claim and that the defendant cannot assert that by way of limitation of what the plaintiff has claimed.\u201d (R. Vol. 7 Tr. At'2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Because the court did not state the basis of its ruling that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-1-11 does not apply, we are unable to grant meaningful review to the parties in this appeal. We can only speculate as to why the district court made such a ruling. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand this case to the district court with directions that the court state with specificity why O.C.G.A. \u00a7 13-1-11 should not apply to this case and support its ruling with appropriate legal authority, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
