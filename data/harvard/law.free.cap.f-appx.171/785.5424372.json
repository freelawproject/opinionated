He appeals the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>enhancement of his base offense level from 8 to 12, for failure to report or correctly identify the source of more than $10,000 income from criminal activity in any year, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), and the court\u2019s finding that the amount of his criminal forfeiture was $69,596. He also claims that the district court\u2019s amended final notice of forfeiture contains a clerical error to the extent that it connects his convictions for offenses other than identity theft to his forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Cekosky argues on appeal that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level from 8 to 12 for failure to report or correctly identify the source of more than $10,000 income from criminal activity in any year, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l). He contends that, because he deposited legally acquired money into bank accounts that he opened illegally under stolen identities, the $69,596 of interest income he earned from these accounts did not derive from criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines in the context of applying enhancements for specific offense characteristics <em>de novo, </em>and the district court\u2019s factual findings related to the imposition of sentencing enhancements for clear error. <em>United States v. Barakat, </em>130 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">According to \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l), \u201c[i]f the defendant failed to report or to correctly identify the source of income exceeding $10,000 in any year from criminal activity,\u201d the offense level should be increased either by 2 levels, or, if the resulting offense level is less than level 12, it should be increased to level 12. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l). \u201c \u2018Criminal activity\u2019 means any conduct constituting a criminal offense under federal, state, local, or foreign law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The district court did not err in applying the enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(l) because the income he earned on the bank accounts opened under stolen identities did, in fact, derive from criminal activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b). The plain language of the guideline and its commentary makes clear that Cekosky\u2019s identity theft is criminal activity from which he earned more than $10,000. Accordingly, we affirm imposition of the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Cekosky further argues that the forfeiture amount of $69,596 was excessively disproportionate to the offense he committed because the district court only imposed the minimum fine allowed, and he had deposited legally acquired money into the illegal bank accounts. He also argues that the district court erred in finding that he had only preserved his right to debate the small details of the forfeiture amount, instead of the entire amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding forfeiture, and whether it is constitutionally excessive, <em>de novo, </em>and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Puche, </em>350 F.3d 1137, 1153 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). During sentencing, the district court must order a person convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028, identity theft, to forfeit to the United States \u201cany property constituting, or <em>derived from, </em>proceeds the person obtained directly or indirectly, as the result of such violation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(2) (emphasis added). \u201c[A] punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. 321, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>334, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 2036, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The district court correctly found that $69,596 was derived from his violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b) because Cekosky was only able to open the bank accounts, and thus earn interest from these accounts, by violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028. Therefore, it is not necessary to decide whether Cekosky had preserved in the plea agreement his right to contest this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Under the Eighth Amendment, a forfeiture is excessive \u201cif it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of the a defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d <em>Bajakajian, </em>524 U.S. at 334, 118 S.Ct. at 2036. We have held that eompari- ' son to the maximum permissible fine under the statute provides a guideline to what is not an excessive f\u00edne. <em>United, States v. 817 N.E. 29th Dr., Wilton Manors, Fla., </em>175 F.3d 1304, 1309 (11th Cir. 1999). This is because \u201cCongress is a representative body, [so] its pronouncements regarding the appropriate range of fines for a crime represent the collective opinion of the American people as to what is and is not excessive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus if the forfeited amount is within the range of fines prescribed by Congress, there arises a presumption that the forfeiture is constitutional. <em>Id. </em>Assuming arguendo that the forfeiture was a fine, the statute under which Cekosky was convicted sets as its maximum fine twice his gain from the crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the forfeiture amount is smaller than that maximum, we hold that it is constitutional. Accordingly, we affirm the forfeiture amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Cekosky also points out that the amended final order of forfeiture should be corrected because his indictment connects the forfeiture amount only to his identity theft charges, whereas the amended final order of forfeiture connects the forfeiture to all of his convictions, including convictions for fraudulent use of a social security number and false statements on a tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">We may remand with instructions that the district court correct clerical errors in a final order. <em>See United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (remanding with directions to the district court to correct the clerical errors in the judgment where the statute cited in the judgment and commitment order was incorrect). We have vacated and remanded because the error in the judgment was a clerical one and \u201ccorrection of the judgment would not prejudice the defendant in any reversible way.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1252-53 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) correctly calculated the criminal forfeiture amount based on Cekosky\u2019s convictions for identity theft, which were Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. Therefore, the statement in the amended final order of forfeiture that the amount of $69,596 relates to Cekosky\u2019s convictions on Counts 1, 2, 10, and 15 is merely a clerical error, the correction of which would not prejudice Cekosky in any way. <em>See Diaz, </em>190 F.3d at 1252-53. Thus, we remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the limited purpose of correcting the error. <em>See Anderton, </em>136 F.3d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED in part, REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-6\">. The forfeiture was tied to Cekosky\u2019s identity theft charges, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b), a class C felony. Because \u00a7 1028 does not specify a fine, the general fine provision 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3571 is used. This section provides for a fine up to $250,000 for a felony. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3571(b)(3). Section 3571(d) also provides: \"If any person derives pecuniary gain from the offense, ... the defendant may be fined not more than the greater of twice the gross gain ..., unless imposition of a fine under this subsection would unduly complicate or prolong the sentencing process.\u201d Cekosky's pecuniary gain from his identity theft was the amount set for the forfeiture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
