Capers argues that the sentence should be vacated because the court erred in its consideration of the mitigating factors he raised under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and, relatedly, because 80 months is unreasonably long. Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">After hearing Capers\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) arguments regarding mitigating circumstances, the district court clearly stated that it \u201cconsidered the factors as outlined in 18 U.S.C. 3553\u201d in \u201cdetermining what would be an appropriate sentence.... \u201d Capers calls this acknowledgment inadequate, arguing that a court must \u201caddress and either accept or reject factors raised and submitted for consideration at sentencing.\u201d A district court must consider the mitigating factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but it need not explain each factor\u2019s applicability and relation to the sentence actually imposed. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). A simple \u201cacknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient....\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find that this requirement was adequately met in the present case. Absent evidence to the contrary, we have no cause to conclude that the court\u2019s avowed consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s effect on Caper\u2019s sentence failed to encompass the arguments it had just solicited on that score. Under such circumstances, a court\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d to specifically address the content of defendant\u2019s arguments is analytically equivalent to a court\u2019s \u201cfailure,\u201d upheld in <em>Talley, </em>to enumerate and explain each of the mitigating factors it purports to have considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Capers\u2019s challenge to the length of his sentence also fails. A sentencing court must correctly calculate the sentencing range advised under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). It \u201cmay [then] impose a more severe or more lenient sentence,\u201d so long as the sentence is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. The burden on appeal rests with the party alleging unreasonableness, and this Court ordinarily expects to uphold as reasonable an otherwise sound sentence that falls within the advisory Guidelines range. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (11th Cir.2005). Capers is unable to overcome these premises. Despite his extensive criminal history, and his second conviction on this very offense, Capers was sentenced at the lower end of the advisory Guideline range and 40 months below the 120-month statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
