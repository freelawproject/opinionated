We previously affirmed Samuel E. Savilla\u2019s conviction following a guilty plea for cultivating greater than twenty marijuana plants in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), as well as his resulting eighteen-month sentence. <em>See United States v. Savilla, </em>No. 03-4758 (4th Cir. Sept. 9, 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Savilla\u2019s case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-25\">A Sixth Amendment error occurs when a district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Because Savilla did not raise a Sixth Amendment challenge or object to the mandatory application of the guidelines in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>ed States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Savilla\u2019s plea supports a conclusion that he is responsible for the cultivation of two kilograms of marijuana. These facts correspond with an offense level of ten. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(15) (2003). Combined with his criminal history category of one, this offense level yields a sentencing range of six to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, table. Savilla\u2019s sentence of eighteen months exceeds this range. Because this error affects Savilla\u2019s substantial rights, we conclude it is plainly erroneous.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. We affirm Savilla\u2019s conviction for the reasons stated in our prior opinion of September 9, 2004. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \u201c[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Savilla\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
