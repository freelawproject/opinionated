Pimentel asserts his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. </em>Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-28\">The erroneous application of the Guidelines as mandatory is technically a <em>Fanfan </em>error. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005); <em>see Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. Such error is <em>not </em>structural. <em>Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The Government concedes Pimentel preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim for appeal. The Government fails to meet its burden of proving the sentence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it fails to cite to any record evidence showing the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 171 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. </em>filed,{No. 05-8843) (23 Jan. 2006); <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 464 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore vacate Pimentel\u2019s sentence and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Pimentel also maintains the enhancement provisions in \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. As he concedes, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it\u201d. <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). He raises the issue to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
