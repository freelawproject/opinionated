Defendant contends the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when it calculated his sentence based on drug quantities greater than the quantities charged in the indictment and to which Defendant pleaded guilty. Defendant\u2019s constitutional claims were raised timely in the district court and, as such, are preserved for our review. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Defendant argued at sentencing and argues again on appeal that, consistent with his constitutional rights, he may be sentenced based on drug quantities no greater than those charged in the indictment to which he pleaded guilty. According to Defendant, because the drugs associated with the substantive counts in the indictment totaled 1,000 grams of methamphetamine and 500 grams of cocaine, Defendant\u2019s offense level under the guidelines, before credit for acceptance of responsibility, was level 32. Based on this level 32 calculation, Defendant\u2019s criminal history category of I, and application of a three-point credit for acceptance of responsibility, Defendant\u2019s guidelines sentence was less than the 10-year mandatory minimum. Defendant contends his sentence can be no greater than the 10-year mandatory minimum plus the consecutive five-year sentence for the weapons offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Instead, the district court held Defendant accountable for drug quantities stated in the PSI and calculated sentence based on almost 16,000 grams of methamphetamine and almost 1600 grams of cocaine. Over the government\u2019s objection, the district court gave Defendant a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Based on this drug quantity, Defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, and a criminal history category of I, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 168 to 210 months, plus the consecutive five-year sentence for the weapons offense. Defendant was sentenced to 168 months imprisonment for the drug offenses, to be followed by 60 months, for a total of 228 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">We see no merit in Defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. Although Defendant argues to the contrary, Defendant admitted to the additional drug amounts during the plea colloquy. Before Defendant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted by the court, the government stated that the evidence at trial would show that at least 500 grams of cocaine and 39 pounds of methamphetamine was recovered from Defendant\u2019s apartment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and additional methamphetamine (approximately one pound or .454 kg) was seized as a result of the LaBarca transaction. Although the district court did not question Defendant about the exact drug amounts in the government\u2019s factual proffer, the Defendant did admit expressly his responsibility for these drugs. And, even at sentencing, Defendant made no objection to the drug quantities set out in the PSI on factual grounds; he objected on constitutional grounds to an enhancement for quantities beyond those charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>in the indictment. When a defendant admits to the facts that enhanced his sentence, no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker </em>can be shown. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (reaffirming that facts used to enhance a sentence, other than a prior conviction, must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant); <em>see United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). And, a defendant\u2019s failure to dispute drug-quantity facts contained in the PSI operates as an admission of those facts for <em>Booker </em>purposes. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Although we conclude that the sentencing court committed no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, two kinds of sentencing error may be claimed under <em>Booker: </em>constitutional and statutory. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331 (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005)). Statutory booker error occurs when the district court misapplies the guidelines by considering them as binding \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Because the district court sentenced Defendant under a mandatory guidelines system, statutory <em>Booker </em>error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">We apply preserved error review to a statutory <em>Booker </em>claim if defendant preserved a constitutional claim by \u201ccitation to Apprendi or to other cases in that line of cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Statutory <em>Booker </em>error requires reversal \u201conly if [the error] resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the [result].\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States, v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999)). The government bears the burden to show the absence of effect of the statutory error on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. A sentence is due to be affirmed if it can be said \u201c \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306,1315-16 (11th Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">From our review of the record we can not say with fair assurance that Defendant\u2019s sentence was not substantially impacted on by the statutory <em>Booker </em>error. What sentence the district court would have imposed had it considered the guidelines advisory and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) is unknown and unknowable. The government failed to carry its burden of showing that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">. <em>Booker </em>was decided by the Supreme Court after Defendant was sentenced. At sentencing, Defendant raised his constitutional claims based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because the <em>Booker </em>decision applies to all cases on direct review, we apply <em>Booker </em>to this appeal. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\">. Laboratory reports show that the actual amount of methamphetamine seized from Defendant\u2019s apartment was 33.869 pounds, not 39 pounds. The PSI calculated Defendant\u2019s sentence based on the actual amounts set out in the laboratory reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">. We apply preserved error review when considering both constitutional and statutory <em>Booker </em>error when, as here, the defendant made a constitutional <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court and his initial appellate brief was filed before our decision in <em>Shelton.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
