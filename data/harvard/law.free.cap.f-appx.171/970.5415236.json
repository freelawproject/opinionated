We previously affirmed James A. Savage\u2019s convictions and sentence for his role in a lengthy conspiracy to defraud investors through bogus investment schemes. <em>United States v. Savage, </em>390 F.3d 823 (4th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Savage\u2019s case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">A Sixth Amendment error occurs when a district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Our review of the record discloses that Savage\u2019s sentence was enhanced on multiple grounds based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by Savage. Because the verdict involved only an unspecified financial loss, Savage\u2019s base offense level is six. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Fl.l(a) (2001). When combined with Savage\u2019s criminal history category of IV, the resulting sentencing range is zero to six months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, table. The district court\u2019s sentence of 250 months far exceeds this range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude, as the Government concedes, that the sentence was imposed in violation of Savage\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">We vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>Athough the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the Guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the Guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for imposing a non-Guidelines sentence as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. We affirm Savage\u2019s convictions for the reasons stated in our opinion of December 10, 2004. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-12\"> Just as we noted in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005), \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Savage's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
