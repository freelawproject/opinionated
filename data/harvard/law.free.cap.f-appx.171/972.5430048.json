We previously affirmed James Howard Harris\u2019 sentence imposed upon his convictions for distribution of an unspecified quantity of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000), and possession of a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924 (2000). <em>United States v. Harris, </em>No. 04-4020 (4th Cir. Oct.13, 2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Harris\u2019 case for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>A district court violates the Sixth Amendment when, acting pursuant to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines, it imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746, 750; <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The fact of a prior conviction, however, is an exception to this general rule and need not be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-36, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This exception was reaffirmed in <em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (\u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence ... must be proved to a jury.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 351-54 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The sentence imposed by the district court does not violate Harris\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights. First, the indictment to which Harris pled guilty supports a base offense level of fourteen, which was increased to twenty-four due to his prior felony convictions. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), (6) (2002). However, because of Harris\u2019 two prior convictions for narcotics distribution, he was properly considered a career offender with an offense level of thirty-two. USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. This offense level combines with Harris\u2019 criminal history category of VI to yield a recommended sentencing range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, table. The sentence of 151 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the district court does not exceed the sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, Harris has demonstrated no Sixth Amendment violation. Moreover, nothing in the sentencing transcript suggests that the court would have imposed a different sentence under a non-mandatory application of the guidelines. <em>See generally United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">We affirm Harris\u2019 convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-21\"> For purposes of the <em>Booker </em>Sixth Amendment analysis, we do not factor in the acceptance of responsibility adjustment awarded by the district court. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
