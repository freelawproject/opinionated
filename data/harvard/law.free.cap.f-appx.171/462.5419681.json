The district court sentenced Pece\u00f1o to 20 months of imprisonment, based in part on a prior aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Pece\u00f1o contends that his sentence is illegal under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because it was imposed pursuant to a mandatory application of the federal sentencing guidelines. Pece\u00f1o thus alleges a \u201cFanfan\u201d error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005). In the district court, Pece\u00f1o objected to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and the Government concedes that the issue is preserved and that it is subject to review for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The Government has not carried its burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court\u2019s error did not affect Peceno\u2019s sentence. <em>See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464; <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285-86 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464; <em>Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d at 285-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Pece\u00f1o also argues that the district court erred when it characterized his 2003 Texas felony conviction of simple possession of a controlled substance as an aggravated felony and enhanced his offense level by eight levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). In <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 693-94 (5th Cir.1997), this court held that a state conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) if the offense was punishable under the Controlled Substances Act and a felony under applicable state law. <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 693. Pece\u00f1o concedes that his conviction of simple possession of rock cocaine was a felony under Texas law. Also, the Controlled Substances Act criminalizes possession of a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Peceno\u2019s prior conviction therefore is an aggravated felony that warrants the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) eight-level offense level increase. <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d at 694; <em>see also United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312-13 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">Pece\u00f1o recognizes this court\u2019s prior decisions, but he argues that this circuit\u2019s precedent is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis set forth in <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943). <em>Jerome </em>did not involve interpretation of the Guidelines. Also, <em>Jerome, </em>a 1943 decision, is not \u201can intervening Supreme Court case\u201d that explicitly or implicitly overruled <em>HinojosaLopez. </em>Thus, this court is bound by <em>Hinojosa-Lopez, see Martin v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 573, 577 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>Jerome </em>does not affect the binding precedential value of <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Hinojosar-Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">Pece\u00f1o also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. Peceno\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Pece\u00f1o contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Pece\u00f1o properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Accordingly, the conviction is AFFIRMED. Peceno\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
