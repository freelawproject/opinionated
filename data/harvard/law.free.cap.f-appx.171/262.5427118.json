Querido\u2019s offenses involved 3,731 kilograms of cocaine that the U.S. Coast Guard found hidden on a fishing vessel in the Pacific Ocean. The vessel had an eight-member crew, including Querido, who served as a deck hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-22\">On appeal, Querido asserts that the district court should have granted him a minor role adjustment. He argues that it is uncontroverted that he was just an \u201caverage crew member\u201d on a boat with three other \u201caverage crew members.\u201d He contends that his mere presence on the boat was not an appropriate factor to deny a minor role adjustment. He further argues that the district court did not follow the reasoning established in <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930 (11th Cir.1999), and contends that the court ignored the facts that he had no knowledge or information about the scope or structure of the enterprise, or any of the factors discussed in <em>De Var\u00f3n. </em>He maintains that his presence on the ship contributed little to the venture, and that his role was a classic illustration of what the guidelines label minimal or minor role.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, 175 F.3d 930, 937 </em>(11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The Sentencing Guidelines provide that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be decreased by four levels if the defendant was a minimal participant in an offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). If the defendant was a minor participant, his offense level should be reduced two levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). In cases in which the defendant\u2019s role falls between a minor and minimal participant, the defendant\u2019s offense level is decreased by three levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The application notes indicate that \u00a7 3B1.2 \u201cprovides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 App. Note 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Minimal participants are \u201cdefendants who are plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 App. Note 4. A defendant\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This adjustment was intended to be used infrequently. <em>Id. </em>Minor participants are defendants who are less culpable than most other participants, but their roles cannot be described as minimal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 App. Note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, 175 </em>F.3d at 939. In considering a defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court should first measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 945. In many cases, this analysis will be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Second, the court may \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s role against the other participants, to the extent they are discernable, in that relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. The court \u201cmay consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. To apply a minor role adjustment, the court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than most other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Upon review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Querido\u2019s role was no less critical than the roles of the other participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
