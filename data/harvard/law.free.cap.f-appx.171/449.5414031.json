Ramirez-Aguilar was sentenced to thirty-three months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-20\">For the first time on appeal, Ramirez-Aguilar argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it does not require the fact of a prior felony or aggravated felony conviction to be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ramirez-Aguilar contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ramirez-Aguilar properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Ramirez-Aguilar also argues for the first time on appeal that his prior Texas conviction for Class A misdemeanor assault was not a crime of violence for purposes of an eight-level enhancement pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2003) [hereinafter U.S.S.G.]. Because he failed to raise this issue in the district court, this court reviews for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2005). When determining whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence because it has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, district courts must employ the categorical approach established in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 320. \u201cUnder that approach, courts determine the elements to which a defendant pleaded guilty by analyzing the statutory definition of the offense, not the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 257 (5th Cir. 2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1076, 125 S.Ct. 932, 160 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005)). If a statute contains multiple, disjunctive subsections, the court may look beyond the statute to certain records to determine which particular statutory provision applies to the defendant\u2019s conviction, but \u201c[tjhese records are generally limited to the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction arose under either Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) or (a)(3) (Vernon 2003). A conviction under \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) is a crime of violence sufficient to trigger the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>325 F.3d 553, 561 (5th Cir.2003). A conviction under \u00a7 22.01(a)(3), however, is not a crime of violence and does not trigger the enhancement. <em>See Gonzalez-Garcia v. Gonzales, </em>166 Fed.Appx. 740 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Unfortunately, the record does not tell us which subsection of \u00a7 22.01 \u2014 (a)(1) or (a)(3) \u2014 applies to Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s conviction. Although the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) contains facts pertaining to Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s alleged conduct in committing the underlying offense, we are not permitted to rely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s prior conviction for enhancement purposes. <em>Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 320-21 (citing <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274 (\u201c[U]nder <em>Shepard, </em>a district court is not permitted to rely on a PSR\u2019s characterization of a defendant\u2019s prior offense for enhancement purposes.\u201d)). Aside from the judgment of conviction, which does not indicate whether Ramirez-Aguilar was convicted under \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) or \u00a7 22.01(a)(3), the record contains no other documents \u2014 such as an indictment, information, plea agreement, or transcript of the plea colloquy from Texas state court \u2014 that this court may rely on to determine whether Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s conviction constituted a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, we cannot identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>with legal certainty under which portion of a statute a defendant was convicted, we remand to the district court for supplementation of the record and resentencing. <em>See id. </em>(reviewing crime of violence enhancement for plain error and remanding to the district court for supplementation of the record and resentencing where the court could not determine \u201cwith legal certainty which portion of the sexual battery statute [the defendant] was convicted under\u201d); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Chavez, </em>432 F.3d 334, 338 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhere we cannot identify with legal certainty under which portion of a statute a defendant was convicted, we cannot determine [under plain-error review] whether a crime of violence enhancement was proper. In such a case, we remand to the district court for supplementation of the record and re-sentencing.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, we vacate the sentence imposed on Ramirezr-Aguilar and remand to the district court for development of the record and resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On remand, the district court should order the government to supplement the record with documents that might establish to which elements of assault Ramirez-Aguilar pleaded guilty. Once the government has supplemented the record, the district court should reconsider whether an eight-level enhancement is warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), taking into consideration whether Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s conviction for assault qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>See Shelton, </em>325 F.3d at 561; <em>Gonzalez-Garcia, </em>166 Fed.Appx. at 741. In making this determination, the district court will no longer be bound by the Guidelines, but it should still determine the applicable guideline range and consider the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">. The judgment of conviction indicates that Ramirez-Aguilar was ultimately convicted of a reduced charge. While the indictment may not be particularly helpful in this case, the government should supplement the record with other documents, including the information filed in state court, so that the district court may discern (with legal certainty) under which provision Ramirez-Aguilar was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ABa\">. Because we vacate Ramirez-Aguilar\u2019s sentence and remand on other grounds, it is unnecessary to address Ramirez-Aguilar's argument in his supplemental letter brief that the district court erred by mandatorily applying the Guidelines. <em>See Bonilla-Mungia, </em>422 F.3d at 321 n. 6 (citing <em>United States v. Alfaro, </em>408 F.3d 204, 210 n. 2 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 271, 163 L.Ed.2d 243 (2005)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
