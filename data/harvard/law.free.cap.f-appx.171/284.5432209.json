The district court denied the motion, agreeing with the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that the Appellants\u2019 subsequent fee request was untimely. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">The order currently on appeal is the result of the denial of Appellants\u2019 second motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. In their first motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 after the entry of judgment in their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, Appellants reserved their right to seek additional fees for litigating the fee motion. Appellants never supplemented this motion with the hours spent working on the litigation of fees, in accordance with the local custom in the Middle District of Florida. In the report and recommendation on this first motion, the magistrate judge noted the motion sought additional fees for litigating the fee issue, but that amount was \u201cunspecified.\u201d The report and recommendation recommended an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation expenses for the litigation as a whole, which did not include an award for any post-judgment advocacy. Additionally, the report and recommendation did not reserve jurisdiction to consider additional petitions for fees. Appellants filed objections to the report and recommendation, but did not object to the omission of jurisdiction to consider a future petition for attorneys\u2019 fees relating to litigating the fee issue. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and did not reserve jurisdiction to consider further fee petitions. Only after the judgment on the first motion did the Appellants file this second motion for fees for litigating their first motion for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">\u201cThis court reviews an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion; nevertheless, that standard of review still allows us to closely scrutinize questions of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>decided by the district court in reaching a fee award.\u201d <em>Villano v. City of Boynton Beach, </em>254 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations and citation omitted). District courts are \u201cfree to adopt local rules establishing timeliness standards for the filing of claims for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309 (quotations and citations omitted). However, a local rule cannot eviscerate a statutory right. <em>Id. </em>at 1309-10. Local Rule 4.18(a) of the Middle District of Florida provides \u201c[i]n accordance with Fed. R.Civ.P. 54, all claims for costs or attorney\u2019s fees ... shall be asserted by separate motion or petition filed not later than fourteen (14) days after the entry of judgment.\u201d In <em>Villano, </em>we held a magistrate judge erred in the interpretation of a local rule, when the magistrate judge disallowed supplementation of the original attorneys\u2019 fees motion with amounts spent litigating the fee issue because the supplemental filings were past the Southern District of Florida\u2019s time limit for filing an attorneys\u2019 fees motion. <em>Villano, </em>254 F.3d at 1309-10. \u201c[P]ost-judgment advocacy may generally be included in a \u00a7 1988 award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">This situation is different than the one in <em>Villano, </em>where the magistrate judge disallowed supplementation of the original motion. Here, the Appellants never attempted to supplement the original motion even though they reserved their right to request additional fees in the original motion and had ample time to supplement the motion. While Appellants\u2019 second motion was filed within 14 days of the first judgment on attorneys\u2019 fees, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding this second motion was untimely. The magistrate judge points out that the usual practice for counsel seeking an award of fees related to a fee petition is to include a reasonable estimate of the time and effort expected. It was not an abuse of discretion to expect Appellants to follow this practice, especially in light of the fact Appellants reserved their right to request additional fees in the first motion, and in light of the fact the magistrate judge essentially reminded them to \u201cspecify\u201d the amount of fees in the first report and recommendation. The procedure employed by Appellants could, as the magistrate judge noted, \u201clead to a never ending succession of fee requests.\u201d We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the second motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
