Desrosiers challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. She contends the Fanmi Lavalas persecuted her in Haiti on account of her political activity and she has a well-founded fear of persecution. We deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">We review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s findings. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is de novo. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (citation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283,1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">A. <em>Adverse credibility finding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Desrosiers first argues the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence as it was based on minor inconsistencies regarding specific dates, improper reliance on gaps in the testimony, and testimony that was not truly inconsistent. Further, some inconsistencies can be attributed to her poor understanding of the English language.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for asylum or withholding of removal without corroboration. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). When the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and is supported by the record, we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ with respect to its credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). Although we have not directly addressed the issue, both the Third and the Ninth Circuits have held an adverse credibility finding must go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the \u201cheart of the asylum claim,\u201d and not be based on minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, and omissions. <em>See Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 954 (9th Cir.1999). Further, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider all of an applicant\u2019s evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, to the extent it addressed Desrosiers\u2019 testimony concerning her political activity, was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ cited several inconsistencies in Desrosiers\u2019 account of her political activity including: (1) her statements related to the Patriotte Uni Pour La Democracy D, Haiti (PUDH), the Convergence Party (CP), and Gerard Gourgue\u2019s leadership of the PUDH; and (2) her statements related to when she joined the PUDH. Desrosiers stated the PUDH was part of the CP, and essentially the same organization. The documentary evidence did not support this assertion. The only document linking the PUDH and the CP was Desrosiers\u2019 ID card. However, erasure smudges and incomplete seals contained on the card supported the conclusion the card was not authentic. Other documents, which failed to identify PUDH as part of CP, supported a conclusion PUDH did not exist. Desrosiers also stated she joined the PUDH in 1997, but later testified she joined the group in 2000. These inconsistencies cut to the heart of her claim as they concern the length and extent of Desrosiers\u2019 political activity. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s finding that Desrosiers was not credible with regard to her political activity was supported by substantial evidence, and Desrosiers presented no evidence compelling a reversal of this determination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, as the IJ based his ultimate conclusion on Desrosiers\u2019 lack of evidence, the adverse credibility finding was not determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">B. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Next, Desrosiers argues she was eligible for asylum under the INA because she was persecuted by the Lavalas party on account of her political opinion. Specifically, she argues she suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of the abduction of her and her brother, her attempted rape by one of the kidnapers, and her brother\u2019s continued disappearance, all of which was on account of their political activism.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined in the INA as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcR\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision Desrosiers did not suffer past persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ found Desrosiers\u2019 testimony concerning her political involvement was incredible, and, as explained above, this finding was supported by substantial evidence. As Desrosiers provided no compelling testimony or documentation that her captors were motivated by her political opinion, her past persecution claim fails. With regard to a well-founded fear of future persecution, Desrosiers has pointed to no credible evidence compelling a finding she would be persecuted on account of her political opinion by the Lavalas if she were returned to Haiti.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">C. <em>Withholding of removal and CAT relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Desrosiers further asserts she was eligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief. The evidentiary burdens for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT are greater than that imposed for asylum, accordingly, if an alien has not met the well-founded fear standard for asylum, he generally cannot meet the standard for withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303. Desrosiers\u2019 withholding of removal claims and CAT claims fail, as she did not establish eligibility for asylum, which carries a lower burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Desrosiers has not shown she was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. Thus, she is not entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\">. However, the IJ\u2019s findings that Desrosiers\u2019 was not credible when she testified regarding how long she was held captive by her abductors, the identity of her abductors, and whether or not she was raped were not supported by substantial evidence. Desrosiers\u2019 repeatedly stated she was held for three days by the men who abducted her and her brother on July 13, 2001. However, she also stated in her credible fear interview that the date of her release was \u201clike the 18th of July ...\u2019\u2019 The IJ\u2019s finding these statements were inconsistent was not supported by substantial evidence as she consistently maintained she was only held for three days and never stated a definite release date, only that it was on or about July 18, 2001. The IJ\u2019s finding her testimony was inconsistent with regards to the descriptions of the men who abducted her and her brother is also not supported by substantial evidence. The descriptions, ranging from soldiers, to armed men in uniform, to armed men dressed in CIMO uniforms, all essentially describe armed men dressed in uniform. Further, it appears the IJ did not consider the United States State Department Country Report, which noted after the military disbanded, former personnel made their way into the national police force, including the CIMO unit, which carries out mistreatment of political opponents. In addition, Desrosiers\u2019 single statement she was raped, which was immediately corrected once her attorney explained the meaning of \"rape\u201d in the context of American law, is not substantial evidence supporting a finding her multiple, consistent accounts of this incident were not credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
