Murillo also notes that he did not own the vessel, did not have any specialized skills, had no direct contact with the cocaine shipment, and did not aid in the planning of the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">Next, Murillo argues that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), contending that the district court failed to consider several of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Murillo argues that his sentence does not reflect the seriousness of his participation or provide a just punishment for a person trying to provide for a family. He contends that his sentence is excessive because it fails to consider that he would be deported upon release from prison and would not be in a position to harm anyone else in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The proponent of the reduction bears the burden of proving the minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. In determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the \u201cdecision falls within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. \u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record <em>and </em>does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, we believe that it will be rare for an appellate court to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court need not make specific factual findings in determining the defendant\u2019s role. <em>Id. </em>at 939. \u201cSo long as the district court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and the court clearly resolves any <em>disputed </em>factual issues, a simple statement of the district court\u2019s conclusion is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The guidelines provide for a two-level minor participant reduction. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2. A defendant is a minor participant if he is less culpable than most other participants, but his role was not minimal. <em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In determining whether a role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. Under the first prong, the district court \u201cmust assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Under the second prong, the court \u201cmeasure[s] the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. In this analysis the court \u201cshould look to other participants only to the extent that they are identifiable or discernable from the evidence\u201d and \u201cmay consider only those participants who were involved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The district court did not clearly err in denying a minor role reduction. With respect to the first prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>a district court may legitimately conclude that a drug courier played an important and essential role where the courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to his own criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. The relevant conduct attributed to Murillo was identical to his actual conduct because he was only held accountable for the 16 bales of cocaine recovered from the vessel, which contained 320 kilograms of cocaine. Thus, Murillo\u2019s claim under the first prong fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">With respect to the second prong, Murillo\u2019s counsel argued that Murillo was only a deck hand who was not involved in the planning or financing of the shipment and would not have profited from the shipment. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) did not specify what roles the other crew members played in organizing the drug shipment, and Murillo did not proffer any facts distinguishing his role from the other crew members. Murillo did not testify regarding his involvement in the transaction or proffer testimony from any other defendants indicating that he played a smaller role than other crew members. As the record is largely devoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>of evidence clarifying any distinction in the roles played by the crew members, Murillo\u2019s argument also fails under this prong. Thus, Murillo has not met his high burden of proving that the district court clearly erred in denying a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s final sentence imposed, in its entirety, for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Those factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment; (4) the need to protect the public; and (5) the guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A district court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). We have acknowledged that the guidelines remain \u201ccentral to the sentencing process,\u201d but we have rejected the idea that a sentence within the guidelines is per se reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We hold that Murillo\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court stated at sentencing that it had considered the advisory guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a) factors and had determined that the sentence imposed was sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing. Mhrillo\u2019s 135-month sentence is at the low end of the guideline range, a range that takes into account Murillo\u2019s offense conduct, personal characteristics and history, just punishment, and adequate deterrence. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330. Murillo\u2019s sentence is also within the statutory range of ten years to life. The court also considered the nature of the offense and the need to provide adequate deterrence because it commented that even individuals playing alleged smaller roles in drug smuggling need to be deterred. Thus, Murillo\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">. The government argues on appeal that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear challenges to the reasonableness of the sentence in this case. We recently held, however, that \u201ca <em>post-Booker </em>appeal based on the \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that a sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-19\">. Because the sentence is reasonable under either an abuse of discretion or plain error review standard, we do not address whether Murillo raised a sufficient reasonableness objection in the district court, which would affect which standard of review would apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
