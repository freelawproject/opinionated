No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">Reeves entered his guilty plea before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Reeves stipulated that he would purchase merchandise from Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot stores using stolen credit card numbers provided by a co-conspirator, who obtained the numbers from a gas station. Reeves would write the stolen numbers on legitimate \u201cinstant issue\u201d credit cards and then made the purchases. At the plea colloquy, Reeves was informed that the statutory maximum sentences were five years for Count One and ten years for Count Two. Reeves was advised that the Sentencing Guidelines would apply to his case and that, after the guideline range was determined, the district court would have \u201csome very limited authority to go ... above the guideline.\u201d The plea agreement reflected that the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion would be restricted \u201conly by the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>tory provisions and the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Based on a total offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of III, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a guideline sentencing range of 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI assigned Reeves a loss, amount of $88,222.74 and described Reeves\u2019s 26 past convictions, the majority of which were for writing bad checks and for driving with a suspended or revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">At sentencing, which occurred shortly after <em>Booker </em>was decided, the district court stated that the guidelines were advisory, not mandatory. The court indicated that it \u201chad reviewed and fully considered all of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the applicable guideline range and the policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.\u201d The court then adopted the PSI, but sentenced Reeves to 60-month concurrent sentences, noting that the court had tailored the sentences to take into account the amount of loss, Reeves\u2019s criminal history, and the \u201cinvolved nature of the offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Reeves argues that the application of the Sentencing Guidelines as advisory, rather than mandatory, worked to his detriment and violated his Fifth Amendment Due Process rights. Reeves contends that, when he committed his crimes, the guidelines were mandatory and that, under the mandatory guideline range, the district court was limited to imposing a 15 to 21 month sentence, absent a lawful departure. He, thus, maintains that he did not have fair warning of the punishment that he would face <em>post-Booker </em>and that his sentence should not exceed the sentence permitted by the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a claim of constitutional eiTor; but we will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">We previously have rejected a due process \u201cfair warning\u201d claim in <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1307-08 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). We are not persuaded by Reeves\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Duncan </em>on the ground that the life sentence imposed in <em>Duncan </em>was identified not just by the applicable statute, but also indicated by the guidelines themselves. In <em>Duncan, </em>we wrote that, at the time the defendant committed the offense of conviction, \u201c[although mandatory Guidelines were in place, the law of this Circuit then recognized the U.S.Code as the source of the maximum sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308. The statutory maximum sentences in effect at the time of Reeves\u2019s criminal conduct \u2014 five years for Count One and ten years for Count Two \u2014 provided him with enough fair warning for purposes of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Reeves also asserts that the application of the guidelines as advisory, rather than mandatory, resulted in a breach of the plea agreement. We reject this contention. The plea agreement provided that the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion would be restricted by the guidelines. But the plea agreement did not attempt to define the scope of that restriction. And after <em>Booker, </em>courts still are required to consider the guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767. Further, the plea agreement warned that \u201cany prediction of the sentence which may be imposed is not a guarantee or binding promise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-14\">Reeves challenges his sentence as unreasonable. He contends that the guidelines do not provide for enhancement when the nature of a fraud is \u201cinvolved.\u201d And he maintains that, although the district court took into account his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>history and the loss amount in imposing sentence, the court failed to make a finding that these elements were considered inadequately in forming the proper guideline range. He also asserts that a 60-month sentence was too extreme of a departure from the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>In determining whether a sentence is unreasonable, we are guided by the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. These factors include (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense, (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant, (3) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment, (4) the need to protect the public, and (5) the guideline range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Here, in imposing a sentence above the guideline maximum of 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court stated that it had considered all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the guidelines. To the extent that Reeves challenges the district court\u2019s failure to explain the weight it accorded to each sentencing factor, the court was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2005). The district court also noted that it was considering the amount of loss, Reeves\u2019s criminal history, and the \u201cinvolved nature of the offenses.\u201d In addition, the district court expressed its concern that Reeves extensively had targeted two victims: Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s. And we note that Reeves\u2019s 60-month concurrent sentences are only one third of the 15-year total statutory maximum sentence he could have received had the district court decided to sentence him to a 10-year sentence on Count Two and to run the sentences consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The district court properly detailed why, based on its consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors, a sentence above the guideline range was warranted. Thus, after reviewing the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we are satisfied that Reeves\u2019s 60-month concurrent sentences are not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
