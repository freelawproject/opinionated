Mears timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">Mears challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cthat evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996)). We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find that the evidence was sufficient to support Mears\u2019 convictions of mail fraud, <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999); <em>United States v. Godwin, </em>272 F.3d 659, 666 (4th Cir.2001), wire fraud, <em>Neder, </em>527 U.S. at 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827; <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>416 F.3d 593, 600 (7th Cir.2005); and interstate travel fraud, <em>Brown v. Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>353 F.3d 405, 407 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Monus, </em>128 F.3d 376, 384 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">Mears also argues that his federal prosecution violates the prohibition against double jeopardy, that the state authorities engaged in outrageous conduct in referring his case to the federal authorities, that the federal prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct, and that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. We find these claims are meritless. Finally, Mears argues that he was deprived of effective assistance of trial counsel. However, because the record does not conclusively show ineffective assistance of counsel, this claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Mears\u2019 convictions and sentence. Mears\u2019 motion to file an oversized brief is granted. Mears also filed a motion entitled \u201cRequest for Certification or Judicial Notice of Presentence Report.\u201d To the extent that he asks this court to consider the presentence report in reviewing his claims, we grant the motion. Mears\u2019 motion for transcripts is denied as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-7\"> Mears was represented by counsel at his jury trial, but elected to proceed without counsel at all further proceedings, including on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
