Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, Defendant-Appellant David Sanchez-Morales has submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>The government has submitted a motion to reinstate our prior affirmance of Sanchez-Morales\u2019s conviction and sentence, which Sanchez-Morales opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Sanehez-Morales pleaded guilty to reentering the United States unlawfully following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. According to Sanehez-Morales, he returned to the United States to look for work. He has a wife, six children, and an elderly mother. After he was arrested for illegal reentry, Sanehez-Morales alleges that he suffered a significant physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The district court increased Sanchez-Morales\u2019s offense level under the Guidelines because he had a prior felony drug conviction, and the court ultimately sentenced him to 60 months imprisonment -three months above the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. SanehezMorales appealed his sentence, and we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sanchez-Morales then obtained Supreme Court review on the issues he raised on appeal and on the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>As noted above, the Supreme Court remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AyF\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Sanehez-Morales raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sanehez-Morales argues that the extraordinary circumstances review is inapplicable to his case for a variety of reasons. As his claim does not survive the less stringent plain error review, we need not address his objections to the extraordinary circumstances standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-18\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes error, and that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden only if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>der an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AU9B\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Sanchez-Morales notes that the Guidelines discourage the consideration of family factors and physical condition as grounds for departure. This is relevant because Sanchez-Morales contends that he presented sympathetic family circumstances and physical condition at sentencing. Thus, Sanchez-Morales insists that a sentencing judge would likely sentence him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme because of his special circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">At the outset, as Sanchez-Morales concedes, there is no indication in the record that the district court would have sentenced Sanchez-Morales differently. Moreover, even though the Guidelines state that \u201cfamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted,\u201d the commentary to that section specifically provides that the sentencing court may take a family\u2019s loss of financial support into account in deciding to depart downward.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Likewise, although physical condition is not \u201cordinarily\u201d relevant in the sentencing determination under the Guidelines, that section explicitly provides that \u201cextraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to depart downward.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, sentencing courts still must consider the Guidelines, even though they are no longer mandatory.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ultimately, Sanchez-Morales\u2019s argument that a sentencing court would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme is unpersuasive. Accordingly, Sanchez-Morales fails to carry his burden under the third prong of the plain error test. Concomitantly, Sanchezr-Morales fails to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances entitle him to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In the alternative, Sanchez-Morales urges us to abandon the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares </em>and instead apply the plain error standard employed by, <em>inter alia, </em>the Fourth Circuit. <em>Mares, </em>however, is the settled law of this circuit, and we may revisit it only en banc or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence as imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Sanehez-Morales\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b514-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
