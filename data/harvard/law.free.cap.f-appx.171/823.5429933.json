After review, we affirm Thompson\u2019s convictions, but vacate his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ACcu\">A. Thompson\u2019s Arrest</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">In June 2003, a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) told Corporal Roy Cuthkelvin with the Mobile County, Alabama Sheriffs Department about a man known as \u201cP\u201d who used a 2000 Mercedes and a 2003 Cadillac with Massachusetts registrations to transport kilograms of cocaine from Atlanta to Mobile. On July 14, 2003, Cuthkelvin and another officer observed a brand new Cadillac and a newer-model Mercedes, both with Massachusetts license plates and identical fancy wheels, in the parking lot of an Intown Suites motel. The officers noted the tag numbers and learned that the cars were registered to Appellant Patrick Thompson. Through the motel, the officers also determined that there was no guest registered as Patrick Thompson, but that one car was listed as belonging to Morris Parsons in room 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">Later that evening, officers stopped the Mercedes, driven by Thompson, after it entered the motel parking lot. Thompson denied staying at the motel and indicated that a friend had a room on the third floor. Thompson consented to a pat-down search, during which officers found four or five hundred dollars and a key to room 241. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Thompson also consented to a search of the Mercedes and the Cadillac. In the trunk of one car, officers found a plastic bag containing thirteen thousand dollars in cash, a large quantity of jewelry, a plane ticket in the name of Patrick Thompson and some documents bearing the name Morris Parsons.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Cuthkelvin obtained a search warrant for room 241. During the search, officers discovered, among other things, 1.5 kilograms of cocaine, 217 grams of crack cocaine, digital scales and a receipt in Thompson\u2019s name for a storage unit in Massachusetts. Thompson was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">In a taped phone conversation from jail shortly after his arrest, Thompson asked a woman named Tanya Janice Lee to empty the Massachusetts storage unit. Lee did as Thompson asked and removed a suitcase containing money, a rusty gun and some crack cocaine. Lee disposed of the gun, gave the crack to Thompson\u2019s brother, gave most of the money to Thompson\u2019s father and eventually turned the suitcase with the remaining cash over to the FBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">B. Thompson\u2019s First Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Thompson was charged in a six-count indictment with: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute powder cocaine and crack cocaine (Counts 1 and 2); (2) possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine and crack cocaine (Counts 3 and 4); (3) obstruction of justice (Count 5); and (4) a forfeiture count (Count 6). Thompson moved to suppress the evidence found in the motel room, arguing that the search was conducted before officers secured a search warrant. Thompson attached to his motion a copy of the search warrant signed by the judge and issued at 10:40 p.m. and a copy of Cuthkelvin\u2019s arrest narrative stating that the search was executed at 2140 hours, or 9:40 p.m. The district court, Chief Judge Granade, denied Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">During the trial, before Judge Butler, Cuthkelvin testified that the search of the motel room was conducted only after he obtained the search warrant from the judge and that the time noted in his arrest narrative was a typographical error. Prior to jury deliberations, the government asked the district court to revisit the prior ruling on the motion to suppress in light of Cuthkelvin\u2019s testimony about the timing of the search. Judge Butler concluded that Thompson had not been prejudiced by the lack of a suppression hearing because the evidence presented at trial indicated that the room had been searched after the officers had obtained a search warrant, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b854-10\">And I\u2019m not going to make a ruling on the motion to suppress as much as I\u2019m going to say that there appears to the Court to have been no prejudice suffered by the defendant by their [sic] not having a suppression hearing to begin with. Because everything that came out in the trial testimony, subject to cross-examination, did not indicate any avenue of possible relief, if you will, from the conclusion that everyone testified to, that the room was searched after the warrant was obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">After jury deliberations began, the jury reported that it was hopelessly deadlocked, and the district court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">C. Thompson\u2019s Second Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">In a superseding seven-count indictment, Thompson was charged with the six counts discussed above and an additional count of obstruction of justice. Thompson again moved to suppress the evidence found in the motel room, asserting the untimeliness of the search warrant. The district court, Chief Judge Granade, again denied the motion for lack of standing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>based on the law-of-the-case doctrine. After a second trial before Judge Butler presiding, the jury convicted Thompson of all seven counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">D. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 34 because Thompson was accountable for a marijuana equivalency of 4,640 kilograms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (2002). The PSI recommended increases of: (1) two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) because Thompson possessed a firearm;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) because Thompson was a leader or organizer of the conspiracy involving five or more participants; and (3) two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because Thompson had concealed and attempted to conceal the evidence in the storage unit. With a total offense level of 42 and a criminal history category of V, Thompson\u2019s Guidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Thompson objected to the PSI\u2019s recommendation of a two-level firearm enhancement and a four-level role enhancement. Thompson also objected to the mandatory application of the Guidelines and judicial fact-finding, pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">During the sentencing hearing before Judge Butler, the government conceded that a four-level role enhancement was inappropriate, and the district court limited the role enhancement to two levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). The district court overruled Thompson\u2019s objection to the firearm enhancement and his <em>Blakely </em>objection. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s calculations (except for the four-level role enhancement). This left Thompson\u2019s total offense level at 40, with a criminal history category of V, resulting in a Guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The district court rejected Thompson\u2019s request for a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range and sentenced Thompson to 480 months\u2019 imprisonment each on Counts 1 through 4 and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment each on Counts 5 and 6, all to run concurrently. Thompson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AvF\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Thompson argues that the district court erred by not holding a hearing with regard to his motion to suppress. Thompson contends that he had standing to challenge the search warrant and that the law-of-the-case doctrine did not preclude the district court from resolving the factual issue of whether the search of the motel room was conducted before officers obtained a search warrant. We find no reversible error with regard to the district court\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">\u201c[A] trial court may refuse a defendant\u2019s request for a suppression hearing and motion to suppress if the defendant fails to allege facts that, if proved, would require the grant of relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>764 F.2d 1514, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1985). We review a district court\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>203 F.3d 1279, 1285 (11th Cir.2000). As a threshold inquiry, courts must determine whether a defendant has established standing to bring the motion to suppress by sufficiently alleging that he possessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched. <em>Id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">With regard to standing, Thompson admits that he repeatedly and adamantly disclaimed any interest in the motel room on the night of the search. Such a disclaimer of ownership or interest deprives a defendant of the \u201csubjective expectation of privacy to assert standing____\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>933 F.2d 962, 964 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1991) (concluding that defendants who denied any relationship with their mother\u2019s residence except access did not have standing to object to the search, despite fact that government established at trial that defendants actually lived at the residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Additionally, Thompson\u2019s standing allegations in his motion to suppress were insufficient to justify holding a hearing. The only fact Thompson alleged in his motion to suppress relating to standing was that the \u201cgovernment contends [room 241] to be a room rented by or to the defendant.\u201d We agree with the district court that this allegation is not sufficient to establish standing. <em>See Cooper, </em>203 F.3d at 1284 (holding that defendants\u2019 offhand references to hotel room as \u201ctheirs\u201d in motion to suppress was too general and conclusory to demonstrate a reasonable expectation of privacy conferring standing and thus district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to hold a hearing); <em>United States v. Sneed, </em>732 F.2d 886, 888 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThe concepts of due process do not require that a defendant who fails to make the fundamental allegations [of standing] in his motion to suppress be afforded a pretrial hearing on his motion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Thompson points to Cuthkelvin\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant, which was attached to the motion to suppress. In the affidavit, Cuthkelvin</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">averred, among other things, that Thompson was one of two occupants of the motel room and that a key to room 241 had been found on Thompson, but also averred that Thompson had denied staying at the motel. Given that Thompson admits that he repeatedly and adamantly disclaimed any interest in the motel room on the night of the search, we conclude Cuthkelvin\u2019s affidavit also did not establish standing for Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Even assuming Thompson sufficiently alleged standing, Chief Judge Granade\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing before ruling on the second motion to suppress was not reversible error. As noted above, during the first trial, Judge Butler made a finding that the search was conducted only after the government obtained a search warrant. Thompson emphasizes that Judge Butler stated at the beginning of his comments that he was not ruling on the motion to suppress. When this phrase is read in context, however, it is clear that Judge Butler meant that he was not changing the earlier ruling on the first motion to suppress, and that he was making a factual finding as additional support for that earlier ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">Perhaps more importantly, as Chief Judge Granade noted, Thompson\u2019s second motion to suppress was \u201cfactually identical\u201d to his first motion to suppress. In other words, Thompson presented no new evidence suggesting that Judge Butler\u2019s finding was erroneous. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that Chief Judge Granade abused her discretion when she adhered to Judge Butler\u2019s earlier factual finding and denied Thompson a hearing to reconsider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-12\">B. Multiplicity</p>\n<p id=\"b856-13\">Thompson also argues that his indictment was multiplicitous because it charged him with separate counts of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>spiracy and possession for the crack cocaine (Counts 1 and 3) and cocaine powder (Counts 2 and 4) found in the motel room. \u201c \u2018An indictment is multiplicitous if it charges a single offense in more than one count.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Sirang, </em>70 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Howard, </em>918 F.2d 1529, 1532 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>whether counts in an indictment are multiplicitous. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 800, 807 (11th Cir.2000). Thompson, however, did not raise a multiplicity challenge prior to trial. Rather, Thompson raised his multiplicity challenge only after the government had rested its case and Thompson moved for a directed verdict. When a defendant fails to object to multiplicitous counts in an indictment prior to trial, he is barred from challenging his convictions and may challenge only his separate sentences. <em>United States v. Grinkiewicz, </em>873 F.2d 253, 255 (11th Cir. 1989); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(B). More importantly, Thompson received concurrent sentences on the counts he claims were multiplicitous. Therefore, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Thompson\u2019s multiplicity claim was <em>correct, any error </em>would be harmless. <em>See United States v. Langford, </em>946 F.2d 798, 804-05 (11th Cir.1991) (finding that multiplicitous securities fraud counts were harmless error because sentences were concurrent). Accordingly, we find no reversible error with regard to Thompson\u2019s concurrent sentences on Counts 1 and 3 (crack cocaine) and Counts 2 and 4 (powder cocaine).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">C. Constitutional <em>Booker </em>Error</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">On appeal, Thompson argues that the district court committed error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his sentences based on facts that he did not admit and that were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt and by sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">With regard to the constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, Thompson argues that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court calculated his base offense level using drug quantities not based on a jury determination and when it imposed a two-level firearm enhancement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There was no Sixth Amendment violation as to the drug quantity findings. Thompson\u2019s PSI held Thompson responsible for 1.5 kilograms of cocaine powder and 217 grams of crack cocaine, for a marijuana equivalency of 4,340 kilograms. Thompson did not object to the factual findings of the PSI, including the drug quantities. Nor did he object to the calculation of his base offense level using those drug quantities. Thus, Thompson admitted to being responsible for a marijuana equivalency of 4,340 kilograms. Accordingly, there was no Sixth Amendment violation with regard to the drug quantity finding. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (concluding that, even though defendant\u2019s conviction was based on only \u201cfive grams or more,\u201d the district court\u2019s drug quantity finding was not reversible <em>Booker </em>error because defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to contest the 37 grams imputed in the PSI constituted an admission of that quantity\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191-92 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 551, 163 L.Ed.2d 467 (2005); <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">There was, however, a Sixth Amendment violation as to the firearm enhancement. We reverse and remand for resentencing only if the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>error was not harmless. <em>United States v. Cain, </em>433 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2005). For a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error to be harmless, the government \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u2018the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d \u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 1348 (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005)). Here, the government has not met its burden to show that the constitutional <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. \u2018We simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Thompson\u2019s convictions, but we vacate Thompson\u2019s sentences and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\">. Specifically, the PSI stated that co-conspirator Tanya Lee admitted to authorities that the suitcase she retrieved from Thompson\u2019s storage unit in Massachusetts contained a small bag of crack, a gun and money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. In any event, there does not appear to be a multiplicity error with regard to Thompson\u2019s sentences. In this circuit, the simultaneous possession of different controlled substances constitutes separate offenses under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) for which multiple sentences may be imposed. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>656 F.2d 153, 156-60 (5th Cir. Unit B Sept.1981) (involving defendant convicted of two counts of possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 841(a), one count for marijuana and one count for qualudes, which resulted in consecutive sentences). The law has long drawn distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. <em>See, e.g., </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii)(II) &amp; (b)(l)(A)(iii); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); <em>United States v. Sloan, 97 </em>F.3d 1378, 1381-84 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining the chemical distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine and concluding that the provisions of \u00a7 841(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 imposing more severe penalties for crack cocaine do not violate the equal protection prong of the Due Process Clause); <em>United States v. Terry, </em>60 F.3d 1541, 1544-45 (11th Cir.1995) (explaining that Congress distinguished between crack cocaine and powder cocaine because \"crack cocaine is more dangerous, more highly addictive, more easily available, and less expensive than powder cocaine\u201d and finding that the harsher penalties in \u00a7 841(b) for crack cocaine do not violate the Equal Protection Clause). Because Thompson was convicted of possessing and conspiring to possess two different controlled substances \u2014 crack cocaine and powder cocaine, he did not receive multiple sentences for the same offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"ADB\">. Because Thompson timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b858-6\">. Thompson concedes in his supplemental brief that there was no Sixth Amendment violation as to the obstruction-of-justice enhancement because the facts supporting that enhancement were found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt at Thompson\u2019s trial. Specifically, the jury found that Thompson concealed and attempted to conceal currency and documents with the intent to impair their integrity and availability for use at trial. In addition, Thompson does not challenge the role enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B 1.1(c). Indeed, at sentencing Thompson agreed that a two-level role enhancement was appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\">. We do not suggest that on remand the district court must impose any particular sentence or that the district court is not free to impose the same sentence. Furthermore, as this is a limited remand to permit the district court to determine what sentence is reasonable and appropriate after considering the now-advisoiy Guidelines range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), Thompson may not re-argue issues already or necessarily decided during the first sentencing which either have been affirmed in this appeal or could have been but were not raised by him during this appeal. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>329 F.3d 1250, 1252 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that when the appellate court issues a limited mandate, \"the trial court is restricted in the range of issues it may consider on remand\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
