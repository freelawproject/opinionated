The denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Sanchez\u2019s petition for asylum and withholding of removal was affirmed by the BIA on 26 March 2004 and was not timely appealed to this Court. On 21 June 2004, Sanchez moved to reopen his case after discovering that the law license of his former attorney, Pizzini-Arnott, a member of the Puerto Rican bar, had been suspended indefinitely months before Pizzini-Arnott represented Sanchez in his asylum hearing and appeal. Sanchez claims he was materially prejudiced by Pizzini-Arnott\u2019s failure to do these things: advise Sanchez that Pizzini-Arnott\u2019s law license had been suspended, attend scheduled meetings and return phone calls, prepare Sanchez for his hearing before the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), and submit valuable evidence of torture suffered by Sanchez and his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion. <em>Gbaya v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>342 F.3d 1219, 1220 (11th Cir.2003). A petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel in a motion to reopen must show prejudice and substantial compliance with the procedural requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lazada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (BIA 1988). <em>See Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA concluded that Sanchez satisfied the <em>Lozada </em>requirements but failed to show prejudice. \u201cPrejudice exists when the performance of counsel is so inadequate that there is a reasonable probability that but for the attorney\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Sanchez has failed to show he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s representation. Pizzini-Arnott filed many documents in support of Sanchez\u2019s asylum application, participated in the evidentiary hearing before the IJ, and filed a timely appeal to the BIA with a 21-page brief. During the evidentiary hearing, Sanchez was questioned extensively about his encounters with guerillas, but Sanchez never mentioned any physical harm. Although Sanchez claims that his attorney omitted valuable evidence of torture, he has not identified what new facts or evidence he would offer if his case were reopened, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(B). It is also not clear that additional testimony regarding torture would have affected the outcome of Sanchez\u2019s case, because the IJ concluded that Sanchez\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence were not sufficiently consistent or believable to provide a plausible basis for fear of execution. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1275 (noting that attorney\u2019s failure to file appeal brief was not prejudicial where IJ\u2019s decision was based on an adverse credibility finding). The judgment of the BIA is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
