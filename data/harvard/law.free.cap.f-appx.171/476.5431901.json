Juarez argues that the facts of this ease do not give rise to the level of endangerment required for an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">The presentence report detailed that two material witnesses stated that Juarez instructed them to get under the bed of the sleeper of the tractor trailer driven by Juarez; that they were \u201csqueezed in and unable to breathe;\u201d and that \u201cthey were banging the compartment top to get someone\u2019s attention.\u201d The district court\u2019s application of the enhancement was not error. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 163 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Ortiz, </em>242 F.3d 1078, 1078-79 (8th Cir.2001); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5), comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-23\">Alternatively, Juarez argues that he was not the individual responsible for creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury because he did not direct the aliens where to hide, nor could he have because the aliens spoke Portugese and he does not. He argues that it was the guide who arranged the aliens in the tractor and that Juarez could not have foreseen that the aliens were going to place themselves where they did. Because Juarez did not present any rebuttal evidence establishing that the information in the presentence report regarding his placement of the aliens was materially untrue, the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5) was not error. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 832 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-24\">Finally, Juarez argues that the district court should not have assessed the reckless endangerment enhancement because there was no jury finding on the enhancement nor did he admit to the enhancement and because the indictment failed to allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>that he intentionally or recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person. First, Juarez\u2019s argument regarding the indictment is factually inaccurate. Second, even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing judge may find facts relevant to the determination of a Guideline\u2019s sentencing range. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
