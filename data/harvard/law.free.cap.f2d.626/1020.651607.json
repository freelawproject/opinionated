L. No. 91-379, 84 Stat. 799 (1970) authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (FERC) to order refunds of natural gas rates<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the Commission determined were allowable under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717 <em>et seq., </em>but excessive under the Economic Stabilization Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">It must first be determined, however, whether this case is within our statutory jurisdiction to review FERC rate decisions under the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. 717r(b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or whether the appeal must be reviewed by the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals (TECA).. At oral argument counsel for the FERC conceded that the rate charged by Tennessee Gas was allowable under the Natural Gas Act. Thus, the only residual issue is whether the rate is allowable under the Economic Stabilization Act and that clearly postulates a \u201ccontroversy arising under . . . \u201d the ESA. The jurisdiction over such appeals is controlled by Section 211(b)(2) of ESA, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1904 (notes) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-17\">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the <em>Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all appeals from the district courts of the United States in cases and controversies arising under this title or under </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number><em>regulations or orders issued thereunder</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">84 Stat. 749 (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Since the relevant statute vests \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d of such cases and controversies in the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals it is the only court that can decide the remaining controverted issue. Properly refined, the question whether this court has jurisdiction over this appeal thus effectively answers itself. And the Commission did file a separate appeal with the TECA which is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">In addition to the clear language of the statute vesting the TECA with \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over appeals arising under the designated title, i. e., the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, 201 et seq., (84 Stat. 749 et seq.), application of ordinary rules of statutory construction would also lead to the same result. The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 is a \u201clatter law\u201d than the Natural Gas Act and to the extent of any inconsistency between the two statutes, it implicitly restricts 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717r(b), <em>supra, </em>giving the Courts of Appeals jurisdiction in Commission rate cases, since \u00a7 717r(b) was enacted in 1938 as part of the Natural Gas Act (52 Stat. 831) and the Economic Stabilization Act was enacted in 1970 (84 Stat. 749). The <em>San Pedro, </em>2 Wheat. 132, 141, 4 L.Ed. 202 (1817); 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>(Sands 1972) \u00a7 51.03, p. 300; <em>Id., </em>1A, \u00a7 23.09, p. 223. The jurisdiction of the TECA derives from the latter statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">Further the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 and \u00a7 211(b)(2), thereof relating to appeals, deals with the matter in \u201cspecific\u201d terms that must be taken to preclude a statute dealing with general appeals. <em>Preiser v. Rodriquez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 489-90, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439, 450 (1973); 2A <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>(Sands, 1972) \u00a7 51.05, p. 315. We would intrude upon that specified jurisdiction only in the face of a clear Congressional mandate which is absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">.
