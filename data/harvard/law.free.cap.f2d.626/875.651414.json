The Committee to Protect the First Amendment Rights of Employees of the Department of Agriculture (Committee) brought the action for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that its members had been denied employment on that basis in violation of their constitutional rights. The district court granted the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">The Committee is an <em>ad hoc </em>organization composed of former employees of the Department of Agriculture who occupied positions in the field service as either State Directors of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or State Executive Directors of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS). The United States Civil Service Commission (Commission) has excepted both positions from the competitive civil service, classifying them Schedule A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s general regulations concerning Schedule A (and Schedules B and C) positions are in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Schedule A jobs are defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>as \u201cpositions other than those of a confidential or policy determining character for which it is not practicable to examine \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">On April 22 and April 25,1977, the newly appointed Secretary of Agriculture discharged a total of nine FmHA State Directors and seventeen ASCS State Executive Directors. The Committee brought this lawsuit in district court, and sought injunctive relief, claiming the Secretary was \u201cdismissing and threatening to dismiss [its] members from their positions . for partisan political reasons and threatening to and has appointed political supporters of the Carter administration to the positions now occupied by [those] members in consideration of their political support.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Am5\">The district court denied a temporary restraining order and consolidated the hearings on plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 3, 1977, the district court dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-20\">Subsequently, two letters were sent from the Chairman of the Commission to the Secretary. On August 5,1977, the Commission declined the Secretary\u2019s, request to reclassify State Executive Directors of ASCS from Schedule A to Schedule C.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It stated: \u201cThe Commission cannot conclude at this time that [State Executive Directors of ASCS] meet the Schedule C criteria for exception as policy-determining or confidential.\u201d In the second letter, dated March 29,1978, the Secretary refined his position.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>He repeated his view that difficulties had arisen in consequence of the action taken in the 1950\u2019s, which converted to Schedule A the positions of state directors of ASCS and FmHA. He reiterated his opinion that State Directors of ASCS should be converted from Schedule A to Schedule C. He indicated a distinction as to FmHA State Directors which he believed \u201cshould be in the career service.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court remanded the case to the district court for consideration of the March 29, 1978 letter and any related evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Upon remand, the district court reopened the record to consider the letter of August 5, 1977 as well as that of March 29, 1978. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. By Memorandum Opinion and Order dated August 10, 1978, the district court, finding that the \u201cletter and additional evidence [did] not affect [its] previous determination,\u201d granted summary judgment <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to the Secretary. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In <em>Elrod v. Burns, </em>427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1975), the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the dismissal of nonpolicymaking government employees because of their partisan political affiliation or nonaffiliation. Justice Brennan, writing for the plurality, relied upon <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, </em>385 U.S. 589, 87 S.Ct. 675, 17 L.Ed.2d 629 (1967) and <em>Perry v. Sinderman, </em>408 U.S. 593, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), to advance the proposition that government cannot condition the retention of government positions on demands which would be unconstitutional if made directly. 427 U.S. at 358-60, 96 S.Ct. 2673. The opinion responds to the needs of a new administration to insure that its policies will not be undercut by obstructionist tactics, but it does so by \u201climiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions.\u201d 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687. Justices Stewart and Blackmun completed the majority, confining themselves to concurring in the result on the ground that a \u201cnonpolicymaking, nonconfidential government employee can [not] be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that he is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of his political beliefs.\u201d 427 U.S. at 374-75, 96 S.Ct. at 2690 (Stewart, J. concurring). In applying the <em>Elrod </em>standard, therefore, we must look to (1) the nature of the position involved and (2) the ground for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">A. <em>The Nature of the Positions Involved</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">The Committee contends that the two posts held by its members are not policy-making positions. The district court disagreed. While it is true that \u201c[n]o clear line can be drawn between policymaking and nonpolicymaking positions,\u201d 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2687, the Supreme Court has proffered some general principles that guide our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-12\">While nonpolicymaking individuals usually have limited responsibility, that is not to say .that one with a number of responsibilities is necessarily in a policymaking position. The nature of the responsibilities is critical. Employee supervisors, for example, may have many responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>ities, but those responsibilities may have only limited and well-defined objectives. An employee with responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope more likely functions in a policymaking position. In determining whether an employee occupies a policymaking position, consideration should also be given to whether the employee acts as an adviser or formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 367-68, 96 S.Ct. at 2687.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">In determining whether the pertinent positions are policymaking, the district court considered the published job descriptions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ASCS State Executive Director, grade GS-15, is described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">[Fjully responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the program and management operations of ASCS activities throughout the State. Within broad policy, makes decisions and commitments on all phases of administration of the assigned programs, and actively participates ... in State ASCS program and policy formulation. Recommends changes and revisions in State and National policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-10\">The FmHA State Director, grade GS-15: [Fjormulates and implements the total FHA program within the State jurisdictional area, exercising executive leadership in developing and implementing operating principles and practices desirable or necessary to promote and achieve the purposes and objectives of the overall FHA program or specialized phases thereof. Gives emphasis to development of annual goals and long-range plans of operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASl\">There is no contention that these job descriptions are a spurious facade.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">In his inquiry, the district judge also considered testimony from two government witnesses and three of the terminated employees that the directors \u201cexercise considerable control over the implementation of the administration\u2019s agricultural program policies at the state and local level, and, thereby, insure either the success or failure of the programs.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This evidence fully justified the district court in concluding that the positions in question were policymaking ones. That conclusion is reinforced by the likelihood that persons administering huge Federal government programs for an entire state will have a high policy component to their activities, both because such large scale exercise of power usually implicates substantive internal policy, and because such positions are a natural source for influential recommendations of changes in policy. Each state director supervises a staff of nearly 100 statewide and acts as \u201cthe administration\u2019s pipeline and advocate at the state and the local level.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Appellant argued its case, both in the district court and before us, on the theory that the courts are controlled by the Commission\u2019s determination, in classifying the posts, that they were nonpolicymaking. We reject that view. Obviously, a Commission determination would not be conclusive against an individual who claimed that the agency had been overly restrictive in defining his constitutional rights. The content and scope of constitutional rights \u2014 their minima and maxima \u2014 are the special province of the courts.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>In approaching the constitutional inquiry we of course take into consideration the determination of the Civil Service Commission. In this litigation, however, we are confronted by the difficulty that the Commission has evolved a specialized terminology and set of classifications. The positions in Schedules A and C are both \u201cexcepted\u201d from the competitive civil service, but the relationship between these schedules is not easy to ascertain \u2014 as is evident from a reference to the Commission\u2019s reports.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> What is certainly plain is that the basis of the Commission\u2019s distinctions is different from the basis underlying the <em>Elrod </em>categories.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The point is dramatized by the fact, brought out at oral argument, that at least some attorneys on the White House staff are classified Schedule A \u2014 that is, classified by the Commission as occupying positions not of a policymaking or confidential character. In fact, there are substantial numbers of attorneys in government service classified as Schedule A.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> So also are law clerks, chaplains, and some officials appointed by the President without confirmation by the Senate, among others.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> By contrast at least some stenographic secretaries, a category of secretaries distinct from private secretaries, are classified as policymaking or confidential.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A court ruling that a position has a policymaking character which makes <em>Elrod </em>inapplicable is not to be taken as condemning any action of the Commission in classifying the position as Schedule A. The Civil Service Commission may classify positions as Schedule A rather than Schedule C in order to nudge forward toward the goal of enhancing a \u201ccareer\u201d civil service. Both Schedule A and Schedule C positions are excluded from the competitive civil service. The distinction has legal \u2014 not constitutional \u2014 significance in that veterans holding Schedule A positions acquire procedural rights under current laws and regulations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And in common understanding, Schedule A positions are considered less \u201cpolitical\u201d than those in Schedule C, so that in practice holders of Schedule A positions are less likely to seek or accept political assignments on their own time, and are more likely to have <em>de facto </em>tenure even with political changes. However, if a position does have significant policymaking components, it cannot be given <em>Elrod </em>-constitutional status merely on the basis of hopeful expectations. And appellant did not challenge the analysis of the district court, but relied solely on the Commission\u2019s classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">In the initial proceeding on these positions, the district court did not ignore the CSC designation of them, but explicitly weighed that as a factor in its consideration of the nature of the two positions in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>volved.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On remand, the court expressly considered whether either of the two letters effected its \u201cprevious determination that the ASCS and FmHA directorships are \u2018policymaking\u2019 positions within the scope of the exception in <em>Elrod.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It concluded that the \u201cletters effect no change in the duties of [the] positions . . . instead, they bear on the classification of the positions,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that its earlier determination was correct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">B. <em>Ground for Dismissal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\"><em>Elrod </em>holds that it is impermissible for a government agency to dismiss a nonpolicymaking employee solely for political reasons. It does not bar every termination of a nonpolicymaking official. In invoking <em>Elrod, </em>appellant relies on a statement of the district judge during the course of the proceeding that \u201cthese were patronage dismissals, pure and simple.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But the district court decision notes uncontroverted testimony that the administration did not know to which political party the incumbents belonged and that the Secretary never attempted to coerce the members of Appellant\u2019s group to change their party in order to retain their jobs.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> There is evidence in the record that the purpose of the Secretary\u2019s personnel review was to spotlight incumbents \u201cof such outstanding qualities that they [should] be retained\u201d when most incumbents were being replaced \u201cby individuals who supported the policies and programs of the new administration.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">This case differs in some significant respects from <em>Elrod </em>as to the reasons for the terminations. The district court did not find that the employees were dismissed solely for political reasons, and indeed cited parts of the record that point to a motivation of the Secretary to enhance policy formulation and execution. However, since we hold that the positions involved are policymaking, we need not and do not consider whether appellant\u2019s showing would suffice to establish a constitutional infringement if the positions were nonpolicy in character.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">It is for the court, not the Civil Service Commission, to decide whether a position is policymaking for constitutional purposes within the meaning of <em>Elrod v. Burns. </em>The district court gave due consideration to the Commission\u2019s classification, and to the correspondence between the Commission and the Secretary of Agriculture. It emphasized the evidence introduced on the nature of the positions. We affirm the conclusion that the positions occupied by the members of appellant\u2019s group were policymaking and therefore the discharge of the incumbents did not infringe upon their constitutional rights.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b944-14\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 213.3101, 213.3113(d)(3) and (e)(4) (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b944-24\">. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 6.2 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"Amy\">\u00a7 6.2 <em>Schedules of excepted positions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">The Commission shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, and C, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AgD\"><em>Schedule A. </em>Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A.</p>\n<p id=\"AVY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number><em>Schedule B. </em>Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B.
