We find the court\u2019s disposition informationally inadequate for full appellate review, and accordingly remand the record for additional explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">The series of events giving rise to the instant contest began in 1975 when a number of corporations filed civil actions in the District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the District of Delaware challenging the LB and CPR programs. Responsively to recommendations set forth in the <em>Manual for Complex </em>Litigation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Delaware District Court elected the expedient of liaison counsel to avoid needless duplication of effort in the cases pending before it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> So, in 1976, the court entered an order appointing Reed Smith, the plaintiffs\u2019 nominee, in that capacity on terms negotiated by them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-13\">The order authorized Reed Smith to receive and distribute to counsel for other plaintiffs documents from the court and from defendants, to coordinate appearances of counsel at hearings and court conferences, to call meetings among plaintiffs\u2019 counsel for various purposes, and to perform other administrative functions \u201cexpressly authorized by further Order of the Court.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The order also included this further provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1092-14\">For the foregoing administrative duties and functions, as liaison counsel shall perform pursuant to Order of the Court, liaison counsel shall be reimbursed periodically, not less often than quarterly, by plaintiffs, per capita, for the expense and time involved in preparation, duplication and distribution of court orders, notices, and other papers designated for distribution by liaison counsel to plaintiffs and for other administrative services rendered, pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 4 above or other Order or direction of the Court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1093-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>Reed Smith issued its first statement under this provision about two months later, covering February-April, 1976,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Howrey &amp; Simon promptly paid its $7,110 share without apparent objection.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On August 30,1976, Reed Smith sent Howrey &amp; Simon a second statement, this time showing $11,-791.70 due,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the latter immediately requested an itemized breakdown.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After-wards, as relations between them began to deteriorate, Howrey &amp; Simon refused to pay anything unless and until Reed Smith deleted reimbursement for items<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that, in the opinion of Howrey &amp; Simon, were not within the scope of the Delaware court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This Reed Smith would not do,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the two firms, lawyerly negotiating skills notwithstanding, found themselves at an impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-14\">Meanwhile, the amount in dispute continued to grow. By April of 1976, all of the LB and CPR litigation in Delaware and the Southern District of New York had been transferred to the District Court for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Like its predecessor in Delaware, the District of Columbia court felt a need for liaison counsel, and it too asked the. plaintiffs to draft a proposed order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Ultimately, the court entered orders appointing Reed Smith as coordinating counsel in both cases and, over Howrey &amp; Simon\u2019s objection, incorporating the identical reimbursement provision that had appeared in the Delaware order.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>have been predicted, wrangling over billings continued after the new order,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and neither correspondence nor face-to-face discussions succeeded in resolving the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Finally, in July, 1977, Reed Smith moved the District Court for an order directing Howrey &amp; Simon to pay all amounts allegedly due.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Both parties filed lengthy memoranda and voluminous documentation in support of their respective positions. Howrey &amp; Simon requested a hearing on Reed Smith\u2019s motion<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and raised essentially three objections: that the District Court should have allocated reimbursement on a per-firm rather than a per-client basis, that a substantial portion of the reimbursement sought was for activities beyond the compass of the court\u2019s order, and that much of what was authorized by the order had been billed at disproportionately high rates.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In particular, Howrey &amp; Simon urged that amounts billed at Reed Smith\u2019s usual commercial rates were actually attorney\u2019s fees, and as such were not properly awardable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-10\">The District Court reached its decision without a hearing. In a memorandum opinion, the court held that it was empowered to require reimbursement, and in the proportions previously set, and that it was \u201creadily apparent that [Reed Smith\u2019s] services and disbursements were well within the scope of the authority granted by [its earlier] order.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court also noted that Howrey &amp; Simon was the only firm that had not paid its allocated share of liaison counsel\u2019s claimed expenses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Resultantly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Howrey &amp; Simon was directed to pay most of Reed Smith\u2019s charges, which aggregated more than $42,000.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">II. THE OBJECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">Howrey &amp; Simon presses here essentially the same arguments it previously advanced in the District Court. We turn now to address each in turn, and that, we find, we can do with relative brevity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">A. <em>The District Court's Power</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZ9\">We have no doubt as to the District Court\u2019s authority to order reimbursement of liaison counsel on appropriate items or to allocate the responsibility for reimbursement in any reasonable manner.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Courts are inherently empowered to control their dockets,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and to that end to appoint liaison counsel and to assure that counsel will be reimbursed for his financial outlay.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> To the extent that objection is registered to raw judicial power in these areas, we find it wholly unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">B. <em>The Manner of Reimbursement</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah-\">The District Court\u2019s decision to require reimbursement on a per-client rather than a per-firm basis was also well within its authority. Howrey &amp; Simon contends that because liaison counsel\u2019s services were rendered directly to law firms, this method of allocation is unfair.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> True it is that because Howrey &amp; Simon has more clients than any other firm involved in the litigation, the combined assessments against its group of clients are greater than the aggregate levy on clients of any other firm.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>But every client pays the same amount, and the District Court\u2019s paramount concern\u2014 surely immune to condemnation \u2014 was fairness to the litigants. Since the economic burden of reimbursement is the client\u2019s and not the attorney\u2019s, no apparent harm to Howrey &amp; Simon flows from the court\u2019s scheme. We do not say that the court could not have adopted a different plan. We do say, however, that the method of allocation chosen by the court was reasonable and within the ambit of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">C. <em>The Amounts Charged</em></p>\n<p id=\"A5-0\">This leaves only the question whether Reed Smith\u2019s reimbursement items emanated from activities within the scope of the appointment orders and, if so, the further question whether the amounts requested were reasonable. The District Court expressly held that the bulk of the charges were both authorized and fair.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The court did not, however, make factual findings or articulate reasons with sufficient particularity to enable suitable review of its holding.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">The problem thus confronting us is similar to another which we addressed in the recent past. In <em>Evans v. Sheraton Park Hotel,</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>discussing an award of attorney\u2019s fees by the District Court, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1096-9\">We believe that a meaningful review requires a record that elucidates the factors that contributed to the fee decision and upon which it was based. Certainly it is not conducive to appropriate appellate review where, as here, the reviewing tribunal is completely in the dark as to what the trial judge found concerning the time and labor involved, the rate of compensation, and the aspects he may have deemed of significance.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">In the case before us, the District Court\u2019s brief discussion of Howrey &amp; Simon\u2019s claims of ultra vires and unreasonableness leaves us in much the same difficulty. The court\u2019s opinion quoted a recent Third Circuit decision<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> for the proposition that courts should not \u201c \u2018become enmeshed in a meticulous analysis of every detailed facet of the professional representation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>District Court then proclaimed that \u201cin fact, because it is concerned only with administrative matters and not professional representation, the court\u2019s review will be even more limited.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Concluding at this point, the court merely stated that Reed Smith had sufficiently itemized its expenses, and ordered Howrey &amp; Simon to pay its allotted share.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\">This exposition explains neither the analysis nor the synthesis underlying the court\u2019s ruling. It thus does not afford an adequate foundation for appellate review on whether the activities for which reimbursement is claimed were within the scope of the appointment orders and, if so, the reasonableness of the amounts claimed. We therefore remand the record for more explicit findings of fact and conclusions on these two issues.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1091-14\">. We explain our use of \u201creimbursement\u201d in note 14 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1091-15\">. Section 1.90 of the <em>Manual for Complex Litigation </em>(West ed. 1977) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1091-25\">When there are several parties on one or both sides of the case represented by different counsel, the court is confronted with a problem in communicating with counsel and in securing responses from counsel on procedural questions. If these circumstances appear at the preliminary pretrial conference, the court should consider requesting counsel for the parties on each side to select one or more of their number as liaison counsel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">.

Howrey <em>&amp; </em>Simon points to several decisions on attorney\u2019s fee awards and argues that they limit judicial power to order reimbursement of liaison counsel. Brief for Appellants at 12-19. These cases are relevant only if the District Court has approved charges properly classifiable as compensation rather than expense items, something we cannot ascertain on the present record, see Part 11(C) <em>infra. </em>It is argued that reimbursement items are attorney\u2019s fees, and as such are impermissible, when they represent services performed by an attorney and are billed at the same hourly rate that any legal work done for a paying client would be. But Howrey &amp; Simon offers no authority to support this position, and it certainly seems logical that the nature of the work performed, and not the amount demanded for it, determines whether a given charge is properly to be denominated an attorney\u2019s fee. We need not explore the concept of attorney\u2019s fees now, see Part 11(C) <em>infra, </em>but we note that the cases Howrey <em>&amp; </em>Simon cites involved no more than adjudications over amounts due for professional representation or legal advice \u2014 in short, for peculiarly legal services. We leave it to the District Court on remand to explain whether its order encompasses payment for legal as well as administrative activities. If, as appears from the order under review, the tasks assigned Reed Smith under the liaison counsel order were wholly administrative in nature, see text <em>infra </em>at note 39, it follows that to the extent that Howrey &amp; Simon complains that Reed Smith has billed for legal rather than administrative services, the only proper objection is that the activity billed was outside of the scope of the District Court\u2019s appointment order. See notes 33-39 <em>infra </em>and accompanying text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1095-11\">. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Landis v. North American Co., </em>299 U.S. 248, 254-255, 57 S.Ct. 163, 166, 81 L.Ed. 153, 158 (1936), there is \u201cpower inherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants. How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.\u201d See <em>Dellinger </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 60, 64, 442 F.2d 782, 786 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">. Indeed, the commonly stated judicial rationale for the appointment of liaison counsel is the necessity for proper and efficient management of the court\u2019s docket. See, e. <em>g., Vincent v. Hughes Air West, Inc., </em>557 F.2d 759, 774-775 (9th Cir. 1977); <em>MacAlister v. Guterma, </em>263 F.2d 65, 67-69 (2d Cir. 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">.

In its brief, Howrey &amp; Simon states that it represents 35 and 39 corporate clients in the LB and CPR proceedings, respectively. Brief for Appellants at 7. According to a letter accompanying Reed Smith\u2019s initial reimbursement statement, Howrey &amp; Simon represented 40 of the 88 corporations in the LB and CPR litigation. Letter from Edward T. Tait to Stuart H. Harris, <em>supra </em>note 10. In any event, it is clear that Howrey &amp; Simon\u2019s group of complaining corporations was larger than that of any other law firm involved.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqne\">Reed Smith\u2019s practice of combined billing for the LB and CPR proceedings was another subject of the bickering. See, e. <em>g., </em>Brief for Appellants at 41-42. Since we will remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>additional findings and reasons, we have no cause to examine the contentions that this sort of billing was improper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">.

Nevertheless, a statement of the factual findings on which the court based its decision often is helpful to appellate review. See, e. <em>g., Tygrett v.

Though findings are not normally required, then, we may properly remand for further elucidation when review would be substantially hindered without them. See text <em>infra </em>at note 36.

It is important to evaluate the quoted passage in its full context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agtm\">We find it necessary also to observe that we did not [in <em>Lindy I] </em>and do not intend that a district court, in setting an attorneys\u2019 fee, become enmeshed in a meticulous analysis of every detailed facet of the professional representation. . . . <em>Once the district court determines the reasonable hourly rates to be applied, </em>for example, it need not conduct a minute evaluation of each phase or category of counsel\u2019s work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYN\"><em>Lindy II, supra </em>note 37, at 116 (emphasis added). It thus becomes evident that the Third Circuit was not advocating a total hands-off attitude in evaluating the reasonableness of fees charged by counsel. Moreover, taken as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>whole, the <em>Lindy </em>decision attests to the judicial feeling that a court conducting a review of fees should put considerable effort into determining the accuracy of the billing and even the quality of the attorney\u2019s work. See, e. <em>g., id. </em>at 117 (\u201cthe court should appraise the manner in which counsel discharged his or her professional responsibilities\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 118 (\u201c[i]f . . the court is persuaded that an increase or decrease ... is warranted, it should identify those factors supporting its conclusions, state the specific amount by which the basic fee should be altered . . . , and give a brief statement of the reasons therefor\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">. Memorandum and Order, <em>supra </em>note 4, at 4, J. App. 71. The problem with this approach is that the most serious question raised by Howrey &amp; Simon was whether the billing was for administrative activities and thus was within the purview of the order appointing liaison counsel, or rather was for legal services and thus was beyond its contemplation. Only after stating that judicial review would be limited was it \u201creadily apparent\u201d to the District Court that the charges were for activities authorized by the appointment order. That conclusion cannot acceptably be based on the premise stated, for the premise incorporates the conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1097-22\">. The District Court will, of course, retain full authority to convene a hearing as a possible aid to achieving the objectives of our remand. That we leave to its decision in the first instance.
