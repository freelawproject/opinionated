That Mergentime is withholding the sum sued for is not in dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case is determined by the interpretation of the relevant contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-22\">The controversy in this case involves the construction of the subcontract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>between Head and Mergentime. Under general contract law, the plain and unambiguous meaning of an instrument is controlling, <em>Vogel v. Tenneco Oil Co., </em>465 F.2d 563, 565 (D.C.Cir.1972), and the Court determines the intention of the parties from the language used by the parties to express their agreement. <em>E. P. Hinkel &amp; Co., Inc. v. Manhattan Co., </em>506 F.2d 201, 204 (D.C.Cir.1974). In performing this task, the Court should construe the contract as a whole so as to give meaning to all of the express terms. <em>California Pacific Bank v. Small Business Administration, </em>557 F.2d 218, 223 (9th Cir. 1977). Finally, the question of interpreting the plain language of a contract is a question of law for the Court, <em>dayman v. Goodman Properties, Inc., </em>518 F.2d 1026, 1034 (D.C.Cir.1973); <em>Framlau Corp. v. United States, </em>568 F.2d 687, 691 n.10 (Ct.Cl.1977), and appellate courts are not limited to the clearly erroneous standard of review unless extrinsic evidence was utilized. <em>Thornton v. Bean Contracting Co., </em>592 F.2d 1287, 1290 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">We find it unnecessary to go beyond the clear and plain wording of the contracts in this case. Upon a de novo review of their language and all their parts, we hold that the district court interpreted the Subcontract incorrectly, and that decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The following is a detailed description and analysis of the pertinent parts of the contracts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">\n<em>Mergentime\u2019s Construction Contract with the Transit Authority.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">In 1971 Mergentime entered into a contract with the Transit Authority, the \u201cowner\u201d of the project, for the construction of a portion of the subway rail system for the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia. The terms of the contract with the Transit Authority designated Mergentime as the \u201cgeneral contractor\u201d, and therein Mergentime obligated itself to the Transit Authority to complete the entire portion of the segment of the project covered by their contract. In return the Transit Authority agreed to pay Mergentime from time to time as the construction progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">\n<em>Mergentime\u2019s Management Contract with Head.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">On June 17, 1971, Mergentime executed a management contract with Head under which the entire remainder of the work, required of Mergentime under its contract with the Transit Authority, would be under the coordination and supervision of Head. However, since Head had only undertaken a management contract, Mergentime remained directly liable to the Transit Authority for all obligations under the prime contract. Consistent with the undertaking between the parties that the prime contract created, the Transit Authority made all progress payments to Mergentime as the work progressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">\n<em>Mergentime\u2019s Subcontract with Head for Completion of the Construction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">On August 28, 1973, after 2 years of ojperations under the management contract, Mergentime and Head entered into a second agreement termed a \u201cSubcontract\u201d [hereafter Second Contract]. Under the terms of this Second Contract the parties agreed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHd\">\u201ccancel and . . terminate the previous Management Agreement between them, and . . . [the] Subcontract [Second Contract] supersede^] the prior Management Agreement to the end that <em>the remaining work to be performed under such general contract shall be performed by the Subcontractor [Head] under the terms and conditions of this Subcontract.\u201d </em>(J.A. 12-13) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">In other words, under the Subcontract Head became in effect the prime contractor except that the Transit Authority still looked to Mergentime as the party responsible to it for the completion of the railway segment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second agreement termed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>Mergentime and Head, the \u201cContractor\u201d and \u201cSubcontractor\u201d respectively (J.A. 12). Among its terms and conditions, Head agreed in section 4(f) to \u201ckeep harmless and indemnify\u201d Mergentime and the Transit Authority against certain claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq3r\">Sec. 4(f) In accordance with Article 2.13 of the Special Conditions of Specification No. 1FB-C-15 of the Prime Contract, it is agreed that the <em>Subcontractor </em>[Head] shall <em>save and keep harmless and indemnify </em>the <em>Contractor </em>[Mergentime] <em>and the Owner </em>[Transit Authority] <em>against any and all liability claims, </em>and the costs of whatsoever kind and nature arising or alleged to arise for injury, including personal injury to or death of any person or persons, and for loss or damage to any property, occurring in connection with or in any way incident to or arising out of the occupancy, use, service, operations, or performance of work in connection with this contract, resulting in whole or in part from the negligent acts, errors or omissions of the Subcontractor [Head] or any employee, agent or representative of the Subcontractor [Head] <em>regardless of whether or not the Owner [Transit Authority] or the Contractor [Mergentime], their directors, officers, agents, or employees may be contributorily negligent in their actions causing such claims. </em>(J.A. 18) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">It is significant that in this part of the Second Contract Head undertakes to \u201cindemnify\u201d Mergentime and the Transit Authority \u201cagainst <em>any and all </em>liability claims . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, he agrees to indemnify Mergentime and the Transit Authority not only for the \u201cnegligent acts . of [Head and his] employees, but he also assumes all the liability of Mergentime and the Transit Authority even though \u201cthe Owner [Transit Authority] or the Contractor [Mergentime], their directors, officers, agents, or employees, may be <em>contributorily negligent </em>in their actions causing such claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added). So if Head just insured his own direct risks as Subcontractor on the project he would not be protected by insurance covering the risks of the \u201cOwner\u201d (Transit Authority) and \u201cContractor\u201d (Mergentime) that Head agreed to \u201cindemnify\u201d in Section 4(f) of the Subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">In the next section, 4(g), Head in essence agreed to provide insurance policies to protect the Transit Authority and Mergentime against liability from the risks it had generally agreed to indemnify, which are referred to<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and more particularly described in Article 2.13 of the Prime Contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">Sec. 4(g) The Subcontractor [Head] shall procure and maintain, at its own expense, <em>the policies of insurance required by said Article </em>2.13<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Special Conditions, which article is incorporated herein by reference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such policies of insurance shall include Contractor\u2019s [Mergentime\u2019s] comprehensive general liability insurance, including contractual obligations, workmen\u2019s compensation, automobile liability insurance, protective liability insurance, and railroad protective insurance, covering the <em>risks described and for the face amount of the policies as specified in Article 2.13 above. </em>(J.A. 18) (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Since Article 2.13 is part of the prime contract, and describes the insurance requirements of the parties to that contract,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is clear that Head undertook in the Second Contract to procure the same insurance policies that Mergentime had been required to furnish and in addition to cover the \u201cContractor\u2019s [Mergentime\u2019s] . . . liability, etc. . . . \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">, As set forth above, the Second Contract specifically requires that \u201csuch policies of insurance shall include <em>Contractor\u2019s </em>[Mergentime\u2019s] comprehensive liability insurance, including [those specified policies] covering the risks described and the face amount of the policies as specified in Article 2.13.\u201d (Emphasis added). In the Second Contract \u201cContractor\u201d by definition means <em>Mergentime </em>and the capitalization of \u201cContractor\u2019s\u201d indicates that a specific contractor [Mergentime] is being referred to and not \u201ccontractors\u201d generally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The terms of the Second Contract are also conclusive on the principal issue here, i. e., that Head agreed to \u201cprocure and maintain, at its own expense, <em>the policies of insurance required by said Article 2.13. </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added). This means the exact policies that 2.13 requires Mergentime to procure and maintain. Head as a \u201csubcontractor\u201d under Article 2.13 of the prime contract had also been required under Article 2.13(f) \u201cto carry the insurance coverages required herein . . \u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> i. e., the insurance required of subcontractors. Thus by the Second Contract Head agreed to carry all the policies that Mergentime was required to carry as well as covering Mergentime and Head (as subcontractor) for all the \u201crisks described and for the amounts specified in Article 2.13. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">The \u201crisks described ... as specified in Article 2.13 . . . \u201d are all <em>risks </em>that the contractor \u201cMergentime\u201d had undertaken to cover. (J.A. 18). The breadth of Head\u2019s potential liability which flows from the \u201ckeep harmless and indemnify\u201d provision that Head agreed to in the Second Contract, applicable as it is to the \u201cContractor\u201d [Mergentime] and the \u201cOwner\u201d [Transit Authority], would expose Head individually to millions of dollars of unprotected risks if he did not take out insurance covering Mergentime and the Transit Authority for their risks that he had undertaken to indemnify. In this respect the quoted provisions in Section 4(f) and (g) bear the same relationship to each other as do Section 2.13(a) and (b) of the Special Conditions in the prime contract. (J.A. 65-67, and see Appendix). In fact, the terms of Section 4(f) and (g) practically track the terms of Section 2.13(a) and (b) except that 4(f) and (g) add Mergentime as an additional insured that Head agreed to cover. When the parallel provisions of the prime contract and the Second Contract are compared it becomes crystal clear that the intent and purpose of Sections 4(f) and (g) of the Second Contract was merely to pass on to Head the exact same insurance obligations that Mergentime as the performing contractor had agreed to assume in the prime contract and to add Mergentime as an additional insured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That Head was becoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>the performing contractor in all practical respects is further reflected by the fact that Mergentime agreed in the Subcontract that Head was entitled to all the \u201cremaining money due under the Contract with the Owner [Transit Authority]\u201d, except payments for prior work. Section 10 (J.A. 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">There is further support for interpreting the Second Contract as requiring Head to take out insurance policies for other parties. When Head contracted with Mergentime to procure and maintain insurance policies of the kind and covering the risks specified in Article 2.13 of the Prime Contract, that obligation included Article 2.13(b)(4) which requires a policy described as follows: \u201cA Protective Liability Insurance Policy issued to and <em>covering the liability of the [Transit] Authority . . </em>. [etc., and the liability of the] District of Columbia\u201d where required by the General Agreement. This indicates that Head\u2019s insurance obligations, specified as they were in Section 4(g) and Article 2.13, extended beyond an obligation only to insure himself as a normal subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">We thus find that Head did not comply with Section 4(g) of the Second Contract when he covered only his <em>individual risk </em>with insurance policies of the type and amounts described in Article 2.13 of the prime contract. In that contract Head, in effect, became the prime contractor, in everything except being recognized by the Transit Authority as replacing Mergentime, for the completion of the remaining segment of the subway to which the contract applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">In sum, the contract between Head and Mergentime required Head to \u201cprocure and maintain at [Head\u2019s] expense [all] the policies of insurance required by Article 2.13 . covering the <em>risks described . in Article 2.13.\u201d </em>Reference to Article 2.13, and to the \u201crisks described\u201d, clearly indicates that the parties were referring to the <em>risks specified </em>in Sec. 2.13 of the Prime Contract, to which the \u201cOwner\u201d [Transit Authority], the \u201cContractor\u201d [Mergentime], and persons referred to as Subcontractors in the prime contract, were potentially liable. It is their risks, as well as the risks of Head as the performing contractor (subcontractor), that are described and are required to be covered by insurance policies procured at Head\u2019s expense. Therefore Head did not fully comply with Section 4(g) of his contract with Mergentime when he took out insurance policies of the required amounts and types that covered <em>only </em>the risks he incurred in his personal performance as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">Because of Head\u2019s refusal to furnish the insurance policies required by the Second Contract, Mergentime is entitled to keep the sums it has retained to compensate it for procuring the insurance Head failed to provide, and Head is obligated to pay Mergentime such additional sum as may be necessary to completely compensate Mergentime for the insurance it supplied due to Head\u2019s default. The judgment of the district court is therefore vacated and the case is remanded with instructions to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">TABLE OF CONTENTS</p>\n<p id=\"A5F_\">SECTION 2</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-14\">SPECIAL CONDITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">2.13 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">(a) The Contractor shall save and keep harmless and indemnify the Authority against any and all liability claims, and the costs of whatsoever kind and nature arising or alleged to arise for injury, including personal injury to or death of any person or persons, and for loss or damage to any property; occurring in connection with or in any way incident to or arising out of the occupancy, use, service, operations, or performance of work in connection with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>contract, resulting in whole or in part from the negligent acts, errors or omissions of the Contractor, any subcontractor, or any employee, agent or representative of the Contractor or subcontractor; regardless of whether or not the Authority, its directors, officers, agents, or employees may be contributorily negligent in their actions causing such claim(s).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">(b) The Contractor shall procure and maintain, at his own cost and expense, during the entire period of the performance under this contract, the following types of insurance:</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">(1) <em>Workmens\u2019 Compensation </em>\u2014A policy complying with the requirements of the Statutes of the District of Columbia, and if there is an exposure by any of the Contractor\u2019s Personnel \u2014 U, S.

Mergentime alleges that it was required to pay $104,306.76 for the necessary insurance, that it withheld $95,671.63, and that Head owes it $8,635.13. (J.A. 10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">. The Memorandum Order of the District Court denies that \u201cthe general thrust of the subcontract was to have Head take over all of [Mergentime\u2019s] responsibilities under the prime contract\u201d, but that was its plain intent. (J.A. 54)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">. Reference in a contract to extraneous writings renders them part of the agreement for the indicated purposes. <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Lynn, </em>514 F.2d 829, 833 (D.C.Cir.1975). Thus, we may look in depth into the wording of Article 2.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">. This does <em>not </em>say that Head shall procure <em>only </em>those policies of insurance required of subcontractors as specified by said Article 2.13(f). The statement in the Second Contract that Head \u201cshall procure and maintain, <em>at its own expense, </em>the policies required by Article 2.13 . . .\u201d (emphasis- added) is a clear indication that the policies are <em>not </em>to be limited to covering Head\u2019s own risks. If the insurance policies were to insure only Head\u2019s own risks he would normally bear such expense and it would be highly unusual in such case for a contract to provide that the cost of the policies would be at his [Head\u2019s] own expense. This provision is thus another indication that the contract intended Head to carry insurance for some other party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">.
