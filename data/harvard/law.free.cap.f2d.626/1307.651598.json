He sued his employer and its insurer in tort. He appeals from the dismissal of his suit pursuant to the grant of summary judgment to the defendants. The defendants\u2019 motion was grounded on the alleged exclusivity of a state workmen\u2019s compensation remedy. We reverse the district court\u2019s summary judgment because of genuine dispute as to material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-27\">\n<em>Undisputed Factual Showing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-28\">Cubbage was hired as a farmhand by his employer, Averett, to milk cows. He was allowed by Averett to reside in a vacant house on Averett\u2019s farm. Cubbage was to milk the cows twice daily, starting about 3:00 a. m. and 2:00 p. m., with the milkings lasting about three hours each.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-29\">Cubbage worked only one full day, February 28, 1979. Having completed the evening milking, Cubbage went back to the house, prepared some food on a hot plate, ate, and sat on his bed. He then lit a cigarette with a cigarette lighter. A violent gas explosion then occurred. As a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>suit, Cubbage sustained serious personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants-appellees because it found that Cubbage\u2019s use of the house was \u201cincidental to employment.\u201d As a result, the court stated that state workmen\u2019s compensation was Cubbage\u2019s exclusive remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">\n<em>The Threshold Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">The threshold issue of this case is whether or not there is any genuine issue of material fact which precludes summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">\n<em>A Disputed Issue of Material Fact Precludes Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-8\">Summary judgment may be granted only if it appears from the pleadings, depositions, admissions, and affidavits, considered in the light most favorable to the opposing party, that there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). <em>See Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 468, 82 S.Ct. 486, 488, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962); <em>Keating v. Jones Development of Missouri, Inc., </em>398 F.2d 1011, 1013 (5th Cir. 1968); <em>Harvey v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., Inc., </em>388 F.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-9\">The motion for summary judgment was decided on the basis of depositions from the plaintiff Cubbage and the employer (Averett), and of affidavits of the plaintiff and his brother. In holding that workmen\u2019s compensation was the exclusive remedy (and therefor granting summary judgment dismissing Cubbage\u2019s suit), the district court resolved conflicting statements and inferences and held that the house provided by Cubbage to Averett was \u201cincidental to employment.\u201d Under Louisiana compensation law, an employee who lives on his employer\u2019s premises may be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation, under certain circumstances, for injuries resulting from a premise accident arising out of the employment or, sometimes, if required by his work to be on the premises at the time. Malone, Louisiana Workmen\u2019s Compensation, Section 170, see also 229 (1952). See, e. g. <em>LeCompte v. Kay, </em>156 So.2d 75 (La.App. 1st Cir. 1963); <em>Ivory v. Philpot Construction Co., </em>145 So. 784 (La.App. 2d Cir. 1933.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-11\">The contradictory affidavits and depositions, which permit conflicting inferences, do not establish as a matter of law that, for such reason, the injured employee was entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation from, and thereby barred from a tort remedy against, his employer. Both parties admitted that the living arrangement was \u201cpart of the deal,\u201d i. e., the oral contract between Cubbage and Averett establishing their employer-employee relationship. However, the parties dispute the particulars of that \u201cdeal\u201d, and the particulars must be ascertained in order to determine whether or not the house provided was \u201cincidental to employment.\u201d The district court itself noted that a \u201creal question ... is whether or not the house was furnished as simply a convenience to that employee because he was looking for a place to live, or whether it was in truth and in fact part of his compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-12\">In ascertaining the make-up of that \u201cdeal,\u201d it is essential that we determine the motive and intent of the parties. For example, what exactly were Cubbage\u2019s duties on the farm? Was he <em>required </em>to live in the house? Was he subject to 24-hour call? Why was the house provided for Cubbage\u2014 for convenience or for compensation? When an issue such as we have here requires a determination of the parties\u2019 dispute as to the contents of an oral agreement, and those contents are material to the decision of the issue before the court, summary judgment should not be granted. <em>N.L.R.B. v. Smith Industries, Inc., </em>403 F.2d 889, 893 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-13\">In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the district court should abstain from resolving disputed fact issues. As this court has already stated in <em>Arrington v. City of Fairfield, Ala., </em>414 F.2d 687, 692 (5th Cir. 1969), \u201cThe court\u2019s duty is not to decide factual issues on summary judgment, but only to determine whether there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>factual issues to be tried.\u201d <em>See Gross v. Southern Ry. Co., </em>414 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">Because we find that there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute, i. e., the intent of the parties to the oral agreement and the particulars of the agreement, we REVERSE the summary judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
