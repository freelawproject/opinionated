The appellants, respondents in the enforcement action, seek further protections against public disclosure of trade secrets that they assert appear in the documents under subpoena. The Commission disagrees and, in addition, argues that the district court exceeded its authority by attaching conditions to the subpoenas beyond those appearing in the Commission\u2019s original orders. We conclude that the issues presented by the appellant are either meritless or not yet ripe for review and that the protective conditions added by the district court are unwarranted. We therefore affirm the order insofar as it enforces the subpoenas as issued, and we vacate those portions of the order that impose further restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-25\">The facts in this case are straightforward. As part of a nonpublic antitrust investigation of the insulation industry, the Commission staff in July of 1977 issued virtually identical subpoenas duces tecum to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, Johns-Manville Corporation, and Certain-Teed Corporation, the appellants herein. The subpoenas asked for various documents containing technical, business, and financial information about the thr\u00e9e companies. After meetings with members of the Commission staff produced mutually satisfactory modifications, the appellants submitted nonconfidential documents to the Commission. They refused, however, to turn over certain other documents that they claimed contain trade secrets.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">The Commission agreed to afford the withheld documents confidential treatment under its customary procedures for handling such information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, it committed itself to giving the company that submitted a document ten days\u2019 notice before disclosing its contents to anyone outside the Commission. The Commission nevertheless excepted from this procedure official requests from courts or arms of Congress. In these instances, it promised \u201cten days\u2019 prior notice where possible, and in any event as much notice as can reasonably be given.\u201d Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 233, 237, 311, 315 (letters from the Commission staff to appellants\u2019 counsel). Subsequently, the appellants tendered additional documents, but they still refused to surrender the rest without further assurances of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">On October 23,1978, the Commission filed a petition in the district court for an order to enforce the subpoenas under section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49 (1976). The appellants, respondents in the district court, filed substantially identical counterclaims asking for a declaration that the documents contain trade secrets within the meaning of the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 (1976),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and section 6(f) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(f) (1976),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that the documents are exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976). They also sought a protective order that would provide additional guarantees of confidentiality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>On January 31,1979, the court entered an order dismissing the counterclaims and enforcing the subpoenas subject to the Commission\u2019s promised procedures regarding confidentiality, with two additions. First, the order requires the Commission in the case of a congressional or a judicial request \u201cimmediately, forthwith upon receipt by it of such a request, [to] advise the respondent which had furnished the document, by telephone and by a written communication, that the request has been made and indicate the nature and extent of the request.\u201d <em>FTC v. Owens-Coming Fiberglas Corp., </em>Misc. No. 78-313, at 2 (D.D.C. Jan. 31,1979) (order enforcing subpoenas), <em>reprinted in </em>J.A. at 11, 12. Second, in the case of congressional requests the order obliges the Commission to \u201cverif[y] that the request is made in accordance with the controlling congressional rule, and [to advise] the requestor that the respondent has claimed that the document contains confidential trade secrets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This order is now before us on cross-appeals, the appellants contending that the district court did not go far enough and the Commission that it went too far.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">II. COMMISSION DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"Adv\">Before embarking on an analysis of the particular arguments raised by the parties, we believe it useful to recapitulate in general terms the law governing Commission disclosure of information contained in confidential documents it has obtained under subpoena. Specifically, appellants are troubled by requests from two sources, Congress and the general public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore shall review the Commission\u2019s formal release of secret information to these groups, either voluntarily or pursuant to some request that by law it must grant.</p>\n<p id=\"AEeH\">A. <em>Congressional Requests</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Recently this court has had several occasions to discuss congressional requests for confidential documents in the hands of the Commission. In particular, we have held explicitly that the Commission may not deny Congress access to confidential documents, including those that contain trade secrets. <em>E. g., Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 F.2d 582, 585-86 (D.C. Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 943, 99 S.Ct. 2160, 60 L.Ed.2d 1044 <em>(1979); Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d 977, 979 (D.C. Cir. 1976). Release to a congressional requestor is not a public disclosure forbidden by section 6(f) of the FTC Act. <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 F.2d at 589; <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d at 979. Moreover, courts may not require the Commission to delay surrendering documents to Congress to notify affected parties in advance, for the judiciary must refrain from slowing or otherwise interfering with the legitimate investigatory functions of Congress. <em>FTC v. Anderson, </em>No. 78-1032 (D.C.Cir. Sept. 17, 1979); <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 F.2d at 588-89. Once documents are in congressional hands, \u201ccourts must presume that the committees of Congress will exercise their powers responsibly and with due regard for the rights of affected parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589 (citing <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d at 979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A court may not block disclosure of information in Congress\u2019s possession, at least when the disclosure would serve a valid legislative purpose. <em>Doe v. McMillan, </em>412 U.S. 306, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973) (construing the speech and debate clause, U.S.Const. art. I, \u00a7 6, cl. I).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">B. <em>Public Requests Under the FOIA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Members of the public also may obtain information from agency \u201crecords\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>under the Freedom of Information Act. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3) (1976).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An agency must release the material sought unless it falls within an exemption found in the statute. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)-(c). The fourth such exemption permits an agency to withhold \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 552(b)(4). The exceptions listed in the FOIA do not prohibit an agency from releasing material sought; they only allow the agency to deny access. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 293, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1713, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979). Nevertheless, the Trade Secrets Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> expressly forbids an agency to release trade secrets or other confidential information in its possession, except as authorized by law. <em>See id. </em>at 290-94, 99 S.Ct. at 1712-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Upon receiving a request for a document in its possession, the agency itself decides in the first instance whether it includes trade secrets or other confidential information. If the agency concludes that the document is not confidential, it must release the information. The party that submitted the document, however, may challenge in court the agency\u2019s evaluation and decision to release as \u201cagency action not in accordance with law\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976), because release of protected information would violate the Trade Secrets Act. <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. at 318, 99 S.Ct. at 1726.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On the other hand, if the agency believes it should withhold the document as confidential, the public requestor may file an action in a federal district court to compel its disclosure under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4) (1976). Thus, no matter what conclusion the agency reaches concerning the confidential status of the information, the losing party may seek judicial review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">III. PRESENT DETERMINATION OF THE DOCUMENTS\u2019 STATUS AS TRADE SECRETS</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">The appellants argue first that we should require the Commission to determine now, in advance of any request for information, whether the documents contain any trade secrets. The appellants believe that such a determination would carry more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>weight with members of Congress and their staffs and thus would deter release once in congressional hands. Even assuming this hypothesis is true, it does not follow that the Commission must give its advice to Congress. Courts do not render advisory opinions, and we see no reason to require an agency to do so. The Commission has promised to notify the affected appellant of any congressional request, in advance of the documents\u2019 transfer when possible, and to inform the recipient that the appellant regards the information as confidential and needing protection. Thus, the appellants will be able to seek confidential treatment from the requestor itself usually before it receives the information but in any event soon thereafter. In the meantime, we must assume that arms of Congress will act discreetly, with due regard for the documents\u2019 sensitive nature. <em>See </em>p. 970 <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">IV. RIPENESS</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">The appellants also present several arguments concerning the documents' status as trade secrets or Commission \u201crecords\u201d and the Commission\u2019s treatment of them at the end of its investigation. Specifically, the appellants ask us to order the Commission to return the documents upon completion of its investigation or any subsequent litigation, to hold that the Commission\u2019s definitions of \u201ctrade secrets\u201d is too narrow, and to declare that the documents are not Commission \u201crecords\u201d under the FOIA. The Commission counters that these claims are not yet ripe for review. In evaluating arguments of ripeness, we must ask whether the issues have been presented in a form appropriate for judicial resolution and what hardships the parties would face by a delay in consideration of their claims. <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 149, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967); <em>Gardner v. Toilet Goods Association, </em>387 U.S. 158, 162, 87 S.Ct. 1520, 1523, 18 L.Ed.2d 697 (1967). Applying this analysis to the questions raised by the appellants, we conclude that they are not yet ripe for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">We may dismiss quickly the appellants\u2019 contention that, at the present time, we should order the Commission to return the documents at the end of its investigation. An order compelling return would become appropriate only if the Commission were to withhold the documents unlawfully at some point in the future. The Commission has listed several situations in which it might have legitimate reasons to retain the documents beyond the completion of its in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>vestigation of the appellants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At the mo ment, we do not know when the investigation will end, whether the Commission will attempt to retain the documents, or what justification it might have if it does, if any is required at all. Our refusal to act now in no way prevents the appellants from seeking judicial relief should the Commission act unlawfully in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">We turn now to the questions concerning the documents\u2019 status as trade secrets and Commission \u201crecords.\u201d So far, no one has requested information from the documents. Should it receive a request from a member of the public under the FOIA,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Commission will be fully capable then to make its determination, in the context of a particular document. Until that time, any evaluation of the Commission\u2019s views on trade secrets will focus on abstract principles instead of the contents of a specific document. Given the rapid pace of technological change \u2014 today\u2019s trade secret easily can become tomorrow\u2019s common knowledge \u2014 a ruling unrelated to particular pieces of information is of little value. Deferring consideration of the documents\u2019 status as trade secrets and Commission \u201crecords\u201d helps ensure the full factual development of the case. <em>See FTC </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>at -. Moreover, any decision that this court or the Commission might make would not necessarily bind a requestor appearing later, for he would not have been a party to this case. Thus, we believe the issues have yet to crystallize into a form that permits judicial resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Furthermore, little hardship will befall the appellants by delaying consideration of these questions until a request actually occurs. In the first place, the Commission has indicated that in practice it refuses FOIA requests for documents accorded confidential treatment even if they do not contain trade secrets. <em>See </em>note 12 <em>supra. </em>Should the Commission change its policy and decide to release information contained in the documents, the appellant affected will receive ten days\u2019 notice and be able to enter court then to challenge the release as an abuse of discretion or as Commission action not in accordance with law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If, on the other hand, the Commission denies the request, the party seeking the information can file its own action to force disclosure. In either event, the status of the documents, both as trade secrets or confidential information and as Commission \u201crecords,\u201d will be subject to full judicial evaluation at that time. <em>See FTC v. Anderson, </em>at-.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-11\">V. THE PROTECTIVE ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">Both the appellants and the Commission challenge the district court\u2019s final protective order. The appellants contend that the district court abused its discretion in not adding further protections to ensure nondisclosure of information in the documents. The Commission argues that the promises of protection in its original subpoena order and letters according confidential treatment were within its discretion and thus the district court exceeded its authority in imposing additional safeguards. Because we believe the Commission did not abuse its discretion, we must vacate the portions of the district court\u2019s order imposing further conditions on the Commission and refuse to add the protections sought by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">Section 9 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 49 (1976), gives the district courts jurisdiction to enforce subpoenas issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Commission. Although leaving this power in the courts rather than the Commission indicates that judges should not simply rubber-stamp Commission subpoenas, see <em>generally SEC v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>584 F.2d 1018, 1032-33 (D.C. Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1071, 99 S.Ct. 841, 59 L.Ed.2d 37 (1979), their role is limited to determining \u201cif the inquiry is within the authority of the agency, the demand is not too indefinite and the information sought is reasonably relevant,\u201d <em>United States v. Morton Salt Co., </em>338 U.S. 632, 652, 70 S.Ct. 357, 369, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1950), <em>quoted in FTC v. Anderson, </em>at 369 slip op. at 5. With regard to protective conditions, the court asks whether the agency has abused its discretion in providing safeguards. <em>See FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. 279, 291, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 1468, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 (1965); <em>FTC v. Texaco, Inc., </em>555 F.2d 862, 884 n.62 (D.C. Cir.) (en banc) (\u201cit is the agencies, not the courts, which should, in the first instance, establish the procedures for safeguarding confidentiality\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 974, 97 S.Ct. 2939, 53 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The district court\u2019s additions in this case apparently are designed to ensure the fastest possible notice to the affected appellant if a court or an arm of Congress seeks a subpoenaed document. These procedures very well may be reasonable ones. The question before us, however, is \u201cwhether the exercise of discretion <em>by the Commission </em>was within permissible limits, not whether the District Judge\u2019s substituted judgment was reasonable.\u201d <em>FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. at 291, 85 S.Ct. at 1468 (emphasis in original). Here, the Commission has promised to give as much notice as it reasonably can once it determines that it must honor a congressional or a judicial request. It has pointed out that historically it has been able to provide the full ten days\u2019 notice in almost every case. J.A. at 783 (affidavit of Barry R. Rubin). The Commission also has agreed to inform the requestor that the appellant believes the information sought is confidential. These guarantees appear sufficient to safeguard the appellants\u2019 interests. The incremental protection afforded by the district court\u2019s additions is speculative and minimal, and the changes would only burden the Commission by forcing it to halt other activities to contact the appellant affected immediately upon receipt of a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">The court\u2019s order also requires the Commission to verify that a request purportedly coming from Congress has been made in accordance with applicable rules. The Commission, in conferring confidential treatment on the documents, has excepted from its commitment to ten days\u2019 notice only \u201cofficial\u201d congressional requests. Implicitly , then, it makes some effort to screen out unofficial ones.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Again, the district court\u2019s additions contribute little, if any, protection beyond what the Commission has volunteered to provide. Indeed, in this instance, they may embroil the Commission in needless disputes with members and committees of Congress over the propriety of their requests. <em>See generally Murphy v. Department of the Army, </em>613 F.2d at 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">The Commission has promised to give as much notice as it reasonably can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>once it has determined that it must honor a congressional or a judicial request. It has agreed to inform the requestor that the appellant that submitted the information sought regards it as confidential. Agencies are free to determine their own procedures, as long as they do not violate constitutional or statutory safeguards. <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>435 U.S. 519, 543-44, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1121-22, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978); <em>FCC v. Schreiber, </em>381 U.S. at 290, 85 S.Ct. at 1467. <em>See Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 <em>F.2d </em>at 587. Moreover, until evidence appears to the contrary, agencies are entitled to a presumption of administrative regularity and good faith. <em>See, e. g., Association of National Advertisers v. FTC, </em>627 F.2d 1151 at 1174 (D.C.Cir. 1979); <em>Hercules, Inc. v. EPA, </em>598 F.2d 91, 123 (D.C. Cir. 1978). With no indication that the Commission will act cavalierly or in bad faith, its promises of advance notice and release only pursuant to official requests adequately protect the appellants\u2019 interests and thus fall within its discretion. The district court thus erred in imposing further terms on the subpoenas as issued.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">The Commission has ample tools at its disposal to ensure confidential treatment for the documents under subpoena while those documents are in its control. Likewise, we must assume until shown otherwise that any congressional committee or subcommittee obtaining them will act with due regard for the appellants\u2019 rights. With no actual request for the information before us and with no present demonstration that the Commission will mishandle the documents once it possesses them, we must affirm the district court\u2019s order insofar as it enforces the Commission\u2019s subpoenas subject to the conditions the Commission imposed on itself, and we must vacate the portions of the order that impose additional restrictions on the Commission\u2019s future conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">. Specifically, the appellants contend that the documents contain detailed information concerning costs, sales, profits, customers, markets, business plans and strategies, plants and equipment, research and development, and new and secret processes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">. The Commission\u2019s general procedures regarding confidentiality and access appear in the FTC Operating Manual, ch. 15, <em>reprinted in </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 715-42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">.

In particular, the appellants asked the district court to enter an order compelling the Commission (1) not to disclose the documents to persons outside the Commission except pursuant to a formally authorized request from Congress or compulsory process from a court, (2) to notify the appellants immediately in case of such a request, (3) to inform any congressional requestor that the documents contain trade secrets the Commission is prohibited from disclosing publicly, (4) to seek from any judicial requestor in camera treatment of any documents surrendered, and (5) to return the documents, together with all copies, notes, abstracts, or other working materials, to the appellants within 30 days of the conclusion of the investigation or any resulting litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">.

The Court reasoned that the speech and debate clause protects only acts taken in furtherance of legislative functions.

Because the Trade Secrets Act forbids disclosure only to the \u201cextent not authorized by law,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1905 (1976), one can argue that releasing any information other than trade secrets or the names of customers is permissible; \u00a7 6(f) expressly authorizes release of all information outside these two categories. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra. We </em>intimate no view on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">. The appellants also argue that in the absence of a determination now by the Commission they are deprived of property without due process of law. This argument is devoid of any merit. First, if the request comes from Congress, surrendering the information is not a public disclosure and thus not a taking of property. <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 F.2d at 589. Second, if a member of the public requests information from the documents under the FOIA, the Commission has indicated, both in its brief, <em>see </em>Brief of Commission at 22, and at oral argument, that its standard practice is to deny the request as falling under the exemption for confidential information. Any deviation from that practice may be challenged at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">The appellants try to salvage this argument by asserting that the increased possibility of disclosure caused simply by the documents\u2019 leaving their exclusive control reduces the value of the information as trade secrets and thus amounts to a present taking. We do not agree. The appellants have demonstrated no interference with their ability to use their trade secrets; they have presented only self-serving speculation that the subpoenas reduce their present market value. This scenario, featuring as it does only a hypothetical disclosure, falls far short of what the Constitution requires to demonstrate a taking. <em>See generally Penn. Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">Appellants also assert that a present determination is necessary to permit judicial review before they are deprived of their property. In the first place, if surrendering the documents to the Commission does not amount to a taking, there is no due process right to judicial review. As we already have noted, the appellants will have adequate opportunity to attack any disclosure made under the FOIA, and courts can do little to prevent the transfer of documents to congressional hands or to protect them once there. Moreover, asking us to command a Commission determination simply to permit us to review it not only is circular but also in effect would have us lay the foundation for rendering an advisory opinion ourselves should the Commission\u2019s ruling be appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">. For example, the Commission may require the information in another investigative proceeding, in rulemaking, or in compiling information for reports it must make under \u00a7 6(d) and (f) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(d), (f) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">. The documents\u2019 status as trade secrets or Commission \u201crecords\u201d becomes material only if a request comes from a member of the public under the FOIA, for the Commission must surrender the documents if sought by a congressional source. See p. 970 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1041-15\">. We intimate no view on whether the Commission, by indicating that in practice it denies FOIA requests for information it has accorded confidential treatment, is bound by that representation or would be abusing its discretion simply by abandoning that practice in the future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">. The Commission has stated that in practice it treats requests from individual members of Congress, as opposed to from committees or subcommittees, as public requests under the FOIA. <em>See </em>Reply Brief of Commission at 6; J.A. at 782-83 (affidavit of Barry R. Rubin). Since this case was argued, a different panel of this court has concluded in another context that there is \u201cno basis in the statute or in public policy for distinguishing for FOIA purposes between a congressional committee and a single Member acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Department of the Army, </em>613 F.2d 1151 at 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1979). If <em>Murphy </em>applies here, the Commission could not lawfully withhold information sought by a member of Congress regardless of whether he complied with applicable committee or subcommittee rules, at least when he requests the information pursuant to his legislative duties and not \u201cin a purely private or personal capacity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 613 F.2d at 1157. The verification required by the district court thus may be irrelevant in most instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-10\">Of course, a request purportedly coming from some arm or member of Congress simply may be a hoax. A single telephone call could discover this fact, and the Commission would not have to surrender the document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">. Our determination that the Commission acted within the bounds of its discretion requires us also to reject any additional protections sought by the appellants. We do not believe that this result in any way conflicts with our decision in <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>for in that case we enforced subpoenas issued with protections similar to those the Commission has granted here and without any court-imposed conditions. <em>See </em>589 F.2d at 594 (affirming district court\u2019s enforcement order \u201cin its entirety\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1043-9\">WALD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Afy\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">I concur in Parts I to IV of Judge Tamm\u2019s opinion for the court. As for Part V, I would affirm the district court\u2019s protective conditions imposed upon the enforcement of the FTC subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">The district court\u2019s conditions were, as to Congressional requests for access to asserted trade secret data, (1) that the FTC \u201cverif[y] that the request is made in accordance with the requirements of the controlling congressional rule,\u201d and (2) that the FTC immediately notify, by telephone and in writing, the owner of the asserted trade secrets when such requests are made. J.A. 12. I believe that the first condition simply implemented the mandate this court laid down for the FTC in <em>Exxon Corp. v. FTC, </em>589 F.2d 582, 592-94 (D.C.Cir.1978), and that there is substantial material in the record of the hearing before the district court to justify the second. <em>See </em>J.A. 39-49. At that same hearing, FTC counsel appeared for the most part to agree as to the appropriateness of the conditions <em>(see id. </em>at 39-41 &amp; 46-47), even though he attempted to dissuade the district court from imposing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">I. THE VERIFICATION CONDITION</p>\n<p id=\"AjK\">In <em>Exxon </em>this court held, following <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. FTC, </em>548 F.2d 977 (D.C.Cir.1976), that Congress is entitled to access to material subpoenaed by the FTC, including \u201ctrade secrets\u201d protected from public disclosure under \u00a7 6(f) of the FTC Act. The court was careful to point out, however, that such trade secrets should \u201cbe disclosed only upon valid <em>formal </em>requests of Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>or its committees.\u201d 589 F.2d at 588 (emphasis in original). The court refused to impose any mandatory notice period before disclosure in response to such requests, because it \u201cwould skirt dangerously close to being at least the temporary \u2018equivalent to an order quashing [the official request or subpoena] which is generally an impermissible frustration of the congressional power to investigate . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(bracketed material in original). But the court nevertheless emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-5\">[W]e feel that there is ample justification for insisting that the Commission only reveal statutorily protected <em>trade secrets </em>when it has indeed received such a proper request or subpoena.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 592 (emphasis in original). The court noted that the separation of powers doctrine, which prevents the courts from interfering with Congressional demands for data, comes into play only for formal Congressional requests for access.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-7\">. Election to the Congress does not give an individual subpoena power over whatever information he may happen to be interested in, and particularly not over trade secrets, whose oftentimes enormous value may be forfeited by disclosure to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-8\">. [A]s Congress itself has manifested a concern to prevent the issuance of subpoenas by individual members as opposed to committees, subcommittees or duly authorized committee chairmen, it is appropriate to require the FTC to take steps to ascertain the validity of a subpoena (or the formal requests it treats as subpoenas) before it releases data it is required by statute to be kept [sic] confidential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1044-9\">. Accordingly, although we do not require the FTC to observe the procedures proposed by the appellants to limit the manner in which the Commission responds to <em>formal requests </em>for trade secrets from Congress or its committees[,] it is nothing more than common sense for the FTC to not disclose trade secrets except upon legally authorized requests therefore and to verify that fact before delivery. Trade secrets, by statute, are in a different position than ordinary non-confidential information within the possession of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1044-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 593 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-13\">The <em>Exxon </em>court also noted that the FTC had, in January 1978, initiated a rulemaking proceeding to consider protection of the confidentiality of such data and declared: \u201cIt would seem that the rule should provide that in all instances the party will be notified immediately whenever Congress makes a proper request for trade secrets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590 n.16. Two years later, however, we do not yet have any rule on confidentiality; nor could the FTC counsel at oral argument enlighten the court as to when such a rule might eventuate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">In the specific enforcement proceeding involved here, the district court made several inquiries as to FTC practices with regard to responses to Congressional requests. The FTC, in answer to requests for prior notice by owners of subpoenaed trade secret material before release to Congressional committees or to a court, will promise only that it will give \u201cas much notice as possible under the circumstances.\u201d J.A. 42; <em>see, e. g., id. </em>at 168. It will advise the requestor that the owner believes the material to be confidential, but nothing is promised about checking on the \u201cofficial\u201d nature of the request. <em>See FTC Operating Manual, </em>Ch. 15.1.3 (1978) (J.A. 718); 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.11 (1979) (\u201c[Requests for disclosure of records\u201d from the FTC).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-15\">An affidavit in this case from an FTC employee, Barry R. Rubin, who handles such requests, alleges that \u201c[o]nly requests from Congressional Committees and Subcommittees are treated as official requests of Com gress\u201d (J.A. 78?); in no instance has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>FTC been \u201caware\u201d that any such request to which it has responded was not properly authorized. <em>Id. </em>at 783. That affidavit further states that in \u201cnearly every instance\u201d the FTC \u201chas been able\u201d to provide ten days\u2019 notice when it has agreed to attempt to do so. <em>Id. </em>Although this may be the FTC\u2019s predominant practice, only the requirement for as much notice as \u201cpossible\u201d is incorporated in its written assurances, and the language in the Rubin affidavit quoted above at least suggests that the FTC may not be \u201cable\u201d to give the full ten days\u2019 notice, or indeed any advance notice, in all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">In only one instance, the affidavit asserts, was notice provided as late as the day of release (id.), but the Rubin affidavit also warns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-6\">In <em>all </em>instances where a congressional committee or subcommittee has indicated that access is requested to Commission information prior to the end of the notice period, <em>the Commission has accepted that representation, has had no reason not to accept that representation and has granted access.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 783-84 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">FTC counsel in this case opined in the hearing before the district court that the <em>Exxon </em>mandate to the <em>FTC </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>to verify that a Congressional request was \u201cformal\u201d \u2014was vague, but he also admitted that the FTC\u2019s own practice of honoring only an \u201cofficial request\u201d from Congress (as set forth in the Rubin affidavit, J.A. 782) was just as indefinite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-9\">The problem here is that Congress works in different ways; that is, some committees authorize their chairman to make official requests for information. So sometimes the chairman, acting alone, can do it. Some work by subpoenas; some work by other documental requests, compulsory process and aids. The putting in words, precise words exactly, what the Commission is obliged to respond to, exactly what duties it has to verify the requests, the validity of the requests, this is very difficult. I think that a general obligation on the part of the Commission to be confident, to be certain that the request is, at least, on its face an official request is appropriate; but to say that the Commission can go over to an ordinate [sic] branch of Government and start asking questions about \u201cWho are you?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your authority in . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-14\">J.A. 46-47 (elipse in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">The distinct impression I (and apparently the district court) glean from those remarks is that no attempt to \u201cverify\u201d whether a request is in conformity with applicable rules for relevant Congressional committees or subcommittees, or even with the general rules of the House or the Senate, is currently being made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s reaction to this disclosure was expressly to require such a verification in accordance with the <em>Exxon </em>mandate, without in any way telling the FTC how it should do its job. The rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate dealing with subpoenas are a matter of public record and easily ascertainable. Even as to nonsubpoena requests which, as the Rubin affidavit implicitly concedes, are sometimes made by tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>phone,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> some verification of the official nature of the request seems not only commonsensical but essential if the strictures of <em>Exxon </em>are to have any effect at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The majority opinion\u2019s footnote 16, suggesting that a single Congressman\u2019s request for confidential information protected by \u00a7 6(f), even though the request is unauthorized by any committee or subcommittee of Congress, may stand on the same footing as a duly authorized committee or subcommittee request, is especially troubling. In the exercise of its administrative discretion, even the FTC has not gone that far; it purportedly treats request for access to trade secrets from individual Congressmen as \u201cunofficial,\u201d and thus akin to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1976), requests from the public. J.A. 782. Frankly, I find the majority\u2019s suggestion surprising in view of their opinion\u2019s overriding emphasis on agency discretion in these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s citation of <em>Murphy v. Department of the Army, </em>613 F.2d 1151 (D.C.Cir.1979) (Greene, J.), to support their position. <em>Murphy </em>dealt with the Army\u2019s disclosure to a Congressman of material otherwise exempt from mandatory disclosure to the public under the FOIA. The court invoked 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as authority that Congress did not mean the FOIA exemptions to impede its own access to such material and found that granting such access to an individual Congressman did not amount to a waiver of the material\u2019s exempt nature. But here we deal with material specifically protected by statute from any disclosure to the public,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> not a situation like <em>Murphy </em>where disclosure is left to the discretion of the government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">Duly authorized Congressional requests were judicially recognized as a narrow exception to the \u00a7 6(f) statutory ban in <em>Exxon, </em>589 F.2d at 592-94; therefore, it is doubly important to insure that these requests are authorized ones. The majority too casually dismisses <em>Exxon </em>in this regard. No Member of Congress, acting on his own, has yet been judicially declared to have access rights to subpoenaed trade secret material for his own individually-defined legislative purposes, no matter how legitimate his interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">To suggest that <em>Murphy </em>may expand <em>Exxon\u2019s </em>limited access to cover any Member acting individually is to seriously dilute the protections of \u00a7 6(f), and even to undermine the duly constituted authority and processes of Congress. The Legislative branch oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>ates in the sensitive area of trade secret disclosure with its coordinate branch, the Executive, through the structure and delegated powers of Congressional committees and subcommittees. Only if the Executive and the courts honor that structure will the Legislature itself, as well as agencies, be able to assure subpoenaed parties that their trade secret material is not subject to indiscriminate disclosure to any or all of the 535 Members of Congress with diverse political and legislative interests. That is what I think this court\u2019s 1978 <em>Exxon </em>opinion was all about. And, in fact, just recently in <em>United States v. Exxon Corp., </em>628 F.2d 70, (D.C.Cir. 1980) <em>(per </em>curiam), this court affirmed a district court opinion enforcing a Department of Energy (DOE) subpoena in which the district court imposed protective conditions upon all requests for access, including those of individual Members of Congress, except those made \u201cpursuant to a request formally authorized by a committee or subcommittee of Congress with jurisdiction over the subject matter of the documents or information requested . . .. \u201d 628 F.2d 77.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8Ng\">II. THE NOTIFICATION CONDITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">During his questioning of FTC counsel, the district court was told that the FTC already had a policy of immediately notifying owners of data in the FTC\u2019s possession upon receipt of a Congressional request for access. J.A. 40. FTC counsel stated that this was set out in the Rubin affidavit <em>(id.), </em>but in fact that affidavit does not speak of any such notification policy and petitioner\u2019s counsel disputed that any such policy was in effect. <em>Id. </em>at 49. FTC counsel, in answer to the district court\u2019s question whether the FTC would be willing to notify the companies upon receipt of a Congressional request in this case, said \u201cI think so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41. He later pulled back to suggest that the FTC might have difficulty in giving that notification \u201cimmediately,\u201d because requests come into personnel all over the Commission (even secretaries), but FTC counsel without equivocation stated that \u201cat the point in [sic] which the request is funnelled to the person who knows about this case, who knows about the documents, at this point notice will be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It subsequently developed that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Congressional requests are channelled into the Office of General Counsel at the FTC and that decisions are made upon them by the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 92-93; <em>cf. FTC Operating Manual, </em>ch. 15.1.3 (1978) (J.A. 718).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Under these circumstances, I believe the district court was justified in probing further as to how the FTC intended to comply with its \u201cpromise\u201d to give as much notice as possible. The Supreme Court recently recognized for example, in rejecting a National Labor Relations Board decision to require an employer to disclose certain aptitude testing materials to union officials, that agency determinations on confidentiality are not sacrosanct. <em>Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>440 U.S. 301, 99 S.Ct. 1123, 59 L.Ed.2d 333 (1979). There the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWo\">. [T]he rule of deference to the Board\u2019s choice of remedy does not constitute a blank check for arbitrary action. The role that Congress in \u00a7 10(e) [of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(e) (1976)] has entrusted to the courts in reviewing the Board\u2019s petitions for enforcement of its orders is not that of passive conduit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-15\"><em>Id. </em>99 S.Ct. at 1132 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">No one disputes that if the owners of trade secrets do not know in time of the likelihood of release of their material to Congress, they can neither attempt to dissuade the FTC from releasing the data,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>seek judicial relief.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, they cannot negotiate on their own with the legislators requesting access to honor the owners\u2019 pleas of confidentiality, and they are at a disadvantage in taking timely precautions if the material should be subsequently released to the public by Congress.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">The district court has fairly \u2014 and reasonably \u2014 required that the trade secret owner be notified of a Congressional request for access upon its receipt by the person at the FTC charged with the responsibility of dealing with such requests. The district court\u2019s order need not be read (as the FTC apparently does) to require notice upon the mere physical receipt by anyone at the FTC of a Congressional request for access, even when it is received by FTC personnel who know nothing about the case. The purpose of the district court\u2019s notice condition is simply to give the trade secret owners notice of Congressional requests at the point the FTC begins to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">III. THE PROPER STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">I do not doubt the district court\u2019s authority to act as it did here. In <em>FCC v. Schreib</em>er, 381 U.S. 279, 291, 85 S.Ct. 1459, 1468, 14 L.Ed.2d 383 (1965), the Court reversed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s affirmance of conditions imposed on a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) investigation by a district court, finding that \u201c[t]he question for decision was whether the exercise of discretion <em>by the Commission </em>was within permissible limits, not whether the District Judge\u2019s substituted judgment was reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis in original). <em>Schreiber </em>concerned an FCC investigation of the television industry in which the Music Corporation of America, Inc. (MCA), unsuccessfully sought FCC assurances that certain subpoenaed data would be kept confidential. Following that rejection, MCA \u2014 again without success \u2014 requested that <em>all </em>its data and even testimony of its representatives not be publicly disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 85 S.Ct. at 1465. In subsequent enforcement proceedings, the district court required that all MCA testimony and documents received by the FCC be held in confidence and made public only after the conclusion of the investigation and upon a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d by the FCC to the court. <em>Id. </em>at 287 n.14, 85 S.Ct. at 1465-1466.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The Supreme Court upheld the agency\u2019s right to fashion its own investigative procedures, including deciding whether hearings would be public or closed, because agencies are \u201cfamiliar with the industries which they regulate and will be in a better position than federal courts or Congress itself to design procedural rules adapted to the peculiarities of the industry and the tasks of the agency involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 85 S.Ct. at 1467. The Court cautioned against judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>second-guessing of an agency\u2019s \u201cprocedural rule, establishing a presumption in favor of public proceedings . . . <em>Id. </em>at 293, 85 S.Ct. at 1469. That rule itself, however, made provision for individualized appeals to the FCC for confidential treatment of particular documents, and the Court noted that \u201c[i]f and when information was demanded which if disclosed might in fact injure MCA competitively, there would be ample opportunity to request that it be received in confidence, and to seek judicial protection if the request were denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296, 85 S.Ct. at 1470 (citation omitted). This is precisely what is happening here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">This is a subpoena enforcement proceeding involving specific documents as to which the owners have asserted a \u00a7 6(f) privilege and as to which the owners seek protective conditions which the FTC has already rejected.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, we are at the point which had not been reached in <em>Schreiber, i. e., </em>the data owners here have \u201crequest[ed] that [their trade secret data] be received in confidence,\u201d and they are now \u201cseeking] judicial protection [since their] . . . requests] were denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is not a pre-enforcement action where there might be uncertainty as the FTC\u2019s position on whether and to what extent it will enforce its subpoenas, nor is this case like <em>Wearly v. FTC, </em>616 F.2d 662 (3d Cir. 1980), where the FTC \u201chas yet to take a position on which documents should be subject to what type of confidential treatment.\u201d At 667.</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\"><em>Wearly </em>in fact supports the data owners here. Although the Third Circuit there found a pre-enforcement proceeding premature, it noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-9\">In acting on [a] petition [by an agency for an order enforcing a subpoena] the district court\u2019s role is not that of a mere rubber stamp, but of an independent reviewing authority called upon to insure the integrity of the proceeding. \u201cThe system of judicial enforcement is designed to provide a meaningful day in court for one resisting an administrative subpoena.\u201d In the discharge of that duty, the court has the power to condition enforcement upon observance of safeguards to the respondent\u2019s valid interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 665 (citation omitted; footnote omitted). <em>Cf. FTC v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>1979-2 Trade Cas. \u00b6 62,830 at 78,792-93 (D.Colo.1979) (holding that <em>Schreiber </em>was not controlling in an FTC subpoena enforcement action because in <em>Schreiber </em>the FCC acted pursuant to a validly promulgated regulation while the FTC had not adopted such a rule regarding the confidentiality of subpoenaed material).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">The FTC has itself provided the \u201c10 day notice\u201d assurance with respect to the release of these same documents to <em>other </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>non-Congressional \u2014 requestors, thereby preliminarily validating the documents\u2019 eligibility for some protection from disclosure. Since the FTC cannot assure 10 days\u2019 prerelease notice for Congressional requests, it seems only reasonable that the FTC should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>do what it can to provide notice at the earliest possible time, i. e., when a request comes in. Requiring notice at the receipt of a request for access seems clearly necessary if the trade secret owners are to have any opportunity to plead their case at the FTC level about what is to be released under what conditions or assurances. Otherwise, by the time \u201creasonable\u201d notice of the FTC\u2019s decision to release data to Congressional committees comes, the agency position will have hardened and any dialogue between the agency and the owner about disclosure will be frozen or futile, or the documents may already have been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Since <em>Schreiber, </em>courts have continued to impose protective conditions on enforcement of agency subpoenas in appropriate circumstances. This court\u2019s recent <em>Exxon </em>opinion regarding DOE\u2019s subpoena enforcement powers reaffirms this authority: \u201cSince the enforcement of a subpoena is an independent judicial action, and not merely an action ancillary to an earlier agency action, <em>ICC v. Brimson, </em>154 U.S. 447, 14 S.Ct. 1125, 38 L.Ed. 1047 (1894), a <em>court is free to change the terms of an agency subpoena as it sees fit. Flotill Products, Inc. v. FTC, </em>278 F.2d 850, 852 (9th Cir. I960).\u201d <em>Exxon, </em>628 F.2d 75 (emphasis supplied). That principle is by no means novel, as Judge Robinson recognized in <em>SEC v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>584 F.2d 1018, 1032-33 (D.C.Cir.1978):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1051-6\">Enforcement of administrative subpoenas has long been committed, not to administrative tribunals themselves, but instead to the courts. Power to enforce subpoenas ... is cast in this traditional mold, without limitation on the court\u2019s discretion to set terms ensuring that the enforcement order does not become an engine of oppression. Stated somewhat differently, judicial authority to temper enforcement with fairness stems inexorably from congressional entrustment of subpoena enforcement to the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\">(Citations omitted). The <em>Arthur Young </em>panel noted that the subpoena enforcement court, \u201cin formulating protective conditions for administrative subpoenas, may resort analogously to techniques conventional to judicial subpoena[s] . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1033. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)(7) (permitting protective orders insuring \u201cthat a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Furthermore, in reviewing the imposition or rejection of such protections, the standard for review is whether the district court exercised sound discretion, taking <em>Schreiber's </em>mandate into consideration. <em>FTC v. Lonning, </em>539 F.2d 202, 211 (D.C.Cir.1976) (\u201c[t]he decision as to the type and scope of any protective order rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge and must be determined on a case by case basis\u201d) (footnote omitted); <em>accord, EEOC v.

Here the FTC has in effect agreed that the notice condition is reasonable and feasible, and asserted that it is actually provided in most cases. J.A. 42. The FTC simply did not want to be required to provide that notice in all cases by court order. <em>Id. </em>But <em>post-Schreiber </em>district courts have imposed conditions, not unlike those at issue here, that confidential subpoenaed material not be disclosed to competitors, <em>FTC v. Continental Can Co., </em>267 F.Supp. 713 (S.D.N.Y.1966), and that sensitive information in documents not be given over to any third party (except grand juries) without ten days\u2019 notice in order to let the parties apply to the court for relief, <em>SEC v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>404 F.Supp. 651 (D.D.C.1975).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">The district court here was similarly exercising its discretion; it is the propriety of its actions which we should be evaluating. I do not believe that the rationale of <em>Schreiber </em>compels so absolute a deference to the FTC\u2019s self-imposed disclosure provisions that a district judge retains no discretion to provide the owner of statutorily-protected material with reasonable assurances of immediate notice and verification when Congressional requests are made for access to that material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>The district court here, furthermore, examined the practical burdens that its two prescribed conditions would impose. It apparently concluded (and I agree) that the burden of both conditions on the FTC is small since the FTC currently channels all Congressional requests to the General Counsel\u2019s office for decision by the Commission itself. As to the notification condition, the following colloquy is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-5\">THE COURT: Yes. So they [i. e., Congressional requests for access] all go to the General Counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-6\">MR. GRIMES [FTC counsel]: That\u2019s correct, and the Commission is the body that finally decides whether to grant that request from Congress. The <em>Ashland Oil </em>case .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-7\">THE COURT: If that\u2019s so, then there is no practical reason why the General Counsel can\u2019t advise these people at the time they get the request, is there? It\u2019s centralized, so therefore, you\u2019ve got a mechanism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1053-8\">MR.

They wouldn\u2019t have the question of people away on vacation, or his secretary needs to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-dY\">J.A. 93 (elipses in original). As to the requirement of ascertaining that Congressional requests are authorized, that too, as the district court concluded, should not be unduly burdensome, again because of the FTC\u2019s practice of channeling such requests to the General Counsel\u2019s office. <em>Compare id. </em>at 47-48 <em>with id. </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">In sum, the district court\u2019s conditions appear to be entirely reasonable in view of the present practices of the FTC as disclosed at the hearing before the district court, and in view of this court\u2019s mandate to the FTC in our 1978 <em>Exxon </em>opinion. Nor is there any ground to believe that those conditions impose any undue burden on the FTC. It may be that as a result of its rulemaking proceeding, the FTC will propose different or better solutions to the problem of implementation of the \u201ctrade secret\u201d provision, but for now it has none except its \u201cas much as possible\u201d notice promise. Nor do I find persuasive the argument that there is no need to impose the district court\u2019s minimal protections unless or until the FTC releases data pursuant to an unauthorized Congressional request or without as much prior notice as \u201cpossible.\u201d This proceeding involved many alleged trade secret documents, and if the owners have any enforceable rights with respect to these documents, protective conditions must precede, not follow, unauthorized releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-15\">Accordingly, I would affirm the district court here in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">. Over a year ago in the district court hearing, FTC counsel was asked about the status of the rulemaking proceeding and answered: \u201cThe Commission has not yet ruled on that. I happen to have personal knowledge of the fact that the staff is in the process of preparing the final recommendations to the Commission . . . .\u201d J.A. 39 (elipse in original). FTC counsel at oral argument before us was unable to be more specific.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">. As counsel for Owens-Coming remarked in the hearing before the district court, without contradiction by FTC counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-11\">. . The Commission, itself, even admits that technological trade secrets fall in this class, but they refuse to classify them as trade secrets and we are told now under the proposed rule that if we turned these over, we may never get notice as to Congress because the only obligation under the rule and the letter which was read to Your Honor is to give notice after the decision to release is made, not at the time the request comes in. As you say, the request may come in to any number of different places in the Commission from any direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1045-16\">Also, the Exxon case in this Circuit has made it clear that the Commission has a duty to make a determination as to whether the request from Congress is an official request, was it issued pursuant to committee vote, and so on. The present Commission practice is not to do so. If a letter from a chairman of a committee on his stationery comes in, they treat it as official, whether or not official, and it may even be a telephone call.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1045-17\"><em>Id </em>at 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">.

The description of a Congressional request for data from the FTC or any federal agency as \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cformal\u201d as opposed to \u201cunofficial\u201d or \u201cinformal\u201d is misleading. Any Congressional request short of subpoena is technically just that: a \u201crequest.\u201d Such \u201crequests\u201d to the Executive are often followed by extensive negotiations between the department or agency and Congress as to what material will be disclosed to the Congressional investigator and under what conditions of confidentiality. It is only at the point that such negotiations break down that a subpoena is resorted to. Even where Congressional subpoenas have been issued, substantial negotiations before production as to the manner of compliance are commonplace. For example, in <em>United States v.

The Second Circuit concluded that \u201c[aln enforcement order in this case, accordingly, should specifically prohibit the government from any further disclosure without the consent of Kodak as the \u2018producer\u2019 of documents under [the CID statute] . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76,757.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">. In <em>Schreiber </em>the Court noted, contrary to the situation here, that \u201cneither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals inquired into the validity of the Commission\u2019s exercise of its rulemaking authority. Instead the District Court devised procedures to be followed by the Commission on the basis of the court\u2019s conception of how the public and private interests could best be served.\u201d 381 U.S. at 291, 85 S.Ct. at 1468. The district court here conducted an inquiry into how the FTC proposed to insure confidentiality under \u00a7 6(f) and the <em>Exxon </em>mandate, and imposed nothing more than what the FTC effectively conceded was appropriate and already being done in large part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">. <em>FTC v. Texaco, Inc., supra, </em>note 7, cited by the majority opinion, is not contrary to the result I would reach here. The subpoenaed parties there had not supplied the material at issue at the time of the court\u2019s opinion, and the FTC had not ruled on specific requests for confidential treatment. In contrast, here the FTC has all the documents it requested and it has refused the trade secret owners\u2019 pleas for an <em>Exxon </em>verification requirement and notice upon receipt of a Congressional request for access. Additionally, although the <em>Texaco </em>court eschewed adopting a general notice rule, it adopted a condition <em>put forth by the FTC itself </em>for settlement purposes and required the FTC to give ten days\u2019 notice <em>even before releasing the subpoenaed material to Congress. </em>The making of that offer by the FTC indicates at the very least that it is not universally opposed to any interference with its ability to respond immediately to Congressional requests for access to subpoenaed data. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The <em>Texaco </em>court noted that \u201c[s]uch a procedure would, of course, provide an opportunity for judicial review at some later date, if the [subpoenaed parties] . . believe that a particular proposed disclosure is improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884-85. The district court\u2019s requirement here for notice upon the FTC\u2019s receipt of a Congressional request simply provides a similar opportunity for trade secret owners to seek judicial review of, and perhaps to provide substantive input into, the FTC\u2019s decision to release data to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">This court\u2019s opinion in <em>Appeal of FTC Line of Business Report Litigation, </em>595 F.2d 685 (D.C. Cir.) (per <em>curiam), cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 958, 99 S.Ct. 362, 58 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), in which Judge Bazelon (the author of the opinion for the court in Texaco) joined, directly cuts against the majority\u2019s invocation of <em>Schreiber </em>and <em>Texaco </em>for the proposition that we must concern ourselves only with whether the FTC has abused its discretion and not with whether the district court\u2019s imposition of protections was appropriate. The lower court in <em>Line of Business </em>had imposed a ten day notice requirement on the FTC\u2019s release of Corporate Patterns Reports (CPR) data, \u201c[s]ince the CPR appellants\u2019 claims involve the potential release of their individual company data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. A ten day notice provision was necessary, the district court found, \u201c \u2018[i]n order to protect the corporate parties from any precipitous action on the part of the FTC\u2019 before appellants could exhaust their administrative remedies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As this court concluded when reviewing that decision: \u201cAlthough we stated expressly in <em>Texaco </em>that such an order is not required as a general rule, we think the District Court\u2019s issuance of a protective order under the circumstances at bar <em>was well within its discretion.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis supplied; footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
