(Berlin) is the licensee of AM station WBRL in Berlin, New Hampshire. Berlin acquired the license in April 1971 and continued the practice of the prior operator of fraudulent billing of advertising accounts. This practice was continued until the investigation by the Federal Communications Commission in August 1974. Under the fraudulent billing plan merchants who had purchased advertising on WBRL were billed by invoices which showed the correct number and cost of the commercial announcements broadcast by the station. However, in addition the merchants also received from Berlin, affidavits that misrepresented the cost or quantity, or both, of advertising on WBRL. The false affidavits were then submitted by the merchants to manufacturers for payment or credit of a percentage of the cost of the advertising shown on the fraudulent affidavit, pursuant to cooperative advertising agreements between the manufacturers and the local merchants. The Commission described \u201cdouble billing\u201d in its proceeding entitled <em>In re Matter of Fraudulent Billing Practices </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-15\">The main ingredient of the practice is the furnishing of false information concerning broadcast advertising to any party contributing to the payment of such advertising, the purpose being to induce such party to pay more than the actual rate for the advertising.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">1 FCC2d 1068 (1965). During the period covered by the Commission\u2019s investigation, twenty-two accounts with local merchants were issued these fraudulent affidavits by Berlin. These affidavits were in turn transmitted by the merchants pursuant to the advertising contract and resulted in overcharges of $22,390.81 to the manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">Richard L. Blais, president and 75% stock owner of Berlin, testified at the hearing that he was first informed that his station was double billing, as the practice is called, a few months after he acquired the station in 1971.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The owner of the Berlin newspaper reported to him that the newspaper and the two other, jointly-owned radio stations in Berlin, WMOU and WXLQ, also double billed. Mr. Blais then ascertained that WBLR was indeed fraudulently billing its accounts, but he allowed the practice to continue, deferring to the judgment of his general manager that the station would be forced out of business were it to cease the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>The Commission initiated its investigation in August 1974 and following the hearing the Administrative Law Judge determined that Berlin had violated Section 73.-1205 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.1205.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This regulation prohibits a licensee from knowingly issuing or causing to be issued to any local or national advertiser any bill, invoice, affidavit, etc., which misrepresents the charge for or quantity, timing or content of advertising on its station, or failing to exercise reasonable diligence in supervising its employees\u2019 adherence to the rule. The Administrative Law Judge denied Berlin\u2019s application for renewal of its license, and this decision was affirmed by the Commission. 68 FCC2d 923 (1978), recon. denied,-FCC-(1978).</p>\n<p id=\"AXN1\">In appealing to the court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Berlin does not deny its fraudulent billing, but instead objects to the severity of the sanction \u2014 nonrenewal of its license. Berlin contends, first, that imposition of this sanction is inconsistent with prior Commission policy and precedent, and second, that the Commission failed to take into account \u201cmitigating factors\u201d raised by Berlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">We find no merit in Berlin\u2019s arguments and uphold the Commission\u2019s order. Furthermore, finding Berlin\u2019s actions to be an egregious violation not only of the Commission\u2019s Rules but believing that fraudulent double billing also may constitute a violation of the Mail Fraud and Conspiracy Statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, 371 (1976),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>strongly recommend that the Commission report future instances of fraudulent billing to the appropriate office of the United States Attorney<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for consideration of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">We distinguish three cases relied upon by Berlin in which a lighter sanction of monetary forfeiture was imposed for fraudulent billing. The licensee in <em>Blackstone Broadcasting Corp., 52 </em>FCC2d 1106 (1975), double billed only two of its accounts. Although this practice lasted for six years, the overcharges were nominal, and no false affidavits were issued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Berlin issued false affidavits in furtherance of a much more pervasive violation, involving twenty-two accounts and over $20,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">In <em>Bluegrass Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>43 FCC2d 990 (1973), and <em>Gateway Broadcasting Enterprises, Inc., </em>58 FCC 2d 63 (1976), principals of the licensees had no actual knowledge that their stations were double billing. In <em>Bluegrass </em>the principal was merely negligent in failing to stop a practice of which he was unaware; the principal in <em>Gateway </em>thought that false affidavits were accurate when he prepared them. Absent this finding, said the Commission on review in <em>Gateway, </em>denial of license renewal would have been the appropriate sanction. In stark contrast, Richard Blais, principal of Berlin, knew of his station\u2019s violation and authorized its continuation until the time of the FCC\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This aiding and abetting is sufficient under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 to constitute him a principal in the criminal violation of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Cases in which the Commission imposed a lighter sanction than non-renewal of license involved less egregious violations of the double billing rule than did Berlin\u2019s flagrantly fraudulent billing practices that were intentionally continued over a three year period with the admitted knowledge of the principal owner of the license. In pointing out this distinction we do not necessarily approve of the lesser sanctions imposed by the Commission in other cases, but neither can we say that the sanction that we approve here for these more egregious violations is inconsistent with Commission precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">Berlin\u2019s next claim is that the Commission should have taken into account certain alleged mitigating factors that would dictate a softening of the sanction to be levied. After even a sympathetic examination of Berlin\u2019s conduct, we fail to see any mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b940-16\"><em>Business Necessity: </em>Berlin outlines a scenario in which it asserts that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>forced by competitive pressures to engage in fraudulent billing. As both the newspaper and other radio stations in town refused to cease the practice, Berlin states that it reluctantly double billed its advertising accounts as well. Failure to do so, Berlin asserts, would have meant the loss of key advertising accounts and resultant competitive ruin. Berlin admits that it could have reported the illegal activities of its neighboring radio stations to the Commission, but excuses this failure by pointing out that the newspaper was not regulated by the Commission, and would presumably succeed to a monopoly of all the advertising business in Berlin.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Berlin\u2019s contentions are contradicted by the record, and by common sense. The newspaper indicated its willingness to stop double billing as early as 1972, and had done so by the time of the Commission\u2019s investigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But more importantly, Berlin could have announced its intention to stop double billing to its competitors at any time and could have told them that it would report their continued violations to the United States Attorney and local criminal prosecutor, in the case of the newspaper, as well as to the FCC in the case of the radio stations. Arguing that the newspaper is \u201cunregulated\u201d is nonsensical in the face of criminal statutes awaiting application to such cases of fraud and obtaining money under false pretenses by the parties involved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, it is elementary that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>fraudulent conduct by licensees is not mitigated because of participation by others in the scheme, or the desire to protect business profits. <em>White Mountain Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>60 FCC 2d 342, recon. denied, 61 FCC 472 (1976), aff\u2019d, <em>White Mountain Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. FCC, </em>194 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 598 F.2d 274 (D.C.Cir.1979); <em>Monroe Broadcasters, Inc., </em>60 FCC2d 792, 796 (1976), recon. denied, 61 FCC 716 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\"><em>Lack of Injury to National Advertisers: </em>Berlin submits that the national advertisers\u2019 failure to request full restitution after they were sent notice of the fraudulent billing indicates a lack of injury that should be considered in mitigation of Berlin\u2019s violations. Berlin also argues, in effect, that the national advertisers are themselves responsible for their losses because of their \u201clax practices\u201d and \u201cpassive acceptance\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">We wonder at Berlin\u2019s curious attempt to \u201cblame the victim.\u201d It occurs to us that the national manufacturers who have paid the cost of Berlin\u2019s violations may not even be aware of the offenses committed against them. The record does not reveal whether it was they who were notified, or their advertising agencies. We cannot accept Berlin\u2019s attempt to shift the blame for its acts to its victims, nor is it reasonable to regard the loss of more than $22,000 as non'-injurious. Even if we were to accord weight to Berlin\u2019s argument that lax practices of the national advertisers \u201cencouraged\u201d the fraudulent billing, that would not be a defense to the Commission\u2019s acting as it did. The FCC must fulfill its responsibility to the public by \u201cdealing vigorously with misrepresentation among those entrusted with a public broadcasting license.\u201d <em>White Mountain Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. FCC, supra, </em>(at 277). Berlin\u2019s conduct does not reflect creditably upon its qualification to operate a license in the public interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\"><em>The Principal's Lack of Participation: </em>Although Berlin admits that its principal, Mr. Blais, had explicit knowledge of the fraudulent billing by the station over a long period of time, it contends that his lack of actual direct involvement in the daily mechanics of creating the fraudulent documents <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> somehow removes him from serious culpability. The Commission found, however, that his failure to stop the practice was \u201ctantamount to instituting intentionally the illegal billing activities\u201d. We agree. He is a principal in the offense just the same as if he personally prepared the false affidavits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In its most favorable light, Blais\u2019 conduct is the \u201cactive indifference\u201d that the Commission views as \u201cunfavorably as an intentional abuse\u201d. <em>United Broad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>casting Co. of Florida, Inc., </em>55 FCC 2d 832, 839 (1975), <em>recon. denied, </em>60 FCC 2d 816 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">To our mind, the so-called mitigating factors submitted by Berlin serve to remind us of the seriousness of the violation. We find the sanction imposed by the Commission to be fully warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s order denying Berlin\u2019s application for license renewal, but we are compelled to add a few observations. This appeal presents us with a case of clearly fraudulent activity. Berlin\u2019s conduct is incompatible not only with the standards expected by law of licensees of the airwaves, but is also incompatible with federal and local criminal statutes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It appears to us that Berlin and other violators of the double billing rule simultaneously offended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, the Mail Fraud Statute, the Conspiracy Statute, 18 U.S.C. 371 and the local statutes proscribing the obtainment of money under false pretenses. The Commission <em>In the Matter of Fraudulent Practices, </em>1 FCC 2d 1068, 1070 (1965) recognized the existence of criminal penalties against \u201cdouble billing\u201d. However, it also appears to us that the Commission has not been giving sufficient consideration to the fraudulent conduct implicit in double billing as the serious <em>criminal </em>violation that it constitutes. In our opinion the Commission has a responsibility to refer such cases to the United States Attorney<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for consideration by the grand jury when the violation of the criminal law is of the magnitude and as obvious as that on display here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">In all other respects, we approve of the actions of the Commission, and affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-18\">.

Berlin is forced to attempt to distinguish <em>White Mountain Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. FCC, </em>194 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 598 F.2d 274 (D.C.Cir. 1979) because in that case we affirmed the FCC\u2019s denial of license renewal to stations WMOU and WXLQ, the jointly-held radio stations in Berlin, New Hampshire, <em>also </em>found in violation of the rule against fraudulent billing. Berlin hopes to establish the superior character of its principal, Richard Blais, by comparison with the principal in <em>White Mountain, </em>who was double billing before Blais purchased WBRL, and allegedly refused Blais\u2019 entreaties to cease the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-18\">Berlin cannot excuse its conduct by reference to the wrongdoing of others. That the <em>White Mountain </em>stations\u2019 illegality preceded that of Berlin does not diminish the fact that Berlin willfully engaged in conduct violative of the Commission\u2019s rules. The facts of <em>White Mountain, supra, </em>are too similar to allow distinction; moreover, standing alone, Berlin\u2019s conduct justifies the sanction of nonrenewal. <em>See </em>discussion <em>infra </em>at 9-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b941-6\">. Brief for Commission at 28, 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\">. <em>See e. g. </em>New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (1979) \u00a7\u00a7 637:4 (theft by deception), 638:6 (deceptive business practices); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, \u00a7 2 (mail fraud); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (conspiracy).</p>\n<p id=\"APmI\">The record in this case indicates apparent violations of the Federal Mail Fraud Statute. (A.97) To assist the Commission in evaluating future cases we explain our analysis of the instant case in detail. There is no question that both Blais and the merchants participated in a scheme to knowingly defraud the national advertisers. Berlin mailed the false affidavits to the merchants (A.97) who collected on them from the advertisers. The Administrative Law Judge made the explicit finding that the false affidavits were sent by Berlin to the merchants via U. S. Mail. (A.97) This mailing in pursuance of a scheme to defraud indicates a violation of the Mail Fraud Statute by the merchants, Bl\u00e1is and other participating knowledgeable employees of Berlin. Even if the invoices and affidavits had been hand delivered by the station in Berlin to the merchants, who in turn mailed them to the national advertisers, that could constitute mail fraud by the local merchants. And Blais and knowledgeable employees of Berlin who participated could be guilty as principals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 because in furnishing the false affidavits they aided and abetted mail fraud. Also, the station and all individuals involved there could be guilty of separate unlawful completed conspiracies with each local merchant to commit mail fraud contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The mailing to the merchants of the invoices and false affidavits, and even their delivery by hand with the subsequent mailing of such invoices and affidavits to the parties ordering the advertising, could constitute overt acts in pursuance of the conspiracy. Each mailing of an invoice or false affidavit for each advertisement could constitute a separate overt act.</p>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">Blais and the participating employees at the station were not the only ones who appear to have violated these laws. A number of local merchants also participated in the double billing scheme, benefitted from it and refused to stop it.</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">1. The Commission found in its Decision that false affidavits issued by Berlin to merchants were in most cases forwarded to national manufacturers for payment or part payment. (A. 180) 68 FCC 923, 924 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"APin\">2. The Decision of the Administrative Law Judge lists 22 accounts of local merchants by name that received false affidavits from Berlin and presumably passed these on to the national advertiser/manufacturers. (A.98-107).</p>\n<p id=\"A5V8\">3. Under WBRL\u2019s prior operator double billing occurred as early as 1966. (Tr. 363-66).</p>\n<p id=\"AIA\">4. The Initial Decision of the ALJ in the <em>White Mountain </em>case involving Berlin stations WMOU and WXLQ found 14 merchants who also participated in double billing with WBRL. There was also testimony by two merchants that their accounts had been double billed since 1969.

FCC, </em>598 F.2d 274 (D.C.Cir., 1979). App. A 14.</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">5. The general manager, Robert Dale, at the request of Blais the principal, spoke to two local advertising merchants to see if it were possible to stop false billing. Dale reported back to Blais that with these two merchants there was \u201cno chance\u201d that they would terminate the practice. Testimony of Dale before the ALJ, (A 377-9); Statement of Blais, A 213.</p>\n<p id=\"AVa\">6. Blais testified on direct examination before the ALJ that <em>all </em>the media in Berlin double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>billed.

Blais stated that he \u201chad no reason to suspect that double billing extended beyond a few accounts\u201d and did not know that false affidavits, rather than false invoices, were issued. Statement of Richard Leo Blais, JA 206,214. His lack of knowledge of the <em>actual </em>mechanics of the fraudulent scheme is not a defense. He knew from the very start that his employees were engaged in a scheme of fraudulent billing and it is immaterial that he may have thought false invoices instead of false affidavits were used. Both violate the regulations and most likely the criminal statutes. The Commission found that \u201cthe record was insufficient to establish that the licensee\u2019s principal had participated <em>directly </em>in the double billing scheme\u201d. 68 FCC 2d at 925 (1978).
