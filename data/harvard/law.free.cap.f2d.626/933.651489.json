After receiving a workmen\u2019s compensation settlement for damages that he had alleged resulted solely from a work-related accident, plaintiff Athanasios Konstantinidis sued defendant Cheng Nan Chen, a medical doctor, for essentially the same damages on a claim of medical malpractice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on the doctrine of judicial estoppel, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s prior assertion that his accident was the sole cause of his injuries, according to the court, barred him from now contending that Dr. Chen\u2019s negligence was a contributing factor. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-18\">Applying the law of the District of Columbia, we find that the District of Columbia courts have not recognized the doctrine of judicial estoppel and would not do so in the present case. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-20\">The facts material to this appeal are not in dispute. On August 30, 1972, while working as a carpenter, Konstantinidis fell off a sawhorse, injuring his neck and back. The Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (Commission) granted Konstantinidis\u2019 application for a temporary total disability based on these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-21\">Seventeen months later Konstantinidis placed himself under the care of the defendant, Dr. Chen, and received a series of acupuncture treatments. On March 30, 1974, during one such treatment, an acupuncture needle broke off, leaving the tip lodged in Konstantinidis\u2019 neck. Konstantinidis subsequently complained of increased neck pain radiating into his right arm. After another physician diagnosed a spinal defect, Dr. John W. Barrett performed a cervical laminectomy to remove a ruptured disc. Dr. Barrett also extracted the needle tip.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-22\">Konstantinidis\u2019 neck pain and discomfort persisted, and in August of 1974 he filed a supplementary claim with the Commission. After a hearing, Commissioner Frankel denied the supplementary claim, finding that Konstantinidis\u2019 accident had not caused the neck disability. The decision was affirmed on rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-23\">Konstantinidir appealed the Commission\u2019s adverse ruling to the Prince George\u2019s Coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>ty Circuit Court,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but before the court could act the parties reached a settlement. Konstantinidis received $20,000 from his employer and the employer\u2019s insurer. In return, Konstantinidis executed a final compromise and release, which the Commission approved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">In early 1977 Konstantinidis filed the present medical malpractice suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Konstantinidis claimed Dr. Chen\u2019s negligent acupuncture treatment had caused the ruptured disc and related medical problems that had been detailed in the supplementary workmen\u2019s compensation application as having been due to the sawhorse fall. Dr. Chen moved for summary judgment, arguing that Konstantinidis\u2019 submissions and pleadings before the Commission and the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court judicially estopped Konstantinidis to attribute the injuries to the broken needle rather than the sawhorse accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">The district court found that Konstantinidis had consistently contended in the past that the fall from the sawhorse constituted the only cause of his neck, arm, and back pains. Concluding that the judicial estoppel doctrine barred Konstantinidis from claiming that Dr. Chen\u2019s actions were responsible for the injuries, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Chen. Konstantinidis now appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-16\">At the outset we must distinguish \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d from the more obscure concept of \u201cjudicial estoppel.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>gener</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number><em>ally </em>IB <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 0.405[8] (2d ed. 1965). Virtually all courts agree that equitable estoppel may be applied to preclude a party from contradicting testimony or pleadings successfully maintained in a prior judicial proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Wakelee, </em>156 U.S. 680, 689, 15 S.Ct. 555, 558, 39 L.Ed. 578 (1895). The party seeking to invoke the estoppel, however, must have been an adverse party in the prior proceeding, must have acted in reliance upon his opponent\u2019s prior position, and must now face injury if a court were to permit his opponent to change positions. <em>See Galt v. Phoenix Indemnity Co., </em>74 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 159, 120 F.2d 723, 726 (D.C.Cir.1941). <em>See also </em>Note, <em>Procedure </em>\u2014 Judi<em>cial Estoppel </em>\u2014 Sworn <em>Statements, </em>11 Sw. L.J. 96, 96-97 (1957). The privity, reliance, and prejudice requirements demonstrate that the doctrine is designed to ensure fairness in the relationship between the parties. As Professor Pomeroy states, the rule\u2019s \u201cobject is to prevent the unconscientious and inequitable assertion or enforcement of claims or rights which might have existed or been enforceable by other rules of law, unless prevented by the estoppel.\u201d 3 <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a7 802 (5th ed. 1941). The party seeking the protection of the estoppel is the intended beneficiary of the doctrine, for \u201cits practical effect is, from motives of equity and fair dealing, to create and vest opposing rights in the party who obtains the benefit of estoppel.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">\u201cJudicial estoppel,\u201d on the other hand, although otherwise similar to the equitable estoppel rule against inconsistency, does not require proof of privity, reliance, or prejudice. <em>Sartain v. Dixie Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>150 Tenn. 633, 648-49, 266 S.W. 313, 317 (1924). This distinction reflects a difference in policy objectives: in contrast to equitable estoppel\u2019s concentration on the integrity of the parties\u2019 relationship to each other, judicial estoppel focuses on the integrity of the judicial process. To the extent that prior sworn statements are involved, the doctrine upholds the \u201cpublic policy which exalts the sanctity of the oath. The object is to safeguard the administration of justice by placing a restraint upon the tendency to reckless and false swearing and thereby preserve the public confidence in the purity and efficiency of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Melton v. Anderson, </em>32 Tenn.App. 335, 339, 222 S.W.2d 666, 669 (Ct.App.1948). <em>See Hamilton v. Zimmerman, </em>37 Tenn. (5 Sneed) 39 (1857). Furthermore, even when the prior statements were not made under oath, the doctrine may be invoked to prevent a party from playing \u2018fast and loose with the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scarano v. Central Railroad, </em>203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir. 1953).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Whatever the value of the judicial estoppel doctrine, we must bear in mind that this case comes before the federal courts because of the parties\u2019 diversity of citizenship. Therefore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), and <em>Angel </em>v. <em>Bullington, </em>330 U.S. 183, 67 S.Ct. 657, 91 L.Ed. 832 (1947), compel us to look to District of Columbia law to determine whether judicial estoppel should be applied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>cannot overrule the decision of the District\u2019s highest court, for \u201c[n]o matter what the result, we cannot \u2018correct\u2019 a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own law. . . . The rule of <em>Erie . . </em>calls on us to apply state law, not, if we can be persuaded to doubt its soundness, to participate in an effort to change it.\u201d <em>Tarr v. Manchester Insurance Corp., </em>544 F.2d 14, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">No District of Columbia court has ever adopted the judicial estoppel doctrine. In certain cases the District\u2019s courts have imposed a bar against inconsistent statements, but in every instance the elements of privity, reliance, and prejudice have been present. <em>See, e.g., Jamison v. Garrett, </em>92 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 205 F.2d 15 (D.C.Cir.1953) (applying District of Columbia law); <em>Clark v. Barber, </em>21 App.D.C. 274 (D.C.Cir.1903) (applying District of Columbia law); <em>Atkins v. United States, </em>283 A.2d 204, 206 (D.C.1971). On the other hand, when one or more of these elements have been missing the District\u2019s courts have refused to impose an estoppel. <em>See, e.g., Parker v. Sager, </em>85 U.S.App.D.C. 4, 174 F.2d 657 (D.C.Cir.1949) (applying District of Columbia law); <em>Dexter v. Gordon, </em>11 App.D.C. 60 (D.C.Cir.1897) (applying District of Columbia law). Thus, although the law of the District recognizes the existence of the <em>equitable </em>estoppel doctrine, no case has embraced the broader <em>judicial </em>estoppel concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">We realize that no District of Columbia court has ever expressly rejected judicial estoppel. Nevertheless, the District\u2019s cases evidence some hostility to the concept. Moreover, judicial estoppel has not been followed by anything approaching a majority of jurisdictions, nor is there a discernible modem trend in that direction. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit observed in <em>Parkinson v. California Co., </em>233 F.2d 432, 437-38 (10th Cir. 1956), judicial estoppel \u201creflects the minority viewpoint which has encountered inhospitable reception outside the State of Tennessee.\u201d Even the state of Maryland, whose workmen\u2019s compensation commission would allegedly be insulted by plaintiff Konstantinidis\u2019 shift in position, would not apply the judicial estoppel doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Travelers Corp. v. Boyer, </em>301 F.Supp. 1396, 1401 n.4 (D.Md.1969) (applying Maryland law).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Furthermore, we agree with the Tenth Circuit that utilization of the judicial estoppel theory \u201cwould be out of harmony with [the modern rules of pleading] and would discourage the determination of cases on the basis of the true facts as they might be established ultimately.\u201d <em>Parkinson v. California Co., </em>233 F.2d at 438. We also believe that \u201c[e]ven in the case of false statements in pleadings, public policy can be vindicated otherwise \u2014 and more practicably and fairly in most instances \u2014 than through suppression of truth in the future.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Lacking a controlling District of Columbia decision on the issue in question, our task is to apply the rule we believe the District of Columbia Court of Appeals would follow today. <em>See In re Leasing Consultants, Inc., </em>592 F.2d 103, 109 (2d Cir. 1979). <em>See also Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 524, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1107, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972); <em>Meredith v. Winter Haven, </em>320 U.S. 228, 234, 64 S.Ct. 7, 10, 88 L.Ed. 9 (1943). We conclude that the judicial estoppel doctrine has no vitality in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-11\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-12\">Moreover, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals would not choose this particular case to introduce the judicial estoppel concept because of the plaintiff Konstantinidis\u2019 lack of success before the Commission and because of his defense that his prior position was a mistake made in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-13\">A. <em>Lack of Success in the Prior Proceeding</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-14\">Judicial estoppel operates to prevent a party from insulting a court through improper use of judicial machinery. Thus the concept\u2019s underlying rationale is that a party should not be allowed to convince unconscionably one judicial body to adopt factual contentions, only to tell another judicial body that those contentions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>were false. <em>Standage Ventures, Inc. v. State, </em>114 Ariz. 480, 484, 562 P.2d 360, 364 (1977); <em>Metroflight, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shaffer, </em>581 S.W.2d 704, 709 (Tex.Civ.App.1979), <em>writ ref\u2019d n.r.e., </em>No. B8440 (Tex. July 3, 1979). It follows that judicial estoppel should not be applied if no judicial body has been led astray. Accordingly, success in the prior proceeding is clearly an essential element of judicial estoppel. <em>City of Kingsport v. Steel &amp; Roof Structure, Inc., </em>500 F.2d 617, 620 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>State Farm Automobile Insurance Co. v. Civil Service Employees Insurance Co., </em>19 Ariz.App. 594, 600, 509 P.2d 725, 731 (1973). <em>Cf. Parker v. Sager, </em>85 U.S.App.D.C. 4, 8, 174 F.2d 657, 661 (D.C.Cir.1949) (no equitable estoppel without pri- or success); <em>Atkins v. United States, </em>283 A.2d 204, 206 n.4 (D.C.1971) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">A settlement neither requires nor implies any judicial endorsement of either party\u2019s claims or theories, and thus a settlement does not provide the prior success necessary for judicial estoppel. <em>See, e.g., City of Kingsport v. Steel &amp; Roof Structure, Inc., </em>500 F.2d at 620; <em>Aerojet General Corp. v. D. Zelinsky &amp; Sons, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 604, 612, 57 Cal.Rptr. 701, 706 (1967); <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>141 Cal.App.2d 121, 129-30, 296 P.2d 386, 392 (1956).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the case before us, plaintiff Konstantinidis has yet to procure a favorable decision from any judicial body. The Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court had no opportunity to rule before the parties made their compromise. As for the Commission, it twice <em>rejected </em>Konstantinidis\u2019 prior position that his injuries resulted from the sawhorse fall. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix at 90, 99. In approving the settlement, the Commission neither made nor intended to make any new decision concerning the cause of Konstantinidis\u2019 injuries. Section 52 of the Maryland workmen\u2019s compensation statute, Md.Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 52 (1979), requires Commission approval of compensation settlements \u201cto prevent advantage being taken of a claimant\u2019s possible ignorance of his rights or of his best interests.\u201d <em>Hanley v. Mulleneaux, </em>192 Md. 592, 597, 65 A.2d 325, 327 (1949). Settlement approval does not signify a Commission endorsement of either party\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">Konstantinidis did not induce the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court or the Commission to accept a theory contrary to the one now being argued in the malpractice suit against Dr. Chen. Consequently, even if judicial estoppel were generally recognized, the doctrine would not be applied to this case because of the lack of prior judicial success.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">B. <em>Defense of Mistake</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">Jurisdictions recognizing judicial estoppel also refuse to apply the doctrine when the prior position was taken because of a good faith mistake rather than as part of a scheme to mislead the court. An unintentional error is not penalized by precluding subsequent assertion of the truth. \u201cBecause the rule looks toward cold manipulation and not unthinking or confused blunder, it has never been applied where plaintiff\u2019s assertions were based on fraud, inadvertence, or mistake.\u201d <em>Johnson Service Co. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>485 F.2d 164, 175 (5th Cir. 1973). <em>Accord, Metroflight, Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>581 S.W.2d 704, 709 (Tex.Civ.App.1979), <em>writ ref\u2019d n.r.e., </em>No. B8440 (Tex. July 3, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">The genesis of medical problems provides fertile soil for reasonable disagreement, even among physicians. In particular, courts and experts have often drawn different conclusions as to the connection between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment. <em>See </em>2A A. Larson, <em>The Law of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number><em>Workmen's Compensation </em>\u00a7 73.21 (1974). Here, the origin of Konstantinidis\u2019 pain and suffering was not within his personal knowledge nor within the knowledge of his attorney. Given the emphatic denials in Dr. Barrett\u2019s reports that the acupuncture needle tip played any role,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is not surprising that Konstantinidis represented to the Commission that his sawhorse accident was the sole causative event. We are satisfied that judicial estoppel \u201ccannot be extended to reach an affiant whose major failing is the absence of clairvoyance.\u201d <em>Johnson Service Co. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., </em>485 F.2d at 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Judicial estoppel has yet to make its way into the law of this jurisdiction, and we do not believe that there is any tendency in favor of its adoption. Furthermore, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals would not adopt the doctrine on the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Mr. Konstantinidis\u2019 prior inconsistent statements will be evidence favoring the defendant in this case. However, Konstantinidis may be able to convince the factfinder that his position before the Commission was simply a mistake: Causation remains a genuine issue of material fact, thereby precluding summary judgment. <em>See Dewey v. Clark, </em>86 U.S.App.D.C. 137, 143, 180 F.2d 766, 772 (D.C.Cir.1950) (Fahy, J.). The decision of the district court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1003-24\">.

The definitions of \u201cequitable estoppel\u201d and \u201cjudicial estoppel\u201d vary considerably throughout the literature of this confused area of the law. <em>See generally </em>Beck, <em>Estoppel Against Inconsistent Positions in Judicial Proceedings, </em>9 Brooklyn L.Rev. 245 (1940). Our use of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>terms is not meant to generate further confusion, but only to label what we perceive to be two distinct doctrines.</p>\n<p id=\"AyO2\">Collateral estoppel, another issue preclusion doctrine, differs from both equitable and judicial estoppel. Collateral estoppel operates to prevent repetitive litigation. Thus the doctrine does not apply if the parties did not actually litigate the issue in the prior proceeding. <em>Cromwell v.

In <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>Garrett, </em>92 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 234, 205 F.2d 15, 17 (D.C.Cir.1953), a settlement did form the basis for a subsequent estoppel. However, it was the express language of the settlement in <em>Jamison, </em>language conveying a quitclaim to the property in controversy, that created the bar rather than the mere fact that the parties reached a settlement. Thus the <em>Jamison </em>defendant simply obtained the benefit of the bargain she had made in the course of the previous action. In contrast, the compromise between Konstantinidis, his employer, and the employer\u2019s insurer contains no admissions or stipulations of fact, nor was Dr. Chen an intended beneficiary of the settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
