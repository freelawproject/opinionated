N. HINSON</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7\">Hohenwald Tennessee</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">Expert Lover \u2014 Wholesaler and Retailer in LOME, KISSES AND UP-TO-DATE-HUGS Samples, free, no extra charge for night work Special Attention to other Fellows Girls.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The trial judge sustained a demurrer setting up, in substance, that the words are not libelous <em>per se, </em>or alleged to be libelous, and that no special damages are averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The case turns on whether or not the words are libelous <em>per </em>se, \u2014 if so no special damages need be charged. Words which, upon their face and without the aid of extrinsic proof, are injurious are defamatory <em>per se; </em>and words defamatory <em>per se </em>carry the presumption of falsity, of damages, and of malice, unless privileged. 36'C. J., p. 1160, 1151. Counsel agree that this was and is a question for the Court, and is&gt; the sole question.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">In Newell on Slander and Libel (4 Ed.), p. 35, libels on private persons are thus classified: \u201c(1) Libels which impute to a person the commission of a crime; (2) Libels which have a tendency to injure him in his office, profession, calling, or trade; and (3) Libels which hold him up to scorn and ridicule, \u2019 <em>\u2019 </em>etc. The instant case belongs to the last division.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The following text from the same author (page 56), supported by many citations and illustrative notes, is particularly applicable to the case before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-3\">\u201cAs every person desires to appear agreeable in life, and must be highly provoked by such ridiculous representations as tend to lessen him in the esteem of the world, and, by the sure effect of ridicule, to cast a shade upon his talents and virtues, it has been held that not only charges of a flagrant nature and which reflect a moral turpitude on the party are libelous, but also such as set him in a scurrilous and ignominious light; for these reflections equally create ill blood, and provoke the parties to acts of revenge and breaches of the peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">\u201cEverything, therefore, written of another which holds him up to scorn and ridicule that might reasonably (that is, according to our natural passions) be considered as provoking him to a- breach of the peace is a libel. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">One test generally recognized, referred to above, is whether or not the language is calculated to provoke a breach of the peace, civilized society being directly concerned in the preservation of peaceful relations among men. Now rereading the language of the card, does it not hold up to ridicule the party therein named and provoke him, if of average blood temperature, spirit and courage, to \u201cacts of revenge and breaches of the peace,\u201d \u2014in common parlance make him \u201cmad enough to fight?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Counsel do not differ materially as to the general definition of libel as, \u201ca malicious defamation, expressed in print or writing, or by signs or pictures tending to blacken the memory of the dead, with an intent to provoke the living, or to injure the reputation of one who is alive, and thereby expose him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule.\u201d Our own cases adopt substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>this definition, as, for example, <em>Stair </em>v. <em>Journal </em>&amp; <em>Tribune Co., </em>136 Tenn., 406. If a defamation <em>per se, </em>malice is presumed. Here it is \u201c expressed in print,\u2019 \u2019 and we think quite plainly intended \u201cto provoke the living,\u201d by exposing him to \u201cridicule.\u201d He is \u201cliving,\u201d according to this description, very much alive. He hardly takes time to sleep. Works anywhere and at any time. Conducts his amours at \u201cwholesale and retail/\u2019 by day and by night, without charge, reckless of place or position, and in utter disregard of the rights of others. No man could carry on his love campaign so passionately and so absorbingly without neglect and abandonment of the ordinary avocations of life, yielding support and competence, and. devoting himself exclusively to the pursuit of frivolity.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">All the world loves a lover, and well it may, but all the world scorns the promiscuous, professional love-maker, \u201cout for a good time,\u201d shallow hearted and shallow pated, who preys on the preserves of others, and whose sole ambition is to flirt with frocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Plaintiff is here so pictured in graphic terms. It will be observed that words are libelous that hold one up to scorn, contempt <em>or ridicule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">We are unable to agree with the learned trial judge, who probably took the view that the publication was in the nature of a practical joke, without malicious design, and this view is plausible, but one may not be thus rightfully held up to ridicule by the publication of printed matter such as this. The words used are in our opinion libelous <em>per se. </em>Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
