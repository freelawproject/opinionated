There were only two witnesses who testified in the case. One of these was the complainant, Dan Masters, who testified that he-resided in Throckmorton County, Texas, and on the 1st day of June, 1930, he owned a Buick Coupe, 1926 model, automobile. On the night of June 1, 1930, he had his car in a garage; that when he put his car in the garage that night it was in good shape and none of the casings, were down or flat. The next morning he found all of the casings on the car down flat and on examination they showed that they had been cut or punctured with a knife or some sharp instrument. The only other witness was the witness Buck Bales, who testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-17\">\u201cMy name is Buck Bales, I reside in Throckmorton County, Texas. On the night of June 1st, 1930, I went with Thurman Latham to Dan Masters garage, and the defendant Thurman Latham did not have a knife and I loaned him my knife before we went to the garage. The defendant went into the garage and I stayed at the door and kept watch while the defendant was back in the garage I heard a noise that sounded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>like air escaping from something. Just before the defendant, Thurman Latham and myself went to the garage of Dan Masters, the defendant said to me,' \u2018let\u2019s puncture old Danny\u2019s tires and give him some flats to fix.\u2019 That the next morning when the defendant and myself passed by Dan Master\u2019s home, we saw Dan Masters out there near his garage and the defendant, Thurman Latham, said, \u2018well I guess old Danny boy (meaning the man Dan Masters) is fixing his flats\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Under the testimony of the said Buck Bales, if the same was true, he was an accomplice. Article 718, C. C. P., provides that a conviction cannot be had upon the testimony of an accomplice unless corroborated by other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed, and the corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows the commission of the offense. There being no other evidence in the case except the testimony of the witness Buck Bales tending to connect the appellant with the offense committed, the conviction cannot stand and must be set aside.
