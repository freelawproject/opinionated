The objections appear to have been overruled. That the argument was manifestly improper is apparent, and the point has been decided by this court in favor of appellant\u2019s contention. There is also complaint of another argument made by said county attorney to the effect that before he filed the complaints against appellant he discussed the matter with the district attorney, and on his advice filed said complaints, and that he had also discussed the same with eminent counsel of the city. It is apparent that discussion of this kind should not have been indulged. The only effect of such argument would be to put behind the prosecuting attorney\u2019s opinion that of the district attorney and of other eminent counsel. In none of the other matters presented by bills of exception do we think error is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">Appellant was an attorney in Dallas representing a mortgage company which had purchased a number of notes and accounts from a San Angelo concern which dealt in such securities. A bond had been made in San Angelo and signed by Mr. W. W. Foreman. The appellant wrote a letter to Mr. Foreman in which he plainly stated that the owner of the San Angelo concern, calling him by name, had misappropriated and converted the funds represented by the notes and accounts which were listed in the letter. We think the indictment sufficiently charged the offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>and that the charge of the court correctly presented the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">For the errors mentioned, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
