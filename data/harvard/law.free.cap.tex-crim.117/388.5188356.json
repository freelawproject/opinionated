In the absence of information on the subject, the presumption prevails that in refusing the charges the action of the trial court was \u2022 proper. However, we note that some of the special charges were given, and those which were refused bear no indorsement showing that their refusal was over the objection of the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-20\">In writing the judgment, the court ignored the Indeterminate Sentence Law, whereby the sentence should have directed the confinement of the appellant in the State penitentiary for a term of not less than two nor more than ten years. The judgment in that respect is reformed, and as reformed it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-21\">\n<em>Reformed and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
