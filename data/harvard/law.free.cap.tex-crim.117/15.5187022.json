An appeal was taken to the County Court at Law of Harris County where a trial de novo resulted in appellant\u2019s conviction with the punishment assessed at a fine of $100.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Article 53 C. C. P. (1925), provides: \u201cThe Court of Criminal Appeals shall have appellate jurisdiction co-extensive with the limits of the State in all criminal cases. This article shall not be so construed as to embrace any case which has been appealed from any inferior court to the county court or county court at law, in which the fine imposed by the county court or county court at law shall not exceed one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">Where the fine imposed on a trial de novo in the county court in a case appealed from an inferior court does not exceed one hundred dollars it has been the uniform holding that the judgment of the county court is final and no appeal lies therefrom to this court.
