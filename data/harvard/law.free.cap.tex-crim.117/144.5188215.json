He said that the transaction took place on the public square in Hamilton after dark, and fixed the time between 8:30 and 9:00 o\u2019clock. Appellant denied the transaction, and testified he went home before dark and was not on the streets of Hamilton at the time the witness claimed he bought the whisky from him. He said he was at home in bed when some parties came by to get him to go to a neighbor\u2019s to a party. He testified further that he met the State\u2019s witness, Williams, at the party, and that Williams was in a drunken condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">The court declined to respond to appellant\u2019s exception to the failure of the charge to embody an instruction covering the law of alibi. The State\u2019s attorney admits that the issue was raised, and confesses error. That appellant\u2019s testimony raised the issue is obvious. Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, sec. 55; Anderson v.
