The use of the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d is indispensable in charging theft under our statute. Byrd v. State, 89 Texas Crim. Rep., 371, 231 S. W., 399; Prim v. State, 32 Texas, 158; Conner v. State, 6 Texas App., 455; Young v. State, 12 Texas App., 614; Muldrew v. State, 12 Texas App., 617; Sloan v. State, 18 Texas App., 225; Ortis v. State, 18 Texas App., 282; Ware v. State, 19 Texas App., 13; Chance v. State, 27 Texas App., 441, 11 S. W., 457; Doxey v. State (Tex. Sup.), 12 S. W., 412; Watt v. State, 61 Texas Crim. Rep., 662, 136 S. W., 56; Baldwin v. State, 76 Texas Crim. Rep., 499, 175 S. W., 701; Newman v. State, 113 Texas Crim. Rep., 517, 23 S. W. (2d) 367. In Byrd v. State, supra, it was held that an allegation that the appellant \u201cdid unlawfully take, steal and carry away\u201d was not equivalent to an averment that, he \u201cdid then and there fraudulently take,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The judgment is reversed and .the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">on state\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b597-8\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">\u2014 From the supplemental transcript filed in connection with the State\u2019s motion for rehearing, it is made to appear that in copying the indictment in the transcript the clerk, by inadvertance, omitted the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d which was, in fact, embraced in the indictment. The record, as corrected, eliminates the fault upon which the order reversing the case and ordering a dismissal was based. From the corrected record it is shown that the indictment in appropriate language charged that the appellant did \u201cunlawfully and <em>fraudulently </em>take one head of cattle,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">No bills of exception are found in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The contention is made that the proof fails to support the allegation in the indictment that the property was in the possession of Dr. A. Carmichael. Reference is made to the opinion in the case of Haney v. State, 117 Texas Crim. Rep., 560, 36 S. W. (2d) 1033, (delivered Feb. 25, 1931) for a discussion of the question. The testimony touching the matter of variance is the same as that set forth in the opinion last mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The State\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted, the judgment of reversal and order of dismissal are set aside, and the judgment of the trial court is now affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">\n<em>Granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
