The sentence is similarly worded. There is no such offense as the mere possession of a still. Appellant was indicted and tried for the possession of a still for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor. The judgment and sentence will be reformed to conform to the indictment and the charge of the court, and appellant is adjudged guilty of the possession of a still for the manufacture of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">As thus reformed, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
