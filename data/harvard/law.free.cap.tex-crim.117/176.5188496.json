Unless appellant possessed the intoxicating liquor for the purpose of sale, his possession thereof did not offend against the laws of Texas. (Rev. St., Sec. 5075). Moore v. State, 112 Texas Crim. Rep., 142, 15 S. W. (2d) 617. The recognizance is fatally defective in failing to show that appellant has been convicted of an offense. When the accused is at large, this court is without jurisdiction in the absence of a proper recognizance or appeal bond. Moore v.
