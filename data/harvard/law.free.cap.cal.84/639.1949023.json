The evidence on the point consists of two affidavits, one by plaintiff, and the other by the juror whose intoxication is alleged. Plaintiff states in his affidavit that the trial of the case occupied several days; that the jurors were allowed to separate at all recesses; that \"affiant is informed and believes, and so charges the truth to be,\u201d that, during each and every recess, the said juror \u201cdrank to great excess intoxicating drinks\u201d; that \u201cas affiant is informed and believes, at the time the jury were charged by the court, and during their deliberations, the said juror was incompetent, from intoxication, to comprehend and discharge his duties as a juror\u201d; and that affiant did not learn or know these facts \u201c until after said jury had retired to deliberate on their verdict.\u201d The affidavit of the juror fully and specifically and positively denies all the charges of intoxication. And if we are to consider only the evidence introduced on the issue, the order denying the new trial should certainly be affirmed, because there is not only a conflict of evidence, but the evidence clearly preponderates against the allegation of intoxication. But the judge of the court below, when denying the motion for a new trial, stated, in writing, as follows: \u201cThat the juror was intoxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>cuted must be conceded. The court must take judicial notice of the fact. It was patent to all parties.\u201d He then proceeds to give as his reason for denying the new trial, that as nine jurors may render a verdict in a civil case, and as ten united in a verdict for defendant in the case at bar, therefore the verdict was valid, because it was concurred ij by the requisite number, not counting the juror charged with intoxication. (This, we suppose, was on the theory that if nine sober jurors cannot be prevented from rendering a verdict by three other sober jurors, they ought not to be so prevented by one drunken juror.) Respondent contends that this statement is mere \u201copinion\u201d of the court below, and under well-settled practices cannot be considered here; and appellant contends that as it was included in the order denying the motion, it may be considered. Under any view, it would be going very far to hold what a judge may say in passing on a motion for a new trial as <em>establishing a fact. </em>At all events, if what he said is to be taken for that purpose, the <em>whole </em>of it must be so taken; and we must then take as true that part of it which states that the intoxication of the juror \u201cwas apparent to all parties.\u201d If, then, the intoxication, which plaintiff avers to have commenced at the beginning of the trial, and continued to its close, was apparent to him, he could not keep quiet on the subject take the chances of a favorable verdict, and then avail himself of it for the first time after defeat. And it may be remarked as somewhat surprising that if this juror was so manifestly and prominently intoxicated during the whole trial that the court had to \u201ctake judicial notice of the fact,\u201d no one \u2014 neither court nor party nor attorney \u2014 made any objection to his well-known condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Sharpstein, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Works, J., concurring. \u2014 I concur in the judgment, on the ground that the evidence as to the drunkenness of the juror was conflicting, and the statement of the judge of the court below that he was intoxicated is no evidence of the fact, and cannot be considered by this eourt for any such purpose.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
