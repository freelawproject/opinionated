The court below, upon the evidence offered by the plaintiff, granted the motion of nonsuit made by the defendant. From the judgment thereupon rendered, and an order denying a new trial, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The facts of the case are, that the two parties to the action entered into a contract, which is as follows: \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201c This agreement, made and entered into this twenty-second day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven, between J.

Boardman, County Clerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-15\">\u201c By Robert Edgar, Deputy Clerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">On the 12th of September, 1887, the plaintiff notified the defendant in writing that he rescinded the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and he demanded back the nine hundred dollars, which, under the terms of the contract, had been paid over and designated as \u201c a forfeit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Up to that time neither the plaintiff had tendered the payment of the balance of the purchase-money, nor the defendant a deed, etc., to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Upon this, the defendant failing to pay back the deposit, the plaintiff institutes this action. The defendant answered and filed a cross-complaint, the object of which last was to force the plaintiff to comply specifically with the contract, and pay the balance of the purchase-money upon the defendant\u2019s making a good and sufficient conveyance of title, etc., to the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The court below seems to have decided against the defendant on his cross-complaint, evidently upon the theory that he could not enforce a mutual and dependent covenant of the plaintiff without having on his, the defendant\u2019s, part, tendered a deed at the date fixed in the contract, and demanded payment of the installment due, but does not seem to have determined anything with reference to the right of the plaintiff to recover back the nine hundred dollars sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Neither the balance of the purchase-money was tendered on the sixth day of September, 1887, by the plaintiff, or a deed by the defendant, or demand made of payment of the installment due. So far, then, as the further carrying out of the agreement was concerned, time being of the essence of the contract, each side had neglected to perform its part of the agreement necessary to consummate the contract, and it was at an end. The plaintiff could not be forced to pay the balance of the purchase-money, as no deed had been tendered him or installment due demanded. <em>(Bohall </em>v. Diller, 41 Cal. 535.) The defendant was no longer obliged to make a deed to the premises conveying a good and sufficient title, as the balance of the purchase-money was not tendered <em>(Englander </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>41 Cal. 421); so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>material question is left to be determined, whether or not the plaintiff, upon this state of facts, is entitled to recover from the defendant, as money in his hands held for plaintiff\u2019s use, the nine hundred dollars which he deposited with the defendant on the inception of the contract as <em>\u201c </em>a forfeit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">. Time was undoubtedly of the essence of the contract, under the rule l-dd down in <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Tubbs, </em>43 Cal. 364, in construing such a contract as the one in hand. In that case this covenant was contained in the contract: \u201cIn the event of failure to comply with the terms hereof by the party of the second part [the purchaser], the party of the first part shall be released from all obligations, in law or equity, to convey said .property, and said party of the second part shall forfeit all right thereto.\u201d In the present case the language is: \u201cIn the event of a failure to comply with the terms hereof by the said party of the second part [the purchaser], the said party of the first part shall be released from all obligations, in law or equity, to convey said property, and said party of the second part shall forfeit all right thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Tubbs, </em>43 Cal. 364, it was said of the language above quoted from the contract construed in that case: \u201cIt would be difficult to express with greater clearness and certainty than the parties did in this contract that time is of the essence of the contract, except it were done by the insertion of those very words in the instrument. Courts of equity have not the power to make contracts for parties, nor to alter those which the parties have deliberately made; and whenever it appears that the parties have <em>in fact </em>contracted that if the purchaser make default in the payments as agreed upon, he shall not be entitled to a conveyance, and shall lose the benefit of his purchase, and -when it also appears that the purchaser is without excuse for his delay, the courts will not relieve him. from the consequences of his default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Forfeitures, as such, are not favored by the courts, and are never enforced if they are couched in ambiguous terms. It is not perfectly certain what the intentions of the parties to this contract were with reference to the nine hundred dollars paid as <em>a forfeit, </em>but construing it with reference to the second clause of the agreement, which we have quoted, and compared with that contained in <em>Grey </em>v. <em>Tubbs, supra, </em>it appears as if it was intended to be in the nature of liquidated damages, if the purchaser should fail, after the contemporaneous tender of a deed to him of the land, and demand of payment of the installment due, etc., to comply with his part of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Now, as both parties have failed to comply with their part of the agreement, and, as we have seen, time being of the essence of the contract, the contract is at, an end, the nine hundred dollars remain in the hands of the defendant as money had and received from the plaintiff] subject to be recovered by the plaintiff, less the amount of damages which the defendant may show for the failure of the plaintiff to complete the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The agreements of the parties were reciprocal, and to be performed, or offered to be performed, contemporaneously at a certain stated time. Both have failed to offer to perform; and if any damage has been donp by the plaintiff, the defendant may recoup for it in an action brought to recover the nine hundred dollars, which reverts to the plaintiff as money held by the defendant for his use. The pleadings as they now stand do not admit of this determination, but the defendant, on a retrial, may reform his pleading so as to raise that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">We perceive no error in the ruling of the court upon the introduction of the judgment roll in the matter of the cross-complaint. It did not tend to show any determination of the question as to what was to become of the nine hundred dollars, designated as \u201ca forfeit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The other points raised it is unnecessary to notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>but, for the reasons above given, we advise that the judgment and order be reversed, with leave to the defendant, within a reasonable time, to frame his pleading as heretofore indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Gibson, C., and Vanclief, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The Court. \u2014 For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the judgment and order are reversed, with leave to the defendant within a reasonable time to frame his pleading as indicated therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
