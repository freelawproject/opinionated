D. 1888, at the said county of San Diego, did, with intent to defraud one W. T. Cottier, falsely make, alter, forge, and counterfeit a certain bill of sale and writing obligatory, said instrument being in the following words and figures, to wit: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cNo. 504.

Carey Harrold, well knowing that the said instrument was false, altered, forged, and counterfeited, and with the intent to defraud some person unknown to this grand jury, did, at the county and state aforesaid, utter, publish, and pass as true and genuine the instrument aforesaid, by offering the said instrument for record, at the office of the county recorder of the county and state aforesaid, and then and there causing the same to be recorded as a record in said office, contrary to the form, force, and effect of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the people of the state of California.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-13\">The court sustained the demurrer, on the ground that the indictment states two offenses.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-14\"><em>Attorney-General Johnson, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-15\"><em>J. </em>M. <em>Lucas, </em>and <em>W. R. Guy, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-16\">Fox, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIO\"><em>In People </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>28 Cal. 513, it was held that \u201c where a statute enumerates a series of acts, either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of which separately, or all together, may constitute the offense, all of such acts may be charged in a single count, for the reason that, notwithstanding each act may, by itself, constitute the offense, all of them together do no more, and likewise constitute but one and the same offense.\u201d To the same effect is <em>People </em>v. <em>De la Guerra, </em>31 Cal. 459, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>35 Cal. 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It follows that the allegation in this indictment of each one of the series of acts named in the statute, either one of which would constitute the crime of forgery, is not the allegation of two offenses, because all constitute but the single crime, under section 470 of the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">But the court below probably held that the indictment charged two offenses, because, in the latter part thereof, the pleader charges the defendant with having offered \u201cthe said instrument for record at the office of the county recorder of the county and state aforesaid, and then and there causing the same to be recorded as a record in said office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The instrument purports to be an assignment of an \u25a0 interest in certain letters patent for an invention. There is no law authorizing the recording of such an instrument in the office of the county recorder, or making it a public record when so recorded. Section 1160 of the Civil Code, cited by respondent, has no application. It relates only to the recording of letters patent affecting the title or possession of real property. Section 115 of the Penal Code, which makes it a felony to procure to be recorded a false or forged instrument, makes it so only when the instrument, if genuine, might be filed, registered, or recorded under the law of the state. As this instrument, if genuine, would not be entitled to be recorded under the law of the state, it was not a felony to offer it for record, or to cause or procure it to be recorded, and it leaves but the one offense charged by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>indictment,\u2014that of forgery. All the matter about recording is mere surplusage, and may be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The material portions of this indictment are in the language of the statute, and are sufficient. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>61 Cal. 366; <em>People </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>77 Cal. 445; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>80 Cal. 209; <em>People </em>v. <em>Keeley, </em>80 Cal. 212.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Judgment reversed, and case remanded, with instructions to overrule the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Paterson, J., and Works, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
