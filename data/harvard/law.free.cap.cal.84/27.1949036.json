It seems that the estate is thus substantially and fairly brought into court through its legal representative.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Id. \u2014 Appearance by Attorney \u2014 Recital in Judgment \u2014 Appeal \u2014\u25a0 Judgment Roll. \u2014If the judgment in such action recites that the defendants appeared by attorney, who was present upon the trial thereof, such recital must be taken as <em>prima fade </em>true, upon an appeal from the judgment, if there is nothing in the record to show the contrary; and such appearance on behalf of the administrator of the estate is equivalent to personal service of summons and complaint upon him. Such recital is not inconsistent with or overcome by the failure of the judgment roll to show such appearance. The code does not require the appearance of an attorney, to be made part of the judgment roll, and it is no proper part of the record upon appeal therefrom.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-5\">Id. \u2014 Amendment of Complaint \u2014 Appeal \u2014 Parenthetical Statement \u2022 in Transcript \u2014 Judgment Roll. \u2014 The fact that the printed record upon appeal from the judgment in such action contains a parenthetical statement that the complaint was amended by changing \u201c executor \u201d to \u201c administrator \u201d cannot be considered, if such statement is no part of the judgment roll or of the record in the case; nor would such fact, if properly authenticated, make any difference if the administrator appeared by attorney after the amendment, whether served with the amended complaint or not.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-6\">Judgments \u2014 Recitals \u2014 Collateral and Direct Attack \u2014 Appeal \u2014 Presumptions. \u2014 The main difference between collateral and direct attacks upon a judgment, in respect of the judgment and its recitals, is, that upon collateral attack the record alone can be inspected, and it is conclusively presumed to be correct, while on direct attack the true facts may be shown in contradiction of the record, and thus the judgment itself on appeal may be reversed or modified. But the judgment and its recitals will be presumed to be correct upon appeal, unless the contrary is made to appear. All presumptions not contradicted by or inconsistent with the record upon an appeal from a judgment are in favor of its correctness.'</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b56-7\">Appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court of the city and county of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">The facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-9\"><em>R.

Patrick Cunningham in bis individual capacity, and also Patrick Cunningham as a representative of the estate of May Cunningham, deceased, were made parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>defendant. The complaint charges Cunningham as \u201cadministrator\u201d of the estate, and the summons is directed to him as \u201c executor.\u201d The affidavit of service of summons shows that he was served as administrator. A default was entered against him as \u201cexecutor.\u201d Afterward, Roach succeeded Cunningham as administrator, and was substituted as defendant, and he appeals from the judgment in favor of plaintiff. His main point is, that the judgment against Cunningham as representative of the estate is void, because the summons and default name him as executor, while the complaint and judgment are against him as administrator. If we were compelled to decide this extremely technical point, we would be inclined to hold that the estate was substantially and fairly brought into court through its legal representative, and that the mistake or inadvertence by which he was called in some \u00abof the papers executor, and in others administrator, was not fatal to the default. But it is not necessary to determine this point, because the judgment recites that the defendants, \u201cafter service of summons, regularly appeared in said action by Robert Ash, Esq., an attorney of the court, who also was present on the trial thereof.\u201d This appearance was equivalent to personal service of summons and complaint. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 416; <em>Ghiradelli v.Greene, </em>56 Cal. 629.) The code does not require such appearance to be made part of the judgment roll; and as appellant appeals upon the judgment roll alone, which shows nothing contradictory of or inconsistent with said recital, it must be taken as at least <em>prima facie </em>true. All presumptions not contradicted by or inconsistent with the record are in favor of the correctness of the judgment. <em>(Parker v. Altschul, </em>60 Cal. 380.) The doctrine of <em>Lick </em>v. <em>Stockdale, </em>18 Cal. 219, <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>9 Cal. 315, and kindred cases, have been modified only with respect to those matters which are required to be shown in some part of the record other than the judgment itself. The cases cited by appellant are mostly cases where the recitals were of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>matters required to appear elsewhere in the roll, or which were inconsistent with matters which did thus elsewhere appear. And the main difference between collateral and direct attacks is, that in the former the record alone can be inspected, and is conclusively presumed to be correct; while on direct attack the true facts may be shown, and thus the judgment itself on appeal may be reversed or modified. (See Freeman on Judgments, secs. 124-134, and cases there cited.) But in the case at bar the appellant showed nothing, and offered to show nothing. He comes here on the judgment roll alone, and merely contends that the judgment roll, apart from the judgment itself, does not affirmatively show that appellant appeared by attorney. He does not attempt to show that the recital of appearance is not true. But, as before stated, the code does not require the fact of appearance to be shown by the roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Respondent offered to amend the record by attaching to it a certified copy of a formal written appearance for Cunningham as administrator of the estate, filed in the court below; but, in the first place, such document, not being part of the judgment roll, could not be part of the record here; and in the second place, under the views above expressed, it would not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">(The printed record contains a statement in parenthesis, made by some one, that the complaint was amended by changing \u201cexecutor\u201d to \u201cadministrator\u201d; but this statement is no part of the judgment roll or of the record in this case, and cannot be considered. It would make no difference, however, as the appearance by attorney was afterwards. And this answers appellant\u2019s second point as to the service of the amended complaint.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We think that the averments of the complaint were sufficient, particularly in the absence of a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Thornton, J., Sharpstein, J., Fox, J., and Paterson, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
