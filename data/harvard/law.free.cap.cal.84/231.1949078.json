That he has settled, certified, and filed a bill of exceptions is not controverted by petitioners, but they insist that it is not a correct bill of exceptions, and ask this court to order a reference, in -order that evidence may be taken on that issue. We know of no precedent.for such a proceeding. The writ has accomplished the purpose for which it was issued, and is therefore <em>functus officio. </em>There can be no further proceedings under it. Such being the case, the writ should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Writ discharged and proceeding dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b260-8\">Fox, J., and McFarland, J., concurred.</author>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">Paterson, J., concurring.\u2014I concur. The remedy after a bill has been settled is provided by section 652 of the Code of Civil Procedure. A judge may be compelled to act by mandate, but his discretion cannot be controlled thereby.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
