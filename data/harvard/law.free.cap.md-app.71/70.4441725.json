Usually asking for and receiving a trial by jury is not a ground for appeal. Yet, when the request is made of a juvenile court, a forum where jury trials are not held, does the grant of the request constitute reversible error? Other issues raised by one or both of the appellants \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d from an attack on the constitutionality of Md. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) to questioning the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">THE FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The appellants, Jeannette L. (Mrs. L.) and Shirley P. (Mrs. P.) have several things in common: Each is the mother of school-age children; each was charged in the juvenile court with violating the State\u2019s Education Article in that the children did not attend school regularly; each demanded and received a jury trial in the juvenile court of Prince George\u2019s County; each was convicted by the jury and ultimately received suspended fines and sentences; each was placed on probation, and each appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The record reflects that at the time of trial Mrs. L.\u2019s daughters were twelve and ten years old, respectively. The older daughter was absent from school 86.5 days between September 11, 1985, and April 25, 1986. The younger daughter was absent from school 70 days between October 8, 1985, and April 28, 1986. Mrs. L. did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"AOD\">Her older daughter told the jury that the reasons she stayed home from school were her grandmother\u2019s death, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>her great-aunt\u2019s hospitalization, her own hospitalization because of mononucleosis and her subsequent recuperation, rumors being spread at school about the reason for her hospitalization, and a rash and welts on her arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The younger daughter related to the jurors that she missed school because she helped her terminally ill grandfather, was hospitalized for a hip infection, had various sicknesses and colds, and could not get to school when the bus did not stop for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Mrs. P. also has two daughters. The daughters are eleven months apart in age. Nevertheless, on the trial date they were both fifteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Mrs. P. testified that the reasons for the daughters\u2019 nonattendance at school were her state of health, lack of cooperation from her children, and her inability to control their conduct. She also said that her daughters were often sick, citing such ailments as a sore mouth after having a cavity filled, a cut finger, and earaches. She permitted the children to stay home since she had no transportation and could not pick them up from school if they wanted to come home at midday.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Mrs. P.\u2019s older daughter was absent from school 71 days between September 1985 and February 22, 1986. Her younger daughter, during the same time frame, was absent 76 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The petitions that were filed in the juvenile court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the two women alleged that each of them did:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">\u201ca. induce or attempt to induce ... a child subject to the compulsory attendance law of the State as defined in Section 7-101 [sic] of the Education Article of the Anno<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tated Code of Maryland, to be unlawfully absent from school on [a stated number of days].<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">b. employ or harbor ... a child subject to the compulsory attendance law of the State as defined in Section 7-301 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, thereby causing the child to be unlawfully absent from school on [a stated number of days].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">c. From [a given date to another given date] have control over ..., a child who was six (6) years or older and under sixteen (16) years of age and who is subject to the compulsory attendance laws of the State as defined in Section 7-301 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and failed to see that the child attended school or received instruction____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Mrs. L. and Mrs. P. were tried separately. Each moved for a jury trial. Over the State\u2019s objection, the trial judge granted the motion and empaneled a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Mrs. P. was found by the jury to be guilty of count c, \u201chav[ing] control over ... [but] failpng] to see that the child attended school or received instruction.\u201d She was sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and serve fifty days in the County Detention Center. The fine and jail term were suspended, and Mrs. P. was placed on supervised probation for two years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The jury determined that Mrs. L. was guilty of counts b and c. She was fined $750 for each count and sentenced to concurrent terms of seventy-five days in the County Detention Center. The jail term and fine were suspended, and she was placed on probation for five years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Immediately prior to the imposition of sentence, defense counsel informed the court that the jury trial demands made by Mrs. L. and Mrs. P. should not have been granted. Counsel asserted that when he asked for a jury trial he expected the case to be transferred to the district court, which had concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge observed, as do we, that there currently are no jury trials conducted in the district court. The judge declined to strike the verdict and suggested that appeals be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In this Court Mrs. L. has fired a scatter gun at the proceeding in and judgment of the juvenile court. She puts eight questions to us. Mrs. P. has advanced five issues. Some of the matters posed by the two appellants, not surprisingly, are concerned with the same facts and law. We shall, therefore, divide the issues into three categories, i.e., joint, Mrs. L.\u2019s, and Mrs. P.\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">JOINT ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"Alv\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\n<em>Are the judgments of the circuit court, sitting as a juvenile court, invalid because the appellants were tried by a jury?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The appellants aver that the trial court lacked the authority to permit a jury trial. To support their position, the appellants point to Md.Rule 910(a) and to the opinion in the case of <em>In re: Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 255 A.2d 419 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Maryland Rule 910(a) provides in clear and unambiguous language that hearings conducted by a juvenile court <em>\u201cshall be ... without a jury.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The Court of Appeals, speaking through Judge Singley, said in <em>Johnson, </em>254 Md. at 531, 255 A.2d at 426:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201c[T]his Court long has recognized that in Maryland \u2018juvenile courts are courts of equity for juvenile causes\u2019 having \u2018the power and full right to decide without a jury every question of law and fact which may arise out of the subject matter before it and over which it has jurisdiction....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Court further commented that if jury trials are to be part of the juvenile court system the Legislature will have to so provide. <em>Johnson </em>was decided more than seventeen years ago, and thus far the General Assembly has not required trial by jury in cases over which the juvenile court exercises jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Courts Art., \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 to 3-835.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Two years after <em>Johnson </em>the Supreme Court decided <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971). Justice Blackmun, writing for the plurality, remarked that \u201ctrial by jury in the juvenile court\u2019s adjudicative range is not a constitutional requirement.\u201d 403 U.S. at 545, 91 S.Ct. at 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The plurality of the high court reasoned that a trial by jury would \u201cremake the juvenile proceeding into a fully adversary process and ... put an effective end to what has been ... an ... informal protective process.\u201d 403 U.S. at 545, 91 S.Ct. at 1986. Justice Blackmun penned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cSince <em>[In re] Gault </em>[387 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) and since <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) ] the great majority of States, in addition to Pennsylvania and North Carolina, that have faced the issue have concluded that the considerations that led to the result in those two cases do not compel trial by jury in the juvenile court. <em>In re Fucini, </em>44 Ill.2d 305, 255 N.E.2d 380 (1970); <em>Bible v. State, </em>[253] Ind. [373], 254 N.E.2d 319 (1970); <em>Dryden v. Commonwealth, </em>435 S.W.2d 457 (Ky.1968); <em>In re Johnson, </em>254 Md. 517, 255 A.2d 419 (1969); <em>Hopkins v.

To the contrary are <em>Peyton v. Nord, </em>78 N.M. 717, 437 P.2d 716 (1968), and, <em>semble, Nieves v. United States, </em>280 F.Supp. 994 (SDNY 1968).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">403 U.S. at 549, 91 S.Ct. at 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">A reading of the federal and state cases makes it unmistakable that a juvenile offender is not entitled to a jury trial in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Prior to 1984, the only offense for which an adult could be charged in the juvenile court was that of contributing to a child\u2019s delinquency, a need for supervision, or a need for assistance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Courts Art., \u00a7 3-831.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Whenever an adult is charged under Courts Art., \u00a7 3-831, he or she is entitled to move for a waiver of jurisdiction and, as a matter of right, have the case sent to the appropriate court. Courts Art., \u00a7 3 \u2014 804(c); Md.Rule 913 f.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ute and rule were designed to afford jury trials to adults. That right is, however, limited to offenses arising out of alleged violations of Courts Art., \u00a7 3-831.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Until 1984 Md.Laws Ch. 664, no problem existed with respect to adults and their right to demand a waiver to a criminal court where they could, if they chose, have a trial by jury. Because the penalty prescribed for violation of Courts Art., \u00a7 3-831 is substantial, a trial by jury, is required, if demanded. Courts Art., \u00a7 3-804(c) and Rule 913 f are but recognition of that right. <em>See </em>generally, <em>Huebner v. District Court, </em>62 Md.App. 462, 490 A.2d 266 (1985), a<em>ff'd, State v. Huebner, </em>305 Md. 601, 505 A.2d 1331 (1986) ; <em>see also Fisher v. State, </em>305 Md. 357, 504 A.2d 626 (1986); <em>Kawamura v. State, </em>299 Md. 276, 473 A.2d 438 (1984). No other type of what is normally considered a \u201ccriminal offense\u201d was punishable by the juvenile court except possibly criminal contempt. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 572, 320 A.2d 538 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>272 Md. 749 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The Legislature in 1984 Md.Laws Ch. 664 added to Courts Art., \u00a7 3-804, paragraph (d), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cThe jurisdiction of the court is concurrent with that of the District Court in any criminal case arising under the compulsory public school attendance laws of this State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>That paragraph confers upon a prosecutor the absolute discretion to determine whether an adult who is accused of violating the compulsory public school attendance laws is to be charged in the district court or juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Neither appellant has attacked the constitutionality of Courts Art., \u00a7 3-804(d), and we express no opinion as to its validity. <em>But see </em>72 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. No. 87-006 (February 10, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>the constitutionality of Courts Art., \u00a7 3-804(d), it becomes readily apparent that the juvenile court had subject matter jurisdiction over the offenses charged because the Legislature so provided. 1984 Md. Laws Ch. 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The question then before us becomes not one of the jurisdiction of the juvenile court but rather its authority procedurally to conduct a jury trial. As interesting as that question may be, we do not decide it because the appellants have by their acts waived their right to raise the issue. <em>Lohss v. State, </em>272 Md. 113, 321 A.2d 534 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">In <em>Lohss, </em>a circuit court had ruled that a search was illegal. Consequently, the State was prevented from introducing evidence derived from the search. Lohss then moved to dismiss the charges, and the State agreed, declaring it had \u201cno objection\u201d to that dismissal. The State then moved to dismiss a co-defendant on the ground that, absent the \u201csuppressed evidence,\u201d it was unable to proceed. The co-defendant, understandably, interposed no objection to the State\u2019s motion. On appeal by the State this Court reversed. <em>State v. Lohss, </em>19 Md.App. 489, 313 A.2d 87 (1973). The Court of Appeals disagreed with our decision, reversed it, and reinstated the dismissal of the indictments. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">\u201c[T]he right of appeal may be lost by waiver or estoppel when there is acquiescence or recognition in the validity of the decision from which the appeal is taken or by otherwise taking a position inconsistent with the right of appeal, <em>see Rocks v. Brosius, supra, </em>241 Md. [612] at 630 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>[217 A.2d 531 (1966) ]. Nor can one appeal from a judgment or order where the relief he prays for is granted. <em>Adm\u2019r, Motor Veh. Adm. v. Vogt </em>[267 Md. 660, 299 A.2d 1 (1973) ], <em>supra; Wright v. Baker, </em>197 Md. 315, 318, 79 A.2d 159 (1951); <em>Mugford v. City of Baltimore, </em>185 Md. 266, 269, 44 A.2d 745, 162 A.L.R. 1101 (1945).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">272 Md. at 118, 321 A.2d 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Mrs. L. and Mrs. P. demanded and received a jury trial. By so doing they acquiesced in and recognized the validity of that form of trial. It is with ill grace that they now complain they should not have gotten that for which they asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\"><em>Lohss </em>is absolutely dispositive of the matter. Any error in granting a jury trial was waived by the appellants\u2019 being the movants in that seemingly procedural aberration.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">\n<em>Is Md.Educ.Code Ann. \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) constitutional?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The Maryland compulsory public school attendance statute, Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(c), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201cEach person who has under his control a child who is 6 years old or older and under 16 shall see that the child attends school or receives instruction as required by this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The penalties for noncompliance with the statute are stated in Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">\u201c(1) Any person who induces or attempts to induce a child to absent himself unlawfully from school or employs or harbors any child who is absent unlawfully from school while school is in session is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a fine not to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">(2) Any person who has control over a child who is 6 years old or older and under 16 who fails to see that the child attends school or receives instruction under this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>subject to a fine not to exceed $50 per day of unlawful absence or imprisonment not to exceed 10 days, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">(3) As to any sentence imposed under this section, the court may suspend the fine or the prison sentence and establish terms and conditions which would promote the child\u2019s attendance. The suspension authority provided for in this subsection is in addition to and not in limitation of the suspension authority under Article 27, Section 641A of the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The constitutional challenge is bottomed on the alleged vagueness of the penalty provisions of \u00a7 7-301(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Appellants assert that subsection (2) of \u00a7 7-301(e) fails to specify what persons are subject to its provisions. The statute as written, the appellants aver, might be applied to any school bus driver who permits a child to alight from the bus before it arrives at the school itself. That argument places the proverbial cart before the well-known and shopworn horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Bowers v. State, </em>283 Md. 115, 122, 389 A.2d 341, 346 (1978), through Judge Levine, made transpicuous that the constitutionality of a statute attacked on the ground of vagueness is \u201cdetermined strictly on the basis of the statute\u2019s application to the particular facts at hand.\u201d (Citations omitted.) It is \u201cimmaterial that the statute is of questionable applicability in foreseeable marginal situations, if a contested provision clearly applies to the conduct of the defendant in a specific case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>United States v. Petrillo, </em>332 U.S. 1, 7, 67 S.Ct. 1538, 1542, 91 L.Ed. 1877, 1883 (1947). <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S.Ct. 316, 320, 46 L.Ed.2d 228, 234 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The trilogy of <em>Bowers, Powell, </em>and <em>Petrillo </em>makes clear that we must consider the vagueness issue only in respect to the appellants\u2019 cases. The statute obviously applies to the appellants, inasmuch as they fit within the ambit of Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(a). Since the statute is manifestly applicable to the appellants, it is immaterial whether it applies to a school bus driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The appellants further contend that the statute fails to indicate whether a single absence from school is sufficient to trigger the provisions of \u00a7 7-301(e)(2). Moreover, they ask what constitutes attending school \u201cregularly.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Because in these two appeals it is apparent that the children of the appellants were absent from school for substantial periods of time, the appellants need not puzzle over whether the act applies to a single absence. Irrespective of how one reads the statute, the extensive unexcused absences of the appellants\u2019 children are embraced within its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>Bowers </em>declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201cA statute is not vague when the meaning of the words in controversy can be fairly ascertained by reference to judicial determinations, the common law, dictionaries, treatises or even the words themselves, if they possess a common and generally accepted meaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">283 Md. at 125, 389 A.2d 341. If read out of context, Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) appears to permit prosecution of any parent who fails to see that his or her child attends school on any given day. When \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) is read together with \u00a7 7-301(a), however, it is perspicuous that the former applies only when a child is not \u201cregularly\u201d attending school. Therefore, the parent whose child fails to attend school on one day is not subject to prosecution so long as the child attends the school \u201cregularly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Next, appellants asseverate that Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(b) is vague because it does not provide adequate guidance as to what constitutes a legitimate excuse for an absence. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>county superintendent, school principal, or an individual authorized by the county superintendent or principal may <em>excuse </em>a student for a <em>necessary absence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">There may be cases in which it might be difficult to prove that a particular absence from school was not necessary. The instant matters, however, are not included with that class of cases. We have already recounted the appellants\u2019 daughters\u2019 reasons for missing school. Needless to say, they were neither excused nor excusable.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Albeit we leave the question to school authorities of what is excusable absence, we surmise that a \u201cnecessary absence\u201d would, among others, encompass a death in the family, a serious illness or injury, or some emergency situation clearly mandating the child\u2019s absence from school.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Appellants\u2019 final vagueness assault on the statute advances the argument that Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) imposes \u201cstrict liability\u201d on the appellants for actions of a third party, their children, who \u201cmay or may not be subject to the control of the accused.\u201d We have an entirely different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The statute does not subject a parent to prosecution for the actions of his or her children, but it does sanction prosecution for the parent\u2019s own acts. Before a person may be found guilty of violating \u00a7 7-301(e)(2), the court must find: 1) the person had control over the child and 2) failed to see that the child attended school regularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">The statute imposes an affirmative duty on persons who have control over a child over age six but under age sixteen. That duty is to assure that the child attends school regularly. Failure to perform that duty is a violation of the statute. Passive acquiescence in the child\u2019s nonattendance of school is no defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">We hold Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) is not void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\n<em>Did the trial judge commit \u201cplain error\u201d in not instructing the jury as to the elements of an offense under Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2)?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Appellants concede, as they must, that no objection was made to the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury relative to the elements of an offense allegedly committed in violation of Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2). Nevertheless, appellants ask that we hold that the judge committed \u201cplain error\u201d in not so instructing.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Our review of the instructions indicates that appellants are laying a \u201csmoke screen.\u201d The judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cIf you find that the defendant was the parent or guardian of a child subject to the compulsory attendance law of the State of Maryland, then you must place upon the defendant the duty imposed by law: Each person who has <em>under his or her control </em>a child who is six years old or older, and under sixteen <em>shall see that the child attends school </em>or receives instruction as required by this statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">So, if you find that the defendant is a person who has these children under her control, then she has a responsibility of either seeing that they go to the public school system, or that they received education they would have received in the public school system, at some other location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">The child must not have attended school on a regular basis for you to find the defendant guilty of violating the statute. And, these excessive absences must not be excused, [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">The statute defines excused absences as, a county superintendent, school principal, or an individual authorized by the county superintendent or principal may excuse a student for a necessary absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the parent or guardian of a child under her control subject to the compulsory attendance laws of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Maryland, and that the child has excessive, or unexcused absences, and the defendant did not see that the child regularly attended school, you must find the defendant guilty of this statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">These instructions adequately covered the law. There was, as we see it, no error, much less \u201cplain error,\u201d material to the rights of the accused. Md.Rule 4-325(e); <em>Sine v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 628, 394 A.2d 1206 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\n<em>Were illegal sentences imposed on the appellants?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Mrs. L., as we have previously noted, was found guilty of two counts of violating Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(1) and two counts of violating Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2). The maximum penalty that may be meted to an offender for violating \u00a7 7-301(e)(l) is a fine \u201cnot to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days or both.\u201d The maximum penalty for violating \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) is \u201ca fine not to exceed $50 per day of unlawful absence or imprisonment not to exceed 10 days, or both.\u201d The juvenile court, however, imposed four concurrent fines of $750 and four concurrent jail terms of 75 days. The sentences and fines were suspended. Mrs. L. was placed on probation under certain terms and conditions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">With respect to the violations of Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(1) it is obvious that the fine exceeds by $250 the maximum imposed by law. The jail sentence also exceeds by 45 days that permitted by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">The sentences with regard to violations of Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) are equally illegal and somewhat perplexing. As to one daughter, the jury found Mrs. L. guilty of count c. That count read, in pertinent part, that Mrs. L. \u201cdid ... from September ... 1985 to April 25, 1986 have control over ... a child ... and failed to see that the child attended school____\u201d With regard to the other daughter, the jury also found Mrs. L. guilty of count c. That count charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>unlawful absence by the daughter from \u201cOctober 8, 1985 to April 28, 1986.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">We are unable to tell whether the jury convicted Mrs. L. of a violation for every day of that period of time or for merely some of those dates. We are certainly unable to state that she was convicted of violating the statute on seventy-five days because there is nothing in that particular count upon which we could predicate that declaration. Patently, there are more than seventy-five school days between the dates specified in counts c.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">There was evidence, if believed, which would have permitted the jury to find that, with respect to the older daughter, Mrs. L. was guilty of violating Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) on 86.5 days. There was also evidence from which the jury could conclude that Mrs. L. violated the statute seventy times as to the younger daughter. The difficulty is that the jury, insofar as count c is concerned, was not asked to determine the number of days of unlawful absence. As we have said, the statute, when read together with \u00a7 7-301(a), requires more than an isolated incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As charged in count c, Mrs. L. is guilty of but one offense. The maximum fine for that offense is $50 or a maximum jail term of ten days or both. Since Mrs. L. was convicted of two separate count c offenses, she could have been sentenced consecutively, which would have resulted in a total fine of $100, a total jail term of twenty days, or both the fine and imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Mrs. P. was convicted of violating \u00a7 7-301(e)(2). She was sentenced to fifty days in jail and fined $500. Both the fine and the jail term were suspended, and she was placed on probation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Section 7-301(e)(2) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201cAny person who ... is ... [convicted] is subject to a fine not to exceed $50 per day of unlawful absence or imprisonment not to exceed 10 days or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The trial judge read the section to mean that a defendant could receive a fine of $50 for each day of unlawful absence <em>and </em>a jail sentence of ten days for each day of unlawful absence or both the fine and the jail sentence. We read the statute somewhat differently. We think the fine may be levied at the rate of $50 per day of unlawful absence, but the provision relating to imprisonment allows but one term of no more than ten days. It is important to note that the words \u201cper day of unlawful absence\u201d precede, not follow, the clause \u201cor imprisonment not to exceed 10 days or both.\u201d Had the Legislature intended that a person convicted of violating \u00a7 7-301(e)(2) was to serve ten days imprisonment for each day of the child\u2019s \u201cunlawful absence\u201d from school, it would have rephrased the penalty to read: \u201ca fine of $50 per day, or imprisonment not to exceed 10 days, or both, for each day of unlawful absence.\u201d The manner in which the statute is worded clearly indicates that the Legislature did not intend the penalty to be as interpreted by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Because the sentences are illegal, we vacate them and remand the cases for imposition of proper sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">MRS. L.\u2019S SEPARATE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">\n<em>Did the trial court err in instructing the jury on the definition of the word \u201charbor\"?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The record indicates that the court instructed the jury with respect to a violation of Educ. Art., \u00a7 7-301(e)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZH\">\u201c[T]he defendant is charged with a violation of Section 7-301 ... (1), which ... [provides] that any person who employs or <em>harbors </em>any child, who is absent unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>from school while school is in session, is guilty of this offense. Therefore, if you find that the defendant employed or <em>harbored </em>any child unlawfully absent from school while school was in session, you must find the defendant guilty of violations of this section of the educational article.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">No exception by appellant was taken to the court\u2019s instructions. During their deliberation, the jury sent a note to the court in which it asked, \u201cMay we please have a better definition of harboring?\u201d After a discussion with the attorneys involved, the judge replied, \u201cThe word used at law has the same meaning as used by lay people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Mrs. L.\u2019s attorney objected to the court\u2019s responding to the jury. Counsel said, \u201cOn the* basis that the Court did not define the word the first time, I will object to any further instruction at this point.\u201d Just before the jury returned to the courtroom to deliver its verdict, Mrs. L.\u2019s counsel, apparently thinking his initial objection to be deficient or out of an abundance of caution, declared, \u201cI think for safety of the record, I will object, just for the record____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Md.Rule 2-520(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">\u201c(e) <em>Objections. </em>\u2014 No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record <em>promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter </em>to which the party objects <em>and the grounds </em>of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Counsel\u2019s objection was directed to the fact that the court had not previously defined the word \u201charbor.\u201d There was no objection to the content of the instruction. There was no claim of error in the instruction. The objection as made does not meet the requirement of Rule 2-520(e), and we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\n<em>Did the Court err in excluding testimony of a defense witness\u2019s state of mind?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">A daughter of Mrs. L. testified that teachers and other students were saying things about the daughter when she returned to school after having been hospitalized. When defense counsel asked the girl to relate what was being said about her, she replied, \u201cI am not really sure what [sic] teachers said this, but they were \u2014 they were going around telling good friends of mine, that when I was in the hospital, I was in there ...\u201d The judge interrupted the testimony, and he said: \u201cYou are asking the witness to say that ... [someone] told her that somebody said something, and that was being offered for the truth, not the words, but that somebody said something ... you are offering it for the truth that a teacher said ... something.\u201d Defense counsel responded in the affirmative. He then added that he would \u201cmake an offer of proof that relates to what this child did upon hearing [the hearsay].\u201d Counsel was permitted to ask the witness, \u201cAs a result [of what you heard others were saying], what effect, if any, did ... [it] have on you?\u201d The daughter responded that \u201cit didn\u2019t affect me.\u201d Defense counsel was able to show the daughter\u2019s state of mind after she heard that people at school had been saying things about her. The child testified that the remarks did not affect her and that she did go to school afterwards. Counsel clearly demonstrated what Mrs. L. now complains she was not able to show.

Furthermore, the issue is largely academic, inasmuch as the sentences were made to run concurrently. In light of the fact that we have vacated the sentences and remanded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>resentencing, defense counsel may opt to raise the issue at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>Did the trial court impose an unlawful condition of probation?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">In light of the fact that we shall vacate the sentences, the conditions of probation are likewise vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">MRS.

As is the fact that appellant was made fully aware of the absences as the result of conferences with school officials as well as letters from the school authorities.
