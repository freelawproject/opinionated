We recognize, of course, that, as an appellate court, we get to view the case from the enviable position of hindsight, and that what may seem to us to be unnecessary overkill may not seem so to the participants in a hotly contested trial. That is why, especially on matters relating to the conduct of the trial and the allowance or disallowance of evidence, we accord considerable deference to discretionary rulings of the trial judge and do not reverse unless there is manifest error. Here, we think, the court allowed the State to go too far, and so we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Appellant was charged with the first degree murder of George Henderson. A jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City acquitted him of that but convicted him of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">There was no question but that he did, in fact, kill Mr. Henderson; through counsel, he conceded that in opening statement. He admitted that, on the evening of September 21, 1985, he was in the 1600 block of Gorsuch Avenue in Baltimore City talking to one or two young ladies when Henderson approached and made some remark to the girls. An argument of sorts followed, whereupon appellant delivered a karate-type kick to Henderson\u2019s head, causing Henderson to fall backward and strike his head on the pavement. Either the kick or the fall caused Henderson to fracture his skull and fatally injure his brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">That appellant was the actor \u2014 the cause of Henderson\u2019s death \u2014 was never an issue at trial. He conceded it in a statement given to the police; counsel conceded it to the jury; an eyewitness to the event positively identified him in court without challenge. Appellant\u2019s sole defense was that he had acted in self-defense \u2014 that Henderson was the aggressor. The story he gave the police, which came into evidence as part of the State\u2019s case, was that Henderson had thrown a bottle at him and had then acted in such manner as to lead appellant to think Henderson was reaching for a weapon. That, said appellant, is when he kicked Henderson \u201conce up around his face\u201d in order \u201cto get him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>to back up off of me.\u201d Counsel told the jury in his opening statement that the evidence would show only \u201cthat during a mutual affray, during a fight, my client kicked this man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The issue, then, was whether appellant\u2019s attack on Mr. Henderson was aggressive, premeditated, malicious, and unjustified, as urged by the State, or defensive, as claimed by appellant. Although appellant elected not to testify, there was evidence to support both views.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The State\u2019s first witness was Patricia Morgan, who had witnessed the episode. She described what had occurred and identified appellant in court as the person who kicked and ultimately killed Mr. Henderson. According to her, the kick was deliberate and unprovoked. No objection was made to her identification of appellant and she was not cross-examined about the accuracy of it. The next witness, Detective Garvey, related the statement appellant had given upon his arrest and also testified that Ms. Morgan had selected appellant\u2019s photograph from an array he had shown her several days after the event. The State then moved into evidence the photographic array, including what is obviously a police \u201cmug shot\u201d of appellant. Despite appellant\u2019s objection based on relevance \u2014 that identification was not an issue \u2014 the court admitted the photographs. Those photographs were not actually shown to the jury, however. At the court\u2019s direction, Xerox copies of the photographs, with the chestplate containing identification numbers covered over, were made and were given to the jury in substitution for the actual photographs. The display of even those somewhat sanitized photographs constitutes appellant\u2019s first claim of error, one which we find to be valid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The Court of Appeals addressed the problems raised by the introduction of police \u201cmug shots\u201d in <em>Straughn v. State, </em>297 Md. 329, 465 A.2d 1166 (1983). Police photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>graphs, on the one hand, are \u201cindependently relevant substantive evidence which may be introduced under certain circumstances,\u201d <em>id., </em>334, 465 A.2d 1166, but they also have the potential for undue prejudice by alerting the jury to the distinct possibility that the defendant has a prior police record, thereby taking on a form of prohibited \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. The Court concluded that the admission of these photographs \u201cis a discretionary matter for the trial court\u201d and that \u201c[i]n the exercise of its discretion, the trial court must balance the probative value of the mug shots against their prejudicial impact on the defendant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The <em>Straughn </em>Court rejected any rigid criteria or litmus test for evaluating the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion, such as had been adopted in <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>490 F.2d 487 (2d Cir.1973), preferring instead to balance \u201call of the factors that might prejudice the defendant.\u201d <em>Id., </em>297 Md. 329, 336, 465 A.2d 1166. Among those factors, however, are those enunciated in <em>Harrington, </em>namely, whether the State had \u201ca demonstrable need to introduce the photographs,\u201d whether the photographs shown to the jury imply a prior criminal record, and whether the manner of introduction draws particular attention to the source or implications of the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">A critical element in any balancing process, of course, is what the <em>Harrington </em>Court referred to as the State\u2019s need for the photographs: were they relevant to any issue in the case; were they merely cumulative to other unimpeached evidence? If the State has no real need to introduce the photographs, there is nothing against which to balance any prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In most cases where police photographs are offered, the identity of the defendant, either as the criminal agent or as a recidivist for enhanced punishment purposes, is at issue, and the photographs are offered to help establish that identity. <em>See </em>Annot., <em>Admissibility, And Prejudicial Effect Of Admission, Of \u201cMug Shot,\" \u201cRogues\u2019 Gallery\" Photograph, Or Photograph Taken In Prison, Of Defendant In Criminal Trial, </em>30 A.L.R.3d 908 (1970). Here, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>we have observed, identity was not in issue. The State had absolutely no need for the photographs \u2014 either the original array or a \u201csanitized\u201d copy of them. They simply were not relevant to any issue that the jury would be asked to decide. The State\u2019s side of the scale, then, has a weight of zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Notwithstanding the court\u2019s effort to ameliorate the prejudicial effect of the photographs, the implication that appellant had prior police contact remained strong. Unlike the situation in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>623 F.2d 339 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>449 U.S. 957, 101 S.Ct. 366, 66 L.Ed.2d 222 (1980), the jury knew that the police had appellant\u2019s photograph <em>before </em>his arrest for this offense and could reasonably infer that, if they included it in an array shown to Ms. Morgan, they had some reason to believe that he was the kind of person who might commit such a crime. Moreover, though \u201cdoctored,\u201d the photographs still showed the front and profile view commonly associated with police \u201cmug shots.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The potential for undue prejudice in this case is more than speculative. With the defense being self-defense, the jury\u2019s decision could well have been influenced by the thought that appellant had a prior record and was consequently a bad person. Indeed, while deliberating on their verdict, they asked that specific question \u2014 \u201cDoes Byron [appellant] have a prior arrest and or conviction record[?]\u201d \u2014which the court declined to answer. In the circumstances of this case, the admission of the police photographs constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Our conclusion on that issue requires a reversal and remand for retrial and thus obviates the need to consider appellant\u2019s other three claims involving alleged trial error. We have considered appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction of manslaughter, however, and find it completely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR NEW TRIAL; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\">. We find no merit to the State\u2019s contention that appellant waived this argument by failing to make a proper objection. He did indeed object to the photographs being shown to the jury in any form.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
