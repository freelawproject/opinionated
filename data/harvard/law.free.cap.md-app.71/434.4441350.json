Article 6, \u00a7 6.2(i) of that ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>nance lists as one of the principal permitted uses under the agricultural classification, \u201cSchools and colleges, including nursery schools or day care centers.\u201d The Circuit Court for Carroll County (Gilmore, J.) ruled that the Home met that definition, reversing a contrary decision by the County Board of Zoning Appeals. We agree with the Circuit Court and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The Raymond I. Richardson Foundation, Inc., a nonprofit charitable organization, operates the Bowling Brook Home for Boys. The Home was established in 1957 on a portion of a 263 acre horse farm owned by the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Home\u2019s current facilities consist of a manor house, an administrative office building, staff living quarters, a maintenance barn, a sports clubhouse, a baseball field and a basketball court. The Foundation\u2019s plans to abandon those facilities and to construct a new expanded physical plant for the Home at another site on the 263 acre tract precipitated this zoning dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Michael Sunday, director of the Home, testified before the Board of Appeals: \u201cBowling Brook Home for Boys is a residential facility that provides educational, counseling, vocational training to young men with troubled backgrounds, ages 15V2 to 18, who have been deemed by the courts to be removed from their home so that we can provide care, assistance and guidance to these young men.\u201d The program at the Home is licensed by the State Juvenile Services Administration and is a highly structured one. Mr. Sunday described the daily regimen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">[TJhey get up at six o\u2019clock in the morning, make their beds, take their showers, prepare themselves for breakfast. A number of the boys also prepare breakfast. After breakfast, the boys go out to a work program from 8 to 12, supervised by one of our staff members. Upon return, at twelve o\u2019clock we have lunch and following lunch, we have on-grounds educational program from one o\u2019clock to four o\u2019clock, which is staffed by a certified teacher from the State of Maryland. From 4:15 to 5:45, an hour and a half, we have a group meeting every day, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>which is used to identify problems, to resolve problems and to have all the young men in the group involved in the helping process with each other. Following the group meeting at 5:45 we move into supper at six o\u2019clock and following supper and the chores around supper, from 7 to 8:30 or 7 to 9, we have a supervised recreational period for these young men. Following the recreational period, we have another group meeting, which we term a riffraff, which is more than say a counseling session. It\u2019s more of a planning session for the following day and that\u2019s from 9 to 10. Following that, there is a short free period for snacks and maybe listening to some music or a game of pool and then they\u2019re in bed by eleven o\u2019clock</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">The average length of stay of residents in the program is five and a half to six months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Sunday pointed out that most of the boys in the Home are boys referred by the Juvenile Services Administration who have been adjudicated delinquent, in need of assistance or in need of supervision by the juvenile courts of this State pursuant to Md. Code (1984 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-801 through 3-835 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. That administration has classified the Home as a \u201cjuvenile care facility \u2014 group home.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Mr. Sunday elaborated on the educational component of the Home\u2019s program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">The educational component, though we only have one certified teacher in the classroom, our group leader who handles the group sessions, is a certified educator. Our vocational supervisor is a Master degree person with an education degree and I feel like not just the classroom but the total program is an educational process. With some young men, for example, that would come into our educational program, we coordinate with the school that they may be targeted to return to, that school will send us materials which [we] will monitor____ [L]ast spring, we had a young man graduate from his high school while he was still in our program, or upon the day after he was released from our program. I think more than anything else, sir, most of our boys have been failures in school and another focus of o\u00far educational program is to whet their appetite for learning and to have them understand that in order for them to be successful out there, they are going to have to learn every day of their lives and if not, they are going to struggle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">[W]hat we do is we have to by State law develop an I.E.P.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is an individual education plan for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>unit, which needs to be reviewed by the case worker, the parents, youth and the people involved with our facility. Also we have an educational coordinator, who is not a paid staff member out of Bowling Brook, but is a member of the Carroll County Board of Education of the public school system, Mr. Larry Weis from the Bowling Brook Service Center. He also oversees and coordinates our educational programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">I feel as far as meeting the State regulations and the certifiable monitoring that the student \u2014 insures that we adhere to \u2014 that we are meeting the time frame for the educational services that we are providing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Mr. Sunday also stressed that \u201c[m]ost of the young men that come to our facility are functioning usually below their grade level in math and reading, and we do a lot of remedial work to try to bring them up to level____\u201d Although only one teacher monitors the daily three hour education session, four members of the Home\u2019s staff are certified teachers who interact with the boys. A vocational program is also a part of the curriculum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>In construing the meaning of a word in a statute, the cardinal rule is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intention. <em>Reid v. State, </em>302 Md. 811, 816, 490 A.2d 1289 (1985); <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. v. Sybert, </em>295 Md. 347, 361, 456 A.2d 20 (1983); <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 388-89, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982); <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 92, 400 A.2d 1091 (1979). The primary source of legislative intent is, of course, the language of the statute itself. <em>Auto. Trade Ass\u2019n. v. Harold Folk Enter., </em>301 Md. 642, 653, 484 A.2d 612 (1984); <em>Haskell v. Carey, </em>294 Md. 550, 556, 451 A.2d 658 (1982); <em>Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, </em>294 Md. 183, 189, 448 A.2d 353 (1982); <em>State v. Berry, </em>287 Md. 491, 495, 413 A.2d 557 (1980). When the legislature has not defined a term, it should ordinarily be given its usual and natural meaning. <em>DeJarnette v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>299 Md. 708, 717, 475 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Brown v. State, </em>285 Md. 469, 474, 403 A.2d 788 (1979); <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, supra, </em>285 Md. at 84, 400 A.2d 1091; <em>Williams v. Loyola College, </em>257 Md. 316, 328, 263 A.2d 5 (1970). Of course, where statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, no construction or clarification is needed or permitted, it being the rule that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation. <em>State v. Intercontinental, Ltd., </em>302 Md. 132, 137, 486 A.2d 174 (1985); <em>Hornbeck v. Somerset Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 597, 619, 458 A.2d 758 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><em>Tucker v. Firemen\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). We apply this precept to the use of the term \u201cschools\u201d by the County Commissioners of Carroll County when they legislated that \u201cSchools and colleges, including nursery schools or day care centers\u201d are a principal permitted use on land classified agricultural under the county\u2019s zoning ordinance. <em>Clarke v. County Comm\u2019rs for Carroll County, </em>270 Md. 343, 349, 311 A.2d 417 (1973). Since the ordinance does not contain a definition of \u201cschool,\u201d the word should be given its usual meaning. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u201cSchool\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 1274 (1984) as \u201ca place or institution for teaching and learning; [an] establishment for education----\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1206 (5th ed. 1979) similarly defines \u201cschool\u201d as \u201c[a]n institution or place for instruction or education.\u201d We also think the concluding phrase of \u00a7 6.2 of the ordinance, \u201cincluding nursery schools or day care centers,\u201d is significant. The Court of Appeals observed in <em>Group Health Ass\u2019n v. Blumenthal, </em>295 Md. 104, 111, 453 A.2d 1198 (1983), that \u201c[o]rdinarily the word \u2018including\u2019 means comprising by illustration and not by way of limitation.\u201d Therefore, other non-traditional types of schools are not excluded merely because they were not specifically provided for in the ordinance. In some jurisdictions, day care centers and nursery schools are not considered schools for zoning purposes. See cases collected in Annot., 64 A.L.R.3d 1087, 1104-10 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have considered the definition of the word \u201cschool\u201d in several different contexts. In <em>Wooddy v. Wooddy, </em>258 Md. 224, 265 A.2d 467 (1970), and in <em>McClure v. McClure, </em>15 Md.App. 226, 289 A.2d 610 (1972), the term was used in separation agreements. In <em>Wooddy, </em>the parties\u2019 son Eddie Lee suffered from Down\u2019s syndrome and was enrolled at a training school for such children. The Court of Appeals considered this type of training school a \u201cspecial school\u201d within the scope of the separation agreement\u2019s provision for \u201cspecial schooling.\u201d The cost of the boy attending a recreational camp, however, was not considered tuition for \u201cspecial schooling\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in the separation agreement. <em>Wooddy v. Wooddy, supra, </em>258 Md. at 229-30, 265 A.2d 467. In <em>McClure, </em>\u201cschooling\u201d was not adequately defined by the parties in their separation agreement. This Court held that expenses for room and board at a boarding school were not encompassed within the provision requiring the husband to pay the cost of the children\u2019s \u201cschooling.\u201d 15 Md.App. at 231-32, 289 A.2d 610. Rather, we concluded that these expenses were part of the support and mainte<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>nance obligation imposed on the husband by the court and were to be deducted from the child support payments that he made to his ex-wife. Finally, we held that tuition for boarding school was an expense within the scope of the provision made in the agreement for \u201cschooling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 289 A.2d 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Court of Appeals discussed the nature of a school at length in <em>Board of Public Welfare v. Myers, </em>224 Md. 246, 167 A.2d 765 (1961). The question presented to the Court in <em>Myers </em>was whether the racial segregation of juvenile offenders in State training schools violated the dictates of <em>Brown v. Board of Education, </em>347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). In concluding that such practice was unconstitutional, the Court relied on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoK\">the record makes it clear that educational programs offered in the training schools are substantially the same as those offered in the regular public schools. The trial judge in the instant case found as a fact, from the evidence submitted, that these programs are so closely patterned after those in the public schools that a child, when his scholastic grades and credits are earned, \u201ccan usually return to his former school in his neighborhood ... without academic difficulty.\u201d The judge stated that the training schools are \u201cbasically schools, and not custody-centered institutions with education secondary.\u201d In support of his conclusion that they are \u201ca part of the State\u2019s public education system,\u201d he pointed out that there are some public schools in Maryland that admit only special groups of problem or handicapped children. He also referred to the fact that by Chapter 29 of the Acts of 1922, the Maryland Training School was placed under the general supervision of the Department of Education, and its transfer to the Department of Welfare in 1943 did not alter its basic character.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Myers, supra, </em>224 Md. at 254-55, 167 A.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Several cases from other jurisdictions are persuasive authority on the question presented to us. In <em>Crist v. Bishop, </em>520 P.2d 196 (Utah 1974), the Supreme Court of Utah held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>that a juvenile training facility was a \u201c \u2018school\u2019 within the meaning of that term as used in the zoning ordinance of Utah County.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199. The Court, rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the institution was more of a correctional facility than a school, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">The requisites of ... a school are: some physical facility, teachers, a curriculum for study or training, and students who are the object thereof. If these requisites are met, the status of the institution is not changed because of variation in methods of teaching or of training, or of discipline or control. These are all present in greater or lesser degree in practically all schools; and they may vary greatly without preventing one from being properly so characterized. <em>Id. </em>at 198-99 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">At issue in <em>Armstrong v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 158, 257 A.2d 799 (Conn.1969), was a proposed school for children who were \u201cmaladjusted\u201d but not \u201cpsychotic, insane, mentally retarded or delinquent____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802 n. 2. The school, located upon an estate known as \u201cGlenholme,\u201d was to provide \u201ctutoring\u201d for the children. Based on the record of the various proceedings below, which included evidence that the curriculum offered at Glenholme would be comparable to that afforded in the public schools, that the facility \u201cwould operate as a school approved by the department of education,\u201d and that the staff would include \u201cone principal-teacher-administrator, four teachers, one remedial tutor and two recreation teachers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 802, the Supreme Court of Connecticut concluded that the proposed use conformed with the generally accepted meaning of the word \u201cschool\u201d as used in the local zoning regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 804. The Court of Appeals of New York, in <em>Wiltwyck School for Boys, Inc. v. Hill, </em>11 N.Y.2d 182, 227 N.Y.S.2d 655, 182 N.E.2d 268 (N.Y.1962), described the boys accepted to the Wiltwyck School by stating: \u201cAll the boys \u2018are referred because there is some mal-adjustment in their getting along in society\u2019, and many need psychiatric care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>227 N.Y.S.2d at 659, 182 N.E.2d at 271. Generally, half of the children admitted were delinquents referred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>juvenile court, and the other half were neglected children. The school admitted boys aged eight to 12, and a regular elementary school curriculum was taught at Wiltwyck. Counseling and typical boarding school activities complemented the formal education provided. <em>Id. </em>227 N.Y.S.2d at 660, 182 N.E.2d at 272. These factors were considered sufficient by the Court to support the conclusion that the \u201cWiltwyck School for Boys is a school within the language of the Yorktown Zoning Ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>227 N.Y.S.2d at 662, 182 N.E.2d at 274.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Home is staffed with four qualified teachers. One teacher supervises the daily three hour classroom session. Each boy, differing in age and ability, has a personalized program tailored to his needs. Each boy\u2019s program is coordinated with the public school system to which the boy will return. The Home complements the educational aspect of its program with vocational training, group counseling sessions, and recreational activities. These programs are similar to those offered in the State institutions found by the Court of Appeals in <em>Board of Public Welfare v. Myers, supra, </em>to be part of the public educational system. In that case the Court of Appeals did not agree with the State\u2019s position that \u201ctraining schools for delinquent minors are places of detention, analogous to prisons, although the accent is on education and training rather than punishment.\u201d 224 Md. at 253, 167 N.E.2d 765. <em>See also Armstrong v. Zoning Board of Appeals, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>and <em>Wiltwyck School for Boys, Inc. v. Hill, supra. Cf. Pennsylvania George Junior Republic v. Zoning Hearing Bd., </em>37 Pa.Cmwlth. 151, 389 A.2d 261 (1978) (group home not a school since boys were sent to public school rather than provided with on-site educational program). Given the attributes of the Home, and the indisputable focus of the program on education, the Home is a school, and is a principal permitted use in an agricultural district under the Carroll County Zoning Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b463-5\">.
