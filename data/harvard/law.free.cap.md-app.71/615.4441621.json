The underlying facts are fairly straightforward and largely uncontested.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>On May 19, 1981, AMS Construction, Inc. (AMS) borrowed $60,000 from Sovran Bank<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and signed a promissory note agreeing to repay that amount, with interest, within 90 days. Along with two other officer/stockholders of AMS, appellant endorsed the note as a guarantor. On August 6, 1981 \u2014 11 days before the due date \u2014 AMS paid the note, together with $2,762 in interest. Forty-five days later \u2014 on September 16, 1981 \u2014 an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against AMS in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">At some point, the trustee in bankruptcy asserted that the $62,762 payment, along with certain other payments made by AMS to Sovran within 90 days of the bankruptcy, represented voidable preferences under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b), and he demanded that Sovran pay those amounts to him. In July, 1982, Sovran informed appellant that the bank had \u201cbeen petitioned\u201d and demanded a meeting to discuss the bankruptcy \u201cand your liability to the bank.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The parties met on August 5, 1982, although precisely what occurred at that meeting, beyond some general discussion about the trustee\u2019s demand, is in some dispute. In an affidavit filed in support of Sovran\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the bank officer who attended the meeting stated that what was discussed was \u201cthe potential need for the [bank] to make demand upon the [guarantors] in the event that the United States Bankruptcy Court set aside any part of the payment\u201d but that \u201cdemand upon [appellant] for payment of any potential eventual liability was <em>not </em>made by or on behalf of the [bank] at the said August 5, 1982 meeting----\u201d (Emphasis added.) Contrariwise, appellant stated in his affidavit that Sovran officials told him then that \u201cI was liable for AMS\u2019s preferential payment and demanded that I pay either [Sovran] or the AMS trustee,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>and that, in response, \u201cI stated that I was financially unable to pay either [Sovran] or the trustee, and therefore would not.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant attested that he heard nothing more from Sovran until June 6, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">On September 14, 1982, Sovran and the trustee reached a settlement. In a Joint Motion filed in the Bankruptcy Court that day, they acknowledged that (1) transfers had been made by AMS to Sovran within 90 days of the bankruptcy on antecedent unsecured debts in the amount of $67,509 (which amount includes the $62,762 at issue here), (2) that represented more than Sovran, as an unsecured creditor, would receive in distribution under Ch. 7 of the Bankruptcy Act,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (3) if those transfers had not been made, Sovran would have an unsecured claim for $67,509 and would receive a distribution of \u201cat least 25%\u201d of that claim, or $16,877. Accordingly, it was agreed that Sovran would retain, at least temporarily, $16,877, that it would return to the trustee the balance of $50,632, that, if the ultimate distribution to unsecured creditors was less than 25% of allowed unsecured claims, Sovran would promptly refund to the trustee that part of the $16,877 that exceeded the percentage distribution ultimately made, together with interest at 10% per annum, but that, if the ultimate distribution exceeded 26% of allowed unsecured claims, the trustee would make an additional distribution to Sovran of an amount that would give Sovran 1% less than the percentage distribution made to other unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Upon that Joint Motion, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, also dated September 14, 1982, approving the settlement and directing Sovran to pay over the $50,632 in accordance with it. Sixteen days later, Sovran paid the money to the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"ApQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>At some point not clear from the record, the AMS bankruptcy proceeding was closed. On August 14, 1985, Sovran wrote to appellant, informing him that the bankruptcy proceeding had been closed, that no additional distribution had been made, and that the bank could \u201cnow fix with certainty the outstanding balance.\u201d Demand was made for $68,986, which included interest at the rate stated in the note (lV4% over prime) through August 12,1985. Appellant refused to make payment, and, on September 13, 1985, Sovran filed suit in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">Both sides moved for summary judgment, appellant\u2019s defense being based solely on the statute of limitations. His argument below, as it is here, was that any cause of action that the bank had against him as a guarantor had accrued at least by July 2, 1982, when the bank acknowledged its awareness of the trustee\u2019s claim that the August, 1981 payment constituted a preference and his demand that the bank turn over the money to him. Under that theory, the action was not filed within the three-year period allowed by Md.Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 5-101. The bank argued that its cause of action against appellant did not accrue until the September 14, 1982 order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the settlement effected with the trustee, and that the action was therefore timely filed, albeit by one day.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">After hearing argument, the court concluded that the action was timely filed and therefore granted the bank\u2019s motion. Judgment in the amount of $93,341 plus $9,334 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs was entered, and this appeal followed. The issue is simply when Sovran\u2019s action against appellant accrued \u2014 on September 14, 1982, as asserted by the bank, or at some earlier point, as asserted by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">This is a matter of first impression in Maryland. Indeed the parties\u2019 research and our own reveal only one case in the country in which an analogous circumstance has been considered, and that case is not terribly enlightening. In <em>Chemical Bank New York Trust Company v. Amory, </em>27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>A.D.2d 730, 277 N.Y.S.2d 459 (1967), <em>aff'd </em>21 N.Y.2d 832, 288 N.Y.S.2d 916, 235 N.E.2d 918 (1968), the defendant guaranteed a demand note for $52,000. The maker paid the note on November 6, 1958, and a week later, on November 13, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. Presumably on the trustee\u2019s petition, the Bankruptcy Court later determined that some $28,000 of the payment constituted a preference and so ordered the payee \u2014 Chemical Bank \u2014 to pay that sum over to the trustee. The bank did so on February 1, 1961. In May, 1966, the bank sued the guarantor to recover the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The guarantor moved to dismiss the action on the grounds of the statute of frauds, limitations, and release, the limitations question being governed by New York\u2019s <em>six </em>-year statute of limitations. Reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion, the appellate division, concluded, at 460-61 of 277 N.Y.S.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cOn a demand note the obligation of a guarantor attaches on execution and delivery and plaintiff could have sued upon any default in payment of the obligation. If the preferential payment was, as plaintiff contends, illegal and no payment at all (cf. <em>Perry v. Van Norden Trust Co., </em>118 App.Div., 288, 103 N.Y.S. 543, rev\u2019d 192 N.Y. 189, 84 N.E. 804), no obstacle existed to institution of suit against defendant within the statutory period. Even a provisional payment by the maker of the note would not extend the statute of limitations, unless such payment was made as the agent of the guarantor <em>(Peoples Trust Co. of Malone v. O\u2019Neil, </em>273 N.Y. 312, 313, 7 N.E.2d 244). Plaintiff\u2019s contention that there was a period of repose or suspension from March 6, 1958, the date of the last payment on the obligation, to February 1, 1961, the date of payment by plaintiff to the trustee, is rejected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">That was the extent of the Court\u2019s analysis. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed by per curiam order, giving no reasons at all. It characterized the bank\u2019s argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u201cThe plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, contending that the period of limitation was suspended from November 6,1958 to February 1, 1961 and, in the alternative, that a new period of limitation commenced on February 1, 1961 because a new cause of action accrued on the repayment of the payment set aside as preferential.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><em>Chemical Bank, supra, </em>288 N.Y.S.2d at 916, 235 N.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We believe that some further analysis is required, and, upon that analysis, we are led to a different conclusion than that reached by the New York Courts. We shall affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Appellant\u2019s guarantee was a guarantee of payment; the endorsement so states. Appellant therefore engaged that, if the instrument was \u201cnot paid when due,\u201d he would pay it \u201caccording to its tenor without resort by the holder to any other party.\u201d Md.Code Ann.Comm.Law art., \u00a7 3-416(1). His liability is on the instrument; it is \u201cindistinguishable from that of a co-maker.\u201d <em>Etelson v. Suburban Trust Co., </em>263 Md. 376, 380, 283 A.2d 408 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"ACW\">In both the trial court and at oral argument before us, appellant conceded that he was not released or discharged as a guarantor by the August, 1981 payment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That interesting issue is therefore not before us in this case, and we do not decide it. <em>See Horner v. First Nat. Bank, </em>149 Va. 854, 141 S.E. 767 (1928). We do, however, have to consider in another context the effect of that August 6 payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">There is nothing in this record to indicate that the payment was not valid when made. There is nothing to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that it was not a duly authorized act of AMS or that it constituted a fraud on anyone. The bank had no choice but to accept the payment, and, indeed, had it refused acceptance, it may well have forfeited its rights against the guarantors. <em>See Horner, supra. </em>But for the fact that, under the Federal Bankruptcy Law, part of it constituted a preferential transfer, which the trustee could and did seek to have set aside, that payment would indeed have discharged the liability of the guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">What, then, is the effect of the voidability of the payment? A payment is not illegal or fraudulent simply because it meets the criteria set forth in the Bankruptcy Law (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b)) for a preferential transfer. Nor is such a payment void <em>ab initio. </em>It is simply, by Act of Congress, made voidable at the election of the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In that regard, two things must be kept in mind. First, although the trustee has a clear and positive duty to collect and preserve the assets of the bankrupt\u2019s estate, including preferential transfers, it appears that the trustee has some discretion in deciding whether to set aside any particular preference, and in what amount. <em>See In re Sapolin Paints, Inc., </em>11 B.R. 930, 939 (U.S.Bankr.Ct.E.D.N.Y.1981): \u201cThe decision as to whether to void a preference, or not, is one for the trustee ... to make. It is a decision that is to be made for the benefit of the creditors.\u201d Second, and perhaps more important, the alleged preference does not become void simply upon declaration by the trustee. To recover the funds, the trustee must take affirmative steps, generally in the Bankruptcy Court, and obtain a judicial determination that the transfer qualifies as a preference under \u00a7 547(b) and an order setting it aside. <em>See Fischer v. Pauline Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>309 U.S. 294, 301-02, 60 S.Ct. 535, 538-39, 84 L.Ed. 764 (1940); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Davis, </em>733 F.2d 1083, 1084 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Matter of Buchman, </em>600 F.2d 160, 163, n. 7 (8th Cir.1979). Moreover, in such a proceeding, the trustee bears the burden of proof on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the issue of whether the transfer meets the requirements of \u00a7 547(b). <em>See </em>\u00a7 547(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">It is evident, then, that until such time as the trustee elected to set aside the payment to Sovran and obtained the order of the Bankruptcy Court actually setting aside 75% of the $67,509 aggregate payments (including 75% of the $62,-762 \u00e1t issue here), Sovran was fully entitled to retain those funds, to treat the loan as paid, and to consider the proceeds as its own. During that interim, then \u2014 until September 14, 1982 \u2014 Sovran had no claim or right of action against appellant or anyone else with respect to the AMS loan. Appellant\u2019s argument that Sovran had a cause of action when it first learned of the trustee\u2019s intention to set aside the payment assumes a significance to that intention that is simply not warranted. The trustee\u2019s demand was just that \u2014 a demand; the bank was free to acquiesce or resist, as it saw fit, until the Bankruptcy Court, upon petition of the trustee, determined the amount of the preference, set it aside, and ordered the bank to pay the trustee. It was then, and as of then, that the payment by AMS became void and a loan balance was restored; it was then, and as of then, that Sovran, having a judicially created past-due loan on its books, first had a cause of action against appellant. Whether, in anticipation of a probable loss, Sovran made demand upon appellant in August, 1982, as contended by appellant, is of no consequence, for, despite any such demand, it had no judicial remedy at that point to enforce collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Our problem with the New York Courts\u2019 conclusions in the <em>Chemical Bank </em>case is twofold. First, they seem to have rested on the notion that the preferential payment was somehow either void <em>ab initio </em>or in the nature of a \u201cprovisional\u201d payment. That may be the effect under New York State law (and we observe that only New York cases are cited for those propositions), but it is not the effect under the Federal Bankruptcy Act or under Maryland law. The AMS payment was valid when made and remained valid until set aside. Second, this is not a question, as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>apparently argued in <em>Chemical Bank, </em>of \u201csuspending\u201d the statute of limitations. It is rather a question of when Sovran\u2019s cause of action against appellant accrued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The other case relied upon by <em>appellant </em>\u2014 United <em>States v. Fidelity-Baltimore National Bank &amp; Trust Company, </em>166 F.Supp. 1 (D.Md.1958) \u2014 we find inapposite. The government there sued its drawee bank for accepting and paying checks upon which the payee\u2019s signature had been forged. The drawee bank, in a third-party action, sued other banks that had endorsed the checks in the chain of negotiation, contending that, as subsequent endorsers, they had warranted the signature of the payee. The third-party action was brought more than three years after the third-party defendants had endorsed the checks, and they raised the statute of limitations as a defense. The court credited that defense and granted their respective motions for summary judgment, concluding that the drawee bank\u2019s cause of action for breach of warranty accrued when the checks were negotiated under the forged endorsement and not when it actually suffered a loss. Sovran seeks to distinguish that case on the theory that the payment there was \u201cvoid\u201d rather than merely \u201cvoidable,\u201d but that may be a bit too simplistic. The question is merely when the cause of action arose: the action for breach of warranty arose when the warranty was breached, which was when the endorsing bank endorsed the check; the action here arose when, as a result of the Bankruptcy Court order, the loan became in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">.
