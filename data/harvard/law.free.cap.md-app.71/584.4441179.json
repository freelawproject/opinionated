BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Following an adjudicatory and a disposition hearing, <em>see </em>Maryland Cts. and Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-801(b) and \u00a7 3-801(n), Darnell F., appellant, was determined by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, to be a delinquent child. <em>See </em>Maryland Cts. and Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-801(\u0196). The delinquent act with which he was charged and as to which facts were found to have been sustained at the adjudicatory hearing was unauthorized use of an automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the car which appellant used without authorization was, while in appellant\u2019s possession, totally destroyed, its owner filed a claim for restitution pursuant to Maryland Cts. and Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-829(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, pursuant to \u00a7 3-829(d) and (e),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court scheduled a restitution hearing. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>date set, the assistant State\u2019s Attorney was not in the courtroom when the court was prepared to hold the hearing, whereupon the juvenile judge<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dismissed the restitution claim. Upon the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and after a hearing at which the assistant State\u2019s Attorney explained her absence and argument was presented by appellant\u2019s counsel, the claim was reinstated. The court ruled that it had discretionary authority to reinstate the case and that it was in the best interest \u201cof the child, society, and the elusive entity called justice\u201d to do so. After a hearing, the court ordered restitution in the amount of $5,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Appellant\u2019s appeal from the judgment thus entered questions the juvenile judge\u2019s authority to have reconsidered and reinstated the restitution claim. His attack is two-pronged: (1) since juvenile court is a court of special jurisdiction and there is no statutory authority giving it revisory power over restitution orders, the juvenile judge had no legal authority to reinstate a restitution claim and (2) even if the juvenile judge has revisory power over restitution orders, reinstating the restitution claim in this case violated appellant\u2019s Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Maryland Rule 916a. provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">a. <em>Revisory Power. </em>An order of the court may be modified or vacated if the court finds that action to be in the best interest of the child or the public, except in cases involving commitment of a child to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for placement in a State mental hospital. In cases involving such commitment, the court shall proceed as provided in Rule 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The rule expressly authorizes the juvenile court to modify or vacate an order of the court, provided it is in the best interest of the child to do so. The issue then is whether this rule is sufficiently broad to encompass an order of the juvenile court dismissing a restitution claim. <em>In Re: Leslie M., </em>305 Md. 477, 505 A.2d 504 (1986) is instructive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">There, the issue was whether the juvenile judge \u201chas the authority to vacate a prior order adjudicating a child to be delinquent after the successful completion of a period of probation.\u201d 305 Md. at 478, 505 A.2d 504. The Court rejected the trial judge\u2019s ruling that a finding of delinquency made at an adjudicatory hearing was not an order of the court within the meaning of Maryland Rule 916 a. It held that \u201can adjudication of delinquency is an \u2018order\u2019 within the purview of Rule 916(a).\u201d 305 Md. at 482, 505 A.2d 504. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">We are persuaded that given the stated focus of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Title 3, Subtitle 8, Juvenile Causes, set out in \u00a7 3-802(a)(2) and 3-802(b), our interpretation more faithfully adheres to the legislatively spelled out purposes of that Subtitle. Section 3-802(a)(2) provides as one of the purposes, \u201cTo remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior.\u201d Subsection (b) provides that \u201c[T]his subtitle shall be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.\u201d To view Rule 916(a) in as restrictive a fashion as did the trial judge does not comport with a liberal statutory construction; rather, it runs counter to the express language of the statute. Whenever possible, a rule should be construed in accordance with statutorily expressed legislative policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\"><em>Id., </em>305 Md. at 481-82, 505 A.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">In addition to its emphasis on the legislative intent of the Juvenile Causes Act, the Court\u2019s holding implicitly recognized well-settled principles of statutory interpretation, which are equally applicable to the interpretation of Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>of Procedure, 305 Md. at 481, 505 A.2d 504, specifically, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">... where unambiguous statutory language expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to disregard the natural import of the words used with a view towards making the statute express an intent which is different from its plain meaning____ Manifestly, therefore, a statute must be construed without resorting to subtle or forced interpretation for the purpose of extending or limiting its operation ... (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALx\"><em>In Re: Arnold, M., </em>298 Md. 515, 521, 471 A.2d 313 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The required restitution hearing has a function and purpose distinct from that of either an adjudicatory or a disposition hearing. <em>In Re: Herbert B., </em>303 Md. 419, 425, 494 A.2d 680 (1985). Thus, while the hearing may be held \u201cas part of\u201d or \u201ccontemporaneously with\u201d either, \u00a7 3-829(e), the adjudication of a child as a delinquent child is not a prerequisite to the passage of an order of restitution. <em>In Re: Herbert B., </em>303 Md. at 427, 494 A.2d 680. It is necessary, however, for the passage of such an order that the court find both that the child had committed the delinquent act alleged in the petition and that during its commission, the child had stolen, damaged or destroyed the victim\u2019s property. 303 Md. at 426-27, 494 A.2d 680. On the other hand, restitution proceedings, consistent with the purposes of the Juvenile Causes Act, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3-802(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are as rehabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tative, and for the same or similar reasons, as are its adjudicative procedures. So viewed, it is patent that a reading of Maryland Rule 916a. to exclude from its coverage orders relating to restitution, particularly those having the effect of foreclosing its award, is no more warranted than was the restrictive interpretation given that rule by the trial judge in <em>In Re: Leslie M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Moreover, there is another reason to uphold the trial judge\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The restitution hearing was scheduled to begin at 1:00 p.m. At that time, however, the judge was hearing a post conviction matter. Therefore, although the assistant State\u2019s Attorney, the assistant Public Defender, the parties, and the witnesses were present, the restitution hearing did not proceed. The assistant State\u2019s Attorney stated at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that, rather than wait for the court to finish the hearing in progress, she proceeded to other juvenile courts, in which matters for which she was responsible were pending, and handled those matters. She also stated that she informed court personnel and appellant\u2019s counsel before leaving and that she returned to the courtroom periodically during the afternoon to check its availability. When the judge was ready to begin the restitution hearing, at approximately 3:25 p.m., the assistant State\u2019s Attorney was not present. According to appellant\u2019s counsel, she and the victim searched for the assistant State\u2019s Attorney without success. At 4:10 p.m., the trial judge instructed appellant\u2019s counsel to call the case. After calling the case, defense counsel moved for dismissal, citing the assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s absence, on the ground of lack of prosecution. The motion was grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ed. The assistant State\u2019s Attorney learned that the case had been dismissed when she returned to the courtroom several minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In <em>In Re: Darryl D., </em>308 Md. 475, 520 A.2d 712 (1987), <em>aff'g </em>66 Md.App. 434, 504 A.2d 676 (1986), relying upon cases holding that dismissal was an improper sanction for violation of a time provision contained in the rules, <em>see e.g., In Re: Dewayne H., </em>290 Md. 401, 430 A.2d 76 (1981); <em>In Re: Trevor A., </em>55 Md.App. 491, 462 A.2d 1245 (1983), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidentially granted, </em>299 Md. 428, 474 A.2d 207 (1984); <em>In Re: Howard L., </em>50 Md.App. 498, 438 A.2d 939 (1982), the Court held that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to dismiss a delinquency petition for lack of prosecution because the prosecutor was tardy. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">If, in light of the special objectives of juvenile proceedings, it is error to dismiss for violation of a time provision <em>mandated </em>by the rules, it would seem axiomatic, absent exceptional circumstances, that it is an abuse of discretion to order dismissal as a means of reprimanding a tardy prosecutor. This is particularly so where there is scant, if any evidence of wilfulness and where the State was ready to call the case within fifteen minutes of the master\u2019s deadline. Moreover, an attorney\u2019s failure to appear is punishable under proper circumstances as a contempt, (emphasis in the original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\"><em>In Re: Darryl D., </em>308 Md. at 482, 520 A.2d 712. We are unable to discern any significant difference between the facts <em>sub judice </em>and those in <em>In Re: Darrell D. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the court\u2019s dismissal of the restitution claim was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We are aware that appellant has not addressed the propriety of the dismissal of the restitution claim, preferring to focus entirely upon the authority of the trial judge to reconsider and reinstate it. Nevertheless, we perceive the issue to be significant; an action which is the product of an improper exercise of discretion may be corrected by the court upon a motion for reconsideration. Certainly that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>consistent with a trial court\u2019s granting of a motion for new trial upon motion of a party bringing to its attention errors made during the trial. Thus, it is not solely the province of the appellate courts to review, identify and correct abuses of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Alternatively, appellant argues that permitting modification or vacation of the order dismissing the restitution claim is barred by principles of double jeopardy. Asserting that there is a punitive aspect to a juvenile court\u2019s order of restitution and that restitution constitutes punishment for purposes of the prohibition against multiple punishment for a single offense, he contends that, when the Public Defender called the case, at the court\u2019s request, jeopardy attached. Thus, he continues, the judge\u2019s grant of his motion to dismiss, in effect, declared that no punishment should be imposed. The subsequent order of restitution, he concludes therefore, constituted an increase in sentence, violative of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Although the double jeopardy clause applies to juvenile offenders, <em>In Re: Mark R., </em>294 Md. 244, 261, 449 A.2d 393 (1982); <em>Parojinog v. State, </em>282 Md. 256, 260, 384 A.2d 86 (1978), and this issue raises several interesting questions, we do not reach them for two reasons: first, the issue of double jeopardy was not raised below and is consequently not before us, <em>Howell v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 675, 676, 468 A.2d 688 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1039, 106 S.Ct. 412, 88 L.Ed.2d 362 (1985); Maryland Rule 1085, and secondly, jeopardy does not attach merely because a case is called. In a case tried without a jury, the \u201c \u2018normal rule\u2019 is that jeopardy fastens when the trial commences, <em>i.e., </em>when the judge begins either to hear testimony or to receive evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State v. Rhodes, </em>36 Md.App. 214, 215, 373 A.2d 636 <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 742 (1977), citing <em>Blondes v. State, </em>273 Md. 435, 444, 330 A.2d 169 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">.
