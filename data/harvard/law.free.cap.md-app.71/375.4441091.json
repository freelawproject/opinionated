Crampton was tried and convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for driving while intoxicated and failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident. He was sentenced on the driving while intoxicated conviction to ninety days in the Montgomery County Detention Center. All but one weekend was suspended in favor of an eighteen month probation. Further, the court imposed a $100 fine for Crampton\u2019s failure to reduce speed to avoid an accident. In this Court, Crampton urges that the trial court\u2019s judgments should be reversed because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">1. It erred in admitting the results of the breathalyzer test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">2. The driving while intoxicated charges should have been dismissed because the original charging document was defective; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">3. It erred in permitting the arresting officer to testify about appellant\u2019s performance on a series of \u201cfield sobriety tests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The charges against Crampton arose from an automobile accident that occurred on the Cabin John Bridge segment of the Capital Beltway. Around 11 p.m. on May 9, 1985, Sunee Grover was crossing the Cabin John Bridge from Maryland to Virginia. His car broke down, and he came to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>a stop in the right lane. He put on his flashing lights and waited for the traffic to pass before exiting his car. While he was waiting for the traffic to clear, Crampton approached at \u201ca good speed\u201d and crashed into his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Two Maryland State Police officers, including Trooper Russell, arrived on the scene within a short time after the collision. Russell stated that when he arrived Crampton was seated in his own car. The trooper \u201csmelt the odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from the vehicle,\u201d and he asked Crampton to alight from the vehicle. When Crampton alit from the automobile, the trooper asked him to perform some \u201cfield sobriety tests.\u201d Those tests consisted of reciting the alphabet, standing on one leg, walking heel-to-toe, and touching his nose with his finger. Crampton attempted those exercises but performed poorly. Trooper Russell then arrested Crampton for driving while intoxicated and took him to the local State police barracks where Sergeant Stotlemyer administered a breathalyzer test to appellant. The test showed a 0.19 percent ethyl alcohol by weight in appellant\u2019s blood.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 10-306 entitled the State to submit the results of the breathalyzer to the jury without calling Sergeant Stotlemyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The principal thrust of Crampton\u2019s appeal is that the trial judge misapplied Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 10-306. That statute then read:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">\u201c(a)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section, in any criminal trial in which intoxication due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the consumption of alcohol, or being under the influence of alcohol is an issue, a copy of a report of the results of a chemical test of breath or blood signed by the technician or analyst who performed the test, is admissible as substantive evidence without the presence or testimony of the technician or analyst who performed the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">(2) To be admissible under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the report must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">(i) Identify the technician or analyst as a \u2018qualified person,\u2019 as defined in Section 10-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">(ii) State that the test was performed with equipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission at the direction of a police officer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">(iii) State that the result of the test is as stated in the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">(b) Test results which comply with the requirements of subsection (a) of this section are admissible as substantive evidence without the presence or testimony of the technician who administered the test. However, if the State decides to offer the test results without the testimony of the technician, it shall, at least 20 days before trial, notify the defendant or his attorney in writing of its intention and deliver to the defendant or his attorney a copy of the test results to be offered. If the defendant desires the technician to be present and testify at trial, the defendant shall notify the court and the State in writing no later than 10 business days before trial; and if such timely and proper notice is given, the test results are inadmissible without the testimony of the technician. Failure to give timely and proper notice constitutes a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to the presence and testimony of the technician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">The General Assembly in enacting this statute \u201cmade clear that alcohol test results are ordinarily reliable and generally admissible as business records.\u201d <em>Moon v. State, </em>300 Md. 354, 369, 478 A.2d 695, 703 (1984). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the statute provides that test results may be admitted into evidence without the necessity of calling the technician who administered the test if due notice is given the defendant and there is no timely objection thereto. Although the statute diminishes a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation regarding alcohol tests, it does not completely abolish that right. The Court of Appeals in <em>Moon, </em>300 Md. at 370, 478 A.2d at 703, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">\u201cIt seems to us that \u00a7 10-306(b) was designed to subordinate the admissibility of alcohol test results to the timely assertion of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation. The statute requires the tester to be produced, upon the defendant\u2019s request, before the evidence may be admitted despite its reliability, and the defendant does not have to proffer what he intends to prove from this witness. In these circumstances, the legislature has safeguarded the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right and elevated it over what the statute has declared to be reliable evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1E\">In the instant case, defense counsel attempted to preserve appellant\u2019s right of confrontation by filing a notice requesting the presence and testimony of the technician. When the State contended that the notice was untimely and hence invalid, the trial court conducted a pretrial hearing to receive evidence on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">At that hearing, defense counsel explained that a breath test was administered to Crampton and that the test showed an alcohol level of 0.19. Notice of the test results and of the State\u2019s intention to submit these results without the testimony of the technician was served on appellant at the time of his arrest. Counsel further explained that originally trial was scheduled to be held in the district court on January 16, 1986. Crampton\u2019s counsel further stated that in November 1985 he made a proper request for the State to produce the technician who administered the breath test. According to defense counsel, the trial in the district court was postponed. Crampton\u2019s attorney said, during argument in the circuit court, that the reason for the postponement was that the technician was not present. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>March 19, 1986, appellant demanded a jury trial, and the matter was transferred to the Montgomery County Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">At the time of the hearing in the circuit court, that court\u2019s record did not contain any indication that a request for the presence of a technician had, in fact, been made in the district court. When the case was first called in the circuit court on April 30, 1986, the State requested a continuance; and the matter was rescheduled for July 9, 1986, but subsequently postponed until July 10, 1986, because of Crampton\u2019s motion to dismiss. That motion was based on duplicity and a failure to charge an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The record does not reflect any activity on the part of either the State or Crampton during the period April 30, 1986, through June 30, 1986. On July 1, 1986, Crampton\u2019s counsel once again demanded that the State produce, at trial, the technician who administered the breathalyzer test to Crampton. Admittedly, that demand was not made more than ten days prior to the then scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Immediately before trial on the merits, the judge heard testimony relative to Crampton\u2019s demand that the technician who administered the breathalyzer test be present. Following that hearing, the judge found that prior to the scheduled district court trial date the State forwarded to Crampton proper notice of its intent to submit the report without the technician. The judge declined, however, to make a specific finding as to whether Crampton had made a proper demand for the presence of the technician in the district court. The judge did, nevertheless, assume that a proper notice had been given. The judge then considered Courts Article \u00a7 10-306 and ruled that the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">1. Requires the State to give only one notice and that once a notice is given in the district court, it applies to any circuit court proceeding that may follow, but that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">2. The statute requires that when a case is transferred from the district court to the circuit court, a defendant must file a new demand for the technician and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>that the new demand must be made at least ten days before the scheduled trial date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Since the demand for the presence of the technician was filed in the circuit court less than ten days before the scheduled trial date, the trial judge concluded that Cramp-ton\u2019s demand was invalid. Consequently, the judge ruled that the State was entitled to have the breath test report received into evidence without the necessity of presenting the technician who administered the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Crampton advances three reasons why he thinks that that ruling was incorrect. First, he avers that the trial court misinterpreted Courts Articles \u00a7 10-306(b) when it ruled that the statute requires the defense to renew its \u00a7 10-306(b) notice if a case is transferred from the district court to the circuit court. To support this contention, Crampton points out that the statute requires only that notice be given \u201cno later than ten days before trial.\u201d Appellant maintains that he gave that notice in November 1985, a period of time well before the trial scheduled for July 9, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Second, Crampton asserts that, if the statute necessitates the defense to renew its notice when a case is transferred from one court to another, it also mandates the State to renew its notice. Since the State failed to make a timely renewal of its notice after the case was transferred to the circuit court, Crampton argues that the State was not entitled to submit the report in the absence of the technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Third, appellant argues that, even if the trial judge interpreted the statute correctly, the judge, nevertheless, abused his discretion by ruling as he did because his ruling denied appellant the right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">We agree with appellant\u2019s first reason. There is nothing in the statute that dictates that a defendant renew his \u00a7 10-306(b)(2) demand. All that the statute commands is that notice be given \u201cin writing no later than 10 days before trial.\u201d Although there may be practical reasons why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a renewal of the notice would be helpful, the statute does not mandate a renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The trial court, as we have said, refrained from making a specific finding that, at the district court level, the defendant demanded the presence of the technician who administered the test. The judge said, however, that with respect to the filing of the demand the defendant was \u201callowed ... the benefit of the doubt.\u201d We think that in making that statement, the trial court effectively found that the subsection 10-306(b)(2) notice had been forwarded to the State while the case was still in the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The demand made on the State while the case was pending in the district court satisfied Courts Article \u00a7 10-306 and required the State to produce the technician at trial. The circuit court erred in permitting the result of the report to be admitted into evidence without requiring the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of the technician who administered the test. That error requires reversal of the conviction for driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The charges against Crampton were commenced via a citation for \u201cdriving a motor vehicle while intoxicated <em>or </em>under the influence of alcohol.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Alleging that the charges were duplicitous, Crampton moved to dismiss them. He asserted that the citation charged him in the disjunctive with the separate offenses of driving while intoxicated <em>or </em>driving while under the influence of alcohol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The trial court refused to dismiss the charges; instead, it allowed the State to amend the citation to contain the single charge of driving while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Crampton argues that the amendment of the charge was improper because it was a substantive change which could only have been made with his consent. Since he did not consent, he maintains the court erred in not dismissing the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">We addressed a similar issue in <em>Thompson v. State, </em>26 Md.App. 442, 338 A.2d 411 (1975), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>278 Md. 41, 359 A.2d 203 (1976). There Thompson was charged by citation with \u201cdriving with ability impaired or intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 11-902 [now \u00a7 21-902] of the Transportation Article.\u201d Thompson, like Crampton, contended that the traffic citation charging him with \u201cdriving while ability impaired or intoxicated\u201d recited two separate potential charges in a single count and was \u201cclearly duplici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tious.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>26 Md.App. at 449, 338 A.2d 411. We said that, although charging two substantive crimes in one count is impermissible where the offenses grew out of different transactions and involved different intents, it is nevertheless permitted when the count charges two or more offenses involving the same intent. <em>Thompson </em>acknowledged that, generally, when a statute creates an offense and specifies several different acts, transactions, means or intents by which the offense may be committed, a charging document alleging those different offenses must do so conjunctively and not disjunctively. <em>State v. Beers, </em>21 Md.App. 39, 318 A.2d 825 (1974). <em>Thompson </em>noted, however, that \u201cthis rule can be changed by statute ... as was done ... [when the Legislature enacted Transportation Article] \u00a7 16-104.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>26 Md.App. at 449-50, 338 A.2d 411. Transportation Article \u00a7 16-104, applied in <em>Thompson, </em>has been replaced by \u00a7 26-405. It provides that if a person is charged with a violation of Trans. Art. \u00a7 21-901 or Trans. Art. \u00a7 21-902 the court may find that person guilty of a lesser included offense. <em>Thompson </em>said that requiring a defendant to stand trial on the driving while impaired charge presented no due process violation. Explaining the reason for the disjunctive/conjunctive rule as twofold, we opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">\u201cThe first is that the defendant is entitled to be informed with certainty of the offense with which he is charged; the second is that he should be enabled to show, in the event of a subsequent prosecution, that he has previously been convicted or acquitted of the same offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><em>Thompson, </em>26 Md.App. at 450, 338 A.2d 411, citing <em>Bonneville v. State, </em>206 Md. 302, 310-11, 111 A.2d 669, 672 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The <em>Thompson </em>Court found no fair notice problem insofar as charging the defendant with a violation of \u00a7 21-902 for driving while intoxicated but allowing him to be convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The Court reasoned that the offenses differ only in the grade of proof required to support a conviction. 26 Md.App. at 450. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number><em>Thompson </em>implied that dropping the greater charge and proceeding in the lesser was not, in the traditional sense, a substantive change to the charging document.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">As in <em>Thompson, </em>appellant was fully aware that he was charged with violation of both subsections of \u00a7 21-902. He cannot successfully assert that he was hampered in preparing to defend against the greater offense because the lesser offense was dropped. Both charges appeared on the initial charging document possessed by Crampton. He had notice of the driving while intoxicated charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The case at bar differs factually from <em>Thompson </em>in that \u201cdriving while intoxicated\u201d is not a lesser included offense of \u201cdriving while under the influence.\u201d We are unable to perceive how Crampton was hampered in his defense simply because a lesser included charge was dropped. As a practical matter, irrespective of the inclusion <em>vel non </em>of the lesser charge, Crampton still had to prepare his defense to the greater offense. We think the trial court did not err in denying Crampton\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Over Crampton\u2019s objection, Officer Russell was permitted to testify concerning Crampton\u2019s performance of certain \u201csimple field sobriety tests.\u201d Crampton claims that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony because the proper foundation for the tests under the Frye-Reed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> standard was not laid. He further asserts that the testimony was not shown to be otherwise reliable, and that it was ultimately more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The testimony Crampton rigorously assails was elicited on direct examination of Trooper Russell. The trooper testified that he asked Crampton to stand on one leg, recite the alphabet, and perform a heel-to-toe test. An objection to that testimony was made on the ground that a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>foundation had not been laid for it. Crampton\u2019s counsel contended that there was nothing in the record to show that the test was scientifically reliable or that it was generally accepted in the scientific community as indicative of a person\u2019s being either under the influence of alcohol or intoxicated. The trooper was permitted to relate to the jury that Crampton was unable to perform the field sobriety tests and was, therefore, arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">One seeking to introduce expert opinion based on a new method of scientific investigation must first establish that the new technique has gained the general acceptance of the relevant scientific community. <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 389, 391 A.2d 364, 372 (1978). The Court of Appeals said in <em>Reed </em>that <em>\u201cFrye [v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir.1923) ] was deliberately intended to interpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new scientific principles____\u201d <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 386, 391 A.2d at 370. The <em>Reed </em>Court cited with approval <em>State v. Cary, </em>56 N.J. 16, 264 A.2d 209 (1970), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cAll scientific aids and devices go through an experimental and testing stage, and during these stages there may be considerable scientific controversy. During this period of controversy ... the danger is that a trial may actually result in the trial of the technique rather than the trial of the issues involved in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-9\"><em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 389, 391 A.2d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">The <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard has been applied to various newly developed methods of scientific discovery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">\u201cparaffin test, <em>Brooke v.

The field sobriety tests are designed to reveal objective information about a driver\u2019s coordination. <em>See People v. Ramirez, </em>199 Colo. 367, 609 P.2d 616, 620 (1980). The <em>Frye-Reed </em>test does not apply to those field sobriety tests because the latter are essentially empirical observations, involving no controversial, new, or \u201cscientific\u201d technique.
