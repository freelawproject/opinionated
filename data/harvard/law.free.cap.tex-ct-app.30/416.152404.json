Aggravated Assault\u2014Indictment\u2014Place of Religious Worship.\u2014Article 496, Penal Code, subdivision 2, provides that an assault or battery becomes aggravated when committed <em>\u201cin </em>any place of religious worship.\u201d The indictment alleged that the assault was committed <em>at </em>Hickory Grove School House,\" when and where there was an assembly assembled for the purpose of religious worship, and which said Hickory Grove School House was then and there a place of religious worship. A motion in arrest of judgment was made, upon the ground that the indictment was insufficient because it substituted the word \u201cat\u201d for the word \u201cin\u201d used in the statute. <em>Held, </em>that the motion was properly overruled under the provisions of article 428o, Code of Criminal Procedure, which declares, \u201cWords used in the statute to define an offense need not be strictly pursued in an indictment; it is sufficient to use other words conveying the same meaning, or which include the sense of the statutory words.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b442-10\">2.

Blackwell guilty as charged, and assess his punishment at a fine of \u00a7500,\u201d filling in the amount agreed upon. \u201d <em>Held, </em>that the charge was erroneous, as well as inconsistent in itself. That the punishment for aggravated assault, . where it is by fine only, is not under the statute fixed absolutely at the sum of \u00a7500. And under the statute, article 498 of the Penal Code, it is for the jury and not the court to assess a fine of not less than \u00a725 nor more than \u00a71000.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Appeal from the County Court of Delta.

That when said charge was handed by the court to the jury the place where the $500 was afterward inserted was left blank by the court.

Motion in arrest of judgment was urged against the information, because it failed \u201cto state the assault was committed in a-place of religious worship;\u201d that it used the language, \u201cat Hickory Grove School House.\u201d The basis of the motion is the alleged insufficiency of the word \u201cat\u201d to convey the meaning of the statutory word \u201cin,\u201d contained in the second subdivision of article 496 of the Penal Code. That portion of the statute defines an aggravated assault to be such \u201cwhen committed in a court of justice, or in any place of religious worship, or in any place where persons are assembled for the purpose of innocent amusement.\u201d Penal Code, art. 496, subdiv. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Our Code of Procedure provides, that \u201cwords used in a statute to define an offense need not be strictly pursued in the indictment. It is sufficient to use other words conveying the same meaning, or which include the sense of the statutory words.\u201d Code Crim. Proc., art. 428o. The words \u201cin\u201d and \u201cat\u201d are not defined in our codes. They therefore have the same meaning attached to them as commonly understood. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>These two words, however, have been frequently the subjects of legal adjudication. The word \u201cat\u201d has been held equivalent to \u201cin,\u201d or \u201cwithin\u201d to \u201cin,\u201d or \u201cnear\u201d to \u201cinto.\u201d In Louisiana it was held, that \u201cat the parish of Caddo\u201d was equivalent to \u201cin the parish of Caddo.\u201d The State v. Nolan, 8 Rob. (La.), 517. In this State the expression \u201cat the county\u201d was held equivalent to \u201cin the county.\u201d Augustine v. The State, 20 Texas, 450. Mr. Bishop says it is immaterial whether \u201cin\u201d or \u201cat\u201d is used in the allegation of place in an indictment. 1 Bish. Crim. Proc., sec. 378. See, also, 1 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, p. 890; 10 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, p. 322. The nse of the word \u201cat\u201d for \u201cin\u201d in alleging place in the information does no violence to the meaning or language of the statute under which it was framed. We are of opinion the information is a valid one. Willson\u2019s Crim. Forms, No. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\">The evidence shows the assault to have been committed upon the minister in a congregation of people assembled for religious worship, and pending such services. The congregation were assembled under a brush arbor, a few steps from the school house. This arbor seemed to have been constructed for the purpose of being used in cases of emergency, and in connection with and as part of the school house, and was being so used at the time for the purpose of carrying on a protracted service. Because the religious services were not being conducted in the house, but under the arbor, it is contended that there is a variance between the allegations in the information and the proof advanced. The same question was presented by special requested instructions, which were refused by the court. We are of opinion that the rulings of the court were correct in overruling the objections to the evidence as well as refusing to give the requested charges. The evidence sufficiently corresponds td the allegations in the information, and does not constitute a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Moreland, a witness for the prosecution, was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel if he knew defendant\u2019s general reputation for being a peaceable, quiet, law-abiding citizen in the neighborhood where he resided. He replied that he did, and it was good. ' The State\u2019s counsel then inquired if he had ever heard of defendant disturbing religious worship before. This was objected to by defendant, but the witness replied before the court ruled on the objection, and his reply was in the affirmative. The court then said in the presence of the jury that both answers were inadmissible, and should not be considered by the jury. The previous trouble of the defendant in disturbing religious worship was testified to by himself; therefore, any supposed error in this respect was waived. We are of opinion that the court did not err in excluding the evidence of reputation, for, if error at all, it was harmless, under the facts of this case, inasmuch as the defendant admitted the commission of the act charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The court charged the jury properly with reference to the penalty, and then proceeded to tell them, \u201cIf you find the defendant guilty and assess his punishment at a fine only, the form of your verdict will be, 'We, the jury, find the defendant E. Blackwell guilty as charged, and assess his punishment at a fine of $500,\u2019 filling in the amount agreed upon.\u201d The verdict was for the sum of $500. There are two inconsistent penalties stated in the charge, the one correctly presenting the law, while the other states a penalty unknown to the law. The statute does not prescribe a penalty of $500 as the punishment of aggravated assault. We are of opinion this is such error as requires a reversal of the judgment. We are asked also to reverse the judgment because the verdict was excessive and cruel. We will not discuss the evidence, but will say that we do not agree with counsel for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">For the error indicated, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
