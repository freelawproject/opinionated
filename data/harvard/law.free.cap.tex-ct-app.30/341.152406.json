Bennett at the time the witness Friar says he saw them in his pasture in the afternoon of the 31st of December, A. D. 1889, the defendant should be acquitted.\u201d This was the only charge upon the subject, and it was specially excepted to, and a bill reserved. Under the facts of this case the charge is wrong, because the defendant may not have been at Ed. Bennett\u2019s at the time Friar said he saw them in his pasture, and yet they may have been at Ed. Bennett\u2019s place at such a time as rendered it altogether improbable that they were at the place in the pasture at the time Friar said they were. When considered with reference to the evidence relating to <em>alibi </em>in this case, the above charge was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">Under no state of facts could a charge upon <em>alibi </em>be correct which requires the jury to believe the proof of <em>alibi </em>before they can acquit. By the charge in the indictment, the State asserts that the defendant was the man, or one of the men, who stole the cow. By his plea of not guilty, defendant says that he was not. The State has the affirmative, and the burden of proof is upon the State to prove that he was. Friar swears that defendant was one of the mem To rebut this, evidence was adduced tending to show, and for the purpose of showing, that defendant was somewhere else, and not at the place of the theft at the time the cow was taken or killed. The burden being on the State to show his presence at the place of the theft, all evidence tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>prove that he was elsewhere tends to negative and disprove his presence at the place of the crime; and the jury are not required to believe that the proof establishes <em>alibi </em>in order to acquit. The evidence in support of <em>alibi </em>may be such as simply to raise a reasonable donbt of guilt, and in that event the defendant may be acquitted. Walker v.
