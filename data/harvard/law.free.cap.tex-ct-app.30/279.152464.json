Habeas Corpus\u2014Bail.\u2014Where on a trial on a <em>habeas corjpus </em>for bail, after an indictment for murder, it appeared from the testimony that applicant entered the house asking and seeking for the deceased and threatening to kill him, and having found deceased made an assault upon him, striking him over the head with his pistol, and while applicant and deceased were engaged in a scuffle two other parties rushed into the house and perhaps fired the fatal shot which killed the deceased; <em>held, </em>that bail was properly refused, notwithstanding the evidence failed to show a conspiracy and acting together between applicant and the other two parties. Under such state of case it would be a strained conclusion that two or more parties would meet at the same time and place, at the dead of night, join in committing the same act, disappear immediately thereafter, and yet not be presumed to have been acting together for a common purpose with a common intent, simply because no witnesses could prove the previously formed design to commit the act, or prove the fact that they fled together as conspirators after the consummation of the act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b305-11\">2. Habeas Corpus \u2014 Burden of Proof.\u2014Where one is separately indicted for murder, and the proof shows that others not joined with him or not indicted at all were equally guilty in the commission of the crime, if not the actual perpetrators, it is held that applicant can not complain that the principal facts which inculpate him as a principal offender are not alleged in the indictment, nor that the burden is upon the State to show him to be a principal offender. The burden of proof is upon the applicant to show that he is entitled to bail.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Appeal from the District Court of Brazoria. Tried below before Hon. W. H. Burkhart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-4\">Appellant was indicted June 19, 1891, for the murder of one Grant Hash, alleged to have been committed by him on or about the 20th day of September, 1890. On the 22d day of June, 1891, he applied for and obtained a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>from Hon. W. H. Burkhart, judge of the Twenty-third Judicial District, during the June term of the District Court of Brazoria County, then in session. The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was heard in term time, June 22, 1891, by said judge, who after hearing the same refused the applicant bail and remanded him to custody. On the 2d day of July, 1891, appellant filed his motion for rehearing on said writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>which motion having been heard and overruled by the court applicant prosecutes this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The judgment refusing bail to this relator is affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">Ann Pitman, the first witness, testified in substance as follows: That Mr. Johnson came to her father\u2019s house during the night.

On Saturday night Johnson came and witness was asleep. Witness\u2019 wife woke him and said Johnson was calling him. I asked him if that was Mr. Johnson, and he said yes. He asked if I had a match, and not having a match, I went to the door with a piece of fire. He shoved the door open and came in. He asked if Grant (deceased) was in. When I told him I did not know, he went to the bed, looked, and not finding him in it, looked under the bed. Grant was under it, and as Grant ran out from under it Johnson grabbed him. They scuffled into the back room. Witness heard no shooting in the back room. While they were scuffling in the back room a white man came up on the gallery, and when he got up on the gallery he shot once. And when I asked him not to shoot me he ran up to me with his pistol in . his hand\u2014held it up over me.

Duff, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alf\">filed a printed brief and able argument upon two assignments of error, which are as follows: 1. The proof of defendant\u2019s guilt not being evident, the court erred in refusing him bail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\">2. The indictment charging that the applicant did kill and murder Grant Hash by \u201cshooting him with a pistol,\u201d and the proof upon an application for bail showing that the applicant was not the actor and did not do the shooting, the applicant is entitled to bail, and if the State seeks to have this privilege denied him by reason of his being a principal under article 74 of the Penal Code, the burden of proof is on the State to show the act and intent which thus made him a principal offender, and it was error in the court holding that the burden of proof was upon the applicant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">He adopted his second assignment as a proposition, and in addition thereto submitted the following, viz.: \u201cIn order to render the applicant guilty as a principal the proof must show a combination of two things, to-wit, the abetting acts and intents. Failing in either of these essentials, the evidence is not such as justifies a court on application for bail in refusing the same.\u201d Citing as authorities: Ex Parte Smith, 23 Texas Ct. App., 123; Bx Parte Boyett, 19 Texas Ct. App., 45; Ex Parte Randon, 12 Texas Ct. App., 145; Guffee v. The State, 8 Texas Ct. App., 187.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-10\"><em>R. H. Harrison, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b308-11\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Apc\">The indictment in this case charges the relator alone with the murder of one Grant Hash. Hpon the trial for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>bail it was developed that other parties were present at the time of and engaged in the killing, and fired the fatal shot while the relator was beating the deceased with a pistol. How the parties reached the domicile of deceased is not shown, nor is it made to appear whether they went there together or each by himself. Appellant knocked at the door, was admitted, pulled out his pistol, and began to hunt for deceased and threatened to kill him. He finally, after searching for deceased, found him under the bed. Deceased, upon his whereabouts being discovered, ran into an adjoining room, where he was met by another party who shot at him. He returned in the direction of the relator, who began inflicting blows upon him with his pistol, and while so doing the third party ran up and shot deceased to death. The relator and the other parties immediately left the premises. The killing occurred at night. On this state of the case the trial court refused bail and the relator appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Appellant contends that the facts do not constitute him a principal offender as to the killing, and inasmuch as he is not jointly indicted with others, and because the particular acts and facts which inculpate him as a principal offender are not alleged in the indictment, that therefore the burden is upon the State to show that he is a principal offender. The burden of proof is upon the appellant to show that he is entitled to bail. Ex Parte Smith, 23 Texas Ct. App., 100. This is equally the case whether the indictment charges the offense severally or jointly against the parties. In such a state of case the allegation will not affect the rule as to the burden of proof, whether the indictment be several or joint. This question was not raised below, because the only evidence adduced was that taken on the examining trial, and upon this evidence the parties rested their case by agreement. Because the facts do not in terms show an actual agreement to kill the deceased, and do not show that the parties to the killing went to and left the place of the homicide in company with each other, we are asked to presume that their meeting there was accidental, and that while there they acted with different intents in committing the homicide, and because appellant did not shoot deceased when he had the opportunity to do so, that therefore he was not a principal offender with the actual slayer. These suggestions are too finely drawn to be based on the facts of the case. It would be a strained conclusion to reach that two or more parties would meet at the same time and place at the dead of night, join in committing the same act, disappear immediately thereafter, and yet not be presumed guilty of acting together, for a common purpose, with a common intent, and in pursuance of a common design, simply because there was no witness who could prove the previously formed design to commit the act or prove the fact that they fled together as conspirators after the consummation of the act. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>such movements there is too much method for accidental theories. We deem it improper to comment upon the facts. The judgment, being correct, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Hurt, J., absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
