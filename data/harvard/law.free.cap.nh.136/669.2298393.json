Dexter, was charged with negligent homicide after a one-car accident that resulted in the death of a passenger in her car. After a jury trial, she was found not guilty of negligent homicide and guilty of the lesser included offense of driving while intoxicated. The sole issue she raises on appeal is the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Temple, </em>J.) denial of her post-trial motion for attorney\u2019s fees, based on alleged misconduct of the prosecutor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">The defendant does not base her claim for attorney\u2019s fees on the lack of merit of the State\u2019s case, nor upon any unwarranted intransigence or obstinacy by the State in its substantive legal positions. Her claim does not reflect upon the fact of the State\u2019s prosecution, but rather upon the county attorney\u2019s management of it. Lawyer conduct in case management and trial tactics underlies her claim for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>In support of her claim, the defendant relies upon the following instances of conduct: failing to turn over police reports as part of court-ordered discovery; purposely delaying simulation testing by the State\u2019s accident reconstruction expert in order to deny defense discovery of the expert\u2019s opinions; attempting to convict the defendant on false evidence provided by the State\u2019s expert; the county attorney\u2019s refusing to disqualify himself when, by participating in the simulation testing, he became a potential witness; and the county attorney\u2019s granting of an eve-of-trial interview with the press, resulting in his disqualification by the court. The defendant\u2019s additional passing reference in her brief to alleged abuse of defense witnesses by the county attorney requires no discussion. <em>See Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 499, 543 A.2d 1379, 1382 (1988) (\u201cglancing character\u201d of defendant\u2019s treatment of claim \u201cwarrants no extended consideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Relying upon <em>Harkeem v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 687, 377 A.2d 617 (1977), the defendant argued below that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was \u201cin bad faith, vexatious, wanton and oppressive\u201d so as to be \u201cunreasonably obdurate or obstinate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691, 377 A.2d at 619. The trial court refused to award fees, noting that it did not \u201cfind ... that the actions of the County Attorney were as characterized above.\u201d Instead, the court stated, \u201c[b]oth attorneys were observed by the Court to be aggressive with one another.\u201d The court noted that when the defendant brought to its attention \u201cmatters of discovery, expert discovery and delay in testing,\u201d the issues were \u201cruled upon and no sanctions resulted.\u201d In addition, the court pointed out the remedies the defendant did receive: the delay in expert testing resulted in a trial delay to allow further preparation by the defense; the State was deprived of the use of its expert in rebuttal while the defendant was able to use the expert\u2019s deposition to confront prosecution witnesses; and the county attorney was disqualified after speaking with the press, with the trial going forward with an assistant county attorney without further delay. The court explained: \u201cThrough the period of pretrial activity, none of the conduct was found to justify such drastic action as dismissal or disciplinary action such as contempt or the awarding of costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">While the general rule is that each party pays his or her own counsel fees in the absence of statute, we have recognized exceptions, such as \u201cwhere litigation is instituted or unnecessarily prolonged through a party\u2019s oppressive, vexatious, arbitrary, capricious or bad faith conduct,\u201d <em>St. Germain v. Adams, </em>117 N.H. 659, 662, 377 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>A.2d 620, 623 (1977), where a party\u2019s conduct is \u201cunreasonably obdurate or obstinate, and . . . [wjhere an individual is forced to seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined and established right, which should have been freely enjoyed without such intervention ...,\u201d <em>Harkeem, </em>117 N.H. at 691, 377 A.2d at 619 (citations omitted), and, in rare instances, where the court in the exercise of its duty of supervising attorneys has held that an attorney may be liable for his or her own client\u2019s legal expense, <em>Stephenson v. Stephenson, </em>111 N.H. 189, 196, 278 A.2d 351, 356 (1971); <em>Hines v. Donovan, </em>101 N.H. 239, 244, 139 A.2d 884, 888 (1958); Doleac, <em>Court Awarded Attorneys Fees Under New Hampshire Common Law, </em>17 N.H.B.J. 134, 141 (1976). We have never addressed the question whether fees are awardable against the prosecution in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The defendant concedes that under <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409 (1976), she has no right of action for attorney\u2019s fees against the county attorney himself, as absolute immunity cloaks a prosecutor for acts performed in the conduct of a criminal prosecution. Since briefing and argument in this case, we expressly held in <em>Belcher v. Paine, </em>136 N.H. 137, 612 A.2d 1318 (1992), what we portended in <em>State (Haas Complainant) v. Rollins, </em>129 N.H. 684, 533 A.2d 331 (1987); namely, that \u201cprosecutorial immunity exists within the rubric of judicial immunity and is absolute when functionally related to the initiation of criminal process or to the prosecution of criminal charges.\u201d <em>Belcher, </em>136 N.H. at 147, 612 A.2d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Acknowledging the personal immunity of the prosecutor, the defendant nonetheless argues she is entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees from Strafford County, which she assumes employs the county attorney. The defendant, however, cites no authority for imputing liability to the county. Holding the governmental employer liable would not be consistent with the policy underlying the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity, that of shielding a prosecutor from the \u201c \u2018deflection of [his] energies from his public duties and the possibility that he would shade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\u2019\u201d <em>Belcher, </em>136 N.H. at 145, 612 A.2d at 1323-24 (quoting <em>Imbler, </em>424 U.S. at 423). \u201c[Prosecutors] could not exercise independent discretion if they had to fear retribution from the government that would have to pay the judgment.\u201d <em>Tilton v. Dougherty, </em>126 N.H. 294, 299, 493 A.2d 442, 445-46 (1985); <em>cf. </em>RSA 541-B:19, 1(a) (Supp. 1992) (limited waiver of sovereign immunity for State, its officials and employees not applicable to claim based on exercise of judicial function).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>We therefore hold that, as to the actions complained of that were functionally related to the prosecution of the defendant\u2019s case, attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable. All of the alleged misconduct, except for the prosecutor\u2019s press interview, falls within this area of immunity. <em>See Schrob v. Catterson, </em>948 F.2d 1402, 1420 (3d Cir. 1991) (talking to press is \u201cat best, only an administrative function\u201d). We will assume, without deciding, that the doctrine of sovereign immunity would not bar an attorney\u2019s fees award against the government in these circumstances and that <em>Harkeem </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"> When the county attorney\u2019s comments to the press were brought to the trial court\u2019s attention, the judge disqualified him from prosecuting the case. In ruling on the motion for fees, the trial court found that the county attorney\u2019s actions were not \u201cin bad faith, vexatious, wanton and oppressive so as to be fairly characterized as \u2018unreasonably [o]bdurate or obstinate.\u2019\u201d Because a trial judge witnessing the proceedings firsthand \u201cmay have insights not conveyed by the record,\u201d <em>Maguire v. Merrimack Mut. Ins. Co., </em>133 N.H. 51, 55, 573 A.2d 451, 454 (1990) (quotations omitted), we accord great deference to his decision whether bad faith or unreasonableness drives a party in the litigation such as to justify imposing on that party the cost of his opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. That deference constrains us to uphold the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion unless it appears that the discretion was \u201cexercised for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable to the prejudice of the objecting party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 573 A.2d at 454 (citation and quotations omitted). Here, the trial judge took remedial action against the county attorney for speaking with the press and concluded that the predicate for awarding fees was absent. We cannot say that this conclusion was clearly untenable or unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Finally, we note that in this court the defendant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees is made against Strafford County while in superior court she sought fees from the State. Given our disposition above, we need not decide whether the defendant\u2019s failure to name Strafford County as a party to the action would defeat any claim for fees from the county. Additionally, we also need not decide, even assuming fees were recoverable, whether fees were properly recoverable from the State or the county. <em>Compare </em>R. MCNAMARA, 1 NEW HAMPSHIRE Practice, Criminal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 12, at 10 (2d ed. 1991) (\u201cThe county attorney of each county is under the direction of the Attorney General, and performs all the duties of the Attorney General\u2019s Office for the county.\u201d) <em>and </em>RSA 7:6, :34 <em>with </em>RSA 23:5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>(county attorney paid by county); <em>cf. Samaha v. Grafton County, </em>126 N.H. 583, 493 A.2d 1207 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
