On appeal, he argues that the Trial Court <em>(Murphy, </em>J.) abused its discretion in denying his motion for a bill of particulars. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">The defendant contends that he was entitled to a bill of particulars because he was charged with a course of conduct involving three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>different types of penetration over a period of time. The indictment alleged, in pertinent part, that \u201cbetween April 1, 1989 and January 31, 1990\u201d the defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cdid knowingly engage in a course of conduct of sexual penetration with a person, not his legal spouse, who was thirteen (13) years of age or older and under sixteen (16) years of age and was related to the other person by blood; in that, Lee Demond did engage in sexual intercourse, by putting his penis into the vagina, cunnilingus and digital penetration, by placing his finger into the vagina, with a female juvenile ..., said female juvenile being his daughter . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The defendant moved for a bill of particulars, arguing \u201cthat the defendant [must] know to a more exacting time, when said alleged conduct happened in order to prepare a proper defense.\u201d No record exists of a hearing, if one occurred, on the motion, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cThe exact date of the assault is not an element of the aggravated felonious sexual assault crime.\u201d <em>State v. Tynan, </em>132 N.H. 461, 464, 566 A.2d 1142, 1143 (1989). \u201cWhere no defense is possible on the basis of the victim\u2019s age, or the statute of limitations, a defendant generally has no basis for complaining that the indictment fails to allege a precise date, absent a showing that the inexactness raises a possibility of prejudice specific to him.\u201d <em>State v. Lakin, </em>128 N.H. 639, 640, 517 A.2d 846, 847 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The defendant, in his motion, made no specific claim of need for the exact date in order to avoid prejudice, nor does he on appeal. He asserted below only a generalized need for \u201ca more exacting time ... in order to prepare a proper defense.\u201d This does not meet the requisite \u201cshowing that the inexactness raises a possibility of prejudice specific to him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The defendant in his brief also argues that an allegation of the exact date was necessary in order to protect him against double jeopardy arising from a future prosecution. Nothing in his motion for a bill of particulars, however, mentions a double jeopardy concern. If more was presented to the trial court at a hearing on his motion, it has not come before us. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s burden in this court is to provide us with a record upon which relief may be granted.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>136 N.H. 42, 46, 611 A.2d 630, 632 (1992). Not having demonstrated that he raised this issue below, the defendant is precluded from obtaining appellate review. <em>See Reynolds v. Cunningham, </em>131 N.H. 312, 314-15, 556 A.2d 300, 302 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number> The decision whether to grant a motion for a bill of particulars lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Tynan, </em>132 N.H. at 464, 566 A.2d at 1144. Only if a defendant can show that the court\u2019s ruling was \u201cclearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case,\u201d <em>id. </em>(quotation omitted), will we find an abuse of discretion. Our review of the trial record leads us to conclude that no such abuse occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
