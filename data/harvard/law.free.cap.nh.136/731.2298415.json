Roberts, was convicted of three counts of witness tampering under RSA 641:5 (1986). We consider the merits of: (1) whether the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction over a witness tampering count alleging acts that occurred in Canada; (2) whether admission of hearsay statements made by a decedent to a drug counselor and a psychologist was improper under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(4) or violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights; (3) whether the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights or abused its discretion by allowing a witness to assert the privilege against self-incrimination on cross-examination, even though the witness had not asserted the privilege in a pretrial deposition; and (4) whether the trial court should have excluded evidence of the defendant\u2019s homosexual relationship with the target of his acts of witness tampering. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">The defendant\u2019s witness tampering convictions arose out of his relationship with Gregory Bryar, II, a seventeen-year-old witness identified in underlying indictments charging the defendant with obscenity, prostitution, and conspiracy to acquire cocaine. The defendant offered a car, money, and an apartment in Canada to induce Bryar to avoid testifying for the State in the underlying prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Sometime before March 1987, the defendant, who was about forty-three years old, met Bryar, who was a high school sophomore. Bryar had a history of drug and alcohol abuse. Testimony at trial indicated that the defendant offered Bryar drugs and money in exchange for sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">In March 1987, the State Police began investigating the relationship between Bryar and the defendant. In April 1987, the district court found Bryar to be delinquent and ordered him to enter the Nathan Brody Chemical Dependency Center (Nathan Brody). At Nathan Brody, Bryar was diagnosed as suffering from drug and alcohol dependency and was treated for substance abuse. During his thirty-day residential treatment at Nathan Brody in April and May 1987, Bryar participated in private therapy with Claire Trottier, an alcohol and drug counselor. The probation officer who brought Bryar to Nathan Brody had alerted Trottier to the ongoing investigation into Bryar\u2019s relationship with the defendant. During sessions with Trottier, Bryar admitted to having had sexual relations with the defendant, and to having received cocaine and money for cocaine from the defendant in exchange for sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In early May 1987, Bryar contacted the police about his relationship with the defendant. In late May, the State Police searched the defendant\u2019s home and arrested him for drug possession and obscenity. In June 1987, the defendant was indicted on charges including prostitution (transporting Bryar to engage in sex for consideration), obscenity (showing an explicit film to a minor male child identified by Bryar\u2019s birthdate), and conspiracy (providing Bryar money and transportation to acquire cocaine). All of these indictments identified Bryar as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In early September 1987, the defendant, Bryar, and Bryar\u2019s friend Scott Shedd went to Montreal. Shedd heard the defendant offer Bryar an apartment in Canada to enable him to avoid testifying in the pending \u201ccase\u201d against the defendant. Shedd also heard the defendant offer Bryar money and a car so that Bryar would change his testimony. There is evidence that the defendant purchased a car in September 1987. He originally noted that he was buying it for Bryar, but later changed the title application to reflect his own ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">In October 1987, Bryar was arrested for attempted extortion from the defendant and was placed in a residential treatment program at Beech Hill Hospital (Beech Hill). At Beech Hill, Bryar was diagnosed as suffering from psychological disorders related to his relationship with the defendant. Bryar participated in private therapy with Dr. Kathleen Bollerud, a psychologist. During sessions in Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>ber and November 1987, Bryar discussed with Bollerud his relationship with the defendant and expressed anger and confusion over the defendant\u2019s inducements not to testify. Bryar met with a police officer while he was at Beech Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In December 1987, the defendant was indicted on witness tampering charges for attempting to induce Bryar to change his testimony or to elude process by offering him a car, money, and an apartment in Canada. Bryar was not available to testify at the witness tampering trial, and all of the underlying cases were ultimately <em>not prossed </em>because Bryar killed himself in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In a pair of pretrial rulings after Bryar\u2019s death, the Superior Court (O\u2019Neil, J.) accepted a waiver of privilege by the administrator of Bryar\u2019s estate and found under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(4) that Trottier and Bollerud could testify to Bryar\u2019s statements revealing the defendant\u2019s provision of drugs or money for sex and concerning the defendant\u2019s promises of a car, money, and an apartment. The Trial Court (Mohl, J.) did not alter these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">\n<em>I. Territorial Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">We first consider whether the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction over an indictment charging that believing \u201can official proceeding was pending or about to be initiated,\u201d the defendant attempted to induce Bryar \u201cto elude legal process ... by taking [him] to Canada and offering to rent an apartment in Canada.\u201d The record indicates that the defendant offered to rent an apartment in Canada for Bryar, so that he could avoid testifying. The defendant argues that the trial court lacked territorial jurisdiction because the indictment charged acts that occurred in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">The defendant raised his jurisdictional argument in a motion to dismiss after the State rested. This motion was denied. The defendant renewed his argument in a post trial motion to dismiss, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Under the State Criminal Code, territorial jurisdiction is defined, for purposes of this discussion, as follows: \u201c[A] person may be convicted under the laws of this state for any offense committed by his own conduct\u201d if \u201c[c]onduct occurring outside this state constitutes an attempt to commit an offense under the laws of this state and the purpose is that the offense take place within this state.\u201d RSA 625:4, 1(b) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">The criminal act prosecuted under the witness tampering statute and charged in the indictment at issue is the <em>attempt </em>\u201cto induce or otherwise cause a person\u201d to \u201c[e]lude legal process,\u201d with the belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>that an \u201cofficial proceeding ... is pending or about to be instituted.\u201d RSA 641:5, 1(c) (1986). The record clearly shows that the defendant knew that an official proceeding was pending against him, prior to the September 1987 trip to Canada, because he had been indicted in June 1987 and had entered not guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"> We find the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional argument unavailing. Whether the defendant\u2019s attempt to induce or otherwise cause Bryar to elude legal process took place in New Hampshire, in Canada, or both, is of no consequence. The fact remains that the defendant was attempting to pervert New Hampshire\u2019s system of justice by distorting the fact finding function of our courts. The witness tampering statute \u201cprotects an important public interest in discovering the truth in official proceedings and investigations.\u201d <em>State v. Kilgus, </em>125 N.H. 739, 745, 484 A.2d 1208, 1213 (1984). The defendant\u2019s conduct, wherever it took place, was intended to frustrate the discovery of the truth in New Hampshire. <em>See Pennington v. State, </em>308 Md. 727, 746, 521 A.2d 1216, 1225 (1987). We hold that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions because the defendant\u2019s conduct vested territorial jurisdiction in this State under RSA 625:4, 1(b) as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">\n<em>H. Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Bryar\u2019s statements, which were admitted through testimony of Trottier and Bollerud for the truth of their assertions, constitute hearsay. N.H. R. Ev. 801. The statements at issue concern the defendant\u2019s identity and the promises he made to induce Bryar to elude process or testify falsely. The defendant contends that admission of this hearsay violated his right of confrontation under the State and Federal Constitutions, and that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(4). We analyze the constitutional question first because we assume that the constitutional requirement that there be \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>135 N.H. 655, 662, 610 A.2d 800, 802 (1992) (quotation omitted), is more rigorous than the requirement in New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 803(4) that there be \u201ccircumstances indicating\u201d the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d of the hearsay statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Consistent with <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 471 A.2d 347, 351 (1983), we analyze the constitutional claims advanced by the defendant by considering first whether admitting the hearsay statements in this case violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under part I, article 15 of the State Constitution. Part I, article 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>prevents the admission of \u201chearsay implicating a person other than the declarant\u201d unless there are \u201c \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019\u201d <em>Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 662, 610 A.2d at 804 (quoting <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66 (1980)); <em>see also State v. McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. 669, 673, 610 A.2d 809, 811 (1992). This requirement ensures that \u201c\u2018adversarial testing would add little\u2019\u201d to the reliability of the hearsay. <em>Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 662, 610 A.2d at 804 (quoting <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 821 (1990)); <em>see also McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. at 673, 610 A.2d at 811. Here, as in <em>McLaughlin </em>and <em>Cook, </em>the declarant\u2019s availability is not at issue. <em>See McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. at 672, 610 A.2d at 811; <em>Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 662, 610 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\"> Our standard of review is whether the trial court\u2019s determination of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness is clearly erroneous. <em>See Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 662, 610 A.2d at 805. In this case, the trial court identified four factors that represent \u201cample indicia of reliability\u201d surrounding Bryar\u2019s statements to Trottier and Bollerud: (1) Bryar made the statements in confidence to persons providing his treatment rather than to the police; (2) Bryar had an \u201copen and honest, professional relationship\u201d with Trottier and Bollerud; (3) Bryar cried spontaneously for twenty minutes when he first admitted to having had a sexual relationship with the defendant; and (4) the statements revealing the defendant\u2019s identity and his sexual relationship with Bryar placed Bryar \u201cin a light where others may look' unfavorably upon him.\u201d We note that the first three of these factors resemble those that we identified as guarantees of reliability in <em>McLaughlin </em>and <em>Cook. See McLaughlin, </em>135 N.H. at 674, 610 A.2d at 812 (statements made in benign setting); <em>Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 664, 610 A.2d at 806 (statements made spontaneously and reported to trusted persons). The fourth factor, that Bryar identified th\u00e9 defendant as a person with whom he had had a homosexual relationship, also bears on the reliability of his statements. The record reflects that Bryar was afraid of being considered homosexual; a logical inference is that he would not have concocted a story that would enable Trottier and Bollerud to question his sexual preference. We conclude that the trial court properly found particularized guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to satisfy the requirements of part I, article 15 of the State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court did not properly consider Bryar\u2019s tentative commitment to court-ordered therapy, revenge motives, and manipulative behavior. The record supports the court\u2019s finding that none of these facts fatally impugned the reliability of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>statements. Bryar participated in private therapy in the inpatient programs and made statements to Trottier and Bollerud to obtain medical treatment. That he had been assured of the confidentiality of his therapy diminished the risk that he fabricated statements to seek revenge by incriminating the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Furthermore, the record supports the conclusion that Bryar did not make statements to manipulate Trottier and Bollerud. Bollerud\u2019s testimony indicates that she did not find Bryar manipulative. Bryar discussed with Trottier and Bollerud details of subjects that were painful to him, including his homosexual relationship with the defendant. Bryar\u2019s initial reaction to Trottier\u2019s inquiry on whether he had been sexually abused by the defendant was twenty minutes of spontaneous crying. This spontaneous, emotional outburst when the defendant\u2019s name first arose diminished the risk that Bryar calculated the effect of admitting to a sexual relationship with the defendant. Even if Bryar arguably believed his conversations with the police improved his chances of receiving a lenient disposition of outstanding charges against him, there is no reason to conclude that he had similar expectations for his confidential statements to Trottier and Bollerud. We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s contentions that Trottier and Bollerud improperly disclosed information to the police, and that Bryar improved his status at Nathan Brody or Beech Hill by incriminating the defendant. All relevant facts support the trial court\u2019s finding that Bryar\u2019s allegedly manipulative behavior did not undermine the reliability of his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The defendant\u2019s last contention is that the trial court improperly considered the therapists\u2019 testimony that Bryar appeared truthful. Assuming for the sake of argument that the defendant\u2019s contention is correct, we nevertheless observe that the trial court found in the four factors noted above ample particularized guarantees of trustworthiness of Bryar\u2019s statements to Trottier and Bollerud, and we conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 662, 610 A.2d at 805. For this reason, we hold that the admission of Bryar\u2019s statements incriminating the defendant did not violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under part I, article 15 of the State Constitution. Because part I, article 15 affords this defendant at least as much protection from an unconstitutional admission of hearsay as the sixth amendment, <em>cf. White v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 n.8, 112 S. Ct. 736, 742 n.8 (1992) (holding that Rule 803(4) hearsay exception is \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d for sixth amendment purposes), we need not embark on an independent federal constitutional analysis. <em>See Cook, </em>135 N.H. at 661, 610 A.2d at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Finding no constitutional infirmity in the trial court\u2019s ruling, we consider whether the court properly applied Rule 803(4). Rule 803(4) carves out an exception to the rule against hearsay for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\">\u201c[statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment, regardless of to whom the statements are made, or when the statements are made, if the court, in its discretion, affirmatively finds that the proffered statements were made under circumstances indicating their trustworthiness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">N.H. R. Ev. 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> There are three areas of inquiry for a court applying Rule 803(4): the declarant\u2019s intent, <em>see State v. Woods, </em>130 N.H. 721, 729, 546 A.2d 1073, 1077-78 (1988); the subject matter of the statements; and whether there are circumstances indicating the trustworthiness of the statements. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 803(4). Whether the statements were made to a physician, a psychologist, or a trained drug counselor is irrelevant, so long as the statements qualify for admission, under the rule. <em>See id. </em>The trial court has discretion in applying Rule 803(4), and we will not disturb a ruling unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Woods, </em>130 N.H. at 725, 546 A.2d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">A court must find first that the declarant intended to make the statements to obtain a medical diagnosis or treatment. <em>Id. </em>at 729, 546 A.2d at 1077-78. This finding may be based upon circumstantial evidence. <em>See State v. Gruber, </em>132 N.H. 83, 93, 562 A.2d 156, 162 (1989). During private therapy with Trottier and Bollerud, Bryar revealed the defendant\u2019s identity. He also disclosed to Bollerud his anxiety over the promises that th\u00e9 defendant had made to induce him not to cooperate in prosecution of the underlying charges. Bryar was sent to Nathan Brody and Beech Hill for diagnosis and treatment, and was aware of the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes of his private dialogues with Trottier and Bollerud. Bryar was able to acknowledge the dimensions of his drug abuse and mental health problems while at Nathan Brody and Beech Hill. Although he did not always adhere to the treatment regimens, both Trottier and Bollerud testified that he made progress in his therapy. Bollerud identified Bryar\u2019s developing ability to discuss with peers at Beech Hill his sexual relationship with the defendant as evidence of this progress, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>and she indicated that he appreciated the progress he was making. These facts support an inference that Bryar intended to make the statements at issue for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Because Bryar\u2019s therapy at Nathan Brody and Beech Hill was court-ordered, and because he expressed a desire to seek revenge against the defendant while he was at Beech Hill, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that Bryar made the statements with an intent to obtain a medical diagnosis or treatment. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that these facts do not offer conclusive proof of Bryar\u2019s intent. Although one can infer that a person who voluntarily visits a doctor intends to obtain medical attention, there is no necessary inference that a person placed by authorities in detoxification and treatment has no intent to secure a medical diagnosis or treatment. That the treatment was court-ordered does not negate a conclusion that the declarant made statements to obtain a medical diagnosis or treatment. In this case, the evidence indicating that Bryar participated in and successfully completed the in-patient programs at Nathan Brody and Beech Hill supports the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Furthermore, Bryar\u2019s disclosure at Beech Hill of a desire to seek revenge against the defendant does not imply that he had no intent to obtain medical assistance. Bryar knew that his dialogue with Bollerud was confidential, and that nothing he said about the defendant would be disclosed without his permission. There is no indication that Bryar asked or expected Bollerud to release his statements incriminating the defendant. Bryar revealed his rage and revenge fantasies to Bollerud in response to her attempts to explore his intrusive thoughts. These thoughts afflicted him during the day and disrupted his sleep at night. We conclude that the trial court did not err in inferring from all relevant facts that Bryar intended to make the statements to obtain medical diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">To be admissible, the statements must describe medical history, or symptoms, pain, sensations, or their cause or source to an extent \u201creasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 803(4). Statements assigning fault for an injury are not generally pertinent to treatment, and statements identifying the person who allegedly harmed a plaintiff or victim are generally inadmissible. <em>See United States v. Renville, </em>779 F.2d 430, 436 (8th Cir. 1985). Courts have admitted the testimony of psychologists and physicians concerning statements made by patients regarding the identity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>perpetrator, if such statements are medically necessary for treatment or diagnosis of sexual abuse and other psychiatric or emotional disorders. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 436-39 (sexual abuse); <em>State v. Wyss, </em>124 Wis. 2d 681, 707-11, 370 N.W.2d 745, 757-59 (1985) (anxiety), <em>overruled on other grounds by State v. Poellinger, </em>153 Wis. 2d 493, 451 N.W.2d 752 (1990); <em>see also </em>2 MCCORMICK ON EVIDENCE \u00a7 278, at 251-52 (J. Strong 4th ed. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Bryar was treated for alcohol and drug dependence at Nathan Brody. According to Trottier, there is a psychological component to treatment for alcohol and drug addiction. Although Trottier indicated that she has had no formal training in the treatment of sexual abuse, she stated that it is important for treatment for a drug and alcohol therapist to inquire into the drug addict\u2019s sexual relationships, particularly if the sexual partner has been a source of drugs, or has sexually abused the addict. Trottier testified that an important reason for identifying intimate associates who have supplied a substance abuser with drugs is to screen persons who may or may not be able to offer support during rehabilitation or treatment. In the context of confidential therapy with Trottier addressing his sexual relationships and drug suppliers, Bryar identified the defendant as a sexual partner and as a person who provided cocaine and money in exchange for sex. Trottier also testified that substance abusers may turn to drugs and alcohol to avoid dealing with traumatic incidents or relationships. Revealing these facts to Trottier and the police caused Bryar pain, but Trottier testified that this pain was therapeutic because he was able to \u201copen up\u201d and confront the trauma. On these facts, the trial court could properly find the statements about the defendant\u2019s identity not only descriptive of the cause or source of Bryar\u2019s symptoms or pain, but also reasonably pertinent to Trottier\u2019s treatment for the medical condition of chemical dependence.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">At Beech Hill, Bryar was diagnosed as suffering from and received treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adolescent judgment disorder, as well as drug and alcohol dependence. Bollerud testified that the central trauma precipitating Bryar\u2019s PTSD was his relationship with the defendant. Symptoms of PTSD include intrusive thoughts. Bryar explained to Bollerud during their confidential therapy sessions that he suffered from intrusive, disruptive thoughts about his sexual relationship with the defendant, and about how he should respond to the defendant\u2019s promises to induce him not to aid the State\u2019s investigation. According to Bollerud, ado<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>lescent judgment disorder manifests itself in an inability to respond appropriately to stressors. Bryar dropped out of school, an inappropriate response to stress, when his peers derided him for his homosexual relationship with the defendant. Bollerud\u2019s testimony indicated that it was important for diagnosis and treatment of Bryar that she know the defendant\u2019s name to ensure that Bryar was always speaking about the same person when he described the source of his intrusive thoughts and the cause of the inappropriate responses that were symptoms of his mental illness. On these facts, the trial court could find Bryar\u2019s statements about the defendant\u2019s identity and the promises he made to Bryar both descriptive of his symptoms and reasonably pertinent to her diagnosis and treatment of his PTSD and adolescent judgment disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqeq\">The final test under Rule 803(4) is whether circumstances indicate that the statements are trustworthy. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 803(4). Because we hold that there were sufficient \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d to satisfy the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation, we need not assess whether there were adequate \u201ccircumstances indicating their trustworthiness.\u201d We assume that the constitutional requirement, which applies only in criminal cases, is more rigorous than the evidentiary standard. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court properly applied Rule 803(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>III. Witness\u2019s Privilege and Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The next issue we address is whether the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation or abused its discretion by curtailing cross-examination of Scott Shedd. Defense counsel sought to impeach Shedd\u2019s credibility at trial by eliciting testimony that cocaine had impaired his memory. In a pretrial deposition, Shedd had not asserted the privilege against self-incrimination and had sworn that he had used drugs, and that his memory was \u201cvery, very unclear.\u201d At trial, Shedd testified that he had heard the defendant offer Bryar inducements not to testify, and that he had used marijuana and alcohol while he was with Bryar, but he asserted the privilege against self-incrimination in response to cross-examination questions on whether he had used cocaine. The trial court accepted Shedd\u2019s assertion of the privilege under part I, article 15 and the fifth amendment. The defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding Shedd unavailable for cross-examination relating to his use of cocaine, and that this finding violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Consistent with <em>Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 231, 471 A.2d at 351, we consider the defendant\u2019s confrontation clause arguments under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>part I, article 15 of the State Constitution. We refer to cases decided under the sixth amendment only to aid our State constitutional analysis. <em>See State v. Gravel, </em>135 N.H. 172, 176, 601 A.2d 678, 680 (1991). The opportunity to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility through cross-examination is an incident of rights guaranteed by part I, article 15 of the State Constitution. <em>See State v. Benoit, </em>126 N.H. 6, 21, 490 A.2d 295, 306 (1985); <em>cf. Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678 (1986); <em>Brown v. Powell, </em>975 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1992), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 113 S. Ct. 1035 (1993). Trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to limit the scope of cross-examination. <em>State v. Ramos, </em>121 N.H. 863, 866, 435 A.2d 1122, 1124 (1981); <em>cf. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 679. No constitutional violation results from a trial court\u2019s restrictions on questions designed to impeach credibility if defense counsel has been allowed to elicit from the witness \u201csufficient information ... from which the jury can adequately gauge the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Burke, </em>738 F.2d 1225, 1227 (11th Cir. 1984); <em>see also United States v. Kaplan, </em>832 F.2d 676, 683-84 (1st Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 907 (1988); <em>Ramos, </em>121 N.H. at 866-67, 435 A.2d at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In this case, defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into Shedd\u2019s credibility satisfied the requirements of part I, article 15. The jury could infer that Shedd used cocaine from his assertion of the privilege on the stand. <em>See Kaplan, </em>832 F.2d at 684 (\u201cThe invocation of the privilege acts as a form of impeachment.\u201d); <em>United States v. Seifert, </em>648 F.2d 557, 560-61 (9th Cir. 1980). Bollerud testified that cocaine impairs an abuser\u2019s memory. The jury actually heard Shedd read from his earlier deposition transcript that his use of \u201ca lot of drugs and alcohol\u201d during the relevant time period had rendered his memory \u201cvery, very unclear.\u201d At least thirty-six times, Shedd stated, \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t recall,\u201d or otherwise manifested memory defects in response to questions posed by counsel. The jury required no further information to conclude that drugs had impaired Shedd\u2019s ability to remember relevant events. We find no clear error of a constitutional magnitude in the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the witness\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination to curtail cross-examination on his use of cocaine. Because the sixth amendment does not offer this defendant protections exceeding those afforded by part I, article 15, we need not make a separate federal analysis in this case. <em>Cf. Brown, </em>975 F.2d at 5 (finding no error in trial court\u2019s limitation on cross-examination where jury could assess witness\u2019s bias and defendant was afforded minimum threshold level of inquiry).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>We next consider whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion in accepting Shedd\u2019s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination under the State and Federal Constitutions. The defendant argues that reversible error resulted from the trial court\u2019s failure to review Shedd\u2019s deposition testimony to determine whether Shedd could rely on the privilege at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The defendant\u2019s argument is unavailing, to the extent it suggests that the trial court erred by failing to examine Shedd\u2019s admissions in the deposition transcript. We need not consider this argument because we find that nothing in the pretrial deposition could have waived the witness\u2019s right to assert the privilege at trial. It is well-settled that after voluntarily revealing self-incriminating information, a witness may not assert the fifth amendment to squelch requests for elaboration. <em>See Rogers v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 367, 373 (1951). However, \u201c[i]t is hornbook law that the waiver [of the privilege] is limited to the particular proceeding in which the witness appears.\u201d <em>United States v. Cain, </em>544 F.2d 1113, 1117 (1st Cir. 1976). The majority rule preserves a witness\u2019s right to assert the privilege in subsequent, distinct stages of a single proceeding. <em>See United States v. Trejo-Zambrano, </em>582 F.2d 460, 464 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1005 (1978); <em>United States v. Johnson, 488 </em>F.2d 1206, 1210 (1st Cir. 1973) (noting that testimony before grand jury or other \u201cpreliminary and separate proceeding\u201d does not waive right to assert privilege at trial) (quotation omitted); 1 McCormick on Evidence, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 140, at 528; <em>cf. State v. Lavallee, </em>119 N.H. 207, 210, 400 A.2d 480, 482 (1979) (finding that witness could assert privilege to avoid testifying at trial on matters she addressed during probable cause hearing, despite her prior admission to court that she had perjured herself during probable cause hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The rule that a loss of privilege lasts no longer than the distinct stage at which the witness testified is \u201cconsistent with the spirit of the privilege,\u201d because it recognizes that a witness\u2019s admissions in a second appearance may exceed those previously made. 1 McCormick ON Evidence <em>supra; see also State v. Settle, </em>132 N.H. 626, 635, 570 A.2d 895, 900 (1990). Nothing in the record in this case, for example, indicates that Shedd previously testified to <em>specific instances of cocaine use, </em>as opposed to use of \u201ca lot of drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">More similar to an examination of a witness at trial than either a grand jury appearance or a pretrial exchange of affidavits, a deposition subjects a witness to timely, effective cross-examination under oath and generates a potentially admissible transcript that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>available to all parties. Cases finding that a waiver of the privilege extends beyond the stage of the case in which a witness was responsive either involve inapposite facts, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Parcels of Land, </em>903 F.2d 36, 43 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that interested party\u2019s affidavit opposed to motion for summary judgment and government\u2019s deposition to explore facts asserted in affidavit do not constitute distinct proceedings), or do not recognize that later assertions can offer further incriminating information, <em>see, e.g., Ellis v. United States, </em>416 F.2d 791, 801 (D.C. Cir. 1969). Using federal case law only as an aid in our analysis of the State constitutional question, <em>see Gravel, </em>135 N.H. at 176, 601 A.2d at 680, we find that a pretrial deposition is a distinct proceeding for the purpose of determining the effect of a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination under part I, article 15. We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses and properly found Shedd\u2019s assertion of the privilege valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">\n<em>TV. Evidence of Homosexual Relationship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The final argument that we consider on the merits is whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony of the defendant\u2019s homosexual relationship with Bryar. The defendant contends that such evidence was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The State introduced evidence that the defendant provided Bryar drugs and money in exchange for sex, and Bollerud explained the possible psychological impact of a homosexual relationship on an adolescent male. The trial court found the testimony admissible as evidence of a prior bad act for proof of motive, N.H. R. Ev. 404(b), and as generally more probative than prejudicial for aiding the jury\u2019s understanding of other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The decision to admit prior wrongs or bad acts as proof of motive is discretionary. <em>State v. Simonds, </em>135 N.H. 203, 206, 600 A.2d 928, 930 (1991). Testimony of a relationship in which sex was exchanged for drugs and money constitutes evidence of a prior wrong or offense. A three-pronged test governs its admissibility: \u201cFirst, the evidence must be relevant for a purpose other than to prove character or disposition. Second, there must be clear proof that the defendant committed the prior offense. Third, the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was \u201cclearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his [or her] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>To obtain a conviction under the witness tampering statute, the State had to show that the defendant believed Bryar was a potential witness. <em>Kilgus, </em>125 N.H. at 742, 484 A.2d at 1211. Indictments underlying the case charged the defendant with conspiracy to purchase drugs, with obscenity for showing an explicit film to a minor, and with prostitution for transporting Bryar to engage in sex for consideration. Testimony that Bryar had stated he received drugs and money in exchange for sex made the defendant\u2019s actual belief of Bryar\u2019s status as a witness more probable. Such testimony also rendered more likely the State\u2019s version of why the defendant promised Bryar cash, a car, and a Canadian address. <em>Cf. State v. Whitney, </em>125 N.H. 636, 638-39, 484 A.2d 1158, 1160 (1984) (holding that evidence of prior convictions is proof of motive for witness tampering). On these facts, the trial court could find clear proof of the defendant\u2019s complicity in the prior wrong and relevant evidence of his motive for removing Bryar as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The defendant contends that unfair prejudice resulted from evidence of his homosexual relationship with Bryar. The inquiry for the trial court under Rules 403 and 404(b) is whether the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence. <em>State v. Trainor, </em>130 N.H. 371, 375, 540 A.2d 1236, 1239 (1988). To reverse a conviction, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>State v. Cochran, </em>132 N.H. 670, 672, 569 A.2d 756, 757 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Although evidence of a defendant\u2019s homosexual relationships may be prejudicial where it is not central to the State\u2019s case, <em>see United States v. Gillespie, </em>852 F.2d 475, 478-79 &amp; n.2 (9th Cir. 1988), testimony of the defendant\u2019s offer of drugs and money in exchange for sex was relevant proof of a central issue in the witness tampering prosecution. The evidence was probative of the defendant\u2019s belief that Bryar could be a witness in the underlying prostitution and drug conspiracy cases. <em>See Kilgus, </em>125 N.H. at 742, 484 A.2d at 1212. Furthermore, the record indicates that counsel screened the jury panel with <em>voir dire </em>questions on homosexuality, <em>cf. State v. Hood, </em>131 N.H. 606, 608, 557 A.2d 995, 996-97 (1989) (noting that whether evidence is prejudicial concerns its effect on jurors). With respect to the relevant evidence of a prior wrong\u2014a relationship in which drugs and money were exchanged for sex\u2014the defendant has failed to establish that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to his prejudice. <em>See Simonds, </em>135 N.H. at 206, 600 A.2d at 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The defendant argues that unfair prejudice resulted from Trottier\u2019s testimony that Bryar\u2019s probation officer alerted her to a police investigation of \u201csexual-abuse issues\u201d in Bryar\u2019s relationship with the defendant. Although the notice of appeal did not discuss the admissibility of this statement, we consider it because it is subsidiary to the question of prejudice resulting from testimony on the defendant\u2019s homosexual relationship with Bryar. Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">In a pretrial colloquy with counsel, the trial court cautioned the State not to use statements describing the relationship as \u201csexual abuse.\u201d At trial, the court admitted Trottier\u2019s statement with an instruction that it was not \u201coffered for the truth of its contents,\u201d but as a description of information provided to Trottier.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Taken only as a description of information provided to Trottier, the statement was relevant and probative. It cast light on Trottier\u2019s expectations for Bryar\u2019s therapy sessions and aided the jury in assessing her ability to report accurately statements she attributed to Bryar.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The court\u2019s limiting instruction lessened the risk of unfair prejudice. In addition, we are not convinced that the defendant would have been in a better position if the statement had been excluded. <em>See State v. McCue, </em>134 N.H. 94, 107, 589 A.2d 580, 588 (1991); <em>State v. Allen, </em>128 N.H. 390, 397-98, 514 A.2d 1263, 1268 (1986). Jurors would have drawn similar inferences from other evidence that the forty-three-year-old defendant had offered drugs and money for sex with Bryar, a seventeen-year-old with a history of drug abuse, and from evidence that Bryar believed his weakness for money had been exploited by the defendant in their relationship. The defendant has failed to establish that the admission of the statement with a limiting instruction was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in admitting Bollerud\u2019s expert testimony that adolescent males may be confused by their physiologic responses to homosexual experiences, which she described explicitly. Earlier testimony suggested that Bryar was manipulative and had expressed a desire to seek revenge against the defendant. The trial court could find that Bollerud\u2019s expert testimony about a young man\u2019s responses to homosexual experiences explained dimensions of Bryar\u2019s psychological problems, demonstrated Bryar\u2019s belief that therapy sessions were confidential, and consequently countered inferences that revenge motives led Bryar to discuss in therapy his relationship with the defendant. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>could have found Bollerud\u2019s statements more probative than prejudicial for these purposes, especially because her brief, explicit description of physiologic responses to sexual arousal was clinical, as opposed to lurid, and would not have induced an emotionally-charged reaction. <em>See Cochran, </em>132 N.H. at 672, 569 A.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s homosexual relationship with Bryar. The defendant has not demonstrated that admitting such evidence was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>V. Issues Not Preserved</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The defendant raises three issues in the brief that were neither presented to the trial court, nor included in the notice of appeal. These are: (1) that venue was improper in Carroll County for the indictment charging that the defendant purchased a car in Merrimack County to induce Bryar to testify falsely; (2) that the State failed to produce sufficient evidence of \u201cprocess outstanding\u201d for conviction under an indictment charging that the defendant offered an apartment in Canada to induce Bryar to \u201celude legal process\u201d; and (3) that introduction of evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s provision of drugs to Bryar was prejudicial error. The defendant\u2019s failure to raise these issues below and in the notice of appeal forecloses our review. <em>See State v. Peterson, </em>135 N.H. 713, 714-15, 609 A.2d 749, 750-51 (1992); <em>State v. McAdams, </em>134 N.H. 445, 446, 594 A.2d 1273, 1273-74 (1991); <em>State v. Menard, </em>133 N.H. 708, 712, 584 A.2d 752, 754-55 (1990); Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b); 1 C. WHARTON, CRIMINAL PROCEDURE \u00a7 34, at 189 (C. Torcia 13th ed. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In summary, we hold that RSA 625:4,1(b) provided the trial court territorial jurisdiction, that admission of the therapists\u2019 testimony complied with the rules of evidence and all constitutional mandates, that the limit on the cross-examination of Scott Shedd was a legitimate exercise of discretion, and that admission of evidence of homosexuality was not error. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b763-10\">THAYER, J., concurred specially; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Thayer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AtK\">concurring specially: I concur in parts I, III, IV and V of the majority opinion.
