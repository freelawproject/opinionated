On appeal, he claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Superior Court <em>(Nadeau, </em>J.) abused its discretion in finding the four-year-old victim competent to testify and in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Shane Kelley is the child of Jerry Kelley and Barbara Mills, who are divorced. Barbara Mills is the wife of the defendant. In January 1989, Shane was three years old and living with his mother and the defendant; he visited his father\u2019s home on alternate weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">At 6:00 p.m. on Friday, January 13,1989, Shane\u2019s father and stepmother Tess arrived at the defendant\u2019s home to pick up Shane for the weekend. Two hours later, while she was bathing Shane, Tess noticed severe bruising on him. Shane told her that the defendant had spanked him for not remembering the color blue and refusing to stay in the corner. After telephoning Barbara Mills, who hung up on her, Tess called the police, who advised her to come to the station immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Jerry and Tess Kelley brought Shane to the police station, and the three were then taken by the police to the hospital emergency room, arriving at approximately 9:30 p.m. Dr. Tim Donnelly, the attending physician, examined Shane and found extensive bruising on his buttocks, legs, arms, and back. Photographs were taken of the bruises. Because of the pattern and degree of bruising, Dr. Donnelly suspected child abuse. Speaking with Dr. Donnelly independently from his father and stepmother, Shane stated that the defendant had caused the injuries with his hand. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, from the appearance of the bruises, they could not have been sustained within three or four hours but were probably over six hours old and likely between twelve and twenty-four hours old.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">On the day in question, Shane had been at a babysitter\u2019s from 6:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. At the defendant\u2019s trial, the babysitter testified that she never spanked Shane. She had noticed bruises on his thighs that morning, as well as what appeared to be a rash on his buttocks. Dr. Donnelly had testified that in the immediate period after injury, the reddened area could be confused with a rash.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The defendant testified that he had been home with Shane after 5:00 p.m. the previous night and admitted having spanked Shane in the past, but he denied spanking him on January 12 or 13. Shane testified that the defendant had spanked him at the defendant\u2019s house and identified the photographs of his bruises. According to Shane, he was spanked because he \u201cdidn\u2019t remember about the blue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Prior to trial, a hearing was conducted to determine whether Shane, then four years old, was competent to testify. After brief initial questioning by the prosecutor, the trial judge engaged in a lengthy colloquy with the child. The judge concluded that Shane was competent to testify based on his ability to observe and narrate \u201cas well as any four-year-old\u201d and on Shane\u2019s statement that \u201che wants to tell the truth.\u201d Defense counsel objected, stating that \u201cwhen [the court] asked [Shane] if he knew what would happen to him if he didn\u2019t tell the truth or it was important for him to tell the truth, I don\u2019t think he showed a clear understanding of the importance between telling the truth and not telling the truth.\u201d The judge responded that he thought that \u201cfor a four-year-old he\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2014it\u2019s important to tell the truth.\u201d In his charge to the jury, the trial judge instructed the jurors to \u201capply particular caution\u201d in evaluating the testimony of a child. The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in (1) finding that Shane understood the obligation to tell the truth; (2) finding that he demonstrated an ability to remember and narrate events; and (3) failing to determine whether Shane could distinguish between truth and falsehood. The defendant below, however, objected to the competency determination solely on the first ground asserted here, <em>i.e., </em>that the witness had not demonstrated an understanding of the obligation to testify truthfully. Accordingly, the other grounds not having been properly preserved, they will not be considered on appeal. <em>State v. McAdams, </em>134 N.H. 445, 447, 594 A.2d 1273, 1273 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Whether a witness is competent to testify is a question of law for the trial court. <em>State v. Blum, </em>132 N.H. 396, 399, 566 A.2d 1131, 1132 (1989). New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 601 sets forth the law governing competency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201c(a) <em>General rule of competency. </em>Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise provided by statute or in these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">(b) <em>Incompetence of a witness. </em>A person is not competent to testify as a witness if the court finds that the witness lacks sufficient capacity to observe, remember and narrate as well as understand the duty to tell the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The import of Rule 601(a) is to establish a presumption of witness competency that may be overcome \u201cby statute or [other] rules,\u201d <em>id., </em>or by findings pursuant to Rule 601(b). <em>State v. Aikens, </em>135 N.H. 569, 571, 607 A.2d 948, 949 (1992). \u201cAbsent an abuse of discretion, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>court, which must act on a cold record, will not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination of competency when there is evidence to support it.\u201d <em>State v. Scarlett, </em>121 N.H. 37, 39, 426 A.2d 25, 27 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">As for the trial court\u2019s finding that Shane understood the obligation to tell the truth, the record shows that the judge first ascertained from the witness that the prosecutor had spoken with him on the subject. A colloquy then occurred, during which Shane stated that he wanted to tell the truth and acknowledged that his parents would be upset if he did not tell the truth. In ruling Shane competent to testify, the trial court was impressed that \u201c[h]e said he wants to tell the truth, he obviously is able to observe and understand things.\u201d These findings were made after an extensive examination on subjects of interest to a four-year-old <em>(e.g., </em>his favorite cartoon character, the circus, playing with his friend), and relating to his observations of the bench and the judge <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cHow come you got that dress thing on?\u201d). That Shane\u2019s answers came primarily in response to leading questions is not problematic, as such an approach is neither out of the ordinary nor impermissible where the witness is a young child. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 611 (reporter\u2019s notes) (discretion to permit leading questions on direct examination \u201cwhen the witness is very young\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Nor is it significant that Shane did not utter any particular \u201cmagic words\u201d indicating comprehension of the obligation to testify truthfully. <em>In re Gerald, </em>471 A.2d 219, 221 (R.I.1984). What is significant is the trial judge\u2019s overall firsthand impressions of Shane\u2019s responsiveness and desire to be truthful. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[B]ecause so much depends upon his observation of the witness,\u201d <em>State v. Pettis, </em>488 A.2d 704, 706 (R.I.1985), the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Shane was competent is entitled to great deference. The question is not whether we would have ruled as the trial court did, but whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to ground the finding. Our review of the record reveals sufficient support for the trial court\u2019s determination of competency. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The defendant\u2019s second contention on appeal is that he is entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence; namely, the purported post-trial recantation by the victim of his accusation against the defendant. At a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, Barbara Mills testified that she asked her son Shane, several months after her husband was convicted, if the defendant had really hit him. He said \u201cno,\u201d according to her testimony, and stated that he had told the judge the defendant had hit him because his father had promised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>him a toy jeep if he told the truth. Shane told her that his father had told him that \u201cthe truth\u201d was that the defendant had hit him. Shane\u2019s mother further testified that Shane had told her that it was his father who had hit him. She admitted that, at the time Shane made the statement, she and Shane\u2019s father were embroiled in an ongoing custody dispute. Shane, although available, did not testify at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Recanted testimony is a species of newly discovered evidence for purposes of a new trial motion. <em>See </em>58 Am. Jur. 2d <em>New Trial </em>\u00a7 440 (1989). In order to prevail on a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, the moving party must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201c(1) that [he] was not at fault for not discovering the evidence at the former trial; (2) that the evidence is admissible, material to the merits, and not cumulative; and (3) that [the evidence is] of such a character that a different result will probably be reached upon another trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\"><em>State v. Abbott, </em>127 N.H. 444, 450, 503 A.2d 791, 795 (1985) (citations and quotations omitted). When the purported new evidence is a recantation by a prosecution witness, the third prong of this test will not be met if the trial judge finds as a threshold matter that the recantation is not credible. <em>See People v. Minnick, </em>214 Cal. App. 3d 1478, 1482, 263 Cal. Rptr. 316, 318 (1989) (in deciding motion for new trial based upon recantation, trial judge determines whether new evidence credible, then whether different result on retrial probable). Whether to grant a motion for a new trial is a question of fact for the trial judge, whose decision will not be overturned unless it is clearly unreasonable. <em>Abbott, </em>127 N.H. at 450, 503 A.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\"> After hearing all the new evidence, including a tape-recorded interview of the child in which Shane stated that the defendant did not hurt him, the trial court concluded that the evidence was not \u201cof such a character that a different result will probably be reached upon another trial.\u201d Noting that Shane\u2019s post-trial statements and those of the witnesses who reported them \u201cmust be viewed in the context of the bitter custody and marital dispute which is taking place,\u201d the court found them lacking in credibility. \u201cWe will not overturn the credibility ruling of the factfinder, who is in the best position to make such a determination ....\u201d <em>State v. Chase, </em>135 N.H. 209, 215, 600 A.2d 931, 935 (1991). Having upheld the trial court\u2019s finding that the new evidence was not credible, we will not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>the defendant\u2019s argument that part I, article 15 of the State Constitution ought to guarantee him a new trial where he produces credible new evidence of recantation. After reviewing the record, we are convinced that the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the motion for a new trial was not clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b66-6\">Brock, C.J., and Johnson, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b66-7\">Brock, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A-q\">dissenting: The criteria for determining whether a witness is competent are: (1) the ability to observe, remember, and narrate; and (2) an understanding of the duty to tell the truth. N.H. R. Ev. 601(b); <em>State v. Keyes, </em>114 N.H. 487, 490, 322 A.2d 615, 617 (1974). The trial court has great discretion in the manner in which the determination of competency is made, <em>see, e.g., State v. Blum, </em>132 N.H. 396, 399, 566 A.2d 1131, 1132-33 (1989), but in deciding whether the witness is competent, it <em>must </em>consider the above criteria. In my opinion, the trial court failed to adequately question the youth on his understanding of the duty to tell the truth. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Initially, I must point out that while I agree with the majority on the preservation of the issue of the importance of telling the truth, I also believe that the issue of whether Shane could distinguish between truth and falsehood was adequately preserved. Following the competency hearing, the court ruled that Shane was competent to testify. The defendant immediately objected to the ruling and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">\u201cI think my main area for the objection is that when you asked him if he knew what would happen to him if he didn\u2019t tell the truth or it was important for him to tell the truth, I don\u2019t think he showed a clear understanding of the importance between telling the truth and not telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">We have previously held that when the court is apprised of the general theory behind the objection such that \u201cit is given an adequate opportunity to reconsider its ruling,\u201d this is sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal. <em>State v. Pinardville Athletic Club, </em>134 N.H. 462, 465, 594 A.2d 1284,1286 (1991); <em>see also State v. Baird, </em>133 N.H. 637, 640, 581 A.2d 1313, 1315 (1990); <em>State v. Judkins, </em>128 N.H. 223, 224-25, 512 A.2d 427, 428 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">The defendant\u2019s objection, although specific in its wording, is sufficient to alert the court to the general nature of the defendant\u2019s theory. It encompasses not only the ability of the witness to tell the truth, but also his concern that the witness know the difference be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tween truth and falsehood. The trial court was alerted to the defendant\u2019s general theory, <em>i.e., </em>the witness\u2019s ability to understand his duty to tell the truth under Rule 601(b). Accordingly, because the defendant objected at the pretrial hearing, the issues of whether the witness understood both the difference between a truth and a lie and the importance of telling the truth were properly preserved for our review. <em>See State v. Simonds, </em>135 N.H. 203, 205, 600 A.2d 928, 929 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">I now turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in ruling that the four-year-old witness was competent. Upon a review of the questions asked and the corresponding responses, we must decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in allowing Shane to testify before the jury. A review of the record shows only one colloquy on the issue of Shane\u2019s \u201ccapacity to ... understand [his] duty to tell the truth\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... Do you want to tell the truth when people ask you things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">(Witness nods head affirmatively)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">THE COURT: Why do you want to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ApRW\">SHANE KELLEY: I want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABWM\">THE COURT: Hmm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKq\">SHANE KELLEY: I want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_A\">THE COURT: You want to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-14\">(Witness nods head affirmatively)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">THE COURT: Does something happen if you don\u2019t tell the truth? Does anything bad happen or somebody do something to you if you don\u2019t tell the truth? Will your mommy be upset and your daddy be upset?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-17\">(Witness nods head affirmatively)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-18\">THE COURT: I see you\u2019re saying \u2018yes,\u2019 putting your head up and down, \u2018yeah.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-20\">At best, the witness \u201cwant[s] to tell the truth,\u201d but this is a far cry from acknowledging a \u201cduty\u201d to tell the truth. More importantly, nowhere in the record does the court even inquire into whether the four-year-old child understands the difference between the truth and ~a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-21\">When determining whether a youth \u201cunderstand^] the duty to tell the truth,\u201d Rule 601(b), the trial court must first ascertain that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>child understands the difference between the truth and falsehood. Once this initial determination is made, the court must then make sure the witness appreciates the obligation to tell the truth. <em>See generally </em>Myers, <em>The Testimonial Competence of Children, </em>25 J. Fam. L. 287, 327-35 (1986-87); <em>see also </em>81 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Witnesses </em>\u00a7 89 (1976). The court must not only determine that the youth understands and can express intelligent answers to the questions put forth, but it must also be satisfied that the witness demonstrates \u201ca sense of <em>moral responsibility </em>[and] a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth.\u201d <em>Goy v. Director General, </em>79 N.H. 512, 514, 111 A. 855, 856 (1920) (citation and quotation omitted); 2 WlGMORE ON Evidence \u00a7 506, at 713 (Chadbourn rev. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Although the witness need not utter any \u201cmagic words\u201d indicating that he or she understands the difference between the truth and a lie or the importance of telling the truth, some indication of the witness\u2019s understanding must be apparent on the record. In this case, there were neither hypothetical questions posed to the child nor any other dialogue by which it may be determined that the child understood his \u201cduty to tell the truth.\u201d Further, the court\u2019s determination of whether the child understood the consequences of not telling the truth rested on a three-part compound question to which the witness merely nodded affirmatively. One cannot discern whether the witness understood which question he was answering, let alone the ramifications of his affirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The largely leading questions posed by the trial court, combined with the cryptic answers or physical affirmations given by Shane, do not provide a sufficient foundation to legally qualify him to testify. For the trial court to rest its determination of competency on so barren a record constitutes an abuse of discretion. In view of the fact that Shane\u2019s testimony was the only direct evidence offered to prove that the defendant caused his injuries, the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I would remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Because I would remand this case for a new trial, I need not address the defendant\u2019s second contention that a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is warranted. I note in passing, however, that Shane\u2019s alleged recantation serves to evidence the tension and stress that Shane was subjected to, thus further supporting my position that the trial court should have questioned him in a more thorough fashion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b68-8\">Johnson, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQv\">dissenting: I concur with the dissenting opinion of the Chief Justice; however, I write separately to emphasize the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>for extraordinary caution in cases, such as this, where a child of parents involved in a \u201cbitter custody and marital dispute\u201d alleges abuse, either of a physical or sexual nature. Common sense tells us that these unfortunate children are all too often placed in a veritable vise between the two warring parents. The intense pressure upon the child to testify in a fashion that will aid one of the parents in their dispute is all too obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The law is clear: the child witness, in order to be found to be competent, must meet two criteria. He or she (1) must understand the difference between truth and falsehood and (2) must appreciate the obligation to tell the truth. <em>See generally </em>Myers, <em>The Testimonial Competence of Children, </em>25 J. Fam. L. 287, 327-35 (1986-87).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In this case, a thorough review of the record reveals not a scintilla of evidence that the alleged child-victim, Shane Kelley, understood the difference between truth and falsehood. He was never asked a single question from which a reviewing court could conclude that he met the first test, that he understood the difference between truth and falsehood. Thus, we have a record that is completely devoid of this critical evidence. The majority is left to uphold the conviction only upon the trial judge\u2019s finding, within his \u201csound discretion,\u201d that the child is competent to testify. The record of the child\u2019s competency in this case is virtually unreviewable by this or any appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the alleged child victim was competent to testify, when he states that the child had the ability to observe and narrate \u201cas well as any four-year-old,\u201d offers little comfort to us. What if the trial court had found that the child had the ability to observe and narrate as well as any two-year-old? Would we allow a defendant to be deprived of his liberty simply because the child has the \u201caverage\u201d ability of a child of the age of the alleged victim, absent a showing that the \u201caverage\u201d child of that age knows the difference between truth and falsehood?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The record indicates that the second test for a child\u2019s competency, that he appreciates the obligation to tell the truth, was also not met in this case. In the Chief Justice\u2019s dissent, the relevant colloquy is set out at length. Had the trial judge received an answer to the first question, \u201cDoes something happen if you don\u2019t tell the truth?,\u201d then an appellate court might have the necessary record to decide if the child had the requisite appreciation of the obligation to tell the truth. However, no answer to that question alone was given. We can only speculate as to what the child would have answered. The record as to that question is thus unreviewable. Further, the trial judge received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>no direct answer to the second question, \u201cDoes anything bad happen or somebody do something to you if you don\u2019t tell the truth?\u201d Had an answer been given, an appellate court could possibly discern whether the child appreciated the obligation to tell the truth. Again, this blurred colloquy offers no reviewable record for an appellate court on the crucial issue of the child\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The third question only served to further muddy the waters and make the child\u2019s answer to the combined three questions incomprehensible and completely unreviewable. The question was, \u201cWill your mommy be upset and your daddy be upset?\u201d Upset about what? The child\u2019s \u201cdaddy,\u201d Jerry Kelley, obviously wanted the child to say that the defendant, Kelly Mills, had abused him, and would be \u201cupset\u201d if the child said otherwise. On the other hand, his \u201cmommy,\u201d Barbara Mills, would be \u201cupset\u201d if the child named her then-husband, the defendant, Kelly Mills, as the one who had abused him. It is of little surprise that the child could not articulate an answer to this question, but only nodded his head. Quite obviously, given the circumstances, one of his parents would be \u201cupset,\u201d no matter what his testimony would be during the trial. That the child later allegedly recanted his testimony, when, as the majority points out, both natural parents were urging a totally divergent view of the \u201ctruth\u201d upon the child, is not surprising. When a very young child is brought into the middle of a \u201cbitter custody dispute,\u201d the child\u2019s personal bewilderment can be easily understood. The child\u2019s testimony, in the divorce proceeding itself, should be viewed with <em>extreme </em>caution. The child\u2019s testimony in a criminal proceeding at the time of bitter marital proceedings must be subject to <em>extraordinary </em>caution. The child\u2019s testimony should be allowed only after the most careful and precise questioning to determine if the child is, at that moment in time, free of parental or other influence, and that the child fully and completely understands (1) the difference between truth and falsehood and (2) the obligation to tell the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The record in this case deprives the defendant of meaningful appellate review of his conviction. I would remand this case for a new trial and, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
