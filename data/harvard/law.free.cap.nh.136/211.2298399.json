The CAB ruled that the employer\u2019s insurance carrier was not obliged to pay for the petitioner\u2019s treatment because the medical treatment was \u201cpalliative in nature and not curative.\u201d Because the curative/palliative distinction is not the correct standard for determining coverage of medical treatment under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">On August 3, 1988, Mr. Levesque sustained a back injury in the course of his employment with Surewood Excavators, when he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>hit by the bucket of an excavating machine. Mr. Levesque was determined to be temporarily totally disabled and received benefits from September 1988 through May 1990, at which time a lump sum settlement was approved. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:37 (lump sum agreements may be permitted at discretion of commissioner, but in no instance shall medical provisions of Act be lump summed).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Mr. Levesque continued to receive medical treatment from his physicians, including an unsupervised exercise program. In addition, he received chiropractic treatment and treatment at Easter Seals for injuries that were sustained in the course of his exercise program.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Surewood Excavators\u2019 insurance carrier denied payment of Mr. Levesque\u2019s medical bills, and Mr. Levesque appealed to the Department of Labor (DOL). A DOL hearings officer upheld the denial of coverage, determining that neither \u201cthe therapeutic exercise program provided by Dr. Smolen nor the chiropractic treatment provided by Dr. Pratt are causally related to his work-related injury or are reasonable or necessary.\u201d The DOL also denied coverage for the treatment Mr. Levesque received at Easter Seals because the treatment was \u201cthe result of injury while treating with Dr. Smolen and logically flows from the denial of the Smolen treatments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Mr. Levesque appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the CAB. At the CAB hearing, Mr. Levesque testified that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to be in peace without being in pain if I wasn\u2019t doing what I\u2019m doing now.\u201d The CAB also received in evidence letters from Mr. Levesque\u2019s doctors. Dr. Pratt wrote that the chiropractic treatment he has administered is \u201cnot maintenance in nature,\u201d and \u201ccontinues to improve Mr. Levesque\u2019s overall condition.\u201d Dr. Smolen wrote that the exercise program \u201cis not maintenance because his condition would be much worse without it, and it is required to eliminate the painful occasions that do exist.\u201d Dr. Berkowitz of Independent Medical Examinations, Inc. examined Mr. Levesque for the employer and found that he \u201cdid not have identifiable objective findings to support his ongoing disability,\u201d and that his course of treatment with both Dr. Smolen and Dr. Pratt is \u201ccontroversial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In its decision, the CAB found that Mr. Levesque had reached a \u201cmedical endpoint\u201d in November 1989, and that the treatments being provided by Drs. Smolen and Pratt are \u201cpalliative in nature and not curative.\u201d The CAB denied coverage for those treatments.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> While we ordinarily defer to an administrative interpretation of a statute, we will not defer where the interpretation is plainly incorrect. <em>Chambers v. Geiger, </em>133 N.H. 149, 153, 573 A.2d 1356, 1358 (1990). RSA 281-A:23, I (Supp. 1991) requires an employer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>its insurance carrier to \u201cfurnish or cause to be furnished to an injured employee reasonable medical, surgical, and hospital services, remedial care, nursing, medicines, and mechanical and surgical aids for such period as the nature of the injury may require.\u201d RSA 281-A:23, I (Supp. 1991), therefore, imposes only two conditions on compensable medical treatment: (1) the treatment must be reasonable; and (2) the treatment may continue only so long as required by the nature of the injury. The statute makes no reference to a palliative/curative distinction, nor does it require that a treatment be curative to be compensable by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The term \u201cremedial\u201d does appear in the statute. Even assuming that the terms \u201cremedial\u201d and \u201ccurative\u201d are synonymous, we note that the term \u201cremedial\u201d modifies only the word \u201ccare.\u201d The term \u201creasonable,\u201d which precedes the enumeration of compensable items, modifies all of the terms that follow it. The plain language of the statute does not limit compensable medical treatments to those that are \u201cremedial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> Therefore, the CAB\u2019s determination that Mr. Levesque\u2019s treatments were palliative and not curative is insufficient to support its decision. Similarly, the finding that Mr. Levesque had reached a medical endpoint is inconclusive with respect to the question of whether or not Mr. Levesque\u2019s employer is required to pay for his treatments. Surewood Excavators\u2019 counsel conceded at oral argument that, consistent with RSA281-A:23,1 (Supp. 1991), a treatment may be reasonable and required by the nature of an injury even though the treatment does not improve the patient\u2019s medical condition. For example, administration of pain-killing drugs to a terminally ill cancer patient may be reasonable even though the drugs will not reverse the cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The respondent argues that the hearing officer\u2019s finding that Mr. Levesque\u2019s treatment was not \u201creasonable or necessary\u201d can support the CAB\u2019s decision. Appeals to the CAB, however, are heard <em>de novo, </em>RSA 281-A:42-a, I, and findings of the hearing officer are not automatically incorporated into the CAB\u2019s decision. Therefore, the respondent may not rely on the hearing officer\u2019s findings to support the CAB\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">We remand to the CAB for a determination of whether Mr. Levesque\u2019s treatments meet the requirements of RSA 281-A:23, I (Supp. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
