On appeal, he contends that the search of the car involved in the.accident was unlawful because the affidavit underlying the search warrant had insufficient indicia of reliability and contained material misrepresentations. Further, he argues that his wife was allowed to testify at his trial in contravention of the marital privilege. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">On May 29, 1989, at about 11:30 at night, a man was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident in front of the Meredith Station restaurant on Route 3 in Meredith. The investigation remained open until April 3, 1990, when the defendant\u2019s estranged wife called the Meredith police, gave her identity, and reported that her husband was involved in the accident and that the car he was driving at the time was parked in the garage at her home in Pembroke. She also called the Pembroke police and told them the same information anonymously. Based on the information, the Meredith police obtained a search warrant for the car. A jury convicted the defendant of violating RSA 264:25, which requires a person knowingly involved in such an accident as occurred here to stop, report it to the police, and share certain information with any person injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The defendant first contends that the fruits of the search of the automobile should be suppressed because the search violated his rights under part I, article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution. He alleges that the affidavit supporting the warrant had insufficient indicia of reliability and contained material misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The law in New Hampshire on the use of informants in constructing affidavits to support a search warrant is by now clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cPart I, article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides that search warrants shall issue only upon cause or foundation, supported by oath or affirmation. We interpret this language as a requirement for probable cause____[T]his court adopted the totality-of-the-circumstances test for determining whether probable cause exists. Under this test, elements including the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge are important factors to be considered by judges and magistrates in determining whether probable cause exists. Other indicia of reliability, however, such as corroboration by police officers, may be used in determining the existence of probable cause to supply the missing factors relative to the informant and the informant\u2019s information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\"><em>State v. Caicedo, </em>135 N.H. 122, 125, 599 A.2d 895, 897 (1991) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201cProbable cause to search exists if a [person] of ordinary caution would be justified in believing that what is sought will be found in the place to be searched.\u201d <em>State v. Doe, </em>115 N.H. 682, 685, 371 A.2d 167, 169 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In this case there was a sufficient basis for finding that the defendant\u2019s wife had knowledge of the facts. The car belonged to her husband and was located in her garage. <em>See State v. Hazen, </em>131 N.H. 196, 201, 552 A.2d 77, 80 (1988). Unlike <em>State v. Davis, </em>133 N.H. 211, 575 A.2d 4 (1990), and <em>State v. Carroll, </em>131 N.H. 179, 552 A.2d 69 (1988), where the informants were anonymous, the informant here revealed her identity and her relationship to the defendant. Although the application for the search warrant and its supporting affidavit did not precisely establish the fact of a statement from the defendant to his wife in which he implicated himself in the offense, the magistrate was, on the remaining facts, entitled to such a conclusion based upon circumstantial evidence from the wife\u2019s statement that she \u201cwanted to clear her conscience.\u201d <em>See United States v. Badessa, </em>752 F.2d 771, 774-75 (1st Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">There was also a sufficient basis for the veracity of the informant. \u201cIt is reasonable to infer the credibility of an informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>where he makes an admission against his own penal interest.\u201d <em>Hazen, </em>131 N.H. at 201, 552 A.2d at 80. The defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s statements to the Meredith police concerning her knowledge of the incident involving her husband\u2019s car constituted an admission to a misdemeanor pursuant to ESA 642:3, 1(d) (\u201cA person is guilty of an offense if, with a purpose to hinder, prevent or delay the discovery, apprehension, prosecution, conviction or punishment of another for the commission of a crime, he . . . [c]onceals . . . physical evidence that might aid in the discovery, apprehension or conviction of such person . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Under even the most strict analysis this court has enunciated to assess the credibility of informants, <em>State v. Mandravelis, </em>114 N.H. 634, 637, 325 A.2d 794, 796 (1974); <em>State v. Carroll, </em>131 N.H. at 192, 552 A.2d at 77 (Batchelder, J., concurring), the affidavit here would be sufficient. Under Carroll\u2019s totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, there is no doubt that the warrant was properly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The defendant next argues that the affidavit supporting the warrant was flawed because it contained material misrepresentations made either intentionally or recklessly. <em>State v. McGann, </em>128 N.H. 186, 188-89, 514 A.2d 1247, 1249 (1986). Omissions, as well as positive misstatements, can be construed as misrepresentations for purposes of an affidavit in certain cases. <em>See State v. Jaroma, </em>128 N.H. 423, 426-27, 514 A.2d 1274, 1276 (1986). The materiality of an omission is a question of law which must be determined before the degree of the affiant\u2019s intent is considered. <em>Id. </em>at 426, 514 A.2d at 1276; <em>see State v. Spero, </em>117 N.H. 199, 205, 371 A.2d 1155, 1158 (1977). Materiality is determined by whether, if the omitted statements were included, there would still be probable cause. <em>State v. Valenzuela, </em>130 N.H. 175, 191, 536 A.2d 1252, 1262-63 (1987) (an omission is material if it is \u201cnecessary for the finding of probable cause\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1008 (1988); <em>see State v. Chaisson, </em>125 N.H. 810, 814, 486 A.2d 297, 300 (1984); <em>State v. Renfrew, </em>122 N.H. 308, 311, 444 A.2d 527, 529 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The defendant alleges that there are three sets of facts which constitute material omissions. The first is that the couple\u2019s marriage was not stable and that the affiant did not apprise the issuing judge of the possible motive of vindictiveness in informing the authorities of her husband\u2019s conduct. However, \u201c\u2018where an informant contacts authorities with a motivation other than \u201ca sense of civic duty\u201d the informant can still be found credible.\u2019\u201d <em>Jaroma, </em>128 N.H. at 426, 514 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>A.2d at 1276 (quoting <em>United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>618 F.2d 1313, 1317 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 824 (1980)). Here, regardless of her motives, Valerie Wilkinson\u2019s credibility was sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Second, the defendant claims that the affiant\u2019s failure to include the fact that the informant\u2019s phone call to the Pembroke police was anonymous was a material omission. However, there is no indication that the informant provided additional information to the Pembroke police that the Meredith police did not have from her as a named source. Thus, we can presume that the search warrant was procured using information from a known source, and that the call to the Pembroke police was, for the purposes of the warrant, irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the affiant\u2019s failure to include in the affidavit several witnesses\u2019 varying descriptions of the car constitutes a material omission. The affidavit stated that \u201c[o]ne witness described the vehicle as a dark possibly blue vehicle. He said it looked like a full sized 1978-79 Ford LTD type vehicle.\u201d The police log stated, however, that the car was white, and the police issued an all-points-bulletin for a white car. Additionally, the witnesses stated variously that the car was an \u201colder and large white type car\u201d; a \u201cdark colored possibly black, 4 door\u201d; an \u201colder full size 2 tone blue vehicle possibly Ford\u201d; a \u201cpossibly dark, possibly blue vehicle\u201d; and light green or dark green. In fact, the car was a 1978 two-door metallic green Ford Thunderbird with a white vinyl roof. More importantly, however, we have already concluded that the magistrate could have properly inferred that the wife\u2019s basis of knowledge was the defendant himself, thereby rendering the omission of the differing descriptions irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The defendant\u2019s second issue on appeal is the admission of his wife\u2019s testimony at trial. The defendant\u2019s wife, Valerie Wilkinson, was home in Meredith on the evening of the hit-and-run incident. Although she tried to stop him from going out because he had been drinking, the defendant left in their 1978 Ford Thunderbird, which he regularly drove. He returned momentarily to collect his forgotten cigarettes, but left again. He returned in a few minutes very upset, but told his wife that he \u201chadn\u2019t been gone long enough for anything to have happened.\u201d Suspecting more, she pressed him, and he admitted that he had hit something near Hart\u2019s Turkey Farm, which she testified is \u201cjust a little bit up the road from Meredith Station.\u201d Together they went into the garage to look at the car and noticed a dent on the right side above the headlight. The Wilkinsons then ceased using the car. The defendant took off the white top, covered the car, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>and left it in the driveway. Later, Valerie drove the car to their new residence in Pembroke, where it remained in the driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The couple subsequently separated, and the defendant moved out. Valerie Wilkinson\u2019s lessor complained about the car in the driveway, and in April 1990 the defendant arranged with a friend to move it. The friend testified that the defendant told him that the car had been involved in a hit-and-run incident probably involving a pedestrian, that the dent in the hood was the point of contact, that the accident had occurred about a year earlier, that the defendant had told his wife about the incident on the night it occurred, and that these were matters that should be kept confidential. Another witness overheard enough of the conversation between the defendant and his friend to be aware that the car was involved in something significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The court held a pretrial hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to bar his wife\u2019s testimony. At the time of the motion hearing, the State did not present evidence that the defendant had revealed facts of his involvement in the Meredith incident to his friend or that there was a witness to that conversation. With no knowledge of the defendant\u2019s communication of the privileged matter to others, the superior court granted the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>excluding Ms. Wilkinson\u2019s testimony of what the defendant had told her, on the ground that it was a privileged communication. In its written order, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201c[T]here is no evidence that Mr. Wilkinson made mention of the hit-and-run to any other person, which would, under New Hampshire law,,have operated as a waiver of the privilege and which would have resulted in the ability of Ms. Wilkinson to testify, inasmuch as there would have been, in such a case, no marital confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">At trial, however, the prosecution called the defendant\u2019s friend and the second witness. After their testimony, at a bench conference, the State sought admission of the wife\u2019s testimony and asked the court to reconsider its decision on the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the court ruled from the bench that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\">\u201c[T]he Motion that I had before me was whether or not she could testify. Having in mind the facts and circumstances that were related to me at the time, I wasn\u2019t aware through any testimony or through any pleading that he had told anybody else. Had I known that at the time I did my opinion, I probably would have stated the status of the law that it\u2019s revealed to somebody else and that person may waive it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>That doesn\u2019t differ substantially from the defendant making the statement to his wife in the presence of a third party. Clearly, that\u2019s waived because the purpose of this is not to be divulged to anybody. It\u2019s made in marital confidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">This may have been intended to be made in marital confidence in the very first instance . . . , [but] once he divulges that to the public he takes away that which he intended to preserve, a marital communication. So as far as my ruling is concerned, it\u2019s modified to the extent that he\u2019s waived it, and she\u2019s entitled to testify, both as to what she saw and what she heard him say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> The defendant appeals this decision on three grounds. He first argues that the court was precluded from reconsidering its decision on the defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>because of principles of <em>res judicata </em>and law of the case. New Hampshire law has long granted the superior court jurisdiction over a matter until its final judgment. <em>Redlon Co. v. Corporation, </em>91 N.H. 502, 503, 23 A.2d 370, 372 (1941). Thus, interlocutory rulings may be reconsidered at the discretion of the same or another judge of the superior court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Second, he argues that his wife\u2019s testimony was barred by the marital privilege, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201cHusband and wife are competent witnesses for or against each other in all cases, civil and criminal, except that unless otherwise specifically provided, neither shall be allowed to testify against the other as to any statement, conversation, letter or other communication made to the other or to another person, nor shall either be allowed in any case to testify as to any matter which in the opinion of the court would lead to a violation of marital confidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">N.H. R. Ev. 504; <em>see </em>RSA 516:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\"> The marital privilege is not a blanket immunity, <em>Corson v. Murinane, </em>51 N.H. 92 (1871) (note); rather, it is a privilege protecting marital confidences, <em>Clements v. Marston, </em>52 N.H. 31, 38 (1872). Read literally, as the defendant urges, there are two prongs of the privilege. <em>See </em>McNamara, <em>The Hierarchy of Evidentiary Privilege in New Hampshire, </em>20 N.H.B.J. 1, 6 (1978). The first prong appears to leave the court little discretion, excluding \u201cany statement, conversation, letter or other communication made to the other [spouse] or to another person.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 504. The second prong goes beyond matters in which one of the spouses is a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and beyond marital communications; it gives the judge discretion to exclude a spouse\u2019s testimony concerning \u201cany matter which in the opinion of the court would lead to a violation of marital confidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, in <em>Clements </em>this court folded both prongs into one, requiring a finding of a \u201cviolation of marital confidence\u201d before the court can exclude a spouse\u2019s testimony. 52 N.H. at 38. The New Hampshire legislature has had 120 years to overturn <em>Clements, </em>but has not. New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 504 is identical in all material respects to the statute construed in <em>Clements. Stare decisis </em>compels us to let current law stand. <em>Cf. Bolduc v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., </em>96 N.H. 235, 238, 73 A.2d 115, 117-18 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The court below found that at the outset the communication was privileged because the defendant intended a marital confidence, but that the privilege was later waived. In this State, \u201c[a] person claiming a privilege against disclosure waives the privilege if the person . . . knowingly and voluntarily discloses . . . any significant part of the privileged matter.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 510. The defendant contends that the court should have held an evidentiary hearing on whether the privilege was waived. However, because the defendant did not ask for a hearing during the bench conference, the issue was not preserved for review. <em>State v. McAdams, </em>134 N.H. 445, 448-49, 594 A.2d 1273, 1275 (1991). Moreover, the court had ample evidence before it to make the determination of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
