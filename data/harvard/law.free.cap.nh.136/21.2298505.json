Boyle by representing Peter Gregori in a criminal matter at the same time that he was acting as guardian ad litem for the children of Peter Gregori and Jane Gregori in a marital matter[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">In November 1985, the respondent, Gerard J. Boyle, accepted appointment as guardian ad litem (GAL) for the minor children of Jane and Peter Gregori in a \u201cbitter marital matter.\u201d He filed his GAL report in February 1986, which recommended that Peter Gregori be given custody of the children. In November 1986, following a contested hearing on the merits, the marital master issued a decision, which was approved by the superior court in November 1986, awarding custody to Jane Gregori. Numerous post-divorce motions were filed between November 1986 and the time of the respondent\u2019s withdrawal as GAL in November 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">The gravamen of the complaint against the respondent involves his representation of Peter Gregori in a criminal matter during the same period that he served as GAL for the Gregori children. In October 1986, a criminal complaint was filed against Peter Gregori alleging criminal trespass in the home of a friend of Jane Gregori. The respondent acted as defense counsel in the criminal matter which was tried in March 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">On July 13, 1988, Jane Gregori filed a complaint with the committee on professional conduct alleging, among other things, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>respondent\u2019s representation of Peter Gregori in the criminal matter while serving as GAL for the children in the marital matter was an impermissible conflict of interest. A petition for public censure was filed by the professional conduct committee on March 8, 1990. Following a prehearing conference, the judicial referee transferred the above-quoted question to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Rule 1.7(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">(2) the client consents after consultation and with knowledge of the consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The respondent maintains that his conduct did not violate this rule. Specifically, he argues that the Gregori children were not his \u201cclients\u201d under our holdings in <em>Ross v. Gadwah, </em>131 N.H. 391, 554 A.2d 1284 (1988), and <em>In re Lisa G., </em>127 N.H. 585, 504 A.2d 1 (1986), and, therefore, it was \u201clegally impossible\u201d for him to violate Rule 1.7(b). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\"> When attorneys serve as guardians ad litem, \u201cthey do not act as legal counsel for the child, but rather as parties to the proceedings.\u201d <em>Ross v. Gadwah, </em>131 N.H. at 395, 554 A.2d at 1286; <em>see also In re Lisa G., </em>127 N.H. at 591, 504 A.2d at 4 (describing GALs role as that of substitute decision-maker or concerned parent). Consequently, the Gregori children were not the respondent\u2019s \u201cclients.\u201d This fact does not, however, place the respondent\u2019s conduct beyond the reach of Rule 1.7(b). The language of the rule is broad. It governs not only conflicts arising out of the representation of multiple clients, but also conflicts arising out of the representation of a client and the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">Rule 1.7(b) permits an attorney to represent a client despite the existence of a possible conflict of interest if the client is informed of the consequences of, and consents to, the potentially conflicting representation. Because he obtained Peter Gregori\u2019s consent after discussing the possible conflict of interest, the respondent maintains that \u201cneither his representation of Mr. Gregori nor that of his continuing service as non-attorney Guardian ad Litem . . . effected] [sic] his representation of either party in either capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>A lawyer may seek consent to the potentially conflicting representation only when \u201cthe lawyer <em>reasonably </em>believes the representation will not be adversely affected.\u201d Rule 1.7(b) (emphasis added). The comments to ABA Model Rule 1.7, which does not materially differ from the applicable portion of our Rule 1.7, explain that \u201cwhen a disinterested lawyer would conclude that the client should not agree to the representation under the circumstances, the lawyer involved cannot properly ask for such agreement or provide representation on the basis of the client\u2019s consent.\u201d We find this to be such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"> The responsibilities of the two roles accepted by the respondent are in fundamental conflict. \u201cGuardians ad litem serve a function that combines the best aspects of their roles as advocates for the children and as impartial Court officials.\u201d <em>Ross v. Gadwah, </em>131 N.H. at 394, 554 A.2d at 1285 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe basic duty the lawyer for the accused owes to the administration of justice is to serve as the accused\u2019s counselor and advocate with courage, devotion, and to the utmost of his or her learning and ability and according to law.\u201d 1 American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice, Standard 4-1.1(b) (2d ed. 1980). Consequently, because a fundamental conflict exists between the respondent\u2019s role as advocate for the children and his role as advocate for the father, the respondent\u2019s representation of the father was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The respondent further argues that because he had already filed his GAL report before he undertook Peter Gregori\u2019s defense in the criminal matter, \u201c[he] had <em>necessarily </em>\u2018taken sides\u2019 in the custody battle[,] . . . had <em>necessarily </em>forfeited all impartiality in the matter[, and] . . . was <em>necessarily </em>no longer neutral in the matter . . . .\u201d These statements display a blatant disregard for the on-going duty of a GAL to represent the best interest of the children, a duty which does not cease upon the filing of the GAL report. <em>See </em>RSA 458:17-a, I (authorizing appointment of GAL whenever custody or visitation of children disputed, even after final divorce decree).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">There was a reasonable possibility that, by virtue of the respondent\u2019s duties as GAL, he might discover facts that would inure to the detriment of his client. Peter Gregori, however, was entitled to have unconflicted representation. \u201cA defendant is not afforded the effective assistance of counsel unless his attorney is acting in his interest and his interest only.\u201d R. McNamara, 1 New Hampshire Practice, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 469 (2d ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>1991); <em>see also State v. Theodore, </em>118 N.H. 548, 550, 392 A.2d 122, 123 (1978) (mandating that \u201ccourts be sensitive to possible conflicts of interest that could impair an attorney\u2019s ability to vigorously defend his [or her] client\u2019s interest\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">We hold that the respondent violated Rule 1.7(b), and consequently violated Rule 8.4(a), which establishes \u201cprofessional misconduct\u201d resulting from such violations, by simultaneously representing the father and serving as GAL for the children. Accordingly, we answer the referee\u2019s question in the affirmative and remand for further proceedings concerning sanction and responsibility for expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b39-6\">Brock, C.J., and Batchelder, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
