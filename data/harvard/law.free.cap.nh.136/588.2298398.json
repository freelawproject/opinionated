On October 24,1990, we appointed a Judicial Referee <em>(Bean, </em>J.) to conduct a hearing on the committee\u2019s petition. The referee found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent violated Rules 1.1(a), 1.1(b)(5), 1.1(c)(4), 1.3(a), 1.4(a), and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct (the Rules). The respondent maintains that the evidence presented does not support the findings of ethical misconduct. Failing this argument, he contends that mitigating circumstances favor the imposition of a reprimand rather than a suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">Early in 1987, Robert and Mary Dambach consulted with the respondent\u2019s law firm regarding financial problems their small corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ration was having with its principal lender, New Hampshire Business Development Corporation (NHBDC). In July 1987, they received from NHBDC notice of foreclosure on their home, which was mortgaged along with other property as collateral for the business loan. Their case was assigned to the respondent, who was able to negotiate a settlement with NHBDC, which reduced the outstanding amount of the loan and allowed the Dambachs an additional twenty-seven months for repayment. He also convinced the Internal Revenue Service that a $32,000 claim against his client should be the responsibility of NHBDC. At the time of the NHBDC settlement, it was decided that the Dambachs should bring suit against a consultant they had hired at the insistence of NHBDC. According to the Dambachs, the consultant\u2019s mismanagement of their corporation had been a substantial cause of their financial problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">During the fall of 1987 and the year of 1988, the Dambachs, eager to procure funds with which to repay the outstanding loan balance, urged the respondent to bring suit against the consultant. Sometime around Christmas of 1988, the respondent falsely informed the Dambachs that the suit paperwork had been lost by the sheriff\u2019s department, even though the Dambachs understood that service previously had been made. Finally, in June of 1989 at a meeting called by the respondent, he confessed to them that he never had brought suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The respondent does not dispute that he misrepresented the status of the litigation to the Dambachs. He does, however, deny that this misrepresentation supports the \u201carray of allegations of ethical misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">The referee found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cRule 1.1(a)\u2014While the services performed were competent representation, the failure to bring suit is a lack of competent representation as is outlined in 1.1(b)(5) and (c)4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">Rule 1.3(a)\u2014Failure to bring suit is also failure to act with reasonable promptness and diligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">Rule 1.4(a)\u2014Failure to properly inform his clients that suit had not been brought against [the consultant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">Rule 8.4\u2014It is misconduct to engage in conduct involving misrepresentation, under paragraph (c).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">In our review of the referee\u2019s findings, \u201cour only function is to determine whether a reasonable [person] could have reached the same decision as the [referee] on the basis of the evidence before him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Bourdon\u2019s Case, </em>132 N.H. 365, 370, 565 A.2d 1052, 1055 (1989) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Rule 1.1(a) states: \u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.\u201d To support his argument that his representation exhibited \u201coverall professional competence,\u201d the respondent directs us to the referee\u2019s finding that \u201cthe work performed by the respondent for the Dambachs was, except for the failure to bring suit and the misrepresentation that he had brought suit, ... of the highest quality.\u201d However, \u201c[i]t is not enough for respondent to demonstrate that in some, but not all, instances his conduct satisfied the requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Bourdon\u2019s Case, </em>132 N.H. at 375, 565 A.2d at 1059. As the referee found, the respondent\u2019s failure to file suit contravenes the Rules\u2019 requirements for \u201cattention to details and schedules necessary to assure that the matter undertaken is completed with no avoidable harm to the [clients\u2019] interest,\u201d Rule 1.1(b)(5), and \u201cundertaking] actions on the [clients\u2019] behalf in a timely and effective manner,\u201d Rule 1.1(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The respondent similarly denies that he failed to act with \u201creasonable promptness and diligence in representing a client,\u201d contrary to Rule 1.3(a). He maintains that because the statute of limitations still had a year and a half to run when he revealed his failure to file suit to the Dambachs, \u201cno harm befell the Dambachs by the delay.\u201d We disagree. \u201cEven when the client\u2019s interests are not affected in substance, however, unreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety and undermine confidence in the lawyer\u2019s trustworthiness.\u201d N.H. Rules of Prof. Conduct 1.3, ABA model code comments. We find no error in the referee\u2019s determination that the respondent violated this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Rule 1.4(a) requires a lawyer to \u201ckeep a client reasonably informed regarding the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.\u201d The respondent concedes in his brief that he \u201cfreely admitted that he failed to properly inform the Dambachs that suit had not been filed, thereby contravening the terms of Rule 1.4(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\"> Finally, the referee found a violation of Rule 8.4(c), which establishes professional misconduct where a lawyer \u201cengage[s] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The respondent contends that although he has never denied misrepresenting the status of litigation to the Dambachs, he has never acted in any way that can be characterized as dishonest, fraudulent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>deceitful. Rule 8.4(c) is disjunctive, however. A finding of misrepresentation alone constitutes misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Finding no error in the referee\u2019s ruling, we turn to the determination of the appropriate sanction. Although the committee has petitioned to suspend the respondent for six months, the respondent maintains that mitigating circumstances justify the imposition of a reprimand rather than a suspension. \u201c[The] purpose of the court\u2019s disciplinary power ... is to protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, and preserve the integrity of the legal profession,\u201d <em>Henderson\u2019s Case, </em>130 N.H. 313, 315, 538 A.2d 1222, 1224 (1988), and to prevent similar conduct in the future, <em>Astles\u2019 Case, </em>134 N.H. 602, 605, 594 A.2d 167, 170 (1991). \u201c[Disciplinary action is not taken as a mode of inflicting punishment for an offense.\u201d <em>Silverstein\u2019s Case, </em>108 N.H. 400, 401, 236 A.2d 488, 490 (1967) (quotation omitted). To accomplish the desired ends, every case is judged on its own facts and circumstances. <em>Flint\u2019s Case, </em>133 N.H. 685, 689, 582 A.2d 291, 293 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The sanction determined must be sufficient to meet the purposes we have stated. It must be determined by giving appropriate weight to the severity of the violations found and to the mitigating circumstances disclosed by the record. As to severity, \u201c[n]o single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie.\u201d <em>Astles\u2019 Case, </em>134 N.H. at 606, 594 A.2d at 170. Although we have ordered disbarment as the appropriate sanction when faced with a lawyer\u2019s dishonesty in the past, <em>see id. </em>at 607, 594 A.2d at 170; <em>Flint\u2019s Case, </em>133 N.H. at 691, 582 A.2d at 294; <em>Eshleman\u2019s Case, </em>126 N.H. 1, 6, 489 A.2d 571, 574 (1985), those cases involved additional and repeated misconduct, including the respondents\u2019 failure to cooperate with the professional conduct committee. Here, the respondent\u2019s unprofessional conduct was isolated and his candor and cooperation with the committee unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">As to mitigation, the respondent refers this court to the thirteen mitigating factors outlined in the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>arguing that ten are solidly present in his case. <em>See </em>Laws. Man. on Prof. Conduct (ABA/BNA) 01:839-40 (June 17,1992). We note that although this court has never formally adopted these standards, we have examined mitigators when imposing sanctions in the past. <em>See, e.g., Whelan\u2019s Case, </em>136 N.H. 559, 564, 619 A.2d 571, 574 (1992); <em>Carroll\u2019s Case, </em>127 N.H. 390, 393, 503 A.2d 750, 751 (1985). The respondent notes, in mitigation, the absence of a prior disciplinary record and the absence of a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>honest or selfish motive. He asserts the presence of personal and emotional problems. The referee did in fact cite the respondent\u2019s testimony of a litany of such problems during the violation period, including serious marital discord, serious and unpleasant disruption in the respondent\u2019s law firm, a diagnosed adjustment disorder, depression, and financial pressures. The respondent also asserts timely, good faith efforts to rectify the consequences of the misconduct. The record supports that the respondent \u201cbrought the misrepresentation to the attention of his clients,\u201d but did little more in the way of rectification. He correctly asserts full and free disclosure to the committee and cooperation in their proceedings. He claims inexperience in the practice of law, which appears on the record, but this is of little materiality to the violations found. <em>See Eshleman\u2019s Case, </em>126 N.H. at 6, 489 A.2d at 574. He claims good character and reputation, a claim unchallenged other than by this incident. He points to his present position in the General Counsel\u2019s Office of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a position the referee found to be conditioned on his continued good standing at our bar. At oral argument it was disclosed that this condition could be waived, but promotion would be denied in the absence of such standing. Finally, the respondent claims the mitigating factor of remorse. On the record as a whole, this claim would seem to be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The referee, in reviewing mitigation, stated that \u201c[t]he evidence, including the demeanor of the respondent, at the hearing is entirely consistent with the request [reprimand] made by counsel for the respondent.\u201d In recounting the committee\u2019s arguments regarding the severity of the offense, the referee found the case for suspension to be based on \u201can equally strong argument on behalf of the Committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We conclude that public censure will satisfy the stated purposes of protecting the public, maintaining the public confidence in the bar, preserving the integrity of the legal profession, and deterring future misconduct. The respondent\u2019s violations must be considered substantial, particularly the misrepresentation. His violations, however, flow essentially from an isolated course of conduct, which he voluntarily disclosed in a manner calculated to mitigate prejudice to his clients. The respondent does not have a prior disciplinary record, <em>compare Flint\u2019s Case, </em>133 N.H. at 688, 582 A.2d at 292, and we agree that the respondent did not act for personal gain. We conclude that the respondent has made a persuasive case for mitigation. We note, however, that despite all of the factors driving the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>to procrastinate, he could have avoided the result here by merely recognizing his problems and promptly withdrawing from representing his clients.</p>\n<p id=\"A10\">We order public censure on all the violations charged and order the respondent to reimburse the committee for the costs of investigating and prosecuting this matter, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
