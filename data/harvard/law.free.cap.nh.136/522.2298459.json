The warrant was executed on October 19, 1989, resulting in the seizure of a quantity of marijuana. The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied by the Superior Court <em>(Barry, </em>J.). The defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Superior Court <em>(Groff, </em>J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The defendant argues that the evidence should have been suppressed because the affidavit submitted in the warrant application did not establish probable cause as required by part I, article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the fourth amendment of the Federal Constitution. Because we find that the seizure was illegal under our State Constitution, we need not reach the fourth amendment issue. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 232, 471 A.2d 347, 351 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The defendant contends that no probable cause could be found because the affidavit neither vouched for the reliability and credibility of the two undisclosed informants, nor provided any reason to believe that marijuana would be found in the defendant\u2019s home. The State, while admitting that the affidavit was inartfully drafted, maintains that it nevertheless provided a substantial basis for the magistrate to determine that probable cause existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The standard for determining if an affidavit in support of a search warrant establishes probable cause is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201cGiven all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before the magistrate, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, was there a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found in the particular place described in the warrant?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\"><em>State v. Davis, </em>133 N.H. 211, 213, 575 A.2d 4, 6 (1990) (quotations, ellipses and citations omitted). In reviewing the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause, this court will not \u201cinvalidate a warrant by interpreting the evidence submitted in a hypertechnical sense ____\u201d <em>State v. Caicedo, </em>135 N.H. 122, 125, 599 A.2d 895, 897 (1991). \u201cAffidavits in support of search warrants must be read, tested and interpreted in a realistic fashion and with common sense.\u201d <em>State v. Hazen, </em>131 N.H. 196, 200, 552 A.2d 77, 79 (1988) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">A common sense reading of the affidavit supports the defendant\u2019s argument that it does not establish probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s residence. Under the totality-of-the-circumstances test adopted by this court in <em>State v. Carroll, </em>131 N.H. 179, 187, 552 A.2d 69, 73 (1988), an informant\u2019s veracity and basis for knowledge remain important factors to be considered when determining if probable cause exists. The affidavit submitted here provides no indication of the informants\u2019 veracity, nor if the informants are known to be trustworthy or have provided reliable information in the past. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>lack of facts attesting to the veracity of the informants does not preclude a finding of probable cause, however, because \u201cother indicia of reliability, such as corroboration by police officers, may be used to supply the missing factors relative to the informant and the informant\u2019s information in determining the existence of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 552 A.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The State contends that there was adequate independent police corroboration of informant A\u2019s information because Officer Laponious confirmed the fact that the phone number dialed by the informant belonged to the defendant and Laponious witnessed the \u201ctransaction\u201d between A and the defendant. The police corroboration relied upon by the State does not dispose of the defendant\u2019s claim that while the affidavit may have established probable cause to arrest the defendant for selling marijuana, it did not establish probable cause to search his residence. <em>See State v. Doe, </em>115 N.H. 682, 685, 371 A.2d 167, 169 (1975) (probable cause to search is not the same as probable cause to arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The only fact alleged in the affidavit that possibly refers to the defendant\u2019s residence is the telephone number dialed by the informant and confirmed by Laponious. The State concedes that there is no information in the affidavit confirming that this telephone number, 635-9607, is the number servicing the defendant\u2019s residence at 34 Tallant Road in Pelham. Although the State admits that the telephone number could have been that of the defendant\u2019s office or car phone, it argues that the affidavit provides a reasonable basis for the issuing magistrate to infer that the number was the defendant\u2019s home number.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Assuming that the magistrate drew the inference that 635-9607 was the defendant\u2019s home number, that phone number is the only connection between A\u2019s information and the defendant\u2019s residence. The affidavit does not state where the two purchases of marijuana were made. The informant does not state that it is his or her belief that drugs are kept at the defendant\u2019s residence or that he or she has seen drugs at the defendant\u2019s residence. <em>Cf. Caicedo, </em>135 N.H. at 123, 599 A.2d at 895 (informant stated that defendant sold cocaine at stated address and made a controlled buy at that address); <em>Davis, </em>133 N.H. at 212, 575 A.2d at 5 (informant saw marijuana on defendant\u2019s porch and in living quarters); <em>Hazen, </em>131 N.H. at 202, 552 A.2d at 80-81 (controlled buy at defendant\u2019s residence substantiated informant\u2019s information that defendant commonly sold cocaine from residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number> An affidavit may establish probable cause without the observance of contraband at the location to be searched. <em>See State v. Westover, </em>127 N.H. 130, 497 A.2d 1218 (1985) (phone number referred to by trustworthy informant was investigated by Federal Drug Enforcement Agency and defendant\u2019s neighbors noted frequent visitors at all hours). The informant here lacked personal knowledge of the presence of drugs in the defendant\u2019s residence and did not indicate any other circumstances that would support the inference, by either the affiant or the magistrate, that the defendant stored drugs in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The State relies heavily on <em>State v. Grimshaw, </em>128 N.H. 431, 515 A.2d 1201 (1986), to support its argument that when a magistrate can reasonably infer a person is a drug dealer, then there is a fair probability that controlled drugs could be found at that person\u2019s residence. The issue in <em>Grimshaw, </em>however, was whether the information provided by the informant was stale, not whether it provided probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s residence. In addition, the facts contained in the affidavit before us differ significantly from those contained in the <em>Grimshaw </em>affidavit, which stated that the disclosed informant had observed the defendant in possession of drugs on twenty to twenty-five occasions over a long period of time, and that the police had verified other information provided by the informant. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 515 A.2d at 1204. In the case before us, the police witnessed one \u201ctransaction\u201d between A and the defendant during the week of October 15, 1989; informant A alleged that the defendant conducted another sale of marijuana during the same week; and an undisclosed informant B allegedly witnessed both transactions. We are not persuaded that the fact that the defendant sold marijuana twice within one week provides probable cause to search his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"> The State urges us to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that if the magistrate determines that a person is a drug dealer, then a finding of probable cause to search that person\u2019s residence automatically follows. The State contends that the issuing magistrate can find that the fact that a person is an active drug dealer creates a fair probability that controlled drugs or other indicia of drug dealing could be found in the drug dealer\u2019s residence. We do not accept the State\u2019s invitation and note that we have consistently required some nexus between the defendant\u2019s residence and drug-dealing activities in order to establish probable cause to search the residence. <em>See Carroll, </em>131 N.H. at 188, 552 A.2d at 74 (police observations during stake-out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>of defendant\u2019s house and information relayed by informant provided probable cause); <em>Davis, </em>133 N.H. at 212, 575 A.2d at 5 (informant observed drugs at defendant\u2019s residence). In the affidavit before us there was nothing to indicate that evidence of the crime was kept at, or picked up from, the defendant\u2019s residence other than the mere fact that the defendant was suspected of being a criminal. We hold that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Finally, the State argues that because the police conducted a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d between informant A and the defendant, there was sufficient corroboration to establish probable cause. This argument is without merit because the affidavit does not indicate that there was a controlled buy. At the suppression hearing, Laponious informed the court that there had been a controlled buy, but a court may not consider information that was not presented to the magistrate who issued the search warrant. <em>Whiteley v. Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 565 n.8 (1971) (otherwise insufficient affidavit cannot be rehabilitated by testimony concerning information possessed by affiant when seeking warrant but that was not disclosed to issuing magistrate); <em>see </em>2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 4.3(a), at 167-69 (2d ed. 1987). Even if such testimony had been presented to the issuing magistrate, it would not have provided the requisite nexus to the defendant\u2019s residence because the controlled buy occurred in the defendant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
