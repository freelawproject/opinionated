Lunt. Because we hold that there is no posthumous support obligation on a parent\u2019s estate without a preexisting order to that effect, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">The plaintiff is a single mother who gave birth to the child one week after the death of the father. The parents of the child never married. The father had been married and was survived by adult children from his marriage. The father\u2019s estate was inventoried in excess of five hundred thousand dollars; the child for whom support is sought in this action is entitled to a one-quarter interest as a pretermitted heir. The defendants in this action are the co-executors of the decedent\u2019s will and have stipulated to the paternity of the child. With paternity not in issue in this case, we turn to the statutes upon which the plaintiff relies in her pursuit of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\"> RSA chapter 168-A, the Uniform Act on Paternity, establishes an obligation on the father for the support of his child born out of wedlock. For such a child, a father\u2019s support obligations are the same as for a child born in wedlock. RSA 168-A:1; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>131 N.H. 573, 576, 558 A.2d 454, 455 (1989). RSA 168-A:3, however, limits the liability of the father\u2019s estate \u201cto amounts accrued prior to his death and such sums as may be payable for dependence under other laws.\u201d It is on the \u201cpayable for dependence under other laws\u201d language that the plaintiff bases her claim for support. Her argument is untenable, however, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-8\">The official comment to the Uniform Act on Paternity indicates that \u201csuch sums as may be payable for dependence under other laws\u201d refers to \u201claws regarding \u2018family allowances\u2019 or similar provision for <em>temporary </em>support of dependents.\u201d <em>Unif. Act on Paternity </em>\u00a7 4 comment, 9B U.L.A. 356 (1987) (emphasis added). A family allowance, which is purely a creature of statute, is intended to main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>tain the security of dependents only pending the administration of the estate. 31 Am. JUR. 2d <em>Executors and Administrators </em>\u00a7 714 (1989). New Hampshire\u2019s only family allowance provision is for the support of the widow, RSA 554:19, III (Supp. 1991); RSA 560:1, and \u201cis intended to enable her to support herself until her interest in the estate can be provided to her,\u201d <em>Mathes v. Bennett, </em>21 N.H. 188, 201 (1850).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The plaintiff, relying nonetheless on RSA 168-A:3, argues that the child\u2019s right to support from her father\u2019s estate is found in RSA 554:19 (Supp. 1991), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-6\">\u201cThe estate of every person deceased shall be chargeable with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-7\">I. The just expenses of the administration thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-8\">II. The necessary expenses of the funeral of the deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-9\">III. A reasonable allowance to the widow, as by law provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-10\">IV. The just debts owed by the deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-11\">V. The support and maintenance of infant children of the deceased until they arrive at the age of eighteen years, if the estate is in fact solvent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-12\">VI. The legacies given by the will of the deceased.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-13\">The plaintiff reads paragraph V above as conferring substantive rights to child support, independent of any preexisting obligation of the father. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-14\"> RSA 554:19 (Supp. 1991), entitled \u201cPriority of Charges,\u201d sets forth the order of preference for the payment of charges against the estate. These expenses are obligations against the estate that must be paid, in order of preference, prior to any testamentary dispositions, because \u201ca man must be just before he is generous.\u201d <em>Guggenheimer v. Guggenheimer, </em>99 N.H. 399, 403, 112 A.2d 61, 64 (1955). RSA 554:19 (Supp. 1991) merely establishes the priority of payment of allowable charges against the estate, C. DeGrandpre &amp; K. Robinson, 10 New Hampshire Practice, Probate Law and Procedure \u00a7 682, at 317 (1990), and is not itself the source of the obligations giving rise to the charges. <em>See Young v. Benton, </em>70 N.H. 268, 268, 46 A. 51, 51 (1899) (\u201ccharge\u201d on the estate creates a priority).</p>\n<p id=\"b21-15\"> So understood, paragraph V of RSA 554:19 (Supp. 1991) provides only that such child support obligations as survive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>father\u2019s death shall be fifth in line in priority of payment. We have consistently held that \u2018\u201cunless otherwise provided, support payments terminate upon the death of either spouse, and the estates of the spouses have no rights or responsibilities concerning these payments.\u2019\u201d <em>Dupuis v. Click, </em>135 N.H. 333, 335, 604 A.2d 576, 577 (1992) (quoting <em>Stebbins v. Stebbins, </em>121 N.H. 1060, 1063, 438 A.2d 295, 297-98 (1981)). Thus, something more than simply the father\u2019s death is required to impose an obligation on his estate for child support. What is required is that the obligation on the estate be expressly provided for before death. If, therefore, by way of a divorce decree or support order a court \u201cmak[es] an order during the life of the father binding on his estate,\u201d <em>Guggenheimer, </em>99 N.H. at 402, 112 A.2d at 63, \u201cthe children become judgment creditors by force of the decree for support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 112 A.2d at 64. In such circumstances, RSA 554:19, V (Supp. 1991) would operate to create a charge against the estate for child support ranking fifth in priority of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Here, no provision for support predated the death of the child\u2019s father. Because the support obligations for a child born out of wedlock are the same as those for a child born in wedlock, RSA 168-A:1, and the obligations for a child born in wedlock cease upon the father\u2019s death absent some provision to the contrary, <em>see Dupuis, supra </em>at 335, 604 A.2d at 578, the plaintiff is not entitled to child support from the father\u2019s estate. <em>See </em>Annotation, <em>Death of Putative Father as Precluding Action for Determination of Paternity or for Child Support, </em>58 A.L.R. 3d 188, 191 (1974) (cases almost unanimous that paternity proceeding \u201cmay not be instituted after the death of the putative father so as to charge his estate with the duty to support the [child]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
