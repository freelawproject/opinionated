Commercial Union appeals the Superior Court\u2019s <em>(Temple, </em>J.) ruling setting aside and modifying the decision of the arbitrator <em>(Stephen J. Dibble, </em>Esq.), who denied coverage for the Masses. The sole issue we discuss is whether the superior court properly found the arbitrator\u2019s decision flawed by \u201cplain mistake.\u201d We conclude that it did not and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The accident engendering this litigation occurred on August 7, 1987, at approximately 9:00 p.m., near the intersection of Pine and Mill Roads in North Hampton. Robert Masse and Robert Blatchford were riding on Blatchford\u2019s motorcycle when the motorcycle collided with two trees, throwing both men to the ground and injuring them severely. Neither man was wearing a helmet, and the force of the impact destroyed their memories of the accident. A police officer re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>sponded to the scene, but took no photographs of the area, licited no statements from the men, and noted no physical evidence of the accident other than the positions of the men, the motorcycle, the intersection, and the two trees. Apparently, no one but the now memory-impaired motorcyclists witnessed the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Masses assumed that Blatchford, and not Robert Masse, drove the motorcycle at the time of the accident, and as Blatchford had no liability insurance, the Masses asked Commercial Union for coverage under the uninsured motorist provisions of their insurance contract. These provisions state that Commercial Union must pay the Masses any damages which an owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle is legally obligated to pay the Masses, so long as the owner or operator\u2019s liability arises \u201cout of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the uninsured vehicle. Commercial Union denied the Masses\u2019 claim, and the case went to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">At the hearing before the arbitrator, the parties presented the following evidence to explain how the accident probably happened. First, the Masses introduced Blatchford\u2019s deposition testimony that he had never had any mechanical problems with the motorcycle. Second, they submitted a police accident reconstruction diagram showing the motorcycle\u2019s direction and point of loss of control; the diagram, however, cites no evidence to support this reconstruction. Finally, they introduced testimony suggesting that Blatchford in fact drove the motorcycle. Commercial Union introduced the relevant portions of the insurance contract and elicited testimony that Robert Masse may have been drinking just before the ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The arbitrator decided the case in Commercial Union\u2019s favor, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201c[o]n the state of the evidence there is no reason to conclude that Robert Blatchford was incompetent in the operation of a motorcycle, that he could not and did not exercise reasonable care and caution at all pertinent times, or that claimant failed to exercise due care and caution in accepting a ride on the motorcycle on the evening in question or in conducting himself upon such motorcycle while underway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The arbitrator noted the lack of foundation for the accident reconstruction contained in the police diagram and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">\u201cOn the state of the evidence presented, there is no means by which the arbitrator can conclude more probably than not that the motorcycle was traveling on either Pine Road or Mill Road prior to the loss of control, whether it was travel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ing in a northerly or southerly direction at such time, whether it was traveling in its proper travel lane or in the opposite lane, or whether it was traveling at a reasonable speed or at an unreasonable speed at the time of loss of control. ... While there is evidence that an accident occurred at the time and place alleged by claimant and described in the police report, there is no evidence that it resulted from a negligent act or omission of Robert Blatchford.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The arbitrator concluded that Blatchford probably drove the motorcycle at the time of the accident and found \u201cno evidence that the loss of control was or was not caused by the negligent act of some unknown person or object, animate or inanimate.\u201d The arbitrator did not mention Blatchford\u2019s deposition testimony that the motorcycle had been mechanically sound before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The Masses appealed the arbitrator\u2019s decision to the superior court pursuant to RSA 542:8, which allows a party to \u201capply to the superior court for an order ... correcting or modifying the [arbitrator\u2019s] award for plain mistake.\u201d After reviewing the record of the arbitration hearing, <em>see Masse v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>134 N.H. 523, 526, 593 A.2d 1164, 1165-66 (1991), the superior court agreed with the arbitrator\u2019s characterization of the evidence as largely inconclusive. The court, however, noted what t he arbitrator failed to mention: that Blatchford had described his motorcycle as being mechanically sound prior to the accident. The court consequently found \u201cplain mistake\u201d in the arbitrator\u2019s decision and stated: \u201c[T]here appears to be no basis to find that this accident occurred other than as a result of the negligence of Mr. Blatchford. As noted above, [the accident] cannot be attributed to other causes on th'6 evidence presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On appeal to this court, Commercial Union maintains that the superior court exceeded the scope of its review and substituted its own judgment for that of the arbitrator. Nothing in the evidence presented to the arbitrator, Commercial Union argues, required him to find in the Masses\u2019 favor. The Masses disagree, arguing that the superior court correctly found the arbitrator\u2019s decision unreasonable, unsupported by the evidence, factually erroneous, and an abuse of discretion. In particular, the Masses contend-that the superior court\u2019s ruling implicitly supports their argument that the arbitrator held them to an erroneously high standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Before examining the law of \u201cplain mistake,\u201d we first address a preliminary issue, our standard of review. The Masses argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>the superior court\u2019s order deserves the deference usually given to a lower court\u2019s findings. <em>See, e.g., Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Custombilt, Inc., </em>128 N.H. 167, 170, 512 A.2d 1098, 1099 (1986). We disagree. \u201c[B]ecause the trial judge decided the case on the [record] and therefore could not have observed the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, the standard of review should be broadened.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Carr, </em>119 N.H. 851, 854, 409 A.2d 782, 783-84 (1979). \u201cAs all the documents from below are available for our perusal, the lower court was in no better position to decide the case than\u2019are we.\u2019\u2019 <em>Hillside Assocs. of Hollis v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>135 N.H. 325, 330, 605 A.2d 1026, 1029 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Turning to the main issue on appeal, we note that RSA 542:8 allows the superior court to alter an arbitrator\u2019s decision only for \u201cplain mistake,\u201d or to vacate it for \u201cfraud, corruption, or misconduct.\u201d The Masses do not allege fraud, corruption, or misconduct; the superior court was therefore limited to reviewing the arbitrator\u2019s decision for \u201cplain mistake.\u201d <em>Masse, </em>134 N.H. at 526, 593 A.2d at 1165. As the Masses point out, the term \u201crefer[s] both to mistakes of fact and mistakes of law,\u201d <em>N.H. Ins. Co. v. Bell, </em>121 N.H. 127,129, 427 A.2d 27, 28 (1981); however, \u201c[t]o constitute plain mistake, the error must be one which is apparent on the face of the record and which would have been corrected had it been called to the arbitrator\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Rand v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., </em>132 N.H. 768, 771, 571 A.2d 282, 284 (1990). Moreover, the arbitrator must have \u201c\u2018manifestly fallen into such an error with regard to facts or law... as must have prevented the full and fair exercise of [his or her] judgment upon the subject submitted to [him or her].\u201d\u2019 <em>Franklin Needle Co. v. Labor Union, </em>99 N.H. 101,105-06,105 A.2d 382, 385 (1954) (quoting <em>Sanborn v. Murphy, </em>50 N.H. 65, 69 (1870)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The superior court accordingly is bound to grant the arbitrator \u201ca great deal of deference,\u201d <em>Masse, </em>134 N.H. at 526, 593 A.2d at 1166. It may not, as the Masses suggest, set aside the decision merely because it believes the arbitrator\u2019s award is against the weight of the evidence. <em>Cf. Broderick v. Watts, </em>136 N.H. 153, 162, 614 A.2d 600, 606 (1992) (distinguishing between review for plain mistake and for a decision against the weight of the evidence); <em>White Mountains Railroad v. Beane, </em>39 N.H. 107, 109 (1859) (\u201cAn award is not to be disturbed because the arbitrators have come to a mistaken conclusion upon a question of fact, upon which the parties have presented and discussed their evidence and proofs, and upon which the referees have exercised their judgments.\u201d). At the very least, the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>court must refrain from altering the arbitrator\u2019s decision unless the court concludes that the mistake alleged affected the arbitrator\u2019s ultimate award. <em>Cf. Turcotte v. Griffin, </em>120 N.H. 292, 295, 415 A.2d 668, 670 (1980) (court correctly set aside arbitrator\u2019s award because arbitrator mistook law \u201con the vital point of which parcel of land described in the lease was the object of the option to purchase\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">Viewing the arbitrator\u2019s decision in light of the standards enumerated above, we hold that the superior court erred in setting aside and modifying the arbitrator\u2019s award. The Masses allege that several mistakes are \u201capparent on the face of the record,\u201d <em>Rand supra, </em>but we are not persuaded that any of them, if mistakes at all, affected the outcome of the case, or \u201cwould have been corrected had [they] been called to the arbitrator\u2019s attention,\u201d <em>Rand supra. </em>The Masses, for instance, insist that the arbitrator subjected them to an erroneously high burden of proof. They point to nothing in his decision, however, that either supports this contention or establishes that the arbitrator would have necessarily reached a different conclusion had he applied the \u201ccorrect\u201d standard of proof. The record indicates that the arbitrator simply found the evidence insufficient to establish that Blatchford negligently caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The Masses also argue that the arbitrator erroneously ignored Blatchford\u2019s testimony concerning the pre-accident condition of his motorcycle and that this omission constituted \u201cplain mistake.\u201d Assuming the arbitrator did ignore Blatchford\u2019s testimony, however, we are not persuaded that the arbitrator committed \u201cplain mistake.\u201d First, as the trier of fact, the arbitrator was not bound to accept anyone\u2019s testimony as true, even if uncontradicted. <em>See Gordon v. Gordon, </em>117 N.H. 862, 865, 379 A.2d 810, 813 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"> Second, even if we agree that the arbitrator should have accepted Blatchford\u2019s testimony, it is not at all plain that such evidence would necessarily lead to the conclusion that the accident was caused by Blatchford\u2019s negligence. An inference of negligence is not warranted in the absence of direct or circumstantial evidence unless all \u201cother responsible causes are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence.\u201d <em>Rowe v. Public Serv. Co., </em>115 N.H. 397, 399, 342 A.2d 656, 658 (1975). Although Blatchford\u2019s testimony about the condition of his motorcycle supports eliminating mechanical failure as a responsible cause of the accident, it does not necessitate it. The Masses presented no evidence that the motorcycle had been inspected after the accident and certified free of pre-accident defect. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>while the scant evidence below militated against a finding that road defects or bad weather could have been responsible for the accident, other possible causes, such as an animal darting in front of the motorcycle, were not \u201csufficiently eliminated by the evidence,\u201d <em>id., </em>to warrant an inference of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Finally, even assuming that \u201cother responsible causes [were] sufficiently eliminated by the evidence,\u201d <em>Rowe supra, </em>the arbitrator would have been well within the bounds of legal precedent to decide, as he did, not to infer negligence from the circumstantial evidence presented. We therefore cannot say that, had the arbitrator considered Blatchford\u2019s testimony about his motorcycle\u2019s condition, the arbitrator would have corrected his alleged mistake and decided the case any differently. <em>See Rand, </em>132 N.H. at 771, 571 A.2d at 284; <em>Turcotte, </em>120 N.H. at 295, 415 A.2d at 670; <em>Franklin Needle, </em>99 N.H. at 105-06, 105 A.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Masses also maintain that the superior court found several factual errors in the arbitrator\u2019s decision, in addition to his failure to mention Blatehford\u2019s testimony regarding the condition of his motorcycle, and that these errors amounted to \u201cplain mistake.\u201d Without setting forth the Masses\u2019 argument point by point, we observe that a close comparison of the superior court\u2019s order and the arbitrator\u2019s decision reveals no material factual disagreement between the two adjudicators except for the testimony of Blatchford. We therefore-find no \u201cplain mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-8\">Batchelder, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AUt\">Batchelder, J., dissenting: I would affirm the trial court.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
