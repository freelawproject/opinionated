The separate shipments consisted of one, two, three, and four carload lots, aggregating twenty-one cars, containing several hundred cattle and hogs. Most of the shipments were loaded at different times; but because one (1872) was forwarded under the 36-hour rule, the time for its unloading was the same as that of another shipment (1871), made eight hours later under the 28-hour rule, from a different station. At another station there were three shipments of one carload each of cattle, belonging to different owners loaded at the same time, but two (1869, 1873) of the cars were forwarded under the 28-hour rule and the other (1874) under the 36-hour rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">The railroad company filed a separate plea in each case, admitting the allegations of the complaint, but setting up that \u201cthe shipment therein was forwarded to Cincinnati on its train No. 98, on which there were also \u2022loaded and forwarded other cattle, referred to in each of the other suits, and in the said several causes the said plaintiff is entitled to recover but' one penalty, not to exceed five hundred dollars, which it is ready and willing to pay, and it pleads the said separate suits in bar to the recovery of more than five hundred dollars for all of the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-7\">The district attorney\u2019s motions for separate judgments on the admission in the several pleas were overruled. The court sustained the company\u2019s motion to consolidate the causes, entered judgment for a single penalty, and ordered \u201cthat the within order in case 1866 shall apply to, operate upon and be conclusive of all the rights of the plaintiff in each of the several causes, to wit, 1867-1874, 1880 and 1884.\u201d The Government sued out a writ of error in case 1866 and, apparently out of abundant cau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>tion, another in 1867, later entering into a stipulation in the Circuit Court of Appeals that the result in these two cases should control all the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-4\">The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (159 Fed.

Under \u00a7 3, the penalty is for failure to comply with the requirement that no live stock be confined in cars for a longer period than 28 hours without unloading. The number confined, whether estimated by the head, by the number of shipments, or by the carloads, is unimportant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-7\">Under the Government\u2019s claim, if fifty horses, each belonging to a different shipper but shipped on the same train, were detained beyond the statutory time, there should be fifty penalties, but if all the horses belonged to the same person and were shipped to the same consignee by the same train, there would be but one penalty. As to construction of the old statute, \u00a7\u00a7 4386,4388, Rev. Stat., see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R. R. Co., </em>15 Fed. Rep. 209; <em>United States </em>v. <em>St. Louis &amp; S. F. R. R. Co., </em>107 Fed. Rep. 870. As Congress knewhow the law had been interpreted in these two decisions and that the penalty did not multiply by either the number of cattle or by the number of cars, or by the number of shipments, it may be considered that a like construction was intended, and was expected to be given to those words. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Fearson, </em>9 How. 258; <em>United States </em>v. <em>G. Falk &amp; Bro., </em>204 U. S. 143;. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hermanos, </em>209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>U. S. 339; <em>New Haven R. R.

Rec., 59th Cong., 1st Sess.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-5\">The practice of the railroads in running solid stock trains was well known to Congress, and if the Congress had Intended this law should carry the multiple penalties it would have said so. Whether $500 is not punishment enough to deter the railroads from violating the statute is a consideration of the sort that addressed itself to the legislature and not to the judiciary. <em>N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>165 Fed. Rep. 833.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-6\">Being penal, this statute should be favorably construed for the carrier. For cases below on this point, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. &amp; St. L. R. Co., </em>168 Fed. Rep. 699; <em>Southern Pacific Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>171 Fed.

Rep. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-7\">The rule for the interpretation of penal statutes is against the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>215 U. S. 233; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>2 Wheat. 119; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, 5 </em>Wheat. 95. It is the legislature, not the court, which is to define a crime and ordain its punishment. But courts do ordain punishment when they undertake, as was done here, to multiply the penalty that the legislature has prescribed. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>99 U. S. 576; <em>France </em>v. <em>United States, </em>164 U. S. 682; <em>Bolles </em>v. <em>Outing Co., </em>175 U. S. 262; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>177 U. S. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-8\">It cannot be said it was an oversight or inadvertence, that Congress did not attach a penalty to each shipment, or carload or head of stock. If Congress had intended that the penalty clause should receive a different construction from that put on it by the prior decisions it would have made provision to that effect at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>this reenactment. <em>Werckmeister </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>207 U.

In support of its position it relies, among others, on authorities which hold that in larceny, if the goods stolen at one time belong to several persons the offense is single; and that, on conviction for working on Sunday, there is only one breach of the statute, the penalty for which cannot be multiplied by the number of items of work done on the day of rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>But this does not mean, that if the thief should, at a different time, steal property from the same place, he could not be punished for the new transaction, nor that because a man had been convicted for working on one Sunday he could not be convicted and punished for subsequently working on a different Sunday. For every penal statute must have relation to time and place, and corporations whose operations are conducted over a large territory, by many agents, may commit offenses at the same time in different places, or at the same place at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Here the 21 cars, loaded at different periods, had been gathered into one train. As the period of lawful confinement of the cattle first loaded expired, there was a failure to unload. For that failure the statute imposed a penalty. But there was then no offense whatever as to the animals in the other 20 cars of the same train, which, up to that time, had not been confined for 28 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">When, however, later in the day, at the same or a different place, the time for the lawful confinement, of the animals in the other 20 cars successively expired, there were similar, but distinct and separate failures then and there to unload. They were separately punishable, since the provision that \u201cfor every such failure\u201d the company shall be liable to a penalty prevented a merger. If the period of lawful confinement of several carloads of cattle expires at the same time and place, and the company fails to unload -\u00bfhem as required by the statute, and if these cattle all belong to one owner, it is conceded that there is only one offense. It is not different if the same cattle, at the same time and place, had belonged to various owners, or had been shipped under different consignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Several expressions in the statute, and particularly the provision that, in estimating the period of lawful confinement, \u201cthe time consumed in loading and unloading shall not be considered,\u201d recognize that the proper load<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ing or unloading of a number of animals may be treated as a single act, and there is nothing to indicate that it is to be treated as more than one act because the animals happen to belong to different persons. The loading of numerous cars might proceed concurrently; or if not discontinuous or unduly prolonged several cars of cattle of the same consignor might be loaded at the same time within the meaning of the act, in which event the period of their lawful confinement, on the same train, would end at the same time and place. There would in this latter case be coincidence between the one shipment and the one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">But in determining whether the number of penalties is always to be measured by the number of shipments on the same train, even when the animals were loaded at different times, it is to be remembered that the statute is general. It applies to the transportation of a trainload of cattle belonging to one owner; to the more usual case where animals belonging to one or more owners are loaded into different cars at different times, and also to those instances where one or a few horses or other animals are shipped and at a different time or farther on during the journey other animals are loaded into the same car. These differences in shipments do not affect the duty of the carrier to the animals, but only the time when the duty to unload is to be performed. The number of consignors, the consent of the owner or agent in charge of the particular shipment that the cattle might be confined for 36 hours, the number of bills of lading and the particulars of the shipment are immaterial, except as they serve to fix the limit of lawful confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">To illustrate: It appears in this record that several hundred animals belonging to one owner and consigned to one dealer were loaded into four cars at the same time. The 28 hours of their lawful confinement necessarily expired at the same time. The simultaneous failure to unload these four cars was single, and punishable as a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>offense. But the duty and offense in this transaction would not have been quadrupled if the company had issued to the owner four bills of lading instead of one. ]NTor would there have been any increase of duty if these same cattle had been received from four consignors instead of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The statute was not primarily intended for the benefit of th\u00e9 owners. Indeed, it is restrictive of their rights. The penalty does not go to the consignor, but to the United States for each failure to unload cattle, regardless of who may own them;- and even if the owner consented to their confinement beyond a period of 36 hours. The title of the act is \u201cto prevent cruelty to animals in transit,\u201d its declared \u201cintent being to prohibit their continuous confinement beyond a period of 28 hours, except upon the scontingencies hereinbefore stated.\u201d Regardless of the number'of shipments, at any time and place where they are willfully and knowingly confined beyond the lawful period there is a violation of the statute as to the animal or animals then and there in custody for transit in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The point is made in the brief that this court has no jurisdiction, because the amount involved in the cases embraced in these writs of error was only $1,000. The court, we think properly, consolidated all the cases (Rev. Stat., \u00a7 921) and, as consolidated, the amount of the possible penalties sued for in the eleven actions was fifty-five hundred dollars. The company is liable for nine penalties, because nine times it failed to unload as required by the statute. One penalty should be imposed as to animals referred to in cases numbered 1871 and l872, and one as to those in 1869 and 1873, where the time for. the required unloading respectively coincided.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\n<em>In other respects the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
