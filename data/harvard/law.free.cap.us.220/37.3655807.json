Doherty, </em>Special Assistant United States Attorney, were on the brief, for the United States:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-12\">The telegraph office at Corwith was \u201ccontinuously operated night and day\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Sutcliffe, </em>8 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 217, 220; <em>Garrison </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>United Railways Co., </em>91 Maryland, 347. Such was the intent of Congress.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-5\">The distinction was between offices \u201coperated only during .the daytime\u201d on the one hand and those operated \u201cnight and day\u201d on the other hand. No distinction was attempted or intended between offices operated without interruption all day and all night, and such, as were operated practically all day and all night, but not without interruption for one or another reason. Congress intended by the proviso to legislate concerning all offices, towers, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\">In using the language in question Congress was merely classifying offices into two general classes and was not attempting exact definitions of either class; too much significance should not be given to a single word, but the general purpose of Congress should be carried out by construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-7\">The word \u201ccontinuously\u201d may be read in the sense of \u201cregularly\u201d or \u201chabitually\u201d or \u201ccustomarily.\u201d <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>U. S. Steel Corporations, </em>64 N. J. Eq. 807.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-8\">There is nothing in the statute which says that the operations must continue all day and all night.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-9\">As to the meaning of the expression \u201c on duty, for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period,\u201d the purpose of the act is to secure rest for the employ\u00e9 in order that he may be able better to do his work with more safety to the public. Such rest should be a continuous rest, not intermittent, as would be possible \u2022under the construction contended for by defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-10\">The Government contends that the term \u201con duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period\u201d is plain, and that the word period must be given some significance; that the period commences when the operator goes to work and continues nine hours therefrom. The word \u201cperiod\u201d cannot be construed as an unmeaning and useless word in this statute; it carries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>with it the idea of a cycle, a term. A man works for a period of time. That may not mean that he works every hour of' the time; that he cannot stop for lunch or.sleep; but whether he stops or whether he works, the period goes on. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Peaslee, </em>20 How. 571; 22 Am. &amp; Eng.

Const., 2d ed., \u00a7 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-4\">The railroad\u2019s practice of splitting tricks breaks into the consecutive hours of rest which it was the intention of Congress that operators should have. Even if this is a penal statute, the forced and technical construction contended for by respondent should not be given. <em>Northern Securities Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>193 U. S. 357; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wiltberger, </em>5 Wheat. 76; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>14 Pet. 464; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bartow, </em>6 Cowan, 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">The mischief sought to be remedied is the splitting of tricks and the long hours of service. The remedy is continuous hours of rest. Hence, a period of nine hours of duty and no more in any twenty-four hour period. See <em>Heyden\u2019s Case, </em>3 Coke, 7; Endlich on Interp. Stat., \u00a7 103; Potter\u2019s Dwarris, Stat.

The Government had a verdict in the District Court, subject to exceptions, and the judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 177 Fed. Rep. 114. 100 C. C. A. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The case is this: By \u00a7 2 it is made unlawful for common carriers subject to the act to permit any employ\u00e9 subject to the act to be on duty 'for a longer period than sixteen consecutive hours,\u2019 or after that period to go on duty again until he has had at least ten consecutive hours off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>duty, or eight hours after sixteen hours\u2019 work in the aggregate: Provided that no telegraph operator and the like shall be permitted to be \u201con duty for a longer period than nine hours in any twenty-four hour period in all towers, offices, places and stations continuously operated night and day, nor for a longer period than thirteen hours in all towers, offices, places and stations operated only during the day time,\u201d with immaterial exceptions. By \u00a7 3 there is a penalty of not exceeding five hundred dollars for each violation of \u00a7 2. The defendant was subject to the act. It had a station and telegraph office at Corwith, in the outer limits of Chicago, which was shut from twelve to three by day and by night, but open the rest of the time. The Government contends that this was a place \u201ccontinuously operated night and day.\u201d At this station the same telegraph operator was employed from half past six o\u2019clock in the morning until twelve and again from three p. m. to half past six, or nine hours, in all, of actual work. The Government contends that when nine hours have passed from the moment of beginning work the statute allows no more labor within twenty-four hours from the same time, even though the nine hours have not all of them been spent in work. According to the Government\u2019s argument the operator\u2019s nine hours expired at half past three in the afternoon. These questions on the construction of the statute are the only on\u00e9s that we have to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">We are of opinion that the Government\u2019s argument cannot be sustained, even if it be conceded that Corwith was a place continuously operated night and day, as there are strong reasons for admitting. The antithesis is between places continuously operated night and day and places operated only during the daytime. We think that the Government is right in saying that the proviso is meant to deal with all offices, and if so, we should go farther than otherwise we might in holding offices not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>operated only during the daytime as falling under the other head. A trifling interruption would not be considered, and it is possible that even three hours by night and three hours by day would not exclude the office from all operation of the law, and to that extent defeat what we believe was its intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">But if we concede the Government\u2019s first proposition it is impossible to extract the requirement of fifteen hours\u2019 continuous leisure from the words of the statute by grammatical construction alone. The proviso does not say nine \u2018consecutive\u2019 hours, as was said in the earlier part of the section, and if it had said so, or even \u2018for a longer period than a period of nine consecutive hours,\u2019 still the defendant\u2019s conduct would not have contravened the literal meaning of the words. A man employed for six hours and then, after an interval, for three, in the same twenty-four, is not employed for a longer period than nine consecutive hours. Indeed, the word consecutive was struck out, when the bill was under discussion, on the suggestion that otherwise a man might be worked for a second nine, hours after an interval of half an hour. In order to bring about the effect contended for it would have been necessary to add, as the section does add in the earlier part, a provision for the required number of consecutive hours off duty. The presence of such a provision in the one part and its absence in the other is an argument against reading it as implied. The Government suggests that if it is not implied a man might be set to work for two hours on and two hours off alternately. This hardly is a practical suggestion. We see no reason to suppose that Congress meant more than it said. On the contrary, the reason for striking out the word consecutive in the proviso given, as we have mentioned, when the bill was under discussion, and the alternative reference in \u00a7 2 to \u2018sixteen consecutive hours\u2019 and \u2018sixteen hours in the aggregate,\u2019 show that the obvious possibility of two periods of service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>in the same twenty-four hours was before the mind of Congress, and that there was no oversight in the choice of words.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>Judgment of Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
