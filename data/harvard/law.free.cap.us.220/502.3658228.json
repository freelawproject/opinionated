Y. 538, holding there was no fight at common law to prevent a company from distributing flour bags upon which was a lithograph picture of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-15\">Under that decision no person in New York has any property right in his own features, nor in the photographs of them, and any person could take a photograph of another and use it as he chose; and see <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>121 Michigan, 372.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The statute in this case was enacted soon after Chief Judge Parker\u2019s decision in the <em>Roberson case. </em>It must be noted that this statute does not in terms affect the property right of a photographer in his work. It merely says that one who uses the photograph of a living person for purposes of trade or advertising without that person\u2019s prior written consent is guilty of a crime. In other words, the statute restricts and limits the property right in such a way as to destroy much of the value of the photograph.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-4\">It is an unnecessary deprivation of property; nor can the law be defended or the rule of \u201cSic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas,\u201d for the \u201cother \u201d has no legal right which you are bound to respect. The law takes no account of \u201cthat liberty of action which is necessary in the conduct of modern business affairs in a great city,\u201d <em>Grossman </em>v. <em>Caminez, </em>79 App. Div. N. Y. 15, but makes even the oral use of a person\u2019s name a crime.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">The individual must admit certain rights by the public in his name and appearance, and must trust to advancing standards of propriety to prevent annoyance from their exercise. <em>Forster </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>136 N.

S. 185. The statute does prevent a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>son from using his own property in carrying on a lawful business, and unless such prevention is reasonably necessary the act violates the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Edison </em>v. <em>Lubin, </em>122 Fed.

O\u2019Brien </em>filed a brief for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b544-7\">Mr. Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"Aj4\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">This is an action brought by the defendant in error for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>using her photographed portrait for advertising purposes without her written consent first obtained. The facts were found against the defendant (the plaintiff in. error), an injunction was issued and damages were awarded; 120 App. Div. 467; the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals, 193 N. Y. 223, and thereupon final judgment was entered in the Supreme Court. The suit was based upon Chapter 132 of the New York Statutes of 1903, which makes such use of the name, portrait or picture of any living person a misdemeanor and gives this action. The case comes here on the single question of the constitutionality of the act. It is argued that as before the statute a person could not prevent the use of her portrait by one who took and owned it, <em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Rochester Folding Box Co., </em>171 N. Y. 538, to deny that use now is to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The Court of Appeals held that the statute applied only to photographs taken after it went into effect, as was the photograph of the plaintiff that the defendant used. The property was brought into existence under a law that limited the uses to be made of it, and, if otherwise there could have been any question, in such a case there is none. Some comment was made in argument on the distinction between photographs taken before and after the date in 1903 as inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment. But the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid statutes and statutory changes to have a beginning and thus to discriminate between the rights of an earlier and later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
