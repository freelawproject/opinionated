Answer, a denial of the signature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-9\">At the trial in the court of common pleas in Bristol, at March term 1859, the plaintiff offered the deposition of Slade, taken in Fall River, in the caption of which the magistrate certified that \u201c the deponent being about to go out of the Commonwealth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and not to return in time for the trial, is the cause of taking this deposition.\u201d And there was evidence that, soon after the taking of the deposition, Slade left the State and had not since returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">In the deposition, Slade testified: <em>\u201c </em>My name is Jonathan Slade. I live in the city of Fall River. Am an apprentice in the jewelry business. I am twenty years of age. If Mr. Shove keeps on in business, I shall probably stay; if he stops, I shall probably leave. I do not know where else I should get employment in Fall River in the same business.\u201d And to a cross-interrogatory, \u201c Have you any present purpose of leaving the Commonwealth ? \u201d he answered \u201c No.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">The defendant objected to the admission of the deposition, on the ground that there was, at the time, no sufficient cause for taking it. But <em>Aiken, </em>J. overruled the objection, and admitted the deposition. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">The deposition was rightly admitted. When a deposition is taken with a view to a future trial, it is always subject to contingencies. All future events are contingent. The substance of the certificate in the caption is this; that the party taking the deposition fears, apprehends, believes that the witness is going to be absent, and this appears to the magistrate to be reasonable. The security against the abuse of this power is that, if the party is not right in his apprehension, he cannot use the deposition; the witness must be produced if the anticipated cause, or some sufficient cause, does not exist at the time of the trial. Here the event showed the party was right. The witness himself being a young man, without family or business to bind him here, made his going out of the state dependent on a contingency not within his knowledge or power. <em>West Boylston </em>v. Sterling, 17 Pick. 128. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
