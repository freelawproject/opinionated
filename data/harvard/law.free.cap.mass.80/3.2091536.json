And this defendant says, that said complaint, ap prehension, arraignment, trial, judgment and all said proceed ings were regular, valid and in due form of law, and remain ii full force and not reversed or annulled, all which appears b\\ the record thereof before said justice remaining, a copy of which the defendant here produces. And the defendant says th&amp;c said justice had full jurisdiction to arraign and try and convict this defendant as aforesaid, and had final jurisdiction to try and convict or acquit, and to sentence this defendant upon the offence charged in said complaint, and had jurisdiction of the person of this defendant therefor, and by reason of the premises acquired and had exclusive cognizance and jurisdiction of said offence; and that the offence charged in this indictment includes the offence charged in said complaint, and is in fact the same offence; and that the offence .of being a common seller of intoxicating liquor on the first day of January A. D. 1858, and on divers days from that day to the fifth day of July A. D. 1858, included and charged in this indictment, is the identical offence charged in said complaint, and on which this defendant was tried as aforesaid; and that said justice assumed and took full jurisdiction of said offence, as he had authority and right to do; and that this court has not jurisdiction thereof and ought not to put this defendant upon trial therefor. And this he is ready to verify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">The record of the justice, after stating the complaint and arraignment, proceeded thus: \u201c After hearing divers witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>sworn to testify the whole truth in the matter, and fully understanding the defence of said respondent, it is considered by the court that he is guilty of the offence so charged against him as a common seller. It is therefore ordered by the court that said respondent recognize to the Commonwealth in the sum of two hundred dollars, with sufficient sureties in the like sum, for the personal appearance of said respondent before the court of common pleas to be holden at Northampton within and for said county on the third Monday of December next, then and there to answer to all such matters and things as shall be objected against him the said respondent in behalf of said commonwealth, (but more especially to the within complaint,) and abide the order and sentence of said court thereon ; and also for his personal appearance at any subsequent term of said court to which the same may be continued, if not previously surrendered and discharged; and so from term to term until the final decree, sentence or order of said court thereon, and to abide such final sentence, order or decree of said court; and in the mean time to keep the peace and be of good behavior,' and not depart without leave ; and recognized thereon as the law directs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-5\">The district attorney demurred to this plea, and Bishop, J. sustained the demurrer, and ordered the defendant to answer over; and he then pleaded not guilty, and was convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">The defendant also moved in arrest of judgment, <em>\u201c </em>1st. Because there is no sufficient allegation that the defendant was not duly appointed and authorized to be a common seller, as charged in said indictment. 2d. Because there is no sufficient allegation of the time when the offence charged in the first count was committed. 3d. Because said first count is defective, uncertain and insufficient, so that no valid judgment can be rendered thereon.\u201d This motion was overruled, and the defendant excepted to all the rulings of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-7\"><em>W. </em>Allen, <em>Jr. </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax\">1. The court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the special plea. The justice of the peace had jurisdiction of the subject matter, concurrent with the court of common pleas. <em>Sts. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 17; 1858, ?. 45, \u00a7 2. The punishment is absolute, and the same in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>courts; and this complaint cannot include an offence beyond the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace; in both of these particulars thus differing from the case of larceny. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>8 Gray, 470. When the justice took jurisdiction of the case, it became exclusive of the court of common pleas. <em>Smith </em>v. M'Iver, 9 Wheat. 532. <em>Shelby </em>v. Bacon, 10 How. 68. <em>Mallett </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>1 Curt. C. C. 178. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tisdale, </em>2 Dev. &amp; Bat. 159. U. S. Dig. 1856, Autrefois Convict, pi. 5; Courts, pi. 19, 20, 23. Whart. Grim. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 521, 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">After the defendant had pleaded to the complaint, it was the duty of the justice to take final action upon it. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>85, \u00a7 26. It is oppressive, after a trial, if the evidence shows only probable cause, to commit the defendant to await a prosecution. The Commonwealth could not abandon the prosecution, and commence a new one, and thus defeat the right of its attorney to a part of the penalty. <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 15. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bundy, </em>5 Gray, 305. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>9 Gray, . <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>3 Cush. 282. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Churchill, </em>5 Mass. 174. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cheney, 6 Mass. 348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">The rule, that the pendency of an indictment cannot be pleaded to another indictment, holds only where they are in the same court, which may take notice of both ; if in different courts, it must be shown by plea; otherwise, both might be put on trial at the same time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-7\">2. The indictment must show that the defendant had no authority to do the act charged against him. 1 Archb. Crim. Pl. (5th Amer. ed.) 86, note. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odlin, </em>23 Pick. 279. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurlow, </em>24 Pick. 380. <em>The King </em>v. Earn<em>shaw, </em>15 East, 456. The offence charged is that of being a common seller, proof of which need not be confined to one town ; whereas the negative ih this indictment is limited to the town of Hatfield\u2014thus differing from all previous cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>11 Cush. 412. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lafon<em>taine, </em>3 Gray, 479. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McSherry, </em>3 Gray, 481, note. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>5 Gray, 97. <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Conant, </em>6 Gray, 482.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>S. H. </em>Phillips, (Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b17-5\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">1. The first plea, which the defendant filed in this case, was rightly adjudged bad on demurrer. Though a justice of the peace has original jurisdiction of the offence of being a common seller of intoxicating liquors, yet that jurisdiction is not exclusive, but is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas \u2014 now the superior court. He may therefore either try a defendant who is brought before him on a charge of being a common seller, or may bind him over to take his trial, on that charge, in that court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Harris, 8 Gray, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">2. The time and place of the commission of the offence being alleged with legal certainty, and the authority to sell at that time and place being sufficiently negatived, the motion in arrest of judgment was rightly overruled. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
