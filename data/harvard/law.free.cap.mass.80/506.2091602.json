Trial in the superior court in Essex at September term 1859, before <em>Morton, </em>J., who reported to this court the following case :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apo\">The plaintiff- called a deputy sheriff, who testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>resided in Haverhill, and knew Alexander, who kept a jewelry and crockery shop there; that before the insolvency he was directed to take possession of the goods in that shop by Carleton, who gave him a writ of replevin therefor against Alexander ; that by virtue of that writ he took possession of a stock of goods in the shop, and delivered them to Carleton, who after-wards sold the goods by auction; and that he had not returned the replevin writ or made any further service of it, because Carleton told him, after receiving the property, that the matter had been settled between him and Alexander. The plaintiff also proved the proceedings in insolvency, the assignment of Alexander\u2019s property to him, a demand on the defendant for the property and his refusal to deliver it; and rested his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-5\">The defendant demurred to the evidence, and the judge ruled \u201c that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff,\u201d and thereupon the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-6\"><em>II.
