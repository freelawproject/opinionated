The slander consists in speaking words \u201c about,\u201d or \u201c respecting,\u201d or (which is the familiar and technical mode of statement) \u201c of and concerning \u201d the plaintiff. The word \u201c accused \u201d the plaintiff, by certain words, is not equivalent to an averment that the defendant spoke them of the plaintiff. Even the form prescribed in the practice act, <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, has the words publicly accused the plaintiff, &amp;c., <em>\u201c </em>by words spoken of the plaintiff, substantially as follows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\n<em>Demwrrer sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
