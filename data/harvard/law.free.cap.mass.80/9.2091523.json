Cain.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b19-6\">A common seller of intoxicating liquors may be indicted and convicted at the same term, upon two indictments covering successive periods of time, the last of which expired before the finding of either indictment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-7\">Indictment found at December term 1858 of the court of common pleas in Hampshire, for being a common seller of intoxicating liquors, at Ware, on the 24th of September 1858, and from that day to the day of the finding of the indictment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-8\">The defendant, at said term, moved the court to quash the indictment, \u201c because he had been already tried and convicted at this term of the court on an indictment found at this term, for the offence of being a common seller at said Ware, from the 1st of April 1858 to the 24th of September 1858,\u201d <em>[ante, </em>7,] and requested the court to rule, \u201c that if the habit and practice of selling was continuous from said first of April to the time ot finding this indictment, it constituted but one offence of common selling.\u201d But Bishop, J. declined to quash the indictment, and ruled, <em>\u201c </em>that although the habit or practice was continuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>during all the time covered by both indictments, yet the defendant could be tried, convicted and sentenced on both.\u201d The defendant, being convicted, alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-5\"><em>G. M. Stearns, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">The offence of being a commoi) seller consists in the business and habit of unlawful selling. The provision of <em>St. </em>1855, c. 215, \u00a7 17, that three sales shall be sufficient evidence of the offence, is not a definition of the offence, but a rule of evidence. The grand jury, having all the evidence before them at one time, that the defendant had been in this habit of selling for eight months, cannot split this continuous habit into divers habits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b20-6\"><em>S.
