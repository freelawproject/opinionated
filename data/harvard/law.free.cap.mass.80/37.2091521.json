The supposed defect in this complaint is the omission of the words \u201c of our Lord \u201d after the word \u201c year.\u201d Is this a fata] defect <em>1 </em>The more usual and approved practice certainly has been to insert the words here omitted. But the question now is, whether the omission absolutely vitiates the indictment. The adjudicated cases on the point .are very few.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutton, </em>5 Gray, 89, merely decided that a complaint, charging the offence as committed \u201c on the third of June instant,\u201d did not sufficiently allege the time; and the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLoon, </em>5 Gray, 91, held that an allegation that the offence was committed \u201c on the fifteenth of July 1855,\u201d was defective. It had been previously held, in North Carolina, that \u201c on the third day of August eighteen hundred and fifty five,\u201d was at common law fatally defective, the court saying that it must be held so, omitting, as it did, the words \u201c year of our Lord,\u201d and even the word \u201c year.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>4 Ired. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">This question has arisen in the courts of Georgia, where the indictment alleged the offence to have been committed \u201c in the year eighteen hundred and forty six,\u201d and it was held to mean in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty six. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 Georgia, 18. In a similar case in Indiana, the same doctrine was held, the court saying that where \u201c year \u201d is introduced to fix the period of an event, we must understand the Christian calendar to be referred to. <em>Engleman </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Ind. 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">In England there might be more reason for adhering to the use of the words \u201c year of our Lord,\u201d inasmuch as they have two modes of alleging the time of an offence : the one that of the year of the king\u2019s reign, and the other that of the year of our Lord. The former has been the more usual mode. Archb. Crim. Pl. (5th Amer. ed.) 38. Hence the word <em>\u201c </em>year \u201d might not certainly indicate the time intended. In this commonwealth, in our pleadings, criminal and civil, we use no other era in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>alleging time but the Christian era; and it seems quite reasonable therefore to hold, that when an offence is alleged to have been committed \u201c in the year eighteen hundred and fifty seven,\u201d it means that year in the Christian era, and that it means nothing else. By the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>2, \u00a7 6, <em>cl. </em>11, it is provided that in those statutes the word \u201c year \u201d shall always be construed to mean \u201c the year of our Lord.\u201d This provision is somewhat significant, and may, we think, be safely followed by us in reference to pleadings and allegations in criminal and civil proceedings. Our only national era, that of our independence, has not been introduced into our legal proceedings in courts of justice, although used for other purposes in public documents and official papers. Our year 1857 is therefore the year 1857 of the Christian era.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">2. The papers, as they appear, were duly certified, and sufficiently refer to each other to constitute a record of the proceedings in a single case. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
