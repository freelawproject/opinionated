The definite article \u201c the \u201d is used, and not the indefinite adjective \u201c all.\u201d The word \u201c manufactured \u201d cannot have a future signification, in this sentence, nor can the word \u201c known.\u201d And the agreement \u201c that the net price of all medicines be fifty per cent, less than the price marked on the bottle,\u201d cannot reasonably be supposed to have been made in reference to an unknown medicine, hereafter possibly to be prepared.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Dr. Lewis\u2019s Horse Liniment\u201d never was and never could be properly called or known as \u201c Dr. Lewis\u2019s Medicines,\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>not in existence or in contemplation until long after the making of this contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">The jury, by implication, find \u201c good faith \u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s part, and \u201c no intent to evade the contract,\u201d and that the horse liniment \u201c was not substantially the same as \u2018 Dr. Lewis\u2019s Medicines,\u2019 or any of them, known at the time the contract was made.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b196-6\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASQ\">The court are of opinion that the instruction given to the jury was erroneous. We think that the plaintiff appointed the defendant his sole agent for the sale not only of all the kinds of medicines that the plaintiff had theretofore manufactured, and which were known by his name, but also his sole agent for the sale of all medicines which he should thereafter manufacture, and which should be known by his name. The question whether he afterwards invented a new medicine, in good faith, and without intent to evade his contract with the defendant, was immaterial. The only questions in the case are, what is the legal construction of the plaintiff\u2019s contract with the defendant ? and has he broken that contract ? The honest belief of the plaintiff that he was not breaking his contract cannot deprive the defendant of his rights under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
