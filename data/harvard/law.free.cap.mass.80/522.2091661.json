The court will therefore separate the illegal from the legal items, there having been no statute in existence at the time, which declared the whole void. <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Capen, </em>11 Cush. 37. <em>Rand </em>v. <em>Mather, </em>11 Cush. 1. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>2 Bur. 1077. <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>38 Maine, 25. <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>38 Maine, 528. <em>Parish </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>14 Pick. 208. <em>Chicopee Bank </em>v. <em>Chapin, 8 </em>Met. 40. <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Cush. 469. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>4 Gray, 93. <em>Filson </em>v.

A mortgage made to secure the account, would have been valid. This mortgage is collateral to the notes, and if any part of the claim is good it is sufficient to sustain the mortgage. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bland, </em>2 Bur. 1077. <em>Yundt </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>5 S. &amp; R. 139. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Burkholder, </em>18 Penn.
