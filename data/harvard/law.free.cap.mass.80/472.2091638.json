Charles Herrick, summoned as trustee, admitted that the sum of $6.79 was due from him to the principal defendants. The plaintiff sought to charge him with the additional sum of $63.49, and at the trial in the court of common pleas in Essex, at June term 1859, proved the following facts, which were not denied by the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-7\">The defendants\u2019 road connects with the Boston and Maine Railroad, and the two form a continuous line from Boston to Topsfield, where the trustee resides. The trustee was accustomed to receive goods from Boston over this route, and to pay to the defendants the freight upon them for the entire distance. It is the custom of each of these corporations to deliver goods going beyond its own railroad to the connecting railroad, and to charge the freight upon them to the owners of the latter, who collect from the consignee the freight for transportation over both roads. Herrick owed for the transportation of goods over the Boston and Maine Railroad, at the time of service upon him, $63.49, which he subsequently paid to the defendants. But no bills were made out by the Boston and Maine Railroad to him, nor were the defendants authorized by them to collect this sum of him, further than by the custom above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-8\">Upon these facts Perkins, J. charged the trustee for $6.79, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-9\"><em>T.
