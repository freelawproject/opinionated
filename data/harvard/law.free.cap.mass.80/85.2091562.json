The jurat is no part of the complaint, and cannot be referred to, to supply the insufficiency in the allegation of the time of committing the offence. It differs in this respect from the caption of an indictment. Its province is simply to show that the complaint was duly sworn to. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutton, 5 </em>Gray, 89. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keefe, </em>7 Gray, 332.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">2.

The only difference between this case and several others that have been heretofore decided, is in the allegation of time, to wit, on a day certain, and from that day to the day of the date of receiving the complaint. ' The day of the receiving of the complaint by the magistrate appears on the complaint; and we think there is no difference in principle between this case and that of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>4 Gray, 11, in which it was decided, that an indictment sufficiently avers the time of the offence therein charged, by alleging it to have been on a day certain, and from that day to the day of the finding of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-11\"> A similar decision was made in Jannary 1860 in the case of</p>\n<p id=\"AC_\">Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Mary A.
