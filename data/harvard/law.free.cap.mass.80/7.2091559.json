Trial in the court of common pleas in Hampshire at December term 1858, before Bishop, J., who signed a bill of exceptions, of which the following is the material part: <em>\u201c </em>The first witness called by the gov ernment was one Murray. The district attorney asked him in regard to sales by the defendant between April 1st and August 22d, saying to him, \u2018 You need not say anything about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>second sale on the <em>22d </em>of August; only the first; \u2019 or words to that effect. And the witness testified, among other things, to one sale to him on the <em>22d </em>of August. On cross-examination and in answer to questions put by the defendant\u2019s counsel, the witness testified that he was present on the <em>22d </em>of August, and saw a sale of liquors, other than that proved by the government made by the defendant at his shop in Ware, to Francis Taylor and stated the circumstances of the sale and who were present and that he was as certain in regard to said sale to Taylor as he was in regard to any part of his testimony. There was no other evidence in the case of any sale to Francis Taylor, and the district attorney stated that he did not intend to rely upon that count, and should not contend that there was any evidence of such sale. The defendant called witnesses to prove, and offered to prove, that said Murray was not present at any sale by the defendant to Taylor, and testified to by him, and that there was no sale by the defendant on the occasion testified to by Murray on his cross-examination, and that his testimony in that particular was false. But the district attorney objected, and the court excluded the evidence. The jury found a verdict of guilty on the first count, and not guilty on the others. And to the above rulings and decisions the defendant excepts.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-5\"><em>G. M. Stearns, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq\">The district attorney, by disclaiming any intention to rely on that portion of Murray\u2019s testimony, upon a material point, which he had ascertained the defendant could contradict, while he still relied on Murray\u2019s testimony in other particulars, could not relieve Murray of his liability to an indictment for perjury, nor deprive the defendant of the right to contradict him upon that point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-6\"><em>S. H. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b18-7\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"As\">The only question in this case, which has not been previously adjudged in other cases, is, whether the defendant ought to have been permitted to show that the testimony of Murray was false, as to a sale to Taylor, on the <em>22d </em>of August 1858. In the fourth count in the indictment, the defendant was charged with a single sale to Taylor on that day. But the district attorney disclaimed all intention to support the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>count by proof of any sale on that day, besides a sale to Murray himself, and also disclaimed the intention to prove the charge in the fourth count. Any other sale by the defendant, on that day, was thereby made irrelevant and immaterial to the issue. And the defendant, by cross-examining Murray as to any other sale on that day, introduced collateral and immaterial matter, and thereby, in the opinion of a majority of the court, brought himself within the settled rule, that when a question is put to a witness, which is collateral or irrelevant to the issue, his answer cannot, for the purpose of discrediting him, be contradicted by the party who asked the question. 1 Greenl.
