Taylor, Special Justice, the standing justice being absent from the town of Chicopee and unable to attend.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATe\">The defendant was tried and convicted before the police court on the same day. The record of the proceedings in that court (in which the substance of the complaint was stated and the complaint referred to as on file) was certified like the warrant. The defendant appealed to December term 1858 of the court of common pleas for Hampden, and was there tried before Aiken, J., who signed this bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">\u201c Upon trial the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses stated that they went to a shop in Chicopee, admitted to have been kept by the defendant, and the defendant was absent, and was not present at any time while they were there ; that they searched the shop and took away various liquors. As tending to show a sale at the defendant\u2019s shop, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified that while at the defendant\u2019s shop upon said occasion, and before the search, an old woman was tending bar (who she was or how she came there, or under what circumstances or by whose authority she was there did not in any manner or at any time appear,) that a man named Harvey Chapman took a bottle off the bar, and put it in a basket he had there, and the woman took a twenty-five cent piece from the same bar at the same time. To this evidence the defendant objected at the proper time. But the court admitted the same; and instructed the jury that if the woman tending bar was there by authority of the defendant, and was authorized by him to sell liquor there, they might consider this evidence as bearing upon the issue; other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>wise, they should reject this evidence altogether. There was other evidence tending to show that the liquor found there was kept for sale by the defendant. The jury found the defendant guilty, and he excepts to the foregoing rulings and instructions of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">The defendant also moved in arrest of judgment, \u201c because the complaint is subscribed by the special justice of the police court of the town of Chicopee, without its appearing that there was any or sufficient cause for his acting in the matter.\u201d The judge overruled the motion, and the defendant excepted to this ruling also.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-6\"><em>G. M. </em>Stearns, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0v\">1. The facts disclosed by the witness did not show a sale, and were too uncertain and inconclusive to be submitted to the jury. The exceptions negative that the woman was proved to be acting by authority of the defendant; her acts therefore were improperly admitted in evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Putnam, </em>4 Gray, 16. This objection is not obviated by the instructions of the judge that the jury were not to consider the evidence unless she was acting by the defendant\u2019s authority, as the exceptions expressly find there was no evidence upon which the jury could find authority to exist. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>5 Gray, 101. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>5 Gray, 80. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Breed, </em>5 Gray, 440.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">2. By the act establishing the police court of Chicopee, power to act is given to the special justice only \u201c in case of the absence, sickness, interest or any other disability of the standing justice.\u201d A special justice, therefore, has no jurisdiction except in those cases. <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>463, \u00a7 8. The record should show such a case to exist. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>6 Gray, 359 The addition of the signature of the special justice is not sufficient. Besides, the want of such a statement at the time of receiving the complaint cannot be aided by a reference to another part of the record. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hutton, </em>5 Gray, 89.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-8\"><em>S. H. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-9\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">The evidence of the acts in reference to the delivery of a bottle from the bar of the defendant by a woman, in the absence of the defendant, were competent evidence to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>submitted to the jury, in connection with other evidence in the case. The facts that liquors were kept there, that she was tending bar for the defendant, and that there was other testimony tending to show that the liquor found there was kept for sale by the defendant, were proper circumstances to be considered by the jury. The instruction was properly guarded as to the necessity of the jury finding that the woman was there by the authority of the defendant and was acting as his agent in making the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The further question arises upon a motion in arrest of judgment, alleging a defect in the record in reference to the authority of the special justice of the police court to act in the case. It is said that by the act establishing the police court of Chicopee, power to act is given to the special justice only in case \u201c of the absence, sickness, interest or any other disability of the standing justice,\u201d and that the record should show such a case to exist. If it be necessary that this fact appear on the record of the particular case in which such special justice acts, it does thus appear in the present case. The complaint and warrant are connected, bearing the same date, and the warrant requiring the arrest of the defendant \u201c to answer to the foregoing complaint this day made,\u201d and to this is appended the certificate \u201cthe standing justice being absent from the town of Chicopee and unable to attend.\u201d This fact is again certified in the record of the case, reciting the proceedings at the hearing of the case on the same day. <em>Exceptions overruled</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
