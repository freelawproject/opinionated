But the court admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-14\">The Commonwealth offered evidence that on a certain Sunday in August 1858 the defendant sold intoxicating liquors at the place alleged. It appeared that the defendant, upon the same evidence, had been tried and convicted for the offence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>keeping open his shop on the Lord\u2019s day, and had paid his fine upon that conviction. The defendant objected that he could not be convicted upon this evidence. But the court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">The Commonwealth also offered evidence of a sale of cider in this tenement, by the wife of the defendant, in his presence. The defendant objected that this evidence was not competent to charge him upon this indictment. But the court admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The defendant was found guilty and alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-7\"><em>B. F. </em>Butler, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajy\">1. The question to Kelly was uncertain. Neither he nor any one but the grand jury could know when the indictment was found.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\"><em>2. </em>The defendant cannot be convicted and punished a second time for the same act of keeping open the same shop.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">3. The evidence of a sale of cider was inadmissible, without proof that it was intoxicating. The provision of Si. 1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 1, that \u201c cider,\u201d &amp;c. \u201c shall be considered intoxicating liquors, within the meaning of this act,\u201d does not extend to <em>St. 1855, c. </em>405. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lahy, </em>8 Gray, 459.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-10\">S. <em>TT. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-11\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AESs\">1. We perceive no legal objection to the question which the court allowed to be put to Kelly. It has repeatedly been held that the day of the finding of an indictment is a time certain ; and if Kelly\u2019s answer had been made through ignorance or misapprehension of the time when the indictment was found, the defendant, by cross-examining him, might at once have avoided the effect of his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">2. The former conviction of the defendant was not a bar to this indictment, as it was for a different offence from that which this indictment charges. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>11 Gray,</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">3. The provision of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>405, \u00a7 1, by which \u201c all buildings, places or tenements used for the illegal sale or keeping of intoxicating liquors are declared to be common nuisances, and are to be regarded and treated as such,\u201d is to be construed by \u00a1reference to the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. </em>215, <em>in pa/ri materia, </em>to which it is necessary to refer in order to ascertain what intoxicating liquors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>it is illegal to sell; and the first section of which declares that \u201c ale, porter, strong beer, lager beer, cider and all wines, shall be considered intoxicating liquors within the meaning of this act.\u201d Proof of sales of cider was therefore competent in support of this indictment. See <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Loxdale, </em>1 Bur. 447; <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Laurie, </em>7 D. &amp; R. 721, &amp; 5 B. &amp; C. 163; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>3 Mass. 21; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>2 Gray, 214; <em>State </em>v. <em>Garthwait, </em>3 Zab. 143. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
