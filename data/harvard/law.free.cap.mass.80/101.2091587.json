The attorney for the government then asked said Fears, if he had known of the defendant living at any other house than the Gloucester House during the time alleged in the indictment; which was objected to by the defendant ; but allowed by the court to be put; and the witness answered that he had not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">\u201c The attorney for the government asked another witness, if, in a certain room, in which there had been evidence of a bar, and was called the bar-room in said house, he had seen bottles, which was objected to by the defendant, but allowed by the court to be put and answered.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">\u201c On the trial of Burnham, Samuel Fears testified that he never saw the defendant in any shop, but had seen him in his own house; and in answer to a question of the district attorney, said he had never bought any liquor there. The district attorney then asked the witness, if he ever drank any liquor at the defendant\u2019s house; to which question the defendant objected ; but the court decided that the question might be put, and it was put, and answered by the witness, that he had drank there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-8\">\u201c Another witness was asked by the district attorney, What have you seen the defendant doing in his own house ? the witness having previously testified that he knew the defendant at his boarding house; to which the defendant objected; but the court allowed it to be put, and the witness answered that he had not seen the defendant doing anything; but had seen. him in all the lower rooms.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-9\"><em>W D. </em>Northend, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADn\">1.

The fact that bottles have been seen in a house does nor tend to show that intoxicating liquor is sold contrary to law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">3. It is not an offence to drink intoxicating liquors; and it cannot be competent for the government, after a witness has negatived a purchase of liquor, to prove that he has drunk liquor in the dwelling-house of the defendant. And the admission of such evidence tends to prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b113-7\"><em>S.
