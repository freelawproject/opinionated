Pearson, guardian of the children of Amos Pearson, to John and David Smith, dated April <em>22d </em>1857, conveying all the right, title and interest of which Amos Pearson died possessed in \u201c a certain parcel of land situated in Newburyport, part in common pasture lying in common with other proprietors, containing twenty eight acres and sixty rods, and bounded as follows, to wit,\u201d in several parcels, one of which was \u201c one lot containing three and a quarter acres more or less in number 17.\u201d And a deed from Anne W. Noyes to Albert Currier, dated May 12th 1857, of \u201c a lot of land in the southeast division of common pasture in Newburyport aforesaid, being lot numbered fourteen,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c also two and a half acres of land in said pasture in lot number 17, and is undivided; the whole of said lot contains twenty acres and one hundred and forty rods, and is bounded \u201d as the deed then set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">The defendant contended that under these deeds he and the other grantees named took an interest in lot number 17, as tenants in common ; and offered evidence to prove that in tearing down the fence he acted not only in the exercise of his own rights as tenant in common, but also by the license and direction of said other grantees. But <em>Perkins, </em>J. ruled that these deeds gave the defendant no interest in the land described therein, so as to enable him to dispute the plaintiff\u2019s title or right in the premises. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-7\"><em>J A. </em>Gillis, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEn\">cited <em>Canning </em>v. <em>Pinkham, 1 </em>N. H. 357; 4 Cruise Dig. tit. 32, c. 21, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>S. B. Ives, Jr. </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxT\">relied on <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Tudor, </em>10 Gray,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-5\">Bigelow, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApD\">The trial of this case did not proceed far enough to lead to a comparison of the titles of the respective parties to the premises in controversy. The plaintiff proved that he was in possession; this was a good title as against strangers, and would enable him to maintain trespass against the defendant, if he failed to show title in himself or in some one of those by whose authority he entered the premises. But the defendant was not permitted to go into full proof of his title. He was cut off by the ruling of the court, that the deeds under which he justified the alleged trespass conveyed no title to the grantees. The plaintiff recovered solely on his possessory title. We have no occasion therefore now to decide whether the ruling of the court as to the validity of deeds under which the plaintiff claimed to hold the premises was correct or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">But we think it clear that the court erred in ruling that the deeds offered by the defendant would not give him an interest in common in the land described therein. The deed from Boardman to Smith conveyed \u201c two and one quarter acres undivided in lot seventeen; \u201d the deed from Pearson to John M. and David Smith conveyed \u201c three and a quarter acres more or less in number seventeen,\u201d part of twenty eight acres and sixty rods, described as being \u201c in common pasture lying in common with other proprietors ; \u201d the deed from Noyes to Currier granted two and a half acres in the common pasture \u201cin lot number seventeen and is undivided.\u201d By these deeds we think it clear that the grantors intended to convey an undivided interest in the whole of lot number seventeen, in the proportion which the number of acres specified and granted by the deed bears to the whole quantity of land contained in that lot. The use of the word \u201c undivided \u201d and the phrase \u201c lying in common \u201d show that the interest conveyed was undivided and in common, and not an estate in severalty; and the quantity of land granted is ascertained and fixed with certainty by the grant of a designated aliquot part of the whole land owned in common. <em>Jewett </em>v. <em>Foster, ante, </em>497. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
