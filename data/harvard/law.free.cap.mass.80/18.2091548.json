The jurat and warrant were signed by the standing justice of that court; but the record of the proceedings in that court, and the copies transmitted to the court of common pleas were attested by \u201c C. A. Winchester, Special Justice of said court, the standing justice being unable to attend by reason of absence from the city.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">The defendant, having appealed from the sentence of that court to the court of common pleas, and been convicted there at December term 1858, moved in arrest of judgment on several grounds, the only one of which not decided in other cases was this : \u201c Because it does not sufficiently appear from the papers in said case that C. A. Winchester, special justice of said police court, had authority to make and attest said copies; and because the special justices of said court have no authority to make and attest copies of papers or to make and sign records of proceedings in said court.\u201d <em>Aiken, </em>J. overruled the motion, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-8\"><em>E. W. Bond, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acj\">The only powers of the special justices of the police court of Springfield are \u201c to issue the processes of said court, and to hear and determine any matter or cause pending therein.\u201d <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>94, \u00a7 29. Even the limited powers conferred on them can only be exercised for certain causes specified in that section, and <em>\u201c </em>assigned on the record by the standing or special justice.\u201d No cause is assigned on this record ; and it does not appear by whom the memorandum under Mr. Winchester\u2019s signature was made. The copies of the complaint and warrant, at least, should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>been attested by the standing justice, who received the one and issued the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-5\"><em>S. H. </em>Phillips, (Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An\">In a case in which the hearing in the police court is had before the special justice, we have no doubt that he may certify the record of the case to the appellate court, assigning the reason therefor. We see no objection to a special justice certifying copies of the records generally, under the limitation that the standing justice is unable to discharge that duty, and stating the reason for his thus attesting the records. <em>St. </em>1852, c. 94, \u00a7 29. \u2022 <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
