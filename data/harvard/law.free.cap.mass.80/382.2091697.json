Richardson, city marshal of Cambridge in the county of Middlesex, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, on oath complains \u201d that the defendant sold intoxicating liquor in violation of <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 15. The complaint bore the signature of <em>\u201c </em>S. W.

Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>135, \u00a7 2. This complaint is not so signed. The complainant and the person who signed the complaint are not connected by the jurat. There is no legal presumption that S. W. Richardson, without further description, is the same person as Samuel W. Richardson, city marshal of Cambridge. There is no legal presumption that the letter S. is an abbreviation of Samuel rather than of Stephen, or of any other name, male or female, commencing with the same initial letter. The letter S. is a name by itself. A single consonant is a good Christian name. <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>17 Ad. &amp; El. N. R. 64. <em>Lomax </em>v. <em>Landells, </em>6 C.

In <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVr9\">We perceive no weight in this objection. The complaint, including the full name and the addition of the complaint and the signature, is one entire document. It is addressed to the justice of the police court of Cambridge; it is officially certified by the same justice that it was \u201c received and sworn to,\u201d that is, sworn to by the same person from whom it was received. The jurat or certificate of the justice is equivalent to an averment by him that the signature and oath were those of the complainant, as named in the introduction; and could not have been truly made if the fact were otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
