Arrey does not challenge the determination that her asylum application was untimely, and she has waived any challenge to this issue. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-20\">Arrey does challenge the adverse credibility determination that rendered her ineligible for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. \u201cCredibility determinations are given great deference.... [We] cannot replace the Board or IJ\u2019s determinations concerning witness credibility or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations with [our] own determinations.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). To prevail, Arrey must show that the evidence compels a contrary finding. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">Arrey contends that the IJ improperly focused on discrepancies in her name that were easily explained, that the IJ made erroneous factual findings based on misunderstandings of her testimony, that her failure to include parts of her story in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>asylum application should not be held against her, and that the IJ should have given more weight to her documentary evidence. Arrey has not shown that the evidence presented compels a conclusion on credibility that is contrary to the one reached by the IJ. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. Accordingly, we may not reverse the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
