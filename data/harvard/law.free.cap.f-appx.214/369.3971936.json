He maintains that the three convictions were \u201crelated\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) because he received concurrent 180-day prison terms for the three offenses on the same day. Because the three DWI offenses were separated by intervening arrests, however, the district court did not err in concluding that those offenses were not related for criminal-history purposes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 3); <em>see also United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1322-23 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-17\">Hernandez argues that the district court erred in imposing a supervised-release condition that required him to cooperate in any collection of his DNA, as violative of his Fourth Amendment rights. As Hernandez concedes, this court has recognized that such a claim is not ripe for judicial review in light of our holding in <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 758 (5th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-18\">Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
