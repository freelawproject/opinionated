The district court sentenced him as a career offender to a 262-month term of imprisonment. In light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>175 Fed.Appx. 625 (4th Cir.2006). On remand, the district court accepted the parties\u2019 sentencing recommendation and sentenced Robinson to 235 months in prison, a twenty-seven-month downward variance from the advisory sentencing guideline range. Robinson appeals his sentence on the ground that the district court did not understand it had the discretion to vary from the guideline range based upon the small amount of drugs and the absence of firearms and violence in the predicate offenses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">In a <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, the district court must calculate the advisory guideline range and then consider whether that range \u201cserves the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C.A.] \u00a7 3553(a) [ (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006)] and, if not, select a sentence that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This court reviews a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). If the district court imposes a variance sentence, \u201c[t]he district court must articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>range\u201d in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id,.; Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456. In reviewing a variance sentence, we \u201cconsider whether the district court acted reasonably both with respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with respect to the extent of the divergence from the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez-Pena, </em>453 F.3d 236, 241 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 542, 166 L.Ed.2d 401 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Because the district court imposed a variance sentence, we conclude that the court recognized its discretion to vary from the advisory sentencing guideline range. Our review of the record convinces us that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a variance sentence was reasonable. <em>See Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 435-36. We also find that the extent of the variance is reasonable as it takes into account Robinson\u2019s status as a repeat drug offender while giving him some credit for the absence of firearms and violence from the predicate offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 437. Although the district court did not explicitly articulate its reasons for adopting the parties\u2019 sentencing recommendation, the court considered the parties\u2019 arguments at sentencing, which focused on the various factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 381 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation may imbue it with enough content for [this Court] to evaluate both whether the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether it did so properly.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). Moreover, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
