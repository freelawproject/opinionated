The district court enhanced Acosta\u2019s sentence based upon its finding that his prior California conviction for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor was a conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Acosta argues that the enhancement was improper because the statute under which he was convicted sets the legal age for consent to sexual activity at 18 years of age while the Model Penal Code and the majority of the states set the legal age of consent for sexual activity at 16 years of age of younger.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Acosta\u2019s prior conviction was under Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5(c). Under a common sense approach, Acosta\u2019s conviction was for the enumerated offenses of statutory rape and sexual abuse of a minor and, accordingly, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(b)(iii)); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Hernandez-Castillo, </em>449 F.3d 1127, 1131 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Vargas-Garnica, </em>332 F.3d 471, 474 &amp; n. 1 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Acosta\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Acosta contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Acosta properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
