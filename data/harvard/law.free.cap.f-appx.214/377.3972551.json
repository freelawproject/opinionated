Bustamante-Castillo received a sentence of 32 months of imprisonment, which included an enhancement based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) because his previous deportation occurred following an aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Bustamante-Castillo asserts that his conviction and sentence are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because 1) \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than offense elements is unconstitutional and 2) neither his indictment nor plea colloquy indicated that his previous deportation had occurred following an aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Bustamante-Castillo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">Bustamante-Castillo also contends that his sentence should be vacated because the district court committed reversible plain error by assessing three criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a) and (b) for his 1996 possession of marijuana conviction, which carried a 12-month sentence. Because Bustamante-Castillo did not raise this issue in the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Arviso-Mata, </em>442 F.3d 382, 384 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 829 (2006). Under the plain-error standard of review, \u201creversal is not required unless there is (1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">According to the Sentencing Guidelines, three criminal history points are assigned for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding 13 months, and two criminal history points are assigned for each prior sentence of imprisonment that is at least 60 days but 13 months or less. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b). Because Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s 1996 marijuana possession conviction carried a 12-month sentence, it should have been assigned only two criminal history points. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">The assignment of three criminal history points in this instance was erroneous, plainly contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 4Al.l(a) and (b), and detrimental to Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s substantial rights in that it incorrectly inflated his sentencing guidelines range. \u201cGenerally, when a trial court incorrectly applies the United States Sentencing Guidelines, as it did here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings is seriously affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Alarcon, 261 F.3d 416, 424 </em>(5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, this error requires that Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s sentence be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Because vacating and remanding Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s sentence is necessary based on this error alone, we do not reach Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s remaining sentencing issues. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005). Bustamante-Castillo\u2019s motion to summarily affirm the judgment in part, vacate the judgment in part, and remand for resentencing is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED; MOTION DENIED AS UNNECESSARY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
