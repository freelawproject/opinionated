This court lacks jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward, unless there is some indication the district court erroneously believed it lacked the authority to do so. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 n. 5 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Immediately before sentencing Ruiz, the district court heard Ruiz\u2019s arguments supporting his downward-departure motion. Although the court did <em>not </em>explicitly rule on the motion, it implicitly denied it by imposing a sentence within the Guideline range. Because the record does <em>not </em>suggest the district court believed it lacked authority to depart in Ruiz\u2019s case, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Ruiz next contends, for the first time on appeal, that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a supervised-release condition requiring him to cooperate in the collection of his DNA. This contention is <em>not </em>ripe for review and is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 827, 166 L.Ed.2d 661 (2006); <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 760-62 (5th Cir.2003). Ruiz acknowledges this argument is foreclosed, but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">As stated, the Supreme Court recently granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Riascos-Cuenu, </em>vacated the holding, and remanded for consideration in the light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Riascos-Cuenu v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 827, 166 L.Ed.2d 661 (2006). <em>Lopez </em>does <em>not </em>concern DNA-colleetion sentencing; but, <em>even if </em>we have jurisdiction to review Ruiz\u2019s claim, our review, in the alternative, would be only for plain error because, as noted, Ruiz failed to raise his objection at sentencing. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">Under plain-error review, Ruiz must show a clear or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>If he satisfies those criteria, this court <em>may </em>correct the forfeited error <em>only if </em>it \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Ruiz fails to show the district court made a clear or obvious error.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-21\">Finally, Ruiz challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S. Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Ruiz maintains <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was decided incorrectly and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em>nied, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Ruiz concedes his argument is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
