Pfeifle seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order directing him to show cause why his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition should not be dismissed as untimely and the final order dismissing his \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely and barred by his procedural default.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Pfeifle has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeals. We also deny Pfeifle\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. We court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>September 12, whether his notice of 487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-18\"> Pfeifle first appealed the district 2006 show cause order. It is questionable appeal was timely under <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>Because Pfeifle filed a timely notice of appeal of the final judgment order, the preliminary notice of appeal is effectively superseded by the second notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
