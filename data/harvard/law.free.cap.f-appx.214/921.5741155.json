It is an issue of Alabama law. In <em>Fleming Foods of Alabama, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, </em>648 So.2d 577 (Ala.1994), the Alabama Supreme Court stated that: \u201ca use tax is not a tax on revenues generated from carrying on interstate business ... but is an excise tax imposed upon the privilege of storing, using, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>consuming tangible personal property purchased at retail outside the state <em>and domiciled in the state.\u201d Id. </em>at 579 (emphasis added). Given the plain meaning of those words, we agree with the district court that the tax is not applicable to the vehicles at issue in this case. The arguments of the Department of Revenue to the contrary are adequately answered in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned memorandum opinion and order. <em>Culverhouse, Inc. v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Revenue (In re Culverhouse, Inc.), </em>358 B.R. 806 (M.D.Ala.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
