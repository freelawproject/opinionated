He was sentenced to 240 months imprisonment and urges on appeal that he is entitled to a new trial on four grounds. We have reviewed the four issues raised by Edwards and find only one merits discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">During trial, the district court excluded evidence proffered by Edwards regarding his future plans and intentions. Edwards offered testimony from his father about conversations they had about his future plans and Edwards\u2019s handwritten notes about legitimate job opportunities he was interested in pursuing. Edwards contends this evidence should have been admitted under the then-existing state of mind exception under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3). We hold that even if there were error, any error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Nyman, </em>649 F.2d 208, 212 (4th Cir.1980) (finding that the test of harmlessness was whether the Court believed it \u201chighly probable that the error did not affect the judgment\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">Accordingly, we find no reversible error and affirm Edwards\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
