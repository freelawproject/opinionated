Keivani concedes that she previously filed a motion to reopen and that her instant motion was filed more than 90 days after the BIA completed its administrative review, contrary to the rules in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). She contends, however, that she is not subject to these rules because her conversion to Christianity resulted in changed country conditions in Iran. The BIA rejected this argument and denied Keivani\u2019s motion to reopen, reasoning that an individual\u2019s religious conversion did not constitute a change in a country\u2019s conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">An alien is not bound by number or timing requirements for filing a motion to reopen if her request for relief \u201cis based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Evidence presented by Keivani establishes that any policy of torturing or persecuting Christians in Iran preceded her initial hearing before the BIA. The fact that Keivani\u2019s conversion made this fact more relevant to her case does not establish a \u201cchanged country condition,\u201d as required by \u00a7 1229a. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Keivani\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Keivani also argues that the BIA\u2019s failure to consider her requests for non-discretionary relief, in the forms of withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, constituted a denial of due process. Because Keivani failed to raise this claim before the BIA, and because the BIA could have corrected any due process problem by granting the motion to reopen, the claim is unexhausted and this court is barred from considering it. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001). Keivani\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
