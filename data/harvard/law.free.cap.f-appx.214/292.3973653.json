Because McRae was previously convicted of two felony drug offenses, the Government filed an information to seek enhanced penalties in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>In compliance with the statutory mandatory minimum, the district court sentenced McRae to life in prison. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Counsel for McRae has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, 386 </em>U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging McRae\u2019s sentence was unduly harsh. McRae filed a pro se supplemental brief claiming the Government should have moved for a downward departure of the mandatory minimum sentence, but refused to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">After a review of the record, we conclude the life sentence imposed upon McRae was required by statute. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), any person convicted of conspiracy to distribute the amount of cocaine base to which McRae pled guilty, and who has \u201ctwo or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense,\u201d must receive a \u201cmandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). While a district court may depart below the sentencing range established by the Sentencing Guidelines, such a departure may result in a sentence below the minimum term specified in the offense of conviction only if permitted by law. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000) (limiting authority of district court to depart below statutory minimum to cases in which the government has moved for such a departure on the basis of substantial assistance); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>38 F.3d 139, 146 n. 8 (4th Cir.1994) (observing that \u201c[t]he district court could have sentenced below the statutory minimum only if this departure was based on the Government\u2019s motion for downward departure due to Defendant\u2019s substantial assistance\u201d); <em>cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (2000) (safety valve provision) (limiting applicability of statutory minimum penalties for certain drug offenses when specified criteria are met); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2 (2005) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">In this case, there was no permissible basis for the district court to depart from the mandatory life sentence. The Government exercised the discretion reserved to it in the plea agreement and refused to make a substantial assistance motion because McRae refused to fully cooperate and violated the terms of his pretrial release by using drugs. Moreover, the safety valve provision did not apply because McRae had too many criminal history points. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (defendant may not have more than one criminal history point for safety valve provision to apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for review. We therefore affirm McRae\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
