On appeal, Bui challenges the firearm conviction on sufficiency of the evidence and prosecutorial misconduct grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">On April 13, 2004, Bui and Marvin Romero were arrested when they attempted to sell ecstacy to Agent Ricky Jackson, an undercover police officer on assignment with the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA) narcotics task force. A DEA confidential source arranged the purchase of 1,000 tablets of ecstacy from Romero for $9,000. Romero met with the source and Agent Jackson in a mall parking lot and led them to Bui, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a parked vehicle nearby. They all got into the vehicle with Bui, and Bui showed Agent Jackson a bag of ecstacy tablets. Agent Jackson signaled surveillance agents to move in and arrest Bui and Romero. After the agents apprehended Bui and Romero, they searched the vehicle and found a loaded Glock, 9mm semi-automatic firearm under the driver\u2019s seat and a loaded magazine clip and a bag of ecstacy pills in the center console of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">Bui first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. We will sustain the jury verdict if \u201cthe evidence, as viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, would permit a rational trier of fact to find [the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this review, \u201cwe draw \u2018all reasonable inferences in support of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude, after a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>review of the record, that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict. Bui, therefore, is not entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Bui next contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asking an improper cross-examination question. During the trial, Agent Eric Davis and Agent Blaine Donovan testified that after Bui\u2019s arrest, Bui told them that he bought the firearm at a gun show. Bui, however, testified that he had never owned, possessed, or purchased a gun. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Bui, \u201cAre you saying that Officer Eric Davis got on the stand, under oath, and risked his entire career to he about that statement, too?\u201d Defense counsel objected to this question as an improper attempt to bolster Officer Davis\u2019s credibility, but the district court overruled this objection. Bui then answered the prosecutor\u2019s question, \u201cLike I said, I know that I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AI4\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on allegations of prosecutorial misconduct for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This review involves two steps: (1) we must first decide whether the prosecutor made an improper remark and (2) if an improper remark was made, we must determine whether the remark affected the substantial rights of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even assuming that the prosecutor\u2019s question was improper, we conclude that it did not affect Bui\u2019s substanfive rights. In determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s question affected Bui\u2019s substantive rights, \u201cwe assess \u2018(1) the magnitude of the statement\u2019s prejudice, (2) the effect of any cautionary instructions given, and (3) the strength of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">First, the magnitude of the question\u2019s prejudicial effect was small when we look at the context in which it was made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bui objected to one question in the middle of the Government\u2019s cross-examination of him. After that question, the prosecutor did not ask Bui any other questions about Agent Davis\u2019s testimony, and the prosecutor moved on to other topics. Also, the district court instructed the prosecutor not to \u201cget into that area on closing argument.\u201d The objectionable remark, therefore, consisted of a single cross-examination question in a two-day trial with numerous witnesses and pieces of evidence. We cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s question overshadowed the other evidence and unduly prejudiced Bui\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Second, the district court helped mitigate any prejudicial effect by properly instructing the jury to base its decision only on the testimony and exhibits presented at trial. The district court also instructed the jury that \u201cany statements, objections, or arguments made by the lawyers are not evidence.\u201d We presume that the jury followed these instructions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cMoreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>instruction immediately preceded the jury\u2019s deliberations, whereas the improper questioning occurred earlier in the trial.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Third, \u201cthe evidence of guilt was overwhelming.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Agent Brandon Mouriz testified that he found a loaded firearm under Bui\u2019s seat and a loaded magazine clip in the center console about three or four inches from the bag of ecstacy tablets that Bui showed to the undercover agent. Agent Rogers testified that Bui made a move for the firearm as agents approached the vehicle. Agent Davis and Agent Donovan both testified that Bui admitted that the gun was his. Also, Romero testified that prior to the drug deal, Bui showed him the gun and said, \u201cI got your back.\u201d All three factors lead us to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s question did not affect Bui\u2019s substantial rights and is thus not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>\u00a1fc </em>^ \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Bui\u2019s conviction of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
