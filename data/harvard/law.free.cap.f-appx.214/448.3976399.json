Because we find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law, we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">Undheim filed for disability benefits and supplemental security benefits in March of 2001, claiming that injuries to his legs and arm limited his ability to work. An ALJ denied the claim in 2002, but the Appeals Council vacated the decision and remanded the case with instructions to obtain additional documentation regarding Undheim\u2019s mental problems and to provide more rationale for the decision. A different ALJ then conducted a hearing, obtained additional evidence regarding Undheim\u2019s mental and physical health, obtained an opinion from a vocational expert, and ultimately determined that Undheim had the residual functional capacity that would allow him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>perform jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy. The ALJ denied benefits, and the Appeals Council denied a request for review. Undheim then filed a civil action in district court and now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Undheim first argues that the ALJ acted contrary to law when he refused to afford great weight to the opinion of Dr. McBride, M.D, a psychiatrist who treated Undheim. Dr. McBride opined that Undheim had a \u201csevere depressive disorder with borderline psychotic features,\u201d and that he was \u201csocially withdrawn, ha[d] impaired judgement and [was] disorganized in his thinking to the point of being incapable of any substantial gainful employment.\u201d Undheim argues that the ALJ erred in discounting Dr. McBride\u2019s opinion without first going through the six-factor analysis articulated in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The ALJ\u2019s discounting of Dr. McBride\u2019s opinion was not erroneous for the following reasons. First, \u201cthe ALJ has sole responsibility for determining a claimant\u2019s disability status[,]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Dr. McBride\u2019s opinion that Undheim is disabled, a decision reserved to the ALJ, is not entitled to any special significance under the regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. McBride\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence, and the ALJ was not required to go through all six factors in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d) in the face of competing first-hand medical evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this case, various psychologists examined Undheim and concluded that he did not appear depressed, that he had only mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning, that he had a fair ability to relate to others, and that there was no evidence of psychotic process. In particular, psychologist Susan Tucker, Ph.D., gave Undheim a \u201cfair\u201d prognosis and concluded that he suffered from substance abuse and depression. Dr. Tucker noted that Undheim demonstrated an average ability to focus his concentration over brief periods, displayed average remote memory and was able to recall relevant facts and dates, displayed focused thought patterns, displayed a marginal degree of insight, and had a marginal degree of social judgment. The ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. McBride\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence and he was not required to evaluate each of the six factors listed in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-12\">Undheim next argues that the ALJ acted contrary to law when he determined that Undheim\u2019s complaints were \u201ccredible, but not disabling to the extent alleged.\u201d He specifically argues that the ALJ did not follow 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c), which requires an ALJ to consider a list of factors when evaluating the intensity and persistence of a claimant\u2019s symptoms. When evaluating the credibility of a claimant\u2019s subjective allegations of pain, an ALJ must give specific reasons for his findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The reasons must supported by the evidence in the case record, and they must be sufficiently specific to make clear to the claimant and to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the claimant\u2019s statements and the reasons for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>weight.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An ALJ is not required to follow formalistic rules when articulating the reasons for his credibility determination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">In this case, the opinion as a whole gives sufficient reasons and documentation for the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination. The ALJ noted that Undheim\u2019s complaints were not fully supported by the objective medical evidence, that Undheim\u2019s physical and mental conditions had improved with medication and treatment, that Undheim engaged in various household activities, and that Undheim had made various inconsistent statements to his treating physicians. These determinations and findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the ALJ\u2019s opinion was sufficiently specific to make clear how the ALJ reached his decision. The ALJ\u2019s discussion was therefore sufficient to meet the requirements of section 404.1529(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
