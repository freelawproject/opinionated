In her complaint, Wilmink claimed that the defendants\u2014Dennis Osborne, her former teacher and an athletic coach; David Gillispie, her former principal; and the Kanawha County Board of Education\u2014violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681 et. seq. (2000), and various provisions of state law. Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Wilmink responded by arguing that, because the defendants had fraudulently concealed facts supporting her claim, the discovery rule tolled the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The district court treated defendants\u2019 filings as summary judgment motions. It granted summary judgment in favor of Osborne because \u201cfrom the very moment of assault\u201d plaintiff had \u201cpossessed all information necessary to hold Osborne accountable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to plaintiffs claims against the Board and Gillispie, the court found that plaintiff had \u201cadequately alleged\u201d fraudulent concealment of material facts and that such allegations merited investigation through discovery. The court thus denied defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and ordered a 120-day discovery period. Following discovery, defendants renewed their motion for summary judgment again arguing that plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Gillispie and the Board. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-17\">Under West Virginia law, a personal injury action must be brought within two years. W. Va.Code \u00a7 55-2-12 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Where, as here, the injured party is a minor, West Virginia Code \u00a7 55-2-15 (2000), tolls the limitations period until plaintiff reaches majority. Under these provisions, Wilmink was required to file her petition in 1991, two years after she turned eighteen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d however, a statute of limitations is tolled until a claimant knows or \u201cshould know that he has been injured and who is responsible.\u201d <em>Cart v. Marcum, </em>188 W.Va. 241, 423 S.E.2d 644, 647 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">West Virginia\u2019s highest court recognizes two variants of the discovery rule. <em>Merrill v. W. Va. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Res., </em>219 W.Va. 151, 632 S.E.2d 307, 312 (2006). In <em>Gaither v. City Hosp., Inc., </em>199 W.Va. 706, 487 S.E.2d 901, 909 (1997), the court held that \u201cthe statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff knows, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence, should know (1) that the plaintiff has been injured, (2) the identity of the entity who owed the plaintiff a duty to act with due care, and who may have engaged in conduct that breached that duty, and (3) that the conduct of that entity has a causal relation to the injury.\u201d And, in <em>Cart v. Marcum, </em>the court recognized a second discovery rule: fraudulent concealment. 423 S.E.2d at 648. Because the fraudulent concealment doctrine operates \u201cwhere a plaintiff does or should reasonably know of the existence of an injury and its cause,\u201d <em>Gaither, </em>487 S.E.2d at 908, it \u201capplies only when there is a strong showing by the plaintiff that some action by the defendant prevented the plaintiff from knowing of the wrong at the time of the injury.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>632 S.E.2d at 318 (quotation omitted). We consider each of these standards in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Plaintiff has failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to any of the <em>Gaither </em>factors. First, it is beyond dispute that plaintiff knew she had been injured in 1984. She immediately reported the incident to her aunt, and her mother found her sobbing the evening of the assault. Moreover, according to plaintiffs deposition testimony, she avoided any further contact with Osborne\u2014she stopped taking classes from him and quit as manager of the boy\u2019s basketball team, which he coached.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Second, plaintiff knew \u201cthe identity of the entity who owed the plaintiff a duty to act with due care, and who may have engaged in conduct that breached that duty.\u201d <em>Gaither, </em>487 S.E.2d at 909. As West Virginia\u2019s highest court has instructed, the second <em>Gaither </em>factor is a limited inquiry into \u201cthe identity of the wrongdoer, not knowledge of the duty owed.\u201d <em>Merrill, </em>632 S.E.2d at 313. Here, plaintiff clearly knew the identity of her principal and her school board by the time she reached majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The third and final element of <em>Gaither </em>requires plaintiff to establish she \u201cneither knew nor by the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known that the conduct of [defendants] had a causal relation\u201d to her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 315. Plaintiffs failure to direct our attention to any evidence justifying her delay in discovering the causal connection between her injuries and defendants\u2019 actions defeats her claim here. <em>See Merrill, </em>632 S.E.2d at 316. As West Virginia\u2019s high court noted recently in Merrill\u2014a case where plaintiff similarly alleged that a supervisory authority had failed to prevent sexual abuse\u2014to survive a motion for summary judgment with respect to knowledge of a causal connection between an alleged injury and a defendant\u2019s conduct, a plaintiff must \u201cidentify specific facts in the record and articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports [her] claims of delay in discovering the causal connection between [her] injuries and the [defendant\u2019s] actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317 (quotation omitted). Here, plaintiff points to no \u201cspecific facts\u201d that excuse her delay in discovering the causal connection, and, as noted below, there is no evidence that defendants concealed their involvement in this case. <em>See id. </em>at 316 n. 16, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In short, by the time plaintiff reached her eighteenth birthday she knew, or reasonably should have known, all the elements of her cause of action. <em>See Keesecker v. Bird, </em>200 W.Va. 667, 490 S.E.2d 754, 771 (1997). Accordingly, she \u201cis not entitled to the protection of the discovery rule\u201d announced in <em>Gaither. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Plaintiffs claim also fails under the fraudulent concealment standard of <em>Cart v. Marcum, </em>423 S.E.2d at 648. To create a triable issue of fact, plaintiff was required to produce some evidence tending to show that Gillispie or the Board had notice that Osborne might sexually abuse students and that these school authorities fraudulently concealed facts which prevented Wilmink from knowing that she had a cause of action against Gillispie and the Board. Plaintiff in this case has done neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The record is devoid of any fact which indicates that school authorities had any reason to know that Osborne would engage in offensive sexual conduct toward students prior to 1984. Implicitly conceding as much, plaintiff argues that this knowledge was somehow \u201cimputed\u201d to the Board by the \u201cobservations\u201d of Linda Nelson, an admittedly \u201cnon-supervisory\u201d reading teacher. Plaintiff contends that when her mother reported her daughter\u2019s assault to Linda Nelson, Nelson told her of a prior occasion in which Nelson saw Osborne try to slide his hand up the back of a female student\u2019s shorts. Nelson now denies ever witnessing Osborne touch a female student in an inappropriate manner. Even assuming the truth of plaintiff\u2019s contentions, however, there is no evidence to suggest that Nelson ever reported the incident to Principal Gillispie, the School Board, or anyone else. In short, as the district court found, \u201cplaintiff has failed to produce a shred of evidence that the Board or Gillispie had any reason to believe that Osborne would engage in inappropriate sexual conduct with minor female school children before the plaintiffs alleged sexual assault in 1984.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">Plaintiff has not only failed to show that school authorities had any reason to suspect that Osborne would engage in inappropriate behavior but also failed to produce any evidence that these defendants actively concealed facts which prevented plaintiff from knowing of her claim. At its most basic, \u201c[f]raudulent concealment requires that the defendant commit some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>positive act tending to conceal the cause of action from the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Miller v. Monongalia County Bd. of Educ., </em>210 W.Va. 147, 556 S.E.2d 427, 431 (2001) (citation omitted). Here, after 120 days of discovery, \u201cthe record shows no competent evidence by the [plaintiff] that [the defendants] did anything to hide [their] actions\u201d from the plaintiff. <em>Keesecker, </em>490 S.E.2d at 771. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to make the requisite \u201cstrong showing\u201d that \u201csome action by the defendant prevented the plaintiff from knowing of the wrong at the time of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We in no way make light of plaintiff\u2019s claims or the injuries she may have suffered. We must, however, affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment since any cause of action which Wilmink may have had against the defendants is barred by the statute of limitations. Our disposition based on West Virginia\u2019s statute of limitations dispenses with all of plaintiffs claims, and we need not, therefore, address her other arguments. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-12\">. In her complaint, plaintiff states that the assault in 1984. In her deposition, however, plaintiff maintains assault occurred in the spring of 1985. This discrepancy affect the statute of limitations issue or this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-13\">. Plaintiffs notice of appeal indicates her intention to pursue an appeal against all parties, including Dennis Osborne. Because plaintiff has not raised any claim with respect to Osborne on appeal, however, those arguments are waived. <em>See Carter v. Lee, </em>283 F.3d 240, 252 (4th Cir.2002) (\"lT]his Court normally views contentions not raised in an opening brief to be waived.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-5\">. Plaintiffs federal claims are appropriately decided with reference to the state statute of limitations. It is well-settled that \"the statute of limitations for a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is borrowed from state law.\u201d <em>Nasim v. Warden, Maryland House of Correction, </em>64 F.3d 951, 955 (4th Cir.1995). Likewise, because Title IX does not contain an express statute of limitations, \u201cevery circuit to consider the issue has held that Title IX also borrows the relevant state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Trustees of California State Univ., </em>433 F.3d 1129, 1134 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Curto v. Edmundson, </em>392 F.3d 502, 503-04 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Bougher v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, </em>882 F.2d 74, 77-78 (3d Cir.1989); <em>Lillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., </em>76 F.3d 716, 729 (6th Cir.1996); <em>Egerdahl v. Hibbing Cmty. Coll., </em>72 F.3d 615, 618 (8th Cir.1995); <em>M.H.D. v. Westminster Schs., </em>172 F.3d 797, 803 (11th Cir.1999)). In any case, plaintiff has never argued it is inappropriate to borrow West Virginia\u2019s statute of limitations with respect to her federal claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
