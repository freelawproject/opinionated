He argues generally that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing his claim as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and that he alleged sufficient facts to state a claim that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs. Newland\u2019s allegations amount at most to negligence, his disagreement with his medical treatment, or unsuccessful treatment. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir. 1991). Newland has not shown that the defendants denied him medical care or that their actions constituted deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 303, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). New-land has not shown that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing his claim that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e) and \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 303, 111 S.Ct. 2321; <em>Varnado, </em>920 F.2d at 321. To the extent that New-land is attempting to raise a different claim on appeal that the defendants did not provide him with assistant in using the restroom, taking a shower, or retrieving his food tray, Newland\u2019s allegations involves factual questions that could have been resolved if he had raised them in the district court. Thus, the error, if any, cannot have been \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Plano City of Texas, </em>70 F.3d 21, 23 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Newland argues that the magistrate judge erred in using the heightened pleading standard in dismissing his complaint. The record shows that the magistrate judge dismissed Newland\u2019s claim pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e) and 1915A as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and did not apply the heightened pleading standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">Newland argues that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his health and safety. Newland\u2019s allegations do not rise to a constitutional violation absent an allegation of physical harm. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e); <em>see also Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">Newland has not shown that the magistrate judge erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 (5th Cir.2003). Newland is advised that this court\u2019s affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
