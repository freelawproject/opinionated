Holland appeals his sentence imposed aiter he pled guilty to ten counts of receipt of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(A). Holland\u2019s plea agreement contained an appeal waiver, which the government contends bars appeal of all but one of Holland\u2019s claims. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>Thus, as a threshold matter, we address the validity and scope of Holland\u2019s appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">A. Appeal Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">In his plea agreement, Holland agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence on any ground except for an upward departure or a finding by the district court that a five-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-6\">To the maximum extent permitted by federal law, however, the defendant voluntarily and expressly waives the right to appeal his sentence and the right to collaterally attack his sentence in any post-conviction proceeding on any ground, except that the defendant may file a direct appeal of an upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range and/or a finding by the trial court that the defendant is subject to a five-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)[ (4) ], because the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">In his plea agreement, Holland also stipulated that his guidelines range should be calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 and that the enhancements in \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), (b)(2)(B), (b)(3) and (b)(5) applied. His plea agreement also acknowledged that the government would argue at sentencing that \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4)\u2019s five-level enhancement applied because Holland had engaged in qualifying conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">On appeal, Holland argues that the district court erred in accepting the stipulation in the plea agreement that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 applied to calculate his offense level and that these enhancements in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 applied: \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), (b)(2)(B), (b)(3) and (b)(5). Holland contends that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.4 is the applicable guidelines provision for his offense and that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2G2.2 and the enhancements in \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l), (b)(2)(B), (b)(3) and (b)(5). If enforceable, Holland\u2019s appeal waiver precludes review of these claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">An appeal waiver \u201cwill be enforced if the government demonstrates either: (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.) (quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1041, 125 S.Ct. 2279, 161 L.Ed.2d 1074 (2005). \u201cA waiver of the right to appeal includes a waiver of the right to appeal difficult or debatable legal issues\u2014indeed, it includes a waiver of the right to appeal blatant error.\u201d <em>United States v. Howle, </em>166 F.3d 1166, 1169 (11th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Here, the district court specifically questioned Holland about the appeal waiver during the plea colloquy, and Holland stated that he understood the provision, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-5\">The Court: [Y]ou are waiving certain appeal rights that normally you would have. With the exceptions noted in your plea agreement, you are giving up that right, which means you\u2019ll be bound by the judge\u2019s decision. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">[Holland]: Yes, I understand I\u2019ll be bound by your decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-7\">The Court: And you are also giving up not only your right to appeal, but your right to collaterally attack your sentence at a later date through a habeas corpus or some other post judgment means. Do you understand that? [Holland]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-8\">The Court: Is there anything I have said or any questions I have asked that you do not understand or you wish me to go back over and clarify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABX\">[Holland]: No, you have said everything clearly, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-9\">The Court: Do you and your attorney feel that you both have had sufficient time to think about and discuss the matter fully among yourselves before entering this plea of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-10\">[Holland]: We have had enough time, and she\u2019s done a good job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Because Holland knowingly and voluntarily entered into his appeal waiver and because the district court specifically questioned Holland about the appeal waiver, the appeal waiver is enforceable. Therefore, we do not address the merits of Holland\u2019s arguments regarding the district court\u2019s use of \u00a7 2G2.2 and the (b)(1), (b)(2)(B), (b)(3) and (b)(5) enhancements stipulated to in his plea agreement, as opposed to \u00a7 2G2.4, to calculate his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">Holland also argues that the district court erred in applying a five-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), a claim expressly permitted by Holland\u2019s appeal waiver.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by five levels \u201c[i]f the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4). \u201cPattern of activity\u201d is defined in Application Note 1 as \u201cany combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor by the defendant. ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) cmt. n. 1. Furthermore, \u201csexual abuse or exploitation\u201d is defined as \u201cconduct constituting criminal sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, abusive sexual contact of a minor, any similar offense under state law, or an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the above offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-16\">Holland\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recounted specific facts relating to the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement. This portion of the PSI described Holland\u2019s ongoing sexual relationships with two fifteen year old boys, JV-MM and JV-TG. The PSI contained descriptions of, and excerpts from, a calendar and diaries kept by Holland as well as letters written by Holland in which he documented multiple sexual encounters with JV-MM and JV-TG. Holland did not object to these factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>allegations in the PSI, and thus they are deemed admitted. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence that Holland had sexual contact with at least five minors and took nude photographs of at least one of them and posted them on his website. Specifically, the government introduced sexually explicit images of minors found on Holland\u2019s computer, his website and on film in his camera; multiple e-mails sent by Holland to minors and to an adult in which he admitted engaging in sexual contact with minors; Holland\u2019s calendar and diaries; and an organizer found on Holland\u2019s refrigerator containing notations indicating that Holland had engaged in sexual contact with minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">This evidence is more than sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Holland engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor. Holland\u2019s diaries, organizer, calendar entries and e-mails recount multiple, separate instances of sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of at least five minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Holland\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s evidence constituted inadmissible hearsay is without merit. First, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply at sentencing. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3). Rather, the sentencing court may consider hearsay evidence that has sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). The statements by JV-MM and JV-TG that they had multiple sexual contacts with Holland are corroborated by Holland\u2019s own statements in his diaries, organizer, calendar and e-mails. Holland has failed to show that this evidence is unreliable. Second, the statements in the diaries, organizer, calendar and e-mails constituted admissions by a party and therefore were non-hearsay. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Equally meritless is Holland\u2019s argument that the district court committed reversible error when it failed to make specific findings to support the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement. The district court explicitly found \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving sexual abuse and exploitation of a minor\u201d and that Holland\u2019s conduct involved \u201cfive different victims, and that the same victim was involved more than one time in some instances.\u201d As the record amply supports the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4)\u2019s enhancement, more individualized findings were not required. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005) (affirming the district court\u2019s application of a \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) without particularized findings because record supported district court\u2019s determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">The district court did not commit plain error when it applied the five-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-8\">. All citations are to the 2002 version of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\">. The parties agree that the plea agreement incorrectly identified the relevant guidelines provision as \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) and that appeal of the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement was excepted from the appeal waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b984-10\">. We reject as meritless Holland\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 2G2.2 enhancements constituted an upward departure and thus fall within the other exception to Holland\u2019s appeal waiver. A departure by definition results in a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>289 F.3d 696, 710 (11th Cir.2002). The \u00a7 2G2.2 enhancements Holland seeks to challenge on appeal were used to calculate Holland\u2019s guidelines range, not to authorize a sentence outside that range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b984-16\">. We review de <em>novo </em>the validity of an appeal waiver. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b985-12\">. Ordinarily, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. </em>Bender, 290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Ftowever, where, as here, the defendant failed to object in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b986-7\">. Holland\u2019s only objection to the PSI\u2019s facts relating to the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement was to the characterization of one incident with JV-MM. According to the PSI, JV-MM stated that Holland took a photograph of him as he exited the shower and then sexually assaulted him. According to Holland, the photograph was given to him, not taken by him, and he never forced JV-MM to engage in sexual activity. However, Holland did not object to the PSI\u2019s description of his other multiple sexual encounters with both JV-MM and JV-TG. Therefore, even without the one incident to which Holland objected, there were still sufficient sexual encounters with minors to satisfy the \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(4) enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
