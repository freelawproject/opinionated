The plaintiff, Charles James Pompey, sued Dr. Appel under section 1983 for deliberate indifference to his medical needs while incarcerated, as proscribed by the Eight Amendment\u2019s right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. The district court denied Appel\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. Because the district court applied an incorrect legal standard, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In reviewing an officer\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity, a court first determines whether the plaintiff alleges a violation of a constitutional right. Here Pompey alleges deliberate indifference, for which the appropriate <em>mens rea </em>is subjective recklessness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That is, \u201c[f]or an official to act with deliberate indifference, the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Yet the district court found a constitutional violation based on objective recklessness, ruling that Appel knew <em>or should have known </em>that Pompey faced a substantial risk of harm. This error improperly broadened the scope of Appel\u2019s liability. We VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-31\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\">. <em>Farmer v.
