Riley, Sr. (\u201cRiley\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s granting of Defendants-Appellees Louisiana State Bar Association\u2019s (\u201cBar Association\u201d) and Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board\u2019s (\u201cBoard\u201d) (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Riley argues that the district court erred in holding that: (1) the Eleventh Amendment barred Riley\u2019s claims for monetary damages against the Bar Association and the Board,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) it lacked jurisdiction to hear Riley\u2019s claims under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. We decline to reach the Eleventh Amendment issues. However, we agree with the district court that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine deprives it of jurisdiction to hear any of Riley\u2019s claims. We therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In 2003, Riley sought readmission to the Louisiana State Bar Association for the third time. The Louisiana Supreme Court denied Riley\u2019s application for readmission on November 19, 2004. <em>In re Riley, </em>887 So.2d 459 (La.2004), <em>reconsideration denied, </em>898 So.2d 1286 (La.2005). In response, Riley requested reconsideration of that decision, which the Louisiana Supreme Court denied. Riley then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Despite these setbacks, Riley remained undeterred. On June 20, 2005, Riley filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana against the Bar Association and the Board, alleging violations of the Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection clauses in addition to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1988 <em>et seq. </em>Riley alleges that the Board libeled him by submitting recommendations to the Louisiana Supreme Court which stated that Riley had not completed all court-ordered restitution. Compl. XXI. Riley contends that the Louisiana Supreme Court denied his application for readmission because of the allegedly false claims in the Board\u2019s recommendations. <em>Id. </em>XXV. Riley further contends that the Bar Association and the Board treat black applicants for readmission differently than they treat white applicants. <em>Id. </em>XXXIX-XXXXIV. The complaint seeks both injunctive relief and monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The Bar Association and the Board filed separate motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). In separate orders, the district court granted both motions for substantially the same reasons. Riley now appeals those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">Riley appeals the district court\u2019s orders granting Defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>so this court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">This court reviews a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo. <em>United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Texas Inc., </em>336 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir. 2003). We must accept all well-pleaded facts as true and review the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>We may dismiss a claim if the plaintiff fails to allege any set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The district court determined that Riley was not entitled to relief because the Eleventh Amendment and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred Riley\u2019s claims against the Defendants. The district court held that Eleventh Amendment immunity shielded the Defendants from suit for monetary damages. Further, the district court held that, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, it lacked jurisdiction over all of Riley\u2019s claims, including those for declaratory and injunctive relief. Because, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we may legitimately decide this case exclusively on jurisdictional grounds, we decline to reach any Eleventh Amendment issues.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine directs that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to entertain collateral attacks on state court judgments. <em>Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994). State courts should resolve constitutional questions arising from state proceedings. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf a state trial court errs[,] the judgment is not void, it is to be reviewed and corrected by the appropriate state appellate court. Thereafter, recourse at the <em>federal </em>level is limited solely to an application for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA federal complainant cannot circumvent this jurisdictional limitation by asserting claims not raised in the state court proceedings or. claims framed as original claims for relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Shepherd, </em>23 F.3d 923, 924 (5th Cir.1994). Similarly, a federal complainant cannot re-litigate issues that should have been raised in state court and defeat the operation of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine by casting a complaint as a civil rights violation. <em>Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 317. Finally, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bars federal claims which, while not identical to, are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with state court judgments. <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">Riley argues that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply to his case. Instead, he contends that his complaint states a separate cause of action unrelated to his application for readmission to the bar. Riley cites to our decisions in <em>Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367 (5th Cir.1995), and <em>Gauthier v. Continental Diving Services, Inc., </em>831 F.2d 559, 561 (5th Cir.1987), for the proposition that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not bar an action in federal court if the same action would be allowed in the state court of the rendering state.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Riley\u2019s arguments are unavailing. Riley attempts to frame the alleged violations of his civil rights as original claims, but they arise from, and exist only because of, the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his application for readmission. Although, in his briefings, Riley strenuously maintains that he does not wish to challenge the denial of his application for readmission, his complaint suggests otherwise. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>complaint states \u201c[t]he denial of Plaintiffs application for readmission, by the Supreme Court of Louisiana, on November 19, 2004, is a denial of due process and equal protection afforded to the Plaintiff, as a black person, under the United States Constitution____\u201d Compl. XXVI. Contrary to Riley\u2019s briefings, these words do not indicate an original cause of action unrelated to his application for readmission.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Even if Riley\u2019s complaint is not a direct challenge to the denial of his application for readmission, his complaint falls under the aegis of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because it raises issues \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state court judgment, such that the district court was \u201cin essence being called upon to review the state-court decision.\u201d <em>Shepherd, </em>23 F.3d at 924. Riley\u2019s case is materially indistinguishable from <em>Liedtke, </em>in which we applied <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because the federal claim was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a previous state court judgment. In <em>Liedtke, </em>the appellant filed a \u00a7 1983 suit challenging the constitutionality of the events that led to his disbarment. 18 F.3d at 316. In that case, we held that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>prevented the appellant from challenging those events in federal court because they were \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment disbarring him. <em>Id. </em>at 318. Similarly, in this case, Riley argues that the events leading to the denial of his application for readmission\u2014for example, the Board allegedly submitting a knowingly libelous recommendation to the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2014resulted in unconstitutional violations of his civil rights. These events are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s denial of Riley\u2019s application for readmission. <em>Cf. Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 316. Therefore, under <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear any of Riley\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">If the readmission process did result in violations of Riley\u2019s civil rights, then he should have raised those issues before the Louisiana Supreme Court. <em>See Musslewhite v. State Bar of Tex., </em>32 F.3d 942, 946 n. 15 (5th Cir.1994) (noting that federal courts lack jurisdiction over claims that could have been, but were not raised in state court). Riley exhausted his recourse at the federal level when the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari. Under <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>the district court lacked jurisdiction over Riley\u2019s claims and properly dismissed his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the orders of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-9\">. The Bar Association and the Board filed separate motions to dismiss and the district court issued separate orders granting those motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-10\">. In its order granting the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court held that the Board had Eleventh Amendment immunity against \"[Riley\u2019s] claims against the Board.\u201d App. at 17. In its subsequent order granting the Bar Association\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court restricted the broad language of its pri- or holding. The district court held that the Board had Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to claims for monetary damages, but not for claims for declaratory or injunctive relief. <em>Id. </em>at 27 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\">. In declining to resolve any Eleventh Amendment issues, we follow the well-established canon that courts should avoid addressing constitutional questions when possible. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 359 (5th Cir.2002). This court should not decide questions of a constitutional nature \"unless absolutely necessary to decide the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
