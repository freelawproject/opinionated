Alegr\u00eda argues that the defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his medical needs by disregarding the treatment recommendations of pain specialists that he be prescribed Darvocet on a long-term basis and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). We reject Alegria\u2019s contention that the district court has insufficient medical documentation before it to render judgment, and we hold that the evidence supports a determination that the decision whether to administer Darvocet was a medical judgment as opposed to deliberate indifference to his pain. Alegria\u2019s claim is a disagreement over the type of care he received, which, under the facts of his case, is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Alegria\u2019s jurisdictional argument fails because it is premised on his erroneous belief that the District Court for the Eastern District of Texas\u2019s order severing and transferring his claims against the instant defendants to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas was immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. As we previously held, such orders are not immediately appeal-able. <em>Harvey Specialty &amp; </em>Supply, <em>Inc. v. Anson Flowline Equip. Inc., </em>434 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see Alegria v. Adams, </em>204 Fed.Appx. 375 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Alegr\u00eda does not argue the merits of the issue whether the transfer was appropriate, and he has therefore waived its review. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
