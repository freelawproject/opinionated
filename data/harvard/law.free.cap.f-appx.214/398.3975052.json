Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), he received an enhanced sentence of 188 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">Cloman argues that the district court erred in counting his convictions for two December 1989 residential burglaries, committed six days apart, as separate offenses for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). The district court did not so err. <em>See United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 253 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 982-83 (5th Cir. 1992). Cloman does not argue that his aggravated arson conviction was not a qualifying predicate offense for purposes of \u00a7 924(e). Consequently, we need not consider his argument that his two convictions for burglary of a high school were not qualifying predicate offenses for \u00a7 924(e) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-21\">Cloman invites us to overrule the precedent set in <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997), that possession of a firearm during a burglary has been held to be \u201cin connection with\u201d the burglary for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. It is the firm rule of this circuit that one panel may not overrule the decisions of another without en banc consideration or an intervening Supreme Court opinion. <em>See Hogue v. Johnson, </em>131 F.3d 466, 491 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
