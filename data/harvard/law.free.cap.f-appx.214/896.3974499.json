Terriquez argues that the district court did not give \u201cfair consideration\u201d to any factors other than the advisory Guideline range and maintains that the district court\u2019s general reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), followed by the imposition of a Guidelines sentence, did not satisfy its \u201cstatutory duty\u201d to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence and our reasonableness inquiry are guided by the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARd\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-6\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. \u201c[Tjhere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. While a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not, <em>per se, </em>a reasonable sentence, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. The district court is not obligated to specifically address and analyze every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, the district court\u2019s statement that it has considered those factors is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">In this case, the district court heard Terriquez\u2019s arguments at sentencing, expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment, and found that a sentence at the low end of the Guideline range was appropriate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing. Thus, Terriquez\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Terriquez\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
