We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue only: \u201c[w]hether appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel when counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal after appellant allegedly requested counsel to do so and whether the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue,\u201d pursuant to <em>Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Suarez argues that his counsel was <em>per se </em>ineffective because he failed to file a direct appeal upon request and that, at a minimum, Suarez is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The government concedes that, pursuant to our decision in <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>the district court erred by finding that Suarez had waived his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a direct appeal. It acknowledges that we should remand for the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing to establish whether Suarez\u2019s trial counsel had a duty to file a notice of appeal from the final judgment in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">A district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding are reviewed <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Whether a defendant ultimately has received ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law reviewed <em>de novo. Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1142 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">The legal standard governing the disposition of ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims is derived from the seminal case of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In <em>Strickland, </em>the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for adjudicating ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. First, a movant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonably deficient. Second, the movant must show that this deficiency prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">In <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), the Supreme Court applied the test set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>in <em>Strickland </em>in addressing the question of when counsel is ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal. The Court reiterated the long-established rule that a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a professionally unreasonable manner. <em>Id. </em>at 476-77, 120 S.Ct. at 1034-35. The Court further held that counsel may be ineffective even when a defendant has not specifically instructed his counsel to file an appeal, so long as counsel had a duty to consult the defendant about his desire to appeal. This duty to consult arises when either: (1) any rational defendant would want to appeal; or (2) the defendant reasonably demonstrated an interest in appealing. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 120 S.Ct. at 1036. Finally, in addition to showing unreasonable deficiency, the defendant must also show that the failure to file a notice of appeal caused prejudice. \u201c[T]o show prejudice under these circumstances, a defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would have timely appealed.\u201d <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">In <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>we were presented with a case factually and procedurally similar to the instant appeal. In that case, Gomez-Diaz pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement containing a sentence appeal waiver. <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 790. Gomez-Diaz did not file a direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>He filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, wherein he alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that his court-appointed counsel failed to file a notice of appeal as he had requested. <em>Id. </em>The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion without an evidentiary hearing, on the basis that Gomez-Diaz failed to identify any ground for appeal falling within the exceptions listed in the sentence appeal waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">After examining the analytical framework set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Strickland </em>and <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>we held that Gomezr-Diaz did in fact state a claim sufficient to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing in the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 791-93. We remanded the case to the district court with instructions to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Gomez-Diaz\u2019s initial statements were sufficient to trigger a <em>per se </em>duty to appeal, and if not, whether counsel fulfilled his constitutional duty to consult with Gomez-Diaz regarding his desire to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 793 We also held that the reasoning of <em>Flores-Ortega </em>applied \u201cwith equal force\u201d where the defendant has waived many, but not all of his appellate rights. <em>Id. </em>at 793.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we find that <em>Gomez-Diaz </em>controls this case, and vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Here, as in <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>the district court erred by concluding that Suarez had waived his ineffective-assistanee-of-eounsel claim. In that case, Gomez-Diaz pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement containing a sentence appeal waiver that, substantively, was essentially the same as the waiver in the instant case. <em>Gomez-Diaz, </em>433 F.3d at 790. In denying Suarez\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted in his \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court found that the claim was barred by Suarez\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver. As conceded by the government, the district court erred in making this finding in light of the reasoning set forth in <em>Gomez-Diaz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The record shows that the district court did not address the issue of whether Suarez actually requested his attorney to file an appeal. This is an essential first step in the analysis under <em>Flores-Ortega </em>and <em>Gomez-Diaz. </em>Therefore, we vacate and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>mand to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing into: (1) whether Suarez, in fact, requested counsel to file a direct appeal sufficient to trigger the <em>per se </em>duty to appeal set forth in <em>Flores-Ortega; </em>and (2) if not, whether counsel fulfilled his constitutional duty to consult with Suarez by advising him of the advantages and disadvantages of filing an appeal and making a reasonable effort to comply with Suarez\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
