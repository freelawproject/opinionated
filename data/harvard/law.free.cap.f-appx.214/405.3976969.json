Batungwanayo has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in determining he had failed to support his motion to reopen with previously unavailable material evidence showing that he had a well-founded fear of persecution related to his political beliefs or ethnicity based on changed conditions in Burundi. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
