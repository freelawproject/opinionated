Randolph, sued the Texas Rehabilitation Commission (TRC) and several TRC employees. Ml of Randolph\u2019s claims were dismissed by the district court. On appeal, Randolph challenges the dismissal of his Rehabilitation Act claims against the TRC based on sovereign immunity and his section 1983 retaliation claims against the employees in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-23\">The TRC concedes that Randolph\u2019s claims under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 should not have been dismissed based on sovereign immunity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>light of <em>Pace v. Bogalusa City School </em>Board<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <em>Miller v. Texas Tech University Health Sciences </em>Center,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Randolph\u2019s section 504 claims is therefore reversed, and the claims are remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">With regard to the dismissal of the section 1983 claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity, Randolph complains that his employment was terminated because he exercised his First Amendment right to speak on an issue of public concern. Randolph alleges that the TRC fired him because he (1) complained that management was running the agency based on \u201cwhims\u201d; (2) threatened, in front of approximately six employees, to \u201csue Commissioner [Vernon] Arrell for $50,000,000\u201d for violating his and another disabled co-worker\u2019s rights; (3) dictated a letter, in front of his co-workers and supervisor, criticizing the TRC management for disbanding a forum for disabled employees to discuss concerns; and (4) criticized Associate Commissioner Dave Ward in front of co-workers on numerous occasions for his involvement with the Amway Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The district court held that Randolph\u2019s speech was public, but the concerns addressed by his speech were outweighed by the TRC\u2019s need to maintain a harmonious, efficient workplace. We review an order dismissing a claim based on qualified immunity <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>treating \u201call well-pleaded facts as true, [and] viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">We employ a two-step test to determine whether the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. First, we must determine whether the plaintiffs allegations, if true, establish a violation of a clearly established federal right.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If not, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If a violation is established, we must then determine whether the defendants\u2019 conduct was \u201cobjectively reasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the incident.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">To prevail on his retaliation claim, Randolph must establish: \u201c(1) [he] suffered an adverse employment action; (2) the speech at issue involved matters of public concern; (3)[his] interest in the speech outweighs the government\u2019s interest in efficiency; and (4) the speech precipitated the adverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court will resolve the legal questions of whether the speech is public in nature and whether the plaintiffs interests outweigh the government\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the plaintiff satisfies these elements, the jury determines the remaining factual issues.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-17\">In assessing whether speech is of public concern, we examine \u201cthe content, form, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and context\u201d of each statement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Internal personnel disputes and management decisions are rarely a matter of public concern, even if they occur at a state agency.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The speech is not public if it \u201cis only interesting to the public by virtue of a manager\u2019s status as an arm of the government.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, claims of corruption or malfeasance are matters of public concern, as opposed to mere employment or managerial disagreements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">None of Randolph\u2019s statements are public in nature when the content, form, and context are considered. His first complaint\u2014that management was making decisions on \u201cwhims\u201d\u2014is simply a disagreement about management of the agency. He alleges no corruption or malfeasance; his comments indicate he simply would have preferred that management make different decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Next, Randolph stood in a group of coworkers and threatened to \u201csue Commissioner Arrell for $50,000,000\u201d for violating his rights and the rights of a disabled coworker. Even Randolph admits that this statement was \u201cpuerile.\u201d Randolph was not giving a critique of the TRC\u2019s policies towards the disabled; he was merely voicing his dissatisfaction with managerial decisions personal to him and other employees. This does not rise above an individual employee\u2019s complaints and is not a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Randolph also dictated a letter in front of co-workers and his supervisor complaining that management disbanded a forum for disabled employees to discuss concerns. The dictation of this letter in the presence of other employees reflects that he created a distraction in the workplace, and this action would be interesting to the public, if at all, only because of Randolph\u2019s status as an arm of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Finally, Randolph complained of Associate Commissioner Ward\u2019s involvement with the Amway Corporation on a number of occasions. Once again, Randolph chose to air his concerns in front of his coworkers. Randolph did not allege any actual misconduct, malfeasance, or corruption\u2014instead, he merely questioned Ward\u2019s involvement and whether it was interfering with Ward\u2019s duties at the TRC. Though Ward is a public official, his private affiliations are not a public concern unless they are related to corruption or misconduct. Randolph did not allege any actual conflicts of interest, corruption, or misconduct\u2014he simply threatened to \u201cinvestigate\u201d Ward\u2019s connection to Amway. These insinuations do not rise to the level of a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">The district court stated that Randolph sometimes complained about the disability policies of the agency in a broad context and that these disability policies would be of interest to the public. However, Randolph\u2019s own allegations of his statements are not extended to a broader context than his own personal complaints. Randolph\u2019s statements, as alleged by Randolph himself, are not assertions of a broad policy of the TRC to discriminate against disabled employees; instead, they are limited to Randolph\u2019s immediate circumstances. Randolph\u2019s statements appear to be nothing more than a frustrated employee\u2019s attempts at creating distractions in the workplace by airing his concerns and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>threats as loudly as possible to his coworkers and supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Randolph\u2019s section 1983 claims against the individual defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">REVERSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
