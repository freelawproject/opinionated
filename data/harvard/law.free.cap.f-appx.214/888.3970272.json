The facts of the underlying case are not at issue and will not be repeated here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A limited re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>view of the procedural history of the case is, however, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">On June 80, 2003, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of appellees School District of Lee County, Department of Children and Families of Lee County, Joanne Loeber and Dan McClean (School) and against Daeda. Daeda filed a timely notice of appeal. It was ultimately dismissed for lack of prosecution on September 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">On June 30, 2004, Daeda filed her first motion from relief from judgment and motion to permit discovery requesting that the summary judgment order in favor of School be vacated on the grounds of newly discovered evidence of fraud. The district court denied the motion for relief from judgment on the basis that it failed to meet the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">On December 29, 2005, some thirty months after the entry of final summary judgment, and eighteen months after denial of her original motion for relief, Daeda filed a second, amended motion for relief. The arguments and evidence presented in the amended motion were virtually identical to those raised in the original motion. On February 3, 2006, the district court denied the amended motion for relief on the grounds that it was untimely filed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 and 60. It also found that Daeda had failed to meet the requirements necessary to warrant the granting of extraordinary relief. That February 3, 2006, order is the limited subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Although captioned an \u201camended\u201d motion, the court found that it had decided the original motion in September, 2004, therefore there was nothing before the court to be amended. Upon review of the record, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The district court characterized the amended motion as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 motion to alter or amend the judgment but denied it as untimely. Rule 59(e) requires the motion to be filed \u201cno later than 10 days after entry of the judgment.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e). Here, the motion was filed approximately <em>thirty months </em>after entry of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">The district court found that even had the motion been timely filed within the 10 day period, the matters asserted could not be properly considered because they were an attempt to \u201crelitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of the judgment.\u201d <em>See Michael Linet, Inc. v. Village of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">If, however, a motion is filed after the ten day period, limited exceptions exist. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Daeda claims that exceptions appear because summary judgment was granted based upon misrepresentations so egregious as to amount to a fraud upon the court. Under Rule 60(b), a court may relieve a party from final judgment based upon mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence or fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">To grant relief based upon newly discovered evidence under Rule 60(b)(2), a movant must meet a five-part test: \u201c(1) the evidence must be newly discovered since the trial; (2) due diligence on the part of the movant to discover the new evidence must be shown; (3) the evidence must not be merely cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence must be material; and (5) the evidence must be such that a new trial would probably produce a new result.\u201d <em>See Toole v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>235 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>Upon careful review of the documents submitted, the district court found that Daeda had not met the burdens required under Rule 60(b). After our separate and thorough review of the record we conclude that the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d was evidence that was available prior to the entry of the original summary judgment in favor of School, so no exception is available. In addition, the motion is untimely as Daeda failed to show exercise of due diligence in filing the amended motion thirty months after judgment. There is no abuse of discretion by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Based upon the foregoing discussion, the judgment of the district court denying Daeda\u2019s amended motion as untimely and without merit is</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-14\">. The amended complaint was filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging sexual assault of a minor by a substitute teacher.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
