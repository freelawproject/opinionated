He was sentenced to 109 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. De La Fuente argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory sentencing guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which requires that his sentence be vacated and remanded for resentencing. He contends that based on the record and the sentencing hearing, the Government cannot show harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-24\">De La Fuente\u2019s objection in the district court based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) preserved his Fanfan challenge for review for harmless error. <em>United States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 829 (2006); <em>United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The district court erred by sentencing De La Fuente under the formerly mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). In light of the Government\u2019s concession that it cannot show harmless error on the current record, and considering the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing about the potential effect of a decision in <em>Booker, </em>we conclude that the Government has not shown harmless error. De La Fuente\u2019s sentence is vacated and this case is remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. See Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 464-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Because we remand based on the Fan-fan error, we need not address the remaining sentencing issues raised by De La Fuente concerning the application of the adjustment for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; the corresponding denial of acceptance of responsibility; whether the district court\u2019s finding of obstruction violated the Sixth Amendment; whether De La Fuente\u2019s subsequent conviction on the escape charge made the obstruction of justice issue moot; and whether the finding on the quantity of drugs violated <em>Booker. See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005) (declining to address other claims of sentencing error when remanding pursuant to <em>Booker); United States v. Mendoza-Blanco, </em>440 F.3d 264, 266 n. 10 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 833 (2006) (Fanfan).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
