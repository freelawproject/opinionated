The district court initially sentenced Wall to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second count <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and eighty-four months on the third count. On appeal, we affirmed Wall\u2019s convictions, vacated Wall\u2019s sentence on the second count, and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Treating the sentencing guidelines as advisory, the district court on remand again imposed a two-level enhancement for organizing and leading a criminal activity involving fewer than five participants, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2003). After considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), the district court sentenced Wall to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment on the second count. Wall filed a timely appeal. He contends the district court\u2019s factual finding concerning the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement on the second count was clearly erroneous. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">We will affirm the sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). An error of law or fact can render the sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). In considering whether a sentence is unreasonable, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006). A sentencing court treating the guidelines as advisory continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">An enhancement for an aggravating role in an offense requires, at a minimum, that \u201cthe defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>see United States v. Harriott, </em>976 F.2d 198, 200 (4th Cir. 1992) (two-level enhancement appropriate where defendant directed activities of one other person); <em>United States v. Kincaid, </em>964 F.2d 325, 329 (4th Cir.1992) (same). Factors distinguishing a leadership or organizational role from lesser roles include exercise of decision making authority, the nature of the participation in the offense, recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the proceeds, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised. USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). After carefully reviewing the trial and sentencing transcripts, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in the application of the two-level enhancement for Wall\u2019s role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Wall\u2019s sentence on the second count. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-11\"> The first count, a lesser-included offense, merged with the second count.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
