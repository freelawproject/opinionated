The district court sentenced Artis to seventy-six months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">On appeal, Artis argues that his sentence is unreasonable. However, Artis\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range of sixty-three to seventy-eight months and below the ten-year statutory maximum sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(a)(2). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). To the extent that Artis argues that this court should revisit its holding in <em>Green, </em>one panel of this court may not overrule a decision of another panel. <em>See, e.g., </em>Scotts <em>Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Artis\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
