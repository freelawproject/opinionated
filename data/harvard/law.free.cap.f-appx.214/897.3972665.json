We granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-19\">(1) Whether the district court erred by construing Wood\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 claims regarding Amendment 591 and 599 to the sentencing guidelines as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claims; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-20\">(2) If not, whether the district court erred by recharacterizing the appellant\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion as a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, without first giving the appellant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it to include all of his \u00a7 2255 claims. <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">On appeal, Wood states that he was sentenced under the federal Sentencing Guidelines. He then argues that he filed a <em>pro se </em>pleading which was clearly labeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>as a \u201cMotion to Modify Sentence under \u00a7 3582.\u201d Moreover, he asserts, in that motion, he noted that his sentence should have been amended based upon Amendments 591 and 599 and that we have held that a motion to modify is the proper mechanism to seek relief on a retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In a proceeding to modify a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Section lB1.10(a) of the Sentencing Guidelines allows a defendant to move, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for a reduction of his sentence based on a guideline range applicable to the defendant which has been subsequently lowered because of an amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). Section 3582(c) provides for modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence under three circumstances. First, on a motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, under specific circumstances regardless of whether the defendant was sentenced under the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). Second, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, which allows a court to correct a prisoner\u2019s sentence when (1) it resulted from arithmetical, technical, or clear error and within seven days of the sentencing, or (2) the government has filed a substantial assistance motion. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). Third, upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, if the defendant was sentenced under the Guidelines and the sentencing range subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, only the third option is open to Wood. However, a review of the record of Woods\u2019s conviction reveals that he was not sentenced pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines. Because Wood was not sentenced under the Guidelines, he could not obtain relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A district court is obligated to determine whether a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s claims are cognizable under a different statutory framework. <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003). The district court thus did not err when it recharacterized Wood\u2019s motion as one filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Wood next argues that a district court may not re-characterize a defendant\u2019s pleadings without first informing the defendant that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motions would be subject to the restrictions of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and providing that defendant with an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. Wood asserts that the district court failed to comply with these requirements. Finally, Wood states that he \u201cdeliberately invoked\u201d \u00a7 3582, did not want to file a \u00a7 2255 motion, and \u201cshould not be compelled to utilize \u00a7 2255.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The Supreme Court has held that, when a court recharacterizes a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first \u00a7 2255 motion, the defendant must be (1) given notice of the re-characterization, (2) informed that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions of a \u201csecond or successive\u201d motion, and (3) provided an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 383, 124 S.Ct. 786, 792, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). The Court held that, if a district court fails to comply with those requirements, \u201cthe motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>plying to later motions the law\u2019s \u2018second or successive\u2019 restrictions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The district court did err in re-characterizing Wood\u2019s motion without first giving him notice and an opportunity to withdraw or amend the motion. However, the remedy for that failing is not remand. Instead, as stated in <em>Castro, </em>the instant motion cannot be considered to have become a \u00a7 2255 motion for purposes of determining whether any future \u00a7 2255 motion is second or successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Upon careful review of the record on appeal and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
