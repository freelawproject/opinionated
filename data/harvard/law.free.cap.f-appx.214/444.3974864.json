Carrillo-Soria contends that the district court erred by applying a 16-level increase to his offense level, based on its finding that his 2002 state felony conviction for assault was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Carrillo-Soria\u2019s assault offense was committed under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01(a)(1) and (b)(2) (Vernon 2003), which does not set forth a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)) (reflecting that simple assault is not an enumerated offense constituting a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d); <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 882 (5th Cir.2006)(determining that use of force is not an element of \u00a7 22.01(a)(1)); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 22.01(b)(2)(lack-ing use of force as an element). As this error is prejudicial, Carrillo-Soria\u2019s sentence is vacated and his case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion. <em>See Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-22\">Carrillo-Soria also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Carrillo-Soria\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>darez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Carrillo-Soria properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
