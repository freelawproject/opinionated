The district court dismissed the petition as an abuse of the writ because Jennings had raised the same claim in an earlier \u00a7 2241 petition. We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Jennings challenges his arson conviction under <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000). He argues that the issue in his current petition is whether he was convicted of a nonexistent offense under <em>Jones. </em>He posits that he did not raise this same issue in his prior petition, where, he asserts, he claimed that the district court improperly instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Based on our review of the record and Jennings\u2019s pleadings in his prior petition, both in the district court and on appeal, we conclude that Jennings raised the same challenge to his conviction based on the holding in <em>Jones </em>and the alleged lack of an interstate commerce element to his offense. The district court did not err by holding that Jennings\u2019s instant petition fails to raise a new issue and is an abuse of the writ. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a); <em>United States v. Tubwell, </em>37 F.3d 175, 177-78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
