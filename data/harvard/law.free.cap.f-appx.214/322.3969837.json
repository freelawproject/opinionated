Boyd appeals the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment, alleging abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) motion. Generally, summary judgment is appropriate only after adequate time for discovery. <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 961 (4th Cir.1996) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, however, while Boyd submitted an affidavit pursuant to Rule 56(f) in which he attested that he was \u201cunable to present facts in opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, without the benefit of discovery in this matter,\u201d he failed to identify any facts essential to his opposition that were not already available to him. Rule 56(f) provides that a court may order a continuance \u201c[sjhould it appear from the affidavits ... that the party cannot for reasons stated\u201d present facts to defeat summary judgment. Given the extent to which numerous documents and affidavits submitted during his EEOC proceedings were already available to Boyd, we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in denying Boyd\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Boyd\u2019 s Rule 56(f) motion, granting summary judgment, and dismissing Boyd\u2019s action. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
