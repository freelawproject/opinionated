Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">Esquivel first asserts that his sentence violates the rule set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court made factual findings at sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and sentenced him under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Esquivel preserved these arguments by making an objection pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and we review for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Mesa, </em>443 F.3d 397, 404 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The district court unequivocally stated that, absent the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, it would impose the same sentence. This statement is sufficient to satisfy the Government\u2019s burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 314-15 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 810, 163 L.Ed.2d 637 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Esquivel\u2019s argument that the alternative non-mandatory sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not consider all the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) also fails. The district court stated that it had considered a number of such factors, namely the nature of the offense, the offender characteristics, and the need for punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A), (B), (D). Further, the only \u00a7 3553(a) factor to which Esquivel points is \u00a7 3553(a)(6), which directs courts to consider \u201cunwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d Although Esquivel\u2019s co-defendants received lower sentences, the record is silent as to the reasons for those sentences. Thus, we cannot determine whether the disparities were unwarranted under \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Esquivel has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In his final point of error, Esquivel contends that the district court committed plain error by accepting his guilty plea without an adequate factual basis. His argument is premised on the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement that 1,375 pounds, rather than 1,375 kilograms, of marijuana were involved. Thus, he asserts, the factual basis does not support a conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), which provides penalties of 10 years to life, but only a lesser offense under \u00a7 841(a)(1), with its penalties of five to 40 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">As Esquivel concedes, because he failed to object, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Marek, </em>238 F.3d 310, 315 (5th Cir.2001). Esquivel has not met his burden. The record as a whole, including the trial testimony, establishes that more than 1,000 kilograms were seized on the date in question. Esquivel was well aware of this information at the time he pleaded guilty, he agreed that the conspiracy involved more than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, and he knew that he faced punishment of 10 years to life. Esquivel has failed to show that the misstatement by the Government\u2019s attorney affected his substantial rights, i.e., that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the error, <em>see United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 559 (5th Cir.2002), nor has he shown that we should exercise our discretion to correct any error. <em>See Marek, </em>238 F.3d at 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
