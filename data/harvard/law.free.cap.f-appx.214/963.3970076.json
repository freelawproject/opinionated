After we vacated Owens\u2019 first sentence and remanded the case back to the district court in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Booker,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number><em>v. Owens, </em>163 Fed.Appx. 845 (11th Cir. 2006), the district court sentenced him to 225 months in prison. Owens\u2019 sole contention in this appeal is that his 225-month prison sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the [section] 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). Our reasonableness review is deferential, and the burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the section 3553(a) factors rests on the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1245 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 693, 166 L.Ed.2d 539 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Owens contends that his sentence was unreasonable because his robbery attempt was \u201cinept,\u201d his prior convictions were not as serious as those for most career offenders, he was suffering from depression when he robbed the bank, and his sentence was disproportionate to what he would have received in state court for a similar crime. To the extent this mitigation evidence was relevant to the section 3553(a) factors, the district court stated that it considered the evidence in determining Owens\u2019 sentence. However, the court also said it must consider Owens\u2019 \u201cbad\u201d sixteen-year criminal history (multiple convictions for car theft, armed robbery, and possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (the court must consider \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant\u201d), his death threat to the teller during the bank robbery, his high-speed car chase in a stolen vehicle after he was found by the police, his perjured testimony that two kidnappers forced him to rob the bank, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1) (the court must consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense [and] to promote respect for the law\u201d), and the advisory guideline range (which called for a prison sentence of between 210 and 240 months), <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4) (the court must consider \u201cthe sentencing range established ... by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Owens has not shown that, given the seriousness of his crime, the breadth of his criminal history, and the advisory guideline range, his 225-month prison sentence was unreasonable. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-29\">. <em>United States v.
