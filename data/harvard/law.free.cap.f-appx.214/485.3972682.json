For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-29\">Guerrero filed her claim for benefits on November 17, 2000, alleging that chronic pain caused by, among other things, psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia prevented her from working. An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) heard evidence, after which he issued his decision that although Guerrero suffered from impairments that caused her pain, she was not disabled within the meaning of the relevant regulations and retained residual function capacity suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>f\u00edcient to work as a secretary. The Social Security Appeals Council rejected Guerrero\u2019s appeal. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, finding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision, and entered judgment for the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Guerrero argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision. Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). In reviewing for substantial evidence, we do not weigh the evidence or resolve conflicts. <em>Masterson v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 267, 272 (5th Cir.2002). To find the absence of substantial evidence we must conclude that there are no credible contrary choices or medical evidence. <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">We find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision. The ALJ concluded that Guerrero retained residual function capacity sufficient to continue work as a secretary. In so concluding, the ALJ rejected Guerrero\u2019s testimony regarding the severity of her pain based on Guerrero\u2019s \u201cmanner while testifying at the hearing, the consistency of her testimony with statements on other occasions in the record, as well as [her] interest, bias, or prejudice considered in light of all the evidence in this case.\u201d We accord an ALJ\u2019s credibility findings substantial deference. <em>James v. Bowen, </em>793 F.2d 702, 706 (5th Cir.1986). With respect to corroboration of Guerrero\u2019s testimony, the ALJ observed that although Guerrero asserted drowsiness and lack of concentration as side effects of her pain medication, Dr. Plata\u2019s May 2, 2002 progress note reflects no side effects of the pain medication and indicates that \u201c[h]er symptoms seem to be well controlled with the pain management at this time.\u201d The ALJ also noted the dearth of evidence in the medical records to support a finding that Guerrero\u2019s impairment was as severe as she alleged. Dr. Plata\u2019s progress notes show a consistent level of pain\u2014self-described by Guerrero as 5 or 6 on a scale of 10\u2014but one that does not rise to the level Guerrero asserted when she testified that she spent most days in bed. The only exception occurred in November 2001 when a progress note observes that after three days without pain medication\u2014 she ran out\u2014Guerrero rated her pain as 10 out of 10. Relying on the assessment of the State Agency\u2019s physician, Dr. Dodd, the ALJ found that Guerrero suffered some functional limitations, but he concluded that Guerrero\u2019s limitations did not rise to the level she claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Having found substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, our inquiry is at an end, and the judgment of the district court is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
