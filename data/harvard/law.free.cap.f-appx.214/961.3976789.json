On appeal, he argues that the government presented hearsay evidence at his revocation hearing, and that the district court erred by failing to engage in the balancing test of <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110 (11th Cir.1994). Belser raises this claim for the first time on appeal\u2014 thus, his argument, in essence, is that the district court should have engaged in the balancing test <em>sua sponte, </em>that is, absent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>any objection by Belser. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Because Belser raises this claim of evidentiary error for the first time on appeal, we review it for plain error only. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1202 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1809, 164 L.Ed.2d 544 (2006); <em>see also United States v. Siddiqui, </em>235 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that, in the absence of a contemporaneous objection below, hearsay claims are reviewed for plain error); <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1334 (11th Cir. 1997) (\u201cAs an evidentiary matter, a contemporaneous objection was required to allow the district court the opportunity to correct any error that may have existed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must show that there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted). On the second prong, an error cannot be plain unless the error is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000). Where neither the U.S. Supreme Court, nor this Court has resolved an issue, that issue cannot be the subject of plain error. <em>Id. </em>The plain error test is \u201cdifficult to meet,\u201d and its purpose is \u201cto enforce the requirement that parties object to errors at trial in a timely manner so as to provide the trial judge an opportunity to avoid or correct any error, and thus avoid the costs of reversal.\u201d <em>United States v. Sorondo, </em>845 F.2d 945, 948-49 (11th Cir.1988) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">We have held that, although the Federal Rules of Evidence are inapplicable to supervised-release revocation hearings, \u201cthe admissibility of hearsay is not automatic.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>26 F.3d at 114. Because defendants in revocation proceedings \u201care entitled to certain minimal due process requirements,\u201d before admitting hearsay testimony, a district court must conduct a balancing inquiry, weighing the defendant\u2019s \u201cright to confront adverse witnesses against the grounds asserted by the government for denying confrontation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Our holding in <em>Frazier </em>was made in the context of hearsay evidence to which the defendant had lodged a contemporaneous objection, and on which both parties submitted briefs on the matter to the district court. Here, by contrast, Belser raised no objection to the testimony in the district court and, therefore, the government did not have the opportunity to assert reasons for denying confrontation. Accordingly, the district court had no reason to engage in a balancing of Belser\u2019s confrontation rights and the government\u2019s proffered reasons for denying confrontation, as contemplated by <em>Frazier. Cf. United States v. Stanfield, </em>360 F.3d 1346, 1359-60 (D.C.Cir.2004) (holding that balancing test is not required where the defend ant fails to object). On this record, the district court\u2019s failure to engage in a <em>sua sponte </em>analysis was not error. Moreover, even if error, such an error would not be plain since neither this Court nor the Supreme Court requires such a <em>sua sponte </em>analysis and, therefore, the error would not be \u201cclear under current law,\u201d as it must to constitute plain error. <em>See Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1321. Belser has not met his burden under either the first prong or the second prong of the plain error test, and, accordingly, he has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>shown plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3-\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-17\">. Given our conclusion on the first two prongs, we need not reach the other prongs of the plain error test. <em>See United States v. King, </em>73 F.3d 1564, 1572 (11th Cir.1996) (\"We need not discuss the entire plain error test because the second prong of the test\u2014that the alleged error be plain\u2014-is not met.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
