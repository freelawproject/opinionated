Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-22\">The act comprising the offense of conviction consisted of a letter mailed by Godsey to Kristi Rose in November 2004 in which Godsey threatened, in chilling terms, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>come to Rose\u2019s home at night with his shotgun and shoot her and anyone else in her home. He told her, \u201cI want you to fear me,\u201d and that his \u201cintentions are cruel and to kill.\u201d J.A. 73 (internal quotation marks omitted). Godsey\u2019s misconduct was hardly limited to his offense of conviction, however. In December 2004, Godsey mailed Mercer County, West Virginia Prosecuting Attorney William J. Sadler a letter in which Godsey stated that he hoped Sadler would die and that he wanted to \u201cbend [Sadler\u2019s wife] over and f* * * her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74 (internal quotation marks omitted). In April 2005, Godsey mailed a letter to United States Probation Office employee Jeanne Buckner in which he stated, \u201cSomeone like you needs to be f* * *ed before they get their brains blow[n] out, raped and murdered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Also in April 2005, Godsey sent Dennis Lee, Special Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia and Prosecuting Attorney for the Commonwealth of Virginia, a letter telling him, \u201cI\u2019m coming after you, and I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75 (internal quotation marks omitted). In other letters to many women with whom Godsey was not acquainted-including many government officials and public servants-Godsey explicitly described sex acts that he wished to engage in with them. Godsey also left several harassing and sexually explicit voice-mails for female United States Probation Office employees (one of whom was Buckner).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">On June 2, 2005, a federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment charging Godsey with mailing threatening letters. Godsey pleaded guilty on October 4, 2005, via a written plea agreement, to Count One of the indictment. Even after pleading guilty, Godsey continued his pattern of misconduct, attempting to make seven collect calls to the Tazewell County, Virginia Prosecutor\u2019s Office and mailing a sexually explicit letter to a woman to whom he had previously sent several other such letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">At sentencing, in calculating Godsey\u2019s guideline range, the district court used a base offense level of 12. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2A6.1(a)(l) (2005). Finding no applicable enhancements or reductions, the district court determined that 12 was also Godsey\u2019s total offense level. This, with Godsey\u2019s Criminal History Category of IV, yielded a guideline range of 21-27 months imprisonment. The district court then departed upward on the basis that this range did not properly account for the seriousness of Godsey\u2019s misconduct since it did not reflect any of Godsey\u2019s communications other than the single letter to Rose. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21, p.s. Thus, considering the factors that the court was required to consider under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), the district court imposed a sentence of 60 months imprisonment, the maximum penalty authorized under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 876(c). The district court did not explicitly indicate whether it departed up to a range that included a 60-month imprisonment term, or rather, whether it departed to some lower range and then imposed a variance sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Godsey contends that his 60-month sentence was unreasonably long. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial is violated when the district court, acting pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone. To remedy this problem, the Court severed and excised the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act, <em>see </em>Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98\u2014473, ch. II, 98 Stat. 1987-2040 (1984) (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3551-3742 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006) and at 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 991-998 (West 1993 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006)), that mandated sentencing and appellate review in conformance with the guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 259, 125 S.Ct. 738 (severing and excising 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2006) and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006)). This excision rendered the guidelines \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, and replaced the previous standard of review with review for reasonableness, <em>see id. </em>at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">This court has previously described the necessary procedure for imposing sentence under the now-advisory sentencing guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">First, the court must correctly determine, after making appropriate findings of fact, the applicable guideline range. Next, the court must determine whether a sentence within that range serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence within statutory limits that does serve those factors. In doing so, the district court should first look to whether a departure is appropriate based on the Guidelines Manual or relevant case law.... If an appropriate basis for departure exists, the district court may depart. If the resulting departure range still does not serve the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), the court may then elect to impose a non-guideline sentence (a \u201cvariance sentence\u201d). The district court must articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the guideline range. The explanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and must be accompanied by findings of fact as necessary. The district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in checklist fashion; it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\"><em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) (citations, internal quotation marks, &amp; alterations omitted). We review a sentence for reasonableness, considering \u201cthe extent to which the sentence ... comports with the various, and sometimes competing, goals of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">Although the numerous other threatening or harassing communications for which the district court found Godsey responsible were not part of the offense of conviction or relevant conduct, the guidelines specifically authorize a departure based on that conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21, p.s. And, the presentence report had not only reported the other misconduct but also observed that \u201cthe Court may consider an upward departure\u201d to account for it. J.A. 85. Indeed, the presentence report estimated that had Godsey been convicted of all three charged counts, his offense level would have been 20, which, when considered with Godsey\u2019s Criminal History Category, would have yielded a guideline range of 51-63 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">In selecting a term of 60 months, the district court explicitly considered the seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ousness of the offense of conviction by noting the \u201caggravated nature\u201d of Godsey\u2019s conduct, including the \u201cdespicable and disgusting\u201d language that he used to ensure that his threats and harassment achieved maximum effect on his victims. <em>Id. </em>at 54, 58. The district court specifically noted that Godsey\u2019s continued pattern of reprehensible conduct, even after pleading guilty, required a sentence necessary to \u201cincapacitatefhim] from further crimes of this nature\u201d and \u201cto deter conduct of this nature\u201d by Godsey and others. <em>Id. </em>at 58. The district court also noted that the length of the sentence would provide Godsey additional time to rehabilitate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Godsey maintains that his 60-month sentence was unreasonable because \u201cthe policy choices of the Sentencing Commission, reinforced by Congress, were that an offense level of 12 [and a corresponding guideline range of 21-27 months imprisonment] adequately represents the seriousness of Godsey\u2019s offense.\u201d Br. of Appellant at 17. This argument plainly fails to recognize, however, that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21 specifically authorizes district courts to depart upward based on dismissed and uncharged conduct not reflected in the applicable guideline range. The analysis employed by the district court here was eminently sound, and the 60-month sentence was reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Godsey also argues that the district court erred in imposing a sentence above the range of 21-27 months without previously providing notice of its intent to do so. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Rule 32 (h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201c[b]efore the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground <em>not identified for departure </em>either <em>in the presentence report </em>or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h) (emphasis added). We have held that Rule 32(h) applies to variances as well as departures. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 371 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Godsey contends that the statement in the presentence report that \u201cthe Court <em>may </em>consider an upward departure in sentencing to consider the seriousness of underlying charges that are dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement that did not enter into the determination of the applicable guideline range\u201d did not satisfy Rule 32(h) because it did not constitute a <em>recommendation </em>that the district court actually depart. J.A. 85 (emphasis added). Godsey\u2019s reasoning is misplaced. The role of the presentence report is not to decide on which bases, if any, the district court <em>should </em>depart, but rather, merely to \u201cidentify any basis for departing.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(d)(1)(E). Fulfilling this role adequately places the defendant on notice of the bases on which the district court may depart. <em>See Burns v. United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 137, 111 S.Ct. 2182, 115 L.Ed.2d 123 (1991) (explaining that the purpose of Rule 32 is \u201cpromoting focused, adversarial resolution of the legal and factual issues relevant to fixing Guidelines sentences\u201d). No further notice is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">In sum, for the foregoing reasons, Godsey\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-5\"> We note that, at the time of Godsey\u2019s sentencing hearing, although <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), had already been decided, the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006), which would have made the proper procedure clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
