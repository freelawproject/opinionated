We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">On December 21, 2002, Parker was a felon, having been convicted of armed robbery in 1992. Nevertheless, that day he acquired a rifle at a pawn shop in Goldsboro, North Carolina, by having another man, Travis James, purchase the weapon for him and represent in the necessary paperwork that James was the actual buyer of the weapon. Later, in February 2003, Parker and James made a similar purchase of a 12-gauge shotgun at a Goldsboro pawn shop, with James again representing in the required paperwork that he was buying the weapon for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">Parker was subsequently charged in a three-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to make false statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm and two counts of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (West 2000). The indictment alleged that Parker conspired with a man named Roderick R. Warren and with \u201cothers both known and unknown to the grand jury.\u201d J.A. 12. Following a jury trial, Parker was found guilty of the conspiracy charge but not guilty of the two remaining counts. The district court imposed a sentence of 60 months imprisonment, the statutory maximum punishment for his offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">Parker first maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the SKS firearm, or alternatively, to prevent the Government from referring to the fact that the weapon was recovered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at a prior residence of Parker\u2019s. Parker contends that suppression was required because he was not timely notified that the Government had obtained the firearm, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 16, and because its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger that it would cause him unfair prejudice, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">The Government explained to the district court that it had maintained an open-file policy, that it intended to offer Parker the opportunity to inspect the weapon, and that it had notified Parker immediately upon acquiring the weapon. Nevertheless, the district court informed Parker that it would accommodate a request to reschedule Parker\u2019s trial date so that he could conduct additional investigation concerning the firearm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>dling of Parker\u2019s motion was well within the discretion of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The ruling of the district court that the evidence was not excludable under Rule 403 was also well supported. The testimony that a weapon purchased for Parker was recovered from a city where Parker had resided previously tended to prove that he possessed the weapon and then disposed of it. To the extent that admission of the evidence damaged Parker\u2019s case, it was due only to its legitimate probative value, not to any unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Parker also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for acquittal on the conspiracy charge because the indictment alleged a conspiracy between Warren, Parker, and other unindicted coconspirators, but the evidence established that Warren was not part of any conspiracy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Parker concedes that the Government was not required to show that each of the people named in the indictment as members of the conspiracy was actually a member of the conspiracy in order to prove that a conspiracy existed. And, Parker does not contend that the evidence was insufficient to prove such a conspiracy. He nevertheless maintains that the absence of proof that all of the people named in the indictment were members of the conspiracy was insufficient \u201cto support the indictment as charged.\u201d Reply Br. of Appellant Reginald Parker at 5. Although he does not describe it as such, it appears that Parker\u2019s claim is that there was an unconstitutional variance from his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">A \u201cvariance\u201d occurs when the evidence presented at trial differs materially from the facts alleged in the indictment. <em>See United States v. Kennedy, </em>32 F.3d 876, 883 (4th Cir.1994). However, a variance is not grounds for reversal \u201cunless it prejudices the defendant either by surprising him at trial and hindering the preparation of his defense, or by exposing him to the danger of a second prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 203 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">Here, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that a variance occurred, it certainly was not grounds for reversal. The specificity with which the indictment described the alleged conspiracy was easily sufficient to put Parker on notice of the conspiracy sought to be charged and to protect him from possibly being prosecuted a second time for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Parker next contends that the district court erred in allowing the Government to cross-examine him regarding the large number of firearms he had been involved with storing at his uncle\u2019s house in relation to the armed robbery that served as his predicate felony conviction for the felon-in-possession charges. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">Parker and the Government stipulated to the existence and nature of the prior felony conviction for Parker\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) charges, and they now agree that, in light of the stipulation, further evidence regarding the conviction would not have been admissible to prove the prior-conviction element of that offense. The Government nevertheless asserts that Parker\u2019s trial testimony made the Government\u2019s questioning relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">The Government\u2019s position stems from Parker\u2019s testimony on cross-examination contradicting the testimony of at least one Government witness that Parker had asked for a 30-round clip to go with the firearm purchased on December 21, 2002. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>After denying that he had asked for the clip, Parker added, \u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from, because I don\u2019t know anything about a clip. I wouldn\u2019t even know how it goes into that gun that\u2019s sitting on that floor. If you gave it, I wouldn\u2019t know how it fit in there.\u201d J.A. 376. Parker denied ever \u201chandling a big weapon like that.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He then testified that he had handled \u201c[m]aybe two\u201d firearms in his life. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">In light of this testimony, the Government sought to question Parker regarding his handling of more than 70 firearms he had helped steal during the armed robbery that was the predicate felony for his \u00a7 922(g) charges. Over Parker\u2019s objection, the district court ruled that \u201cthe government may question the defendant about whether or not he handled guns with regard to his prior conviction,\u201d and specified that \u201cthis line of inquiry may make reference to a particular number of guns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. The Government subsequently asked Parker whether it was true \u201cthat at one time [he had been] involved with ... taking to and storing at [his] uncle\u2019s house 69 handguns, three rifles and two shotguns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 497. Parker admitted that he had, then he added that \u201c[t]hat was the charge that I admitted to with the armed robbery.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The district court was within its discretion in allowing the questioning. Once Parker testified that he had handled only two firearms in his life, had never handled a large firearm, and thus would not know anything about the clip that at least one government witness claimed that Parker asked for, the testimony about Parker\u2019s involvement with the tens of firearms became relevant \u201cto contradict [the] specific statements\u201d that Parker had made and therefore prevent Parker from undermining the credibility of the government witnesses who testified that Parker asked for the clip. <em>See United States v. Leavis, </em>853 F.2d 215, 220 (4th Cir.1988). The Government was therefore \u201centitled ... to rebut the false impression [Parker] was creating by his testimony.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Parker also argues that the probative value of the testimony was substantially outweighed by its potential to cause him unfair prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403. That was not the case, however. We have already explained the probative value of the evidence. While it did have the potential to damage Parker\u2019s case, there was nothing unfair about this potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Parker next argues that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding entrapment. He maintains that evidence presented to the jury tended to show that he involved himself with the charged conspiracy and firearm transactions in an attempt to implicate those individuals with whom he dealt and thereby obtain leniency for his friend\u2014and now wife\u2014Christina Ellis, who was facing criminal charges of her own. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">A defendant \u201cis entitled to an entrapment instruction whenever there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find entrapment.\u201d <em>Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 62, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988). \u201c[A] valid entrapment defense has two related elements: government inducement of the crime, and a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 108 S.Ct. 883. \u201c \u2018Inducement\u2019 ... involves elements of governmental overreaching and conduct sufficiently excessive to implant a criminal design in the mind of an otherwise innocent party.\u201d <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>3 F.3d 775, 778 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Here, Parker failed to present evidence that government agents induced him to engage in the charged conspiracy. The district court thus correctly refused to instruct the jury regarding entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Parker finally contends that the district court erred in counting a 1988 aggravated assault conviction as three criminal history points in calculating his advisory guideline range, thereby placing him in Criminal History Category IV rather than III. Even assuming that the district court erred, however, the error was harmless because the change from Category IV to III would not have reduced Parker\u2019s guideline range; either way it would have been 60 months, the statutory maximum for the offense of conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371; <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(a) (2004) (\u201cWhere the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In sum, for the foregoing reasons, Parker\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\">. Parker did not request a continuance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-11\">. But for the existence of the statutory maximum, the guideline range calculated as Parker suggests would have been 63-78 months as opposed to 77-96 months if the aggravated assault conviction counted for three points.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
