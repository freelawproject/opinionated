(\u201cBannum\u201d), challenges the Bureau of Prison (the \u201cBureau\u201d)\u2019s award of three contracts for the construction and operation of Community Corrections Centers, which are designed to help prisoners who have served their sentences in readjusting to civilian life. The Court of Federal Claims denied the challenge, ruling that Bannum had failed to show that the Bureau\u2019s violation of a procurement regulation prejudiced it. <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>69 Fed.Cl. 311 (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">This case returns to this court following a remand to the Court of Federal Claims, <em>see Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>126 Fed.Appx. 958 (Fed.Cir.2005), for that court to conduct further proceedings consistent with our decision in <em>Bannum, Inc. v. United States, </em>404 F.3d 1346 (Fed.Cir. 2005). In the latter opinion, which involved Bannum\u2019s non-selection for another contract covering a different Community Corrections Center, we held that the Bureau\u2019s review of Bannum\u2019s responses to criticisms of its performance in operating a number of other Community Corrections Centers, violated the governing regulation (FAR \u00a7 42.1503(b)), because it was made by persons not authorized to perform that function. <em>Id. </em>at 1351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">On remand, the Court of Federal Claims ruled that the Bureau\u2019s failure to comply with FAR \u00a7 42.1503(b) had not prejudiced Bannum because Bannum had not shown that if the authorized officials had reviewed its submissions, the result actually or probably would have been the award of the contracts to Bannum. <em>Bannum, </em>69 Fed.Cl. at 317-18. As in the prior case, Bannum\u2019s challenge to the procurement \u201crests on mere numerical possibility, not evidence.\u201d <em>Bannum, </em>404 F.3d at 1358. The Court of Federal Claims did not err in ruling that Bannum failed to establish it was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Bannum\u2019s complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
