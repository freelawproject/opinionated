Jones, Jr. appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty-plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Jones argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for possessing the firearm in connection with the felony offense of cocaine possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Jones first asserts that the district court clearly erred in finding that he possessed cocaine. Based on the record as a whole, the district court\u2019s finding that Jones possessed cocaine was plausible and therefore not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1199 (5th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Jones also argues that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) is inapplicable to his case because his firearm possession did not occur in connection with the cocaine possession. The district court did not err in its application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) to Jones\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1199-1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
