We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and uphold credibility determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding and the ruling that Fomboh failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution as necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Fomboh cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Fomboh also alleges that the Board erred in denying her protection under the Convention Against Torture. To qualify for this protection, a petitioner bears the burden of proof of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2006). Fomboh failed to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Accordingly, we deny Fomboh\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
