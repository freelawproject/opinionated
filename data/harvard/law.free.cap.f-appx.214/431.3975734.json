Williams appeals the sentence that he received after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Williams argues that the district court erred when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because he would not be convicted for \u201canother felony offense\u201d in light of Louisiana jurisprudence applying La.Rev.Stat. 14:27. Williams\u2019s argument is unavailing. Commentary to the Guideline explicitly states that a conviction need not be obtained for the Guideline to apply. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), comment, (n. 4). Moreover, the offense conduct as set forth in the Presentence Report supports the district court\u2019s determination that Williams possessed a firearm and ammunition in connection with another felony offense. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 560, 584 (5th Cir.2006). Williams\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence, which was within the applicable guidelines range of imprisonment, is likewise unavailing. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
