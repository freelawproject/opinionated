Jalea pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 846. On appeal, Jalea argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a minor-role adjustment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jalea states his role was minor since he merely acted as a broker by trying to find a buyer for the cocaine, which he never succeeded in doing. Additionally, Jalea was not involved in the initial phase of the conspiracy, where the drugs were transported into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">\u201cThis Court has long and repeatedly held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The proponent of the downward adjustment always bears the burden of proving the mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. In determining the defendant\u2019s role, the decision falls within the sound discretion of the district court: \u201ca trial court\u2019s choice between \u2018two permissible views of the evidence\u2019 is the very essence of the clear error standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). In determining whether a mitigating-role reduction is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines: first, the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing, and, second, [his] role as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In looking to relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Under the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, we conclude from the record that the district court correctly compared Jalca\u2019s conduct, his involvement in trying to find a buyer for and testing the 99.4 kilograms of cocaine, with the conduct for which he was sentenced, conspiracy with intent to distribute 99.4 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Under the second prong of the analysis, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-10\">He was a willing and knowing conspirator. His role might have been slightly different than others in the sense that he didn\u2019t have a proprietary interest in the cocaine, but nonetheless, he stood to gain a substantial amount of money for his participation in the role as broker/negotiator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>Jalea discussed prices for the cocaine with the undercover agents, brought a potential buyer to the warehouse where the cocaine was located, and inspected and tested the cocaine. At the sentencing hearing, Jalca\u2019s attorney admitted that Jalea would have received $1,000 per kilogram of cocaine for finding a buyer. Jalca\u2019s potential fee was approximately $99,000, while the actual sales price for the cocaine was $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Since the district court\u2019s findings are supported by the record, and the court properly applied the analysis established by <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>Jalea has failed to meet his burden, and the district court did not clearly err in denying Jalea a minor-role reduction. Accordingly, we affirm Jalea\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. In the Standard of Review portion of his brief, Jalea mentions that this court should review his sentence for reasonableness under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In his Summary of the Argument, Jalea states the district court ignored 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because a sentence less than 188 months would have been sufficient due to his role as a broker in the transaction. Jalea did not develop these arguments any further, and the government did not address any of these arguments in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">\u201cWe may decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue in its initial or reply brief. Without such argument the issue is deemed waived.\u201d <em>United States v. Gupta, </em>463 F.3d 1182, 1195 (11th Cir.2006). Since Jalea did not substantively address his arguments that his sentence was not reasonable and that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), his arguments are deemed waived and will not be addressed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
