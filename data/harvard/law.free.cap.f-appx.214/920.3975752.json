Gray raises only one point on appeal\u2014that the district court erred by failing to apply a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The government argues that we should dismiss this appeal because, in his written plea agreement, Gray waived his right to appeal his sentence unless he was sentenced above the guideline range. Gray does not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-26\">We review the waiver of the right to appeal <em>de novo. United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446 (11th Cir. 1997). Appeal waivers are valid if they are made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993). For an appeal waiver to be enforced, the government must show that either: (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the appeal waiver during the plea hearing, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 1351. In this case, the district court, in accepting Gray\u2019s guilty plea, asked him only briefly about the waiver, but did so in the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing and Gray also waived his right to appeal in his written plea agreement. We are satisfied from the totality of this record that Gray\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Moreover, we note that even if we were to disregard the waiver, the district court\u2019s determination that Grey was not entitled to a downward adjustment must be affirmed on the merits. A district court\u2019s assessment of a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is entitled to great deference, and we review it only for clear error. <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1022 (11th Cir.2005). Although \u201centry of a plea of guilty will constitute significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, this evidence may be outweighed by conduct ... that is inconsistent with acceptance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3). For example, we have held that continued drug use following indictment supported the denial of acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1250 (11th Cir.1999). Here, Grey\u2019s post-indictment conduct, including the use of cocaine-laced marijuana, adequately supports the district court\u2019s denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
