On that day the plaintiffs and the defendant, a public service corporation, entered into a contract, wherein and whereby the plaintiffs conveyed certain of its land to the defendant for a right of way for its railroad; and the defendant, as a part of the consideration for the conveyance of the land, agreed to do and refrain from doing certain acts. The part of the instrument material to the questions here presented is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">\u201cWitnesseth: That first parties for the consideration of the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) to them in hand paid by the second party, and for the other considerations hereinafter mentioned, which considerations are to be considered as conditions subsequent, do hereby grant, sell, convey, confirm and quitclaim unto second party, its successors and assigns, the following described real estate, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">\u201cTo have and to hold, unto the said second party, its successors and assigns forever upon the considerations and subject to the limitations hereinafter provided, which conditions and limitations are to be construed as conditions subsequent, and upon failure of second party, its successors and assigns, to strictly perform the same, this deed and the rights conveyed hereby, are subject to revocation and forfeiture by first parties, their heirs or assigns. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">\u201cSecond party agrees to construct and maintain the necessai\u2019y crossing where its line intersects the logging railroad of first parties, said crossing to be an under-crossing and to be built in accordance with the plans submitted by second party to first parties according to a blue print this day furnished, which has been marked \u2018Exhibit B,\u2019 and said crossing is to be maintained by second party, its successors and assigns, and second party, for itself, its successors and assigns, assumes the responsibility in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>maintenance and operation of said crossing and to furnish water barrels upon said crossing to safe-guard the same from fire. Where the lines of the first parties and of the second party intersect, it is agreed by second party that it shall and it does hereby allow first' parties, their heirs and assigns, to maintain and operate their logging road as the same is now located, maintained and operated, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-3\">\u201cIt is further agreed that, Avhereas first parties are engaged in extensive logging operations, the extent of Avhich is Avell knoAvn to.second party, and any delay or interference Avith said logging operations or with the railroad or first parties\u2019 use in connection therewith, would cause great damage and loss of profits to first parties, Avhich damage and loss of profits would be difficult of ascertainment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">\u201cNoav, therefore, second party agrees not to interfere Avith the use by first parties of their logging railroad in such manner that first parties cannot haul logs over said railroad to the Chehalis river, but if such interference occurs, the second party hereby agrees to pay to first parties therefor the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day for each day of such interference and a proportionate part thereof for any part of a day of such interference, and said sum is hereby agreed upon as liquidated damages and not as a forfeiture or penalty, and it is agreed between the parties hereto that by such interference first parties would actually suffer loss in the amount aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The defendant entered into the possession of the land conveyed, and constructed its railroad and an overhead crossing for the logging road at the point of intersection of the two roads. On April 12, 1910, the crossing in part collapsed, so that for a period of four days the logging road could not be operated. A few days later the plaintiffs commenced this action for the purpose of recovering the sum of $4,000, Avhich they claimed under the liquidated damage clause of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The defendant admits the making of the contract, admits that it constructed its road and the crossing for the logging road at the point of intersection of the two roads, and admits that the crossing fell, so that the logging road could not be operated for the period alleged. It alleges affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tively, that it constructed the crossing according to the blue print referred to in the contract; that the work was done in a careful and substantial manner; that the damages agreed upon were unreasonable and unlawful; and that the damages did not exceed fifty dollars per day. This was put in issue by the reply. The plaintiffs offered evidence tending to show that the crossing was negligently constructed, but before resting their case this testimony was withdrawn. After the plaintiffs rested, the defendant offered to prove the facts embraced in its affirmative pleading, and that the damages could be ascertained. The offer was denied, and a judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiffs for $4,000, being at the rate of $1,000 per day for the four days\u2019 suspension of the logging road.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The discussion has taken a somewhat wide range upon the part of the appellant. It argues that it is not liable under the contract for a suspension of the logging operations caused by the act of God or of the public enemy. That question is not presented by the record. Again, the appellant says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">\u201cThe cause of the interruption in the operation of the logging railroad was an earth slide on the upper part of the crossing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We have not found such evidence in the record. It is true that one of the respondents\u2019 witnesses testified that the collapse of the crossing was caused \u201cby a slide or the piling giving way;\u201d and another testified that it was caused \u201cfrom lack of penetration of the piling.\u201d Later, however, this testimony was withdrawn. We express no opinion upon the competency or materiality of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The contract, however, has been breached by the appellant. It is clear from reading it as an entirety that the appellant could not relieve itself from liability by constructing the crossing according to the blue print, for the contract expressly provides \u201cthat said crossing is to be maintained by second party [the appellant] its successors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>assigns; and second party for itself, its successors and assigns, assumes the responsibility in connection with the maintenance and operation of such crossing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">Passing to the pivotal point in the case, we cannot think that the respondents are entitled to recover under the liquidated damage clause upon the facts stated. The showing made is, that the appellant constructed the crossing; that it fell, and that the respondents\u2019 logging operations were suspended for four days. The cause of the fall of the crossing is not shown. A reference to the habendum clause of the deed discloses that the conditions and limitations in the instrument are to be treated as conditions subsequent, and that upon the failure of the appellant to strictly perform them, the \u201cdeed and the rights conveyed are subject to revocation and forfeiture.\u201d Again, near the end of the contract, it is provided that the \u201cagreements to be performed\u201d by the appellant are a part of the consideration for the instrument, \u201cand arc material considerations therefor,\u201d and that upon the failure of the appellant to strictly comply with the terms \u201cof this instrument,\u201d the deed, at the option of the respondents, \u201cis subject to revocation and forfeiture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Further analyzing the instrument, we find that the appellant agreed to \u201cconstruct and maintain\u201d the necessary crossing at the point of intersection of the roads, and that it \u201cassumes the responsibility in connection with the maintenance and operation of said crossing.\u201d There is no provision, however, to the effect that, if it fails to maintain the crossing and the logging operation is suspended thereby, the liquidated damage clause shall apply. In the clause which immediately precedes the damage clause it is agreed that the respondents are engaged in extensive logging operations, and that any \u201cdelay\u201d, or interference with such logging operations or with the railroad or first parties\u2019 \u201cuse in connection therewith,\u201d would cause the latter great damages and loss of profits, and that the damages and loss of profits would be difficult of ascertainment. In the damage clause following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>this language, the word \u201cdelay\u201d is omitted, and the appellant agrees \u201cnot to interfere\u201d with the respondents\u2019 use of the road in such manner that they cannot haul logs over the same, and agrees that, \u201cif such interference occurs,\u201d the appellant will pay to them the sum of $1,000 per day for each day of \u201csuch interference, and a proportionate part thereof for any part of a day of such interference\u201d as liquidated damages, and that the respondents would actually suffer to that extent \u201cby such interference.\u201d ' To recapitulate, it appears that, for certain breaches of the contract upon the part of the appellant, the deed is subject to revocation and forfeiture at the option of the respondents. This provision, as we have seen, is twice inserted. Whether the stipulation is enforceable against a public service corporation when the land conveyed has become a part of its line of road, is not before us. Again, as we have pointed out, the appellant agreed to construct and maintain the necessary crossings, and to emphasize this obligation upon its part it \u201cassumes the responsibility in connection with the maintenance and operation of such crossing.\u201d It would seem that, if it had been intended that the damage clause should apply if the operation of the respondents\u2019 road was suspended by a breach of any one of the obligations assumed by or imposed upon the appellant, such intention would have been clearly expressed, and not left to be gathered from words of doubtful meaning. The damage clause is a drastic one, and it will not be extended by construction to embrace matters not clearly within its terms. We need not speculate as to what delinquencies it may cover. It suffices to say that it is not applicable to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Upon the evidence, the respondents were entitled to a judgment for nominal damages for the failure of the appellant to maintain the crossing. In addition to nominal damages, they may, upon proper proof, recover their actual damages; and if they can show that the crossing fell through the \u201cinterference\u201d on the part of the appellant, they can re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>cover the liquidated damages. The word \u201cinterference\u201d here used evidently has reference to some affirmative or physical act upon the part of the appellant. It is clear that the parties intended to stipulate for liquidated damages and not for a penalty. <em>Madler v. Silverstone, 55 </em>Wash. 159, 104 Pac. 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">The judgment is reversed, with directions to grant a new trial, and to permit the parties to recast their pleadings if they desire.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Mount and Parker, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b77-5\">Dunbar, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABd\">(dissenting) \u2014 It is inconceivable to me that that portion of the contract providing for stipulated damages was made with reference to any affirmative action on the part of the railway company, or that it ever entered into the mind of either party to the contract that the railway company would do so unusual a thing as to purposely break down or blow up the structure which was the subject of the contract and which it had so firmly bound itself to maintain. The majority seem to think that, because the deed was revocable for certain breaches of the contract, and because this provision was twice inserted and the provision in relation to liquidated damages was inserted but once, the first provision in some measure weakens the force and changes the otherwise obvious construction of the latter clause. I think there is nothing whatever inconsistent between the two provisions, and that the obligation to maintain, instead of being inconsistent, is a basis for the contract for liquidated damages. It can readily be seen that the main solicitude on the part of respondents was to be protected against an interference in any way with their logging operations. And according to the contract, if it appeared that the railway company was not taking the precautionary measures provided for, and danger to the operation of the logging business was threatened, it was within the power of the respondents to avert that threatened danger by revocation. That was only one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>rights they had under the contract. But it was not their bounden duty to keep a surveillance over the railway company in this regard. They had the right of revocation, but they had the further right to compensation in case the bridge was not safely maintained and injury resulted. It seems to me that the plain provisions of the liquidated damage contract have been destroyed by a strained construction of the first provisions of the contract. I therefore dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
