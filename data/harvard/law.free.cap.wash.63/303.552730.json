Darwin, did make said libelous publication, and cause and procure same to be made thus unlawfully, wilfully and maliciously, knowing that the same would tend to expose the complainant to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy, and knowing the same would tend to injure the complainant in his business and occupation; and the said defendant did thereby intend to expose the said T. S. Hamilton to public hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy, and to injure the said T. S. Hamilton in his business and occupation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Respondent was convicted on this complaint before the justice of the peace, and appealed to the superior court, where the demurrer was sustained. Appellant\u2019s only assignment is that the trial judge erred in sustaining the demurrer and discharging respondent. The prosecution is based upon Rem. &amp; Bal. Code, \u00a7 2424, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201cEvery malicious publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, sign or otherwise than by mere speech, which shall tend:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201c(1) To expose any living person to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, or to deprive him of the benefit of public confidence or social intercourse; or . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201c(3) To injure any person, corporation or association of persons in his or their business or occupation, shall be a libel. . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Appellant contends the publication tended to expose the complainant to hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy; that it was malicious, was made without justification or excuse; that it tended to injure complainant in his business; that criminal libel is charged in the language of the statute, and that the complaint is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>While no reasonable excuse appears for making the publication, and the motive that actuated it may not have been commendable, and although it may have annoyed the complainant, yet, from the facts pleaded, we do not conclude that it amounted to a criminal libel. Although no dates of sales were mentioned in the publication, it is nevertheless conceded the sales were actually made by Hamilton in the due course of his business. There is no question but that they were conditional sales, and that for his own protection he filed memoranda thereof, with the county auditor, under the authority of Rem. &amp; Bal. Code, \u00a7 3670 <em>et seq. </em>Publication at any time thereafter of the fact that he had made such filings would not tend to expose him to hatred, contempt, ridicule, and obloquy; nor are we able to understand how it would tend to injure him in his usual business which he was conducting in the manner stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">If there was any circumstance, such as the nature, value or quantity of the merchandise sold, which could by any possibility be consti\u2019ued as tending to reflect upon the vendor, and subject him to contempt and ridicule, that fact must have been known to him when he made the conditional sales and filed their memoranda with the county auditor. There is no intimation that his business methods or the making of such sales were not legitimate or honorable. The complaint alleged the publication was made long after the dates of the respective sales and after payment of the purchase price. Of this fact the vendor Hamilton cannot complain. It could in no manner injure him in his credit or business standing. If it could, his methods which he himself adopted, must have been at fault. The only possible persons, if any, whose credit or financial standing could have been affected by so late a publication, were the vendees, who had then made full payment, but the respondent is not charged with having libeled them.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Although the complaint follows the language of the statute in making its charges, the statements upon which appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>relies are simply conclusions of the pleader deduced from the facts alleged. It is for the court to determine whether the facts pleaded sustain such conclusions. Conceding the publication to have been unwarranted and at the same time irritating and annoying to Hamilton, yet it only states facts taken from public records, the truth of which is not questioned. The alleged publication contains no words libelous <em>per se. </em>Appellant insists that extrinsic circumstances have been pleaded as inducement and innuendo, which, coupled with the language published, are sufficient to show that the publication tended to produce, and did produce, the results which the statute is intended to prohibit. In support of this contention appellant cites, with others, the following authorities: <em>Denney v. Northwestern Credit Ass\u2019n, 55 </em>Wash. 331, 104 Pac. 769, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1021; <em>State v. Elliott, </em>10 Kan. App. 69, 61 Pac. 981; <em>State v. O\u2019Hagan, </em>78 N. J. L. 209, 68 Atl. 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">An examination of these cases will disclose that, if pertinent at all, they tend to show the insufficiency of this complaint. <em>Denney v. Northwestern Credit Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>was a civil action for damages predicated on an alleged libel. We there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cIn all charges of this kind, it is the duty of the court to regard the words spoken or written as might a stranger to the parties, and if they be in themselves, and without the aid of innuendo, otherwise innocent, and if they do not in themselves, and without the aid of the special knowledge possessed by the parties concerned, imply malice, or hold the party out to public contempt or ridicule, or make any charge involving moral turpitude, or touch him in his business, or subject him to an infamous punishment, it is the general rule that they are not libelous <em>per se. </em>If the words do not come within this rule,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201c \u2018It is necessary that the declaration should set forth precisely in what way the damage resulted from the speaking of the words. It is not sufficient to allege generally that the plaintiff has suffered special damages, or that the party has been put to great costs and expenses. . . . By special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>damage in such a case is meant pecuniary loss.\u2019 <em>Pollard v. Lyon, </em>91 U. S. 223, 237, 23 L. Ed. 308.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u201cSee, also, 5 Ency. Plead. &amp; Prac., 766; 25 Cyc. 455; <em>Dunn v. Maier, </em>82 Fed. 169; <em>Bradstreet Co. v. Oswald, </em>96 Ga. 396, 23 S. E. 423; <em>Newbold v. Bradstreet &amp; Son, </em>57 Md. 38, 40 Am. Rep. 426.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Appellant concedes the publication here involved is not libelous <em>per se. </em>We find no allegations sufficient to show that Hamilton was actually damaged or injured, personally or in his business. The complaint only states the pleader\u2019s conclusions to that effect. Hamilton first published the matter set forth in the complaint when he filed the' memoranda of the conditional sale contracts, and caused them to become public records, the publication of which is privileged. An information will not lie for publishing words charging a person with having done that which he may legally and properly do. It is conceded the conditional sales memoranda were legally and properly filed. The publication was truthful. The demurrer only admitted facts alleged and not the pleader\u2019s conclusions. The latter must be ignored in passing upon the sufficiency of the complaint. Thus considering the complaint, we conclude it does not state facts sufficient to charge criminal libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Dunbar, C. J., Morris, and Chadwick, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
