N. Shanafelt </em>was appointed examiner to take testimony upon the facts in dispute and to make report thereof to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-5\">On November 2, 1885, the examiner\u2019s report being filed, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. O. B. </em>Dickinson, as master, who on February 1, 1886, filed his report, which in part was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-6\">It is essential to a satisfactory view of the evidence to first clearly understand the points of dispute to which it was intended to apply.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">The company complainant owns and operates a line of railroad extending through the respondent city with roadbed and appurtenances complete, and occupies within the limits of said city, substantially, if not precisely, the same site, and maintains the same grade as were occupied and maintained before the city of Chester had advanced to the dignity of a city or even of a borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">The locality of the dispute between the parties is where Pennell street running north and south crosses the tracks of the complainant. The grade of the railroad as established; the natural grade of the land, and the official grade of the street as originally established, would all call for a grade crossing at this point. The point, though on the line of the P., W. &amp; B. Railroad, is within a few feet of the junction of its tracks with the tracks of the Chester Creek R. Company, a line controlled and operated by the complainants. The point is known as Lamokin Junction, and immediately south or southwest of it are situate Lamokin station and the round-house and car shops of the Chester-Creek Road. Almost in conjunction with the railroad buildings, but on opposite sides of the P., W. and B. Railroad tracks, two extensive establishments engaged in the manufacture of steel castings and railroad and other appliance have been erected and are now conducting their works. This point is also made the southern terminus of what may be termed, for the sake of description, a railroad line from Philadelphia to Chester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\">All trains of the Chester Creek Road starting .from Lamokin are required to run past Pennell street, in order to get back to Lamokin station on the main tracks of the P., W. and B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>All these circumstances in the opinion of the managers of the railroad necessitated more frequent shifting of trains and a heavier amount of railroad travel at the place in question than on the general line of the road, and required special provisions for an overhead crossing for the protection of the traveling public both over the highway of the city and of the complainant. These are some of the reasons which supplied the motive on the part of the complainants to originally enter into the agreement now in dispute, and which influence them in upholding its binding character.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\">The contrivance which was devised and accepted to meet the necessity of the situation as above understood to be, was an overhead bridge spanning the roadbed of the complainants at the hight of twenty feet one inch from rail to top of the floor of the bridge. On the other hand, the approaches to the bridge on the south side are so abrupt and so illy protected, and the bridge itself so much above the general level of the street of which it forms a part, that the residents of the locality deem it difficult and dangerous of access and as marring the appearance of the street. The location of the manufacturing establishments, railroad station and buildings above-mentioned, has practically closed the avenues of outlet on the west of Pennell street nearly if not quite to the western limits of the city, and in the wisdom of the city council the opening of the streets east of Pennell has been thought unadvisable if not indeed unfeasible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The locality both on the north aud south of the railroad has within the last few years rapidly increased in population, and now a population of several thousand in the heart of a populous city finds itself divided and separated by an impassable barrier of railroads, with absolutely no other means of communication, except Pennell street, from Kerlin street on the east to Lamokin street on the west, a distance of more than half a mile.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">At the time of the making of the disputed agreement Pennell street was unopened, and that portion of the city unbuilt, so that very little popular interest was excited in the question. Now, the locality is a well built part of the city, and as the improvements, which have since been erected, have been adapted to the original grade of the street and the change as made in pursuance of the agreement has been practically ig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>nored, there is a vigorous popular feeling against the bridge being maintained as it is.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">The plan returned with the report of the examiner more accurately describes the bridge and its approaches than any words of the master could do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">From the testimony and evidence in the cause, and the admissions of the counsel of the parties, the master finds in addition to the general facts above mentioned, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">1. The averments of .the complainants in the third clause of the agreement upon which the clause proceeds are, in the opinion of the master, supported by the evidence and therefore found to be true. The expenditure of money by them on account of the arrangement therein referred to, was at least the sum of $6,525.41, not including a subscription of five hundred dollars toward the grading of Seventh street. The latter for anything which appears before the master would seem to have been a gratuity, as it cannot be found in the agreement between the parties as forming part of the consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">2. The counsel for respondent have requested the master to consider the averment in the fourth paragraph o'f the agreement for this case, to be an admitted element of fact therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-9\">3. The master further finds as a fact, for whatever it may be worth as an element in the case, that the present condition of the southern approach to the present bridge crossing is such as to render public travel in vehicles over the same to be inconvenient, difficult and dangerous, and that it seriously detracts from the value of the street as a public highway : also, that a street admitting of easy, safe and comfortable passage at or near the present location of Pennell street is now a necessary convenience to the residents of the city and the traveling public, as it affords practically the only means of access and communication between the northern and southern portions of the South ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-10\">4. The master is also obliged by the evidence before him to find that these elements of danger and obstruction to travel result either from the manner in which the city has performed its part of the agreement between the parties, or from the natural difficulties of its undertaking, and that the complainant, as is conceded, has faithfully and diligently observed all its covenants and properly done the work marked out for it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>with the single exception of leaving cracks and fissures in the floor of the bridge, permitting the passage of vaporous steam emitted by engines passing under it. This is, of course, a matter of easy remedy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">o. The approaches to the bridge could, at small expense, be so guarded and protected as to eliminate many of the present elements of danger, and relegate the question of the relative merits in this respect of a grade and overhead crossing at this point to the abstract question of their respective merits under the best conditions.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">8. The bridge over the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad tracks which now forms part of the roadbed of Pennell street, is at the grade established by the ordinance of May 19, 1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">Many of the above facts have been found by the master because testified to by the witnesses and discussed by counsel. They are conceded to have not a very strong bearing upon the substantial legal merits of the controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">The legal conclusions to which the master has arrived have been reached from a consideration of but few questions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">The due execution and delivery of the paper, upon the legal character and effect of which depends the respective rights of the parties to this suit, is admitted by the agreement for this action. That the party complainant has fully paid the consideration, the master finds is a fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-10\">It is contended on behalf of the complainant that a fair construction of the instrument and of the preliminary and ratifying ordinances to which it refers, and with which it is accompanied, would make it evident that the intentions and meaning of the parties were, that Pennell street be opened to public use and travel, and that the grade thereof, on either side of the right of way of the complainant, be thereafter maintained at the grade which by said paper and ordinances was \u201c established and fixed.\u201d It was further urged that it must be evident to all unprejudiced minds that the purpose sought to be accomplished and the object which all the parties had in view, was the establishment and maintenance of an overhead crossing at this point; that whatever opinions may be entertained of the legal effect of this paper, the consideration moving from the railroad company and the contemporary acts, and construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>given to it by tbe parties, preclude all right as to what was meant; that the complainants moreover have, by the exercise of unquestioned good faith on their part, entitled themselves to the right to seek to uphold in all its integrity a bargain fully understood and fairly entered into. On the other hand, as they were dealing not with the public, the real party in interest, but with persons who were known- to act only in a representative capacity, they assumed the risk of the authority of the agent to bind the principal; and the legal and moral right of the principal, who feels he was worsted in the bargain, to test the powers 'of the agent, must likewise be conceded. This brings us to a consideration of what is really the only question in the case, the binding character in law of the agreement of the parties as gathered from the ordinance of May 19, 1874, and August 17,1884, and the instrument of July 7,1874.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">Under the foregoing findings of fact, the master, discussing Goszler v. Georgetown, 6 Wheat. 593; \u00a7 3, act of April 2,1867, P. L. 678; \u00a7 6, act of March 25, 1873, P. L. 376 ; act of June 9, 1874, P. L. 282; act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360; and \u00a7 12, act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 62, held that the validity of the. contract must depend, if upon anything, upon the act of March 25, 1873; that while a municipality has no power to make a contract which would control or embarrass its legislative powers over its streets, or prevent its regulation of their use by all persons: Presbyterian Church v. New York, 5 Cow. 538; State v. Stuyvesant, 7 Cow. 588; Pullman v. Mayor of New York, 34 Barb. 169; N. Y. &amp; H. R. Co. v. Mayor of New York, 1 Hilt. 562; Maryland v. Graves, 19 Md. 351; yet, where the legislature of the state has by clear enactment conferred upon the municipality the power to contract with respect to a given subject, and the municipality does so contract, it is irrevocably bound by if, even though the effect may he the impairment of a legislative function: C. &amp; S. R. Co. v. Carthage, 36 Ohio 631. But every intendment would be against the existence of the power in a municipality to barter away the rights and franchises essential to the maintenance of all its functions in their full rigor: Addis v. Pittsburgh, 85 Pa. 379; Fowler v. Bank of Pittsburgh, 72 Pa. 456; Duncan v. Penn. R. Co., 94 Pa. 444; Branson v. Philadelphia, 47 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>332; Southwark R. Co. v. Philadelphia, 47 Pa. 314; Sharpless v. Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 162. The master then proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">In the light of these decisions and many others which might be cited, was the power attempted to be exercised through the ordinances in question conferred by the act of March 25,1873?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">It is conceded that if it was not given by this act it clearly was not by the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">In the first place, did the property which is the subject matter of the agreement belong to the city, in what may be termed its individual corporate capacity, or belong to it in its public political character? If the former, the complainants have a clear right to hold them to their bargain: Western S. Fund v. Philadelphia, 31 Pa. 175.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">A mere glance at the contract resolves this question against the complainants. The subject matter of the contract was a public highway. The strictest rules must therefore be applied against the grant of power.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">This act of assembly confers in plain and unambiguous terms upon the mayor and council of the city two powers: (1.) To grant to the complainants the use and occupation of all streets lying within three hundred feet of the railroad to be used and occupied by it only so long as the said streets shall remain open to public use and travel. (2.) To vacate any of the said streets concerning which no grant as aforesaid shall have been made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">1. It is apparent that the same right cannot be claimed as conferred by virtue of both these powers, for they are mutually destructive. The complainant can claim the right to use and occupy the street only so long as it is open to public use and travel, and the city can vacate only when the right to use and occupation has not been granted to the railroad. It would also seem clear that the assertion of the right which the complainant is insisting upon, is itself a denial of the power of the city to grant that right under the first of the above enumerated powers. The moment they establish the validity of their contract as a grant of the use and occupation of the street, eo instante they establish also a similar and equal right to the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">The use and occupation need not be necessarily a horizontal one, per Lewis, J.: Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., 27 Pa. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>344, but whatever their right is, it is enjoyed in \u00e9ommon with the public and cannot be exclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-4\">2. The validity of their contract, therefore, must. depend upon the power of vacation. Was Pennell street vacated by the ordinance of May 19, 1874? If the ordinance accomplished any such result it was the very opposite of that declared by the title to be the intention of its passage, for it is entitled \u201c Ordinance directing the opening and grading of Pennell street and changing the grades thereon,\u201d etc., and it is also in direct violation of the solemn undertaking of the city. It was contended before the master that the purpose was to vacate the portion of Pennell street occupied by the railroad. If such was their purpose, it is .clear th\u00e1t they failed to carry it into effect. The ordinance and agreement both provide for nothing to be done by the city other than the opening and grading of the street. Waiving the question whether the legal import of the words used make out an undertaking on the part of the city to forever maintain the grade as fixed and established by the ordinance of May 19, 1874, the master concludes that the act does not disclose with sufficient clearness the existence of the power in the city council by whom the ordinance was enacted, to prevent the exercise by the present or any future council of the same right which they claim and exercise for themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">There is another view of the case which the master has not stopped to elaborate, but which is equally fatal to the complainants\u2019 case. Admitting the power of the- then council to enter into the contract referred to, the contract when made and the rights of the parties under it, as under all other contracts entered into by any other persons, were necessarily subject to legislative powers and authorities confided to the municipality in its public political character: As the right to enforce police regulations or abate nuisances: Presbyterian Church v. New York, supra; Stuyvesant v. Same, supra. Also the right of eminent domain: In re Towanda Bridge Co., 91 Pa. 216. In neither view, of course, is the right of the complainants to recover compensation for the damages which may be suffered by it by reason of the change of grade, affected or intended to be passed upon. It remains only to discuss briefly the remaining general question proposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>3. Are the complainants in any event entitled to the injunction which they ask? It is settled law that the court will not inhibit the passage of an act of assembly or ordinance because of its alleged invalidity as the \u201c impairment of a contract.\u201d They will always wait until some act is attempted under it and then restrain the unauthorized act: Smith v. McCarthy, 56 Pa. 359; Chicago v. Evans, 24 Ill. 52; Des Moines Gas Co. v. Des Moines, 44 Ia. 505; Sheridan v. Calvin, 77 Ill. 237; Milhan v. Sharp, 15 Barb. 195 ; s. c. 9 N. Y. 263; Davis v. The Mayor, 14 N. Y. 506.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-5\">If the position of the complainants on the general question be a sound one, the passage of the threatened ordinance without more, will damage them nothing. When steps are taken by the city to make the ordinance available, the courts may be asked to interfere.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">The master would therefore recommend a decree in favor of the respondents and against the complainant in conformity with the agreement of the parties to this action, dissolving the preliminary injunction supposed to have been issued and dismissing the bill of complainant with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">Various exceptions to the foregoing report were overruled by the master, and were then renewed in court. On argument thereof, the court, Clayton, P. J., on June 7,1886, filed the following opinion and decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-8\">The very able report of the learned master to whom the case was referred, leaves but little if anything more for consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-9\">It will hardly be seriously contended that a municipality, by any form of ordinance or agreement, can deprive itself of any of its delegated powers. It is a mere trustee invested by the sovereign power of the state with the exercise of certain powers for the good of the people of the town. No matter what the consideration, or how honest the intention of the parties, the city, in this case, had no more right to bargain away the control of the future municipal authorities over its streets than an ordinary trustee could sell in fee the lands held by him in trust, without the power of alienation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-10\">The roads and streets of the country belong to the state. The city is but the agent of the state. The delegated power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>of the city is well defined. It must exercise the necessary police authority over the streets, must keep them unobstructed and in good and safe traveling order. It may fix grades and change them as public exigencies may require. It may bridge over or tunnel under dangerous places, and in a word do whatever, in its judgment and discretion, is necessary for the public good. The instant it exceeds any of its delegated powers or attempts to bind itself from their honest exercise, its acts are ultra vires and void. Among the student\u2019s first lessons is the rule for construing statutes: \u201c Acts of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent parliaments bind not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">It may be conceded that the state could make a binding contract for a sufficient consideration with a private person or corporation. It could, therefore, delegate that power to the city, and the sole and single question in this case is, has it done so ? The plaintiff claims that the act of March 25, 1878, P. L. 376, gives to the city the necessary authority. A careful reading of the act clearly shows that it has no application whatever to the case. The authorities are uniform that such legislation, to be effective, must be clear and unambiguous,, and is to be strictly construed in favor of the government. The object of the act was not to regulate bridges over, or tunnels under, the railroad. Its purpose was to give the city power* in its discretion, to permit the railroad to occupy certain streets therein named. Nothing but the'most liberal and enlarged construction can give to the statute the meaning contended for by the plaintiff. The reasoning of the master, and the authorities cited by him in support of his views, are conclusive upon this point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">I entirely concur in all the conclusions to which the master has arrived. The exceptions are overruled and the bill dismissed with costs to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">Thereupon the plaintiff took this appeal specifying as error' the decree dismissing the bill with costs to the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-8\"><em>Mr. William </em>Ward, for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b90-9\">1.

Under the statement of facts found, the complainant shows full compliance on its part with the obligations of the contract of July 2, 1874, and it is entitled to protection in the enjoyment of its advantages secured under it; having made the expenditures on the faith of the contract entered into by the city, the city has no power to abrogate it: Western S. Fund v. Philadelphia, 31 Pa. 175. Goszler v.

The exact letter of the act of March 25,1873, covers this case. It is admitted that Pennell street is within the three hundred feet limit prescribed by the act. The act provides for the grant to the railroad company of the use and occupation, either jointly with the public or exclusively, or to any extent, and in whatever manner the two contracting parties may decide. In fact, the power is given to contract for the absolute vacation and obliteration from the city map of any street decided upon for the use of the railroad company.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-7\">4.

Even if the appellant be correct in its contention that a correct reading of the agreement and the spirit of it imply a restriction upon the power of future councils to alter the grade or restore it to its original position, we contend that it would not be competent for any council to make such a binding contract, and any attempt to do so would be void, as against pub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>lie policy, and a surrender of inalienable powers.

In view of the foregoing, it will not be questioned that we have the right to insist on a strict construction of the act of March 25, 1883. From the words of the act, the council had the power: (1) to grant the use and occupation of the streets to the railroads, while they remained open as streets; (2) to vacate any other streets within the prescribed distance from the railroads. But it is not asserted that council attempted to vacate Pennell street. Then did council grant the use and occupation of that street to the railroad company? The company asserts no right to the use of the bridge; it passes its cars and locomotives along its railroad under tbe bridge, but precisely in the same manner as before the bridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>was built. It is clear then that no use or occupation was granted by the ordinances or the agreement, at least in clear and unambiguous language: Sharpless v. Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 182; Lafayette v. Cox, 5 Ind. 38. Evidently, the act of assembly was not in the minds of those who prepared either the ordinances or the agreement, or, if in mind, it was not believed to bear on the subject; and it must not be overlooked that neither the ordinances nor the agreement contain any restriction upon future legislation on the part of councils, with reference to the grade of the street.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AX\">Mr. Justice Green:</author>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The act of March 25, 1873, P. L. 376, contains in the concluding clause of section 6, the following provision: \u201cSuch grants as aforesaid, when made and approved by ordinance of the mayor and council, shall be as valid and effectual to transfer the rights and privileges therein contracted for to the said railroad companies, or any of them, or any of their successors and assigns, as if made between individuals; and the mayor and council of the said city shall have power to enact ordinances from time to time as they may deem advisable and expedient for the purposes of this act.\u201d The agreement of July 2,1874, between the city of Chester and the P. <em>W. </em>&amp; B. R. Co. was duly approved by an ordinance of the city council on August 17, 1874, and, so far as it was in the power of these contracting parties to do so, they bound themselves to the just performance of all the terms of that contract. If the question now at issue arose out of a contract between individuals, there would not be a moment\u2019s doubt as to its determination. As a matter of course, neither the parties, nor the legislature, nor the courts, could disregard the terms of the contract; nor could any rights acquired under it be defeated, taken away or impaired without the consent of the party affected. By necessary consequence it follows, that if the grants made by the city to the railroad company by the contract of July 2, 1874, were within the lawful power of the city under the act of 1873, the city is bound by them with the same effect in all respects as if it were an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Does that act confer the power to make the contract of July 2,1874? If it does, there is an end of the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The act is special and local. It confers expressly certain powers upon the city of Chester to make certain grants to the Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Company. So far as the parties are concerned, and so far as the contracting power is concerned, and the quality or legal character of any actual exercise of that power, there is no kind of question. The one. solitary question in this case is, so far as this branch of it is concerned, whether the contract of July, 1874, was an exercise of the power conferred by the act of 1873. This involves an interpretation, of the act. Its terms are as follows : \u201c That the mayor and council of the city of Chester shall have power to grant to the Philadelphia. Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad Company, The Philadelphia &amp; Baltimore Central Railroad Company, The Chester Creek Railroad Company, or any of them, or any of their successors or assigns, the use and occupation of the streets, lanes, courts, and alleys lying within three hundred feet of the said railroads, or any of them now opened or hereafter to be opened or established, to be used and occupied by the said railroad companies respectively, only so long as the said streets, lanes, courts and alleys shall remain open to public use and travel, and shall have the power to vacate any of the said streets, lanes, courts or alleys, concerning which no grant as aforesaid shall have been made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Referring now to the terms of the contract, we find that in consideration of the undertakings to be performed by the company, the city agrees that Pennell street shall be open to public use and travel between Third and Seventh streets, and that the grades of the street shall be fixed in accordance with the grades, lines and marks ordained by an ordinance approved May 19, 1874, entitled \u201c An ordinance directing the opening and grading of Pennell street and changing the grades thereon between Third and Seventh streets, the said grades being so established and fixed with the intent and purpose of having the said Pennell street cross the said railroad at such a height, not less than eighteen feet above the top of the ties of the said railroad, as will permit the free operation of the same under the said street and prevent the dangers of a crossing of said railroad by said street at level grade.\u201d Then follows the stipulation of the company thus : \u201c And for and in consideration of the above recited contract and agreement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>the said city and of the establishment of the said grades as defined in the said ordinance, and with the intent and purpose of preventing a level or grade crossing over the said railroad by the said street as aforesaid, the said The P. W. &amp; B. R. Co. hereby contracts and agrees with the said city of Chester as follows: that is to say, to build over the said railroad where the said Pennell street crosses the same, at the grades herein-before recited, an iron bridge as before described and donate the said bridge with the appurtenances hereinafter enumerated to the said city.\u201d Then follows a description of the manner in which the bridge shall be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In substance, this means that the street shall be opened and used at certain grade lines so fixed that the street shall be at an elevation of eighteen feet above the railroad and that the railroad shall be operated freely under the said street, and that a crossing of the railroad by the said street at grade shall be prevented. It means, also, that the railroad company shall so use the ground over which Pennell street would necessarily be laid, if it crossed the railroad at grade, as that such a crossing shall not be permitted, and hence that portion of Pennell street which would cross the railroad at grade is devoted to the exclusive use of the railroad. If Pennell street had then been laid out and opened, it cannot be questioned that the subsequent use of the street at the place of crossing, under the contract, would have been the use of a part of that street, and hence it would come within the very words of the power granted by the legislature to the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Whether the user of the street granted by the contract was longitudinal or transverse, is immaterial in considering the question of power, since the act which gives the power authorizes the city to grant \u201c the use and occupation of the streets etc., or any of them now opened or hereafter to be. opened or established,\u201d without any limitation as to the extent or manner of the use. The use of the street crosswise its direction, or lengthwise, is of the same generic character, and, where it is exclusive, it is just as effectual if it be sixty feet as if it were six hundred.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">But, more than this, the railroad company is to build that portion of Pennell street which crosses the railroad. The street at this point is to consist of abutments twenty-six feet long and a superstructure of iron \u201c twenty-four feet in width <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>with wooden flooring and capable of carrying a load of one hundred pounds per square foot in addition to weight of structure.\u201d This part of the street is to be constructed at the cost of the railroad company and donated to the city in consideration of the previous contract of the city, and the railroad company is prohibited from using any part of the street so as to constitute a grade crossing. In this sense also, therefore, the provision of the contract is a provision in regard to the use of the street; and, while it is negative in that it prohibits the use of the street, it is affirmative in that it grants the exclusive use of that portion of the street which would necessarily be used as a street if a grade crossing were established. Moreover the construction of the street at an elevation for purposes of use, with a prohibition against the use of a grade crossing, is so necessarily and fundamentally germane to the power conferred by the act to grant \u201c the use and occupation \u201d of the streets, that, if there were any doubt upon the subject, we would feel quite justified in holding it to be included by necessary implication in the general grant of power expressed in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">, We have no difficulty, however, in holding that the power exercised by the city in making the contract in question comes within the letter of the act, and hence the rights conferred by the contract upon the railroad company are inviolable. This ' view of the case renders unnecessary the consideration of the several matters discussed in the printed arguments. There is no question as to the performance by the railroad company of its part of the contract, and the question of the right of a municipality to grant away its control of the streets is foreign to the discussion. If there is a legislative grant of the power in controversy, to the municipality, it is only necessary to consider whether that power has been exercised. We hold that it has been in the present case, and by the express terms of the law the city is as completely bound by it as though it were an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The decree of the court below is reversed at the cost of the appellees; and the record is remitted with direction that an injunction be awarded in conformity with the terms of the agreement of the parties under which this proceeding was commenced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
