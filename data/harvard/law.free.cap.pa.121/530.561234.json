W. Ames and O. Keese, trading as Ames &amp; Keese, against R. H. Childs, William Willis and E. R. Loomis, trading as Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis. In the issue as framed Ames &amp; Keese were plaintiffs, and Sampson Short, defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-9\">At the trial on June 21, 1887, it was made to appear that in the fall of 1882, Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis completed the erection of an oil refinery in Kendall borough, and on February 12, 1883, made an assignment to Alfred Short for the benefit of creditors; that on May 17, 1883, Ames &amp; Keese filed a claim against Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis, for a lien under the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 696, and its supplements, for materials furnished by them \u201c for and about the erection and construction of several buildings and a certain oil refinery erected within the county of McKean, hereinafter more particularly described.\u201d The material parts of said claim were the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-10\">The said Childs,'Willis &amp; Loomis were the owners of said buildings and oil refinery at the time when the same were commenced, and with whom the contract of the said Ames &amp; Keese therefor, was made. The amount claimed to be due to them, the said Ames &amp; Keese, is $2,002.49. This sum is due for materials furnished, such as engines, steam pumps, stills, fittings, etc., by the said Ames &amp; Keese, for and about the erection and construction of said buildings and oil refinery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-11\">* * ******* *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-12\">Said buildings and oil refinery are situate in the county of McKean and state of Pennsylvania and is bounded and described as follows, to wit: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>All that certain piece or parcel of land situate in Foster township, Mc-Kean county, Pennsylvania, bounded and described as follows, to wit: On the north by the Tunuugwant creek; east by a small stream or gulley emptying into the said creek; south by land of Rochester <em>&amp; </em>Pittsburgh Railroad; west by land of Philo Ackley; containing four and one third acres, more or less, being the same land conveyed to Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis by Melvin Brothers, by deed dated tje-day of July, 1882. And having buildings and machinery erected thereon, consisting of boiler and boiler house, tanks and tank houses, stills, warehouse and barn, and donkey pumps, engines and fittings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">It also appeared that on July 20, 1883, Alfred Short, the assignee of Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis, had sold the oil refinery property discharged of liens, under order of the Court of Common Pleas, and that an auditor was appointed to distribute the purchase money. During the hearing before the auditor, a rule taken to show cause why the said mechanics\u2019 claim should not be stricken off, was discharged, when this issue was applied for and awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-8\">The facts and questions arising, so far as material, sufficiently appear in the charge to the jury, Olmsted, P. J., which after reviewing the evidence proceeded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-9\">Now that is really the question you are to determine, whether Ames &amp; Keese, the plaintiffs, had a valid lien against the land that was assigned to Alfred Short, and from the sale of which the fund was raised that came into the court for distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-10\">* * * * * . * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-11\">We have been requested by defendant\u2019s counsel to answer certain points in writing, which we will now do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-12\">1. The property against which the attempted lien is filed, is not the subject of a mechanics\u2019 hen, and the claim of the plaintiffs cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-13\">Answer : We answer this point in the negative. It is one of the doubtful questions, and perhaps the doubtful question in the case.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-14\">2. The articles alleged to have been furnished, and for which the attempted lien is filed, are not such as will enable a lien for them to be sustained against property of the character described in the plaintiffs\u2019 statement filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-15\">Answer : We answer this point in the negative. It is substantially the same question that is raised in the first point.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">4. Under the facts shown plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, and the verdict should be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">Answer: We answer this point in the negative, as we cannot unqualifiedly affirm it.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">Now, gentlemen of the jury, we have by our answers to the legal points that have been suBmitted, said to you that this property, if it is what it is described to be, is such a property as may be the subject of a mechanics\u2019 lien. That question is not one, therefore, for you, and we say to you now if you believe from the evidence in the case that the plaintiffs, Ames &amp; Keese, sold and delivered to the defendants these items that have been gone over in your presence, amounting to some $1,800 and upwards, upon the faith and credit of an erection that was to be made by Childs, Willis &amp; Loomis upon a piece of land in Tarport, and that the last item of goods shipped was delivered, or shipped for delivery, that would be delivered, probably, on November 18th, and the hen was entered on May 17th, we say that that was within six months and within the meaning of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">********</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">The jury, upon the several issues of fact submitted, found for the plaintiffs, and judgment being entered, the defendant took this writ assigning as error, inter alia :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-10\">2-4.

Chapman </em>(with him <em>Mr. John B. </em>Chapman), for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-12\">1. The claimant is required to set forth the \u201c locality of the building and the size and number of the stories of the same, or such other matters of description as shall be sufficient to identify the same.\u201d The object of the description is not to establish the curtilage, but simply to identify the particular structure upon which the work has been performed, or for which the material has been supplied: Johnson on Mechanics\u2019 Liens, 241, n. 39 ; Washburn v. Russel, 1 Pa. 499 ; Barclay\u2019s App., 13 Pa. 495 ; Nelson v. Campbell, 28 Pa. 156; Simpson v. Murray, 2 Pa. 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b565-13\">2. The land is described as in Foster township. It was actually in Kendall borough, which never was a part of Foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>township. The property against which the lien is given must be so, accurately described in the claim that when judgment is obtained on the scire f\u00e1cias, the writ of levari facias following the claim may so designate the property and the extent of the interest therein to be sold, that a separate' schedule will not be required for the guidance of the sheriff: Ely v. Wren, 90 Pa. 151; Simpson v. Murray, 2 Pa. 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-5\">3. The property is described in the claim, as \u201c several buildings, and a certain oil refinery.\u201d Buildings only are subject to the lien of the mechanic or the material man; the land is incidentally subject to the hen against the building. An oil refinery is not a building, nor any part of a building. The act of February 27, 1868, P. L. 212, authorizing mechanics\u2019 hens upon oil or other refineries, was never extended to McKean county. The mechanics\u2019 hen law is purely a creature of statute, and cannot be carried beyond the limits prescribed. Individual cases of hardship occur. Sometimes the mechanic or material man suffers, and sometimes it is the ' owner of the fee. The statute leans toward neither: Tilford v. Wallace, 3 W. 141; Bolton v. Johns, 5 Pa. 149. Moreover, no part of the appliances charged for were to be used in the construction of any building. Stills, tanks, pumps, boilers, pipes and fittings, constituting an oil refinery, are certainly no part of any building: Oppenheimer v. Morrell, 118 Pa. 189.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-6\"><em>Mr. M. H. Byles </em>(with him <em>Mr. E. </em>McSweeney), for the defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-7\">1. It is not necessary that the description in a mechanics\u2019 hen should be either full or precise. If there be enough in the description of the situation and the peculiarities of the building to identify it, the statute is satisfied: McClintock v. Rush, 63 Pa. 203 ; Richardson v. Glockner, 3 Penny. 90; Washburn v. Russel, 1 Pa. 499; Knabb\u2019s App., 10 Pa. 186; Shaw v. Barnes, 5 Pa. 18; Kennedy v. House, 41 Pa. 39; Harker v. Conrad, 12 S. &amp; R. 301; Springer v. Keyser, 6 Wh. 187.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b566-8\">2. The mechanics\u2019 hen in this case can be sustained, because the property therein designated consisted of structures or buildings into which the materials furnished by the plaintiffs entered as necessary portions, constituting when placed therein essential parts of the structures located on the land described in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>claim, the whole as completed being called an oil refinery. Parrish\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 111, is in our favor on this point. The improvements in the case at bar were of a permanent and substantial character, and in their extent and value were significant enough to give ample notice to purchasers and incumbrancers of their existence upon the land.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"AGA\">Mr. Justice Clark:</author>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In Short v. Miller, 120 Pa. 470, we held that an oil refinery may be the subject of a mechanics\u2019 lien; indeed, upon the facts exhibited in that case, we held that this particular oil refinery was subject to such a lien. The act of 1836, as we said in that case, does not designate the character or kind of the building to which a mechanics\u2019 lien will attach; if the structures are of a substantial and permanent character, and may in any reasonable sense be known as buildings, they may be incumbered by lien. Nor is it of any consequence that buildings may not be considered essential to an oil refinery, if buildings are actually erected in connection therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">But this lien is not filed against any building by any proper description. The plaintiffs set forth in their claim for lien that it is \u201c for materials furnished by them for and about the erection and construction of several buildings and a certain oil refinery erected, etc., particularly described,\u201d etc. The description is as follows: \u201c Said buildings and oil refinery are situate in the county of McKean and state of Pennsylvania, and is bounded and described as follows,\u201d then follows a description of the land: \u201c and having buildings and machinery erected thereon, consisting of boiler and boiler-house, tanks and tank-houses, stills, warehouse and barn, and donkey-pumps, engines, and fittings.\u201d It is difficult to determine whether this lien was filed against several buildings and an oil refinery, or against several buildings which with other structures constituted an oil refinery, or against an oil refinery as such, the buildings being mentioned as matter of description merely. However this may be, the description of the structures or subject of the lien is radically defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The twelfth section of the act of June 16, 1836, provides that the claim shall set forth \u201c the locality of the building and the size and number of the stories of the same.\u201d In Kennedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>v. House, 41 Pa. 39, and McClintock v. Rush, 63 Pa. 203, it is said, if there be enough in the description of the locality and other peculiarities of the building to point out and identify it With reasonable certainty, it is a sufficient compliance with the requirements of the act. But in this case the buildings are not described at all. There is an attempted description of the tract or piece of land upon which the buildings and refinery are erected; even this is erroneous, however, as the land is described as being in Foster township, when in fact it is in Kendall borough; but there is no description of the structures themselves. The claim does not state whether the buildings are of brick or wood; it does not state their form, size, height, or the manner of their construction; nor does it contain any other matters of description sufficient to identify the same. It does not state whether they adjoin or are disconnected, whether they are erected as one tenement or may be separated in their use without injury; it states simply that there are several buildings and an oil refinery and that the land has buildings and machinery thereon erected, consisting of boiler and boiler-house, tanks and tank-houses, stills, warehouse and barn, and donkey-pumps, engines and fittings.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">It is plain that the act of 1836 applies only to buildings erected. It seems from the evidence that an oil refinery may exist and be operated without any structure of a permanent or substantial character, which can in any reasonable sense be known as a building; if this be so, the claim must be entered against such structures and buildings erected in connection therewith, as are the proper subjects of a mechanics\u2019 lien, and they must beso described as to be capable of identification. In the case, under consideration no such description is given; therefore, whether the claim is considered as a lien upon the buildings or upon the refinery, or upon all together, the lien cannot be sustained. In this view of the ease it is unnecessary to consider the other.questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
