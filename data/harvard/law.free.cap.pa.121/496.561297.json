Ridgway, by deed duly proved and recorded, did grant and convey unto Timothy Ives, Jr., J. W. Guthrie and Z. H. Eddy, commissioners of the county of Elk, and their successors in office, the right to freely use and enjoy from time to time and at all times thereafter, without limit, so much of the water of a large spring upon the grantor\u2019s lands, south of the town of Ridgway, as might be necessary for the use of the county of Elk and her public buildings, with the right to convey the same by means of pipes laid through or upon the land of the grantor to the public square; the surplus of the water, over and above what would be needed for the supply of the public buildings, to be held in trust for the citizens of Ridgway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">That soon after the making of said grant, the county, by its commissioners, caused a pipe to be laid to said spring and a portion of the water therefrom to be eonveyed to said public square and for said public buildings, which said pipe (or the substitutes therefor), had been kept and maintained by the plaintiff ever since, and the said water was necessary for the safe and healthful use and occupancy of the public buildings erected and maintained'by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-10\">That by reason of the increase of the population and business of the county, necessitating the erection of large and expensive new public buildings, together with the increase of the population of the town of Ridgway, the supply of water afforded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>by the pipe theretofore in use was wholly inadequate, and it had become necessary for the plaintiff to repair the basin or reservoir collecting and holding the waters of said spring, and to replace the said pipe by one capable of carrying and conducting a larger supply, and the plaintiff had made preparations for such repairs and renewal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-4\">That the defendants were in possession of the lands upon which said spring was located and through which the pipe from said spring was laid, and threatened to arrest the agents, servants and employees of the plaintiff if they or any of them entered into or upon said lands for the purpose of repairing said basin or relaying said pipe, by reason whereof the plaintiff was greatly delayed, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">The\u2018bill prayed for an injunction, preliminary until hearing and perpetual thereafter, restraining interference with the repairing of said reservoir and the relaying of said pipe; and for other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">The answer of the defendants, so far as material, admitted the grant to Ives, et al., as alleged, but averred that at the time thereof they were not commissioners of Elk county, and had no authority to receive grants for the use or benefit of the county; denied that any such rights were conferred upon the plaintiff by said grant as was alleged, and averred that Reuben Winslow, John Brooks and Chauncey Brockway were at the date of said grant the commissioners of said county, duly elected, qualified and acting; admitted that the county had laid a pipe from the spring and had maintained it for twenty-one years prior to 1873, for the purpose of supplying the public buildings with water, but averred that C. R. Earley had built and maintained the reservoir now at said spring at his own expense, and claimed the right to keep and maintain the reservoir and premises as they had theretofore been kept; denied that they had ever threatened to arrest the servants of the plaintiff employed to keep and maintain the pipe put in and used by the plaintiff; denied further the right of the plaintiff to enter upon the premises of defendants and to meddle with the reservoir, or in any way disturb the premises any more than was necessary to regulate the supply of water coming to the county buildings, and averred that the water already conveyed by said pipe to said buildings was sufficient for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>thereof, and that the plaintiff permitted the water so conveyed to be misused and wasted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">Issue having been joined, the cause was referred to <em>Mr. J.

S. Hyde to furnish stone pipe and lay the same from the spring to the public square, fix the head of the spring, make a reservoir at the public square and carry off the waste water, the county to pay the expense and the commissioners to have supervision of the work. This was laid and was 2^ inches in diameter. It was brought down to the corner of the public square. A small stone culvert was made at the head of the spring, that was closed by a plank door and locked with a padlock, and the key was held under the control of \"the commissioners. The use of the water was continued by both the county and the citizens of Ridgway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-10\">On July 7,1859, John J. Ridgway and wife conveyed by deed to Albert \"Willis, of Ridgway, out-lot No. 18, it being the lot upon which the spring is, \u201c reserving the right for the water from the large spring, to be brought to the public square in such way as may be desired, and of repairing and relaying said conveyance at any time without molestation.\u201d Willis went into possession under this conveyance while the pipe that Hyde laid was in existence, and the defendants are in possession under Willis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>and claim title through him. As I understand they went into possession in about 1873-4. Willis used the water from this spring in common with other citizens of Ridgway, taking it from the surplus at the corner of the public square.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">In 1874, C. R. Earley, one of the defendants, being in possession of the lands, employed a man to put in a reservoir, and at the same time he laid a pipe from the spring to his house. This reservoir was a small one, about 8 by 10 feet; and this and the pipe laid were without any arrangement with the county, but were done, as Dr. Earley explains, to get purer water. In doing this the county pipe was not disturbed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">After Dr. Earley had completed this work in 1874, the flow of water through the county pipe was found to be insufficient for the purposes of the county buildings, and the county commissioners entered into an arrangement with Dr. Earley, whereby he extended his pipe to the corner of the court house lot, and erected a hydrant there at an expense to himself of about one hundred dollars. There has been some conflicting testimony in regard to this agreement......</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-7\">I think the clear weight of evidence is with the theory that the arrangement made with Dr. Earley in 1874, was only of a temporary character, and not made with the view of surrendering any of the rights of the county to the spring.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-8\">In 1875, Dr. Earley took out the reservoir, made by him in 1874, and made a much larger one, and built a house over it and expended about $2,000 in doing so. He also extended the pipe from the corner of the court house square into the sheriff\u2019s kitchen at his own expense; the latter he did, it would seem, at the request of the commissioners, but the reservoir was made by him without any agreement with, or authority from, the commissioners to do so. In putting in this new reservoir the county pipe was laid about 6 inches lower in the water than Dr. Earley\u2019s. Nothing more whatever was done with the spring or pipes leading from it, until 1879-80, when the new court house was built.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-9\">In 1879-80, upon the completion of the new and expensive court house, the county commissioners, in order to properly supply water, laid a 2j-ineh wrought-iron pipe from the spring to the court house, in the place of the stone pipe laid by Hyde in 1859. They run this pipe up to the upper floors of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>court house where they took from it a supply for the court house, and from there it conducted the surplus water to the box at the corner of the public grounds; the citizens of Ridgway take water from this box by seven pipes laid to different parts of the town. This state of affairs remained until the summer of 1885, when the commissioners erected and constructed a large and expensive jail and sheriff\u2019s residence, and a much larger supply of water was needed for the county buildings, they being arranged with urinals, water closets, bath tubs, laundry and steam heating apparatus. For some reason, in the summer of 1885, the supply failed to a considerable extent and there was for a month or two prior to the filing of the bill in this case, not enough water for court house or jail, and the supply to the citizens of Ridgway also failed. The county buildings would become unfit for use without a supply of water. This spring is located about fifty-six feet above the level of the ground at the court house. It is shown to be a large spring, that would probably fill a 5-inch pipe, and, if economically used for domestic purposes, would in all probability supply the people of Ridgway, besides the county buildings. There is no other source from which a sufficient supply could be obtained without great expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-5\">In about August, 1885, when the supply of water failed to be enough for the public buildings, the commissioners of Elk county, Gardner, Kronewetter and Carman, contemplating laying 5-inch pipe to the spring in place of the 2^-inch pipe, went together to find the course and the ground occupied by the old pipe. When they came to the land of the defendants, and before they entered thereon, they were met by the attorney of the defendants, who forbid their going on the premises, and threatened to arrest them if they did so. The commissioners obeyed the warning, did not then go to the spring, or upon the defendants\u2019 lands, but went away, and thereupon they brought this action by bill.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-6\">CONCLUSIONS ON LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b534-7\">It is contended by the defendants that the deed of November 5, 1848,-from John J. Ridgway to Timothy Ives et al., vested no title in the commissioners of Elk county, nor in the county; that lyes et al. were not commissioners at the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and delivery of the deed, and if they had been, a deed to individuals merely describing them as officers of a corporation would vest the title in the individuals, and not in the corporation. It is true that Ives et al. were not at that date the county commissioners. Yet I do not think I should adopt this view in regard to this deed. A plain mistake was made in naming the grantee; but it is clear upon the face of the instrument who the grantee was intended to be. The intention of the grantor is clear, and I think this deed in a court of equity in this state will be treated as if it had been made to the county of Elk. It is the peculiar province of a court of equity to reform deeds and other written instruments that have been made wrong through mistake. It seems to me that the courts properly exercise great care to uphold written instruments and carry out the intention of the parties where it can be done without violating a positive rule of law or a statute. [Discussing Lant\u2019s App., 95 Pa. 279; Lawrence Co. v. Leonard, 83 Pa. 206; Bispham\u2019s Eq. 244; Broom\u2019s Leg. Max. 482; Huss v. Morris, 63 Pa. 372, the master proceeded:]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">I think that the intention of the grantor to make this conveyance effective for the county of Elk as the grantee, is plain on the face of the deed. There was such a grantee in existence. The mistake in naming Ives et al. is clear. In my judgment this mistake should be corrected in a court of equity, and the intention of the grantor made effectual bjr holding that the county of Elk took a good title under this deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">There was some contention in this case as to the power of the county to take as a trustee for the citizens of Ridgway. I have not thought that the rights of the citizens of Ridgway were directly involved and necessary to be decided in this issue ; but the question would seem to be pretty clearly settled by the case of Lawrence County v. Leonard, and the cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">If I am right in the conclusion that the deed should be upheld, and that the county of Elk may claim a good title thereunder to the easement, then the next thing to be determined is, has the county parted with that title or any part thereof? ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-8\">It is earnestly contended by the defendants that a court of equity has no jurisdiction; that the acts alleged in plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>bill to have been done and threatened by the defendants are not contrary to law and equity; that the mere denial of a right does not constitute a disturbance of the exercise of that right; that in a case situated as this one is the plaintiff should first establish his right in an action at law and then come into chancery if necessary for the protection of the legally established right; that the bill does not allege irreparable injury and must therefore be dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ATy\">The. industry of the counsel for the defendants has furnished me with a number of authorities that I have carefully examined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-5\">\u25a0 The case of Downing v. Baldwin, 1 S. &amp; R. 303, is cited, and the doctrine of that case is sought to be applied to the facts of this case. In that case it appears that the plaintiff asked permission to use a water course that he claimed a right to use, and the defendant refused to,give his permission. The court held this mere denial of the right did not constitute a disturbance of the exercise- of that right. But between that case and the one at bar there is, it seems to me, a clear distinction of importance, upon the facts. In this case the plaintiffs set out to exercise the right claimed, and were met by the defendants at the place of entry on their lands, and were forbid entering thereon, and were threatened with arrest if they did enter. There was something in this on the part of the defendants that was active in its nature, and from which it could be implied that they intended to resist the exercise of the right claimed. It was an act opposing the plaintiffs, accompanied by a threat. Moreover, it would seem to me that equity would have jurisdiction under the circumstances, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, for the constant use of this right is necessary for the public: Bitting\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 521.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-6\">In this connection the case of Hagner v. Heyberger, 7 <em>W. </em>&amp; S. 104, was cited by defendants. This was a nisi prius decision, and so far as it relates to the question, it seems to have been repudiated by the Supreme Court. In Stockdale v. Ullery, 37 Pa. 487, Lowrie. C. J., says, \u201cThe Supreme Court never formally sanctioned the dictum in that case.\u201d And in Wistar v. McManes, 54 Pa. 328, Strong, J., says, \u201c Our more modern decisions do not recognize the doctrine asserted by Judge Sergeant at nisi prius, 7 W. &amp; S. 104, that our courts are powerless to restrain acts contrary to equity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>But the defendants urge, upon the authority of Rhea v. Forsyth, 37 Pa. 503, that the plaintiff\u2019s rights are not acknowledged, and they must therefore be established at law before resort can be had to a chancellor. The authority of this case I fully recognize. There is a long line of cases to the same effect, among which may be mentioned: Brown\u2019s Appeal, 62 Pa. 17, and Mining\u2019s Appeal, 82 Pa. 373, and their authority remains undoubted; but it does not seem to me that the doctrine of those cases is applicable to the facts of this case. In Rhea v. Forsyth, there was no writing witnessing the right claimed, and there was much conflict in the testimony relating to both the grounds on which the plaintiff rested his claim. In Brown\u2019s Appeal, there was a serious dispute about the very terms of the contract that had not been reduced to writing. In Minnig\u2019s Appeal, the plaintiff\u2019s rights had been made more than doubtful by the finding of the master, and an action of ejectment was pending. In the case in hand the plaintiff\u2019s title is by deed, about the due execution of which there is no dispute. There appears to be no serious conflict in the testimony upon any material point in the case. There is no contention that requires to be settled by a jury. A chancellor may declare the rights of the parties upon the construction of writings and upon facts not seriously controverted. Under such circumstances the right is clear, and it would seem to me that, as it was held in Hacke\u2019s Appeal, 101 Pa. 245, \u201cIt need not first be established by a suit at law, nor is it necessary that the owner should prove special damage to entitle him to a decree. In the Commonwealth v. Railroad Co., 24 Pa. 159, it was also held that \u201cin a case where public rights, or private rights secured by contract are invaded, and an injunction is asked for in order to protect them, no question of the amount of damage is raised, but simply one of right.\u201d In Bitting\u2019s Appeal, 105 Pa. 517, it is held that \u201c when the facts show a legal title in the complainant, it is not a prerequisite to the enforcement in equity of equitable rights incident thereto, that the complainant\u2019s legal title be established in an action at law; that actions at law would not afford an adequate remedy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">I am therefore of the opinion that I should recommend the following decree:.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Among the exceptions filed by the defendants to the foregoing report, overruled by the master and then renewed in court, were the following: That the .master erred</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-4\">2.

Real P. 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-9\">2. If the acts of the defendants alleged to have been done and threatened, are not contrary to law and equity, a court of equity has no jurisdiction: High on Injunctions, \u00a7 550 : Hagner v. Heyberger, 7 W. &amp; S. 104; Downing v. Baldwin, 1 S. &amp; R. 303; Adams\u2019 Equity, 331. The act alleged is, that defendants threatened to arrest the agents, etc., of the plaintiff; but to give notice that an arrest would be made, was to give notice that a legal act would be performed, and to say that a legal act is contrary to law is absurd. The case at bar is not distinguishable from Downing v. Baldwin, supra; and if there is a doubt as to the sufficiency of the allegations, that doubt is to be resolved in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b539-10\">3. The bill alleges that the defendants are in possession of the land on which the spring in dispute is situate. The answer admits the possession, but denies the right claimed. If the claim of the plaintiff amounts to a corporeal hereditament, and gives the right to the possession of the spring and the land on which it is situate, with the right to excavate and build a reservoir, then the plaintiff is attempting to obtain through the decree of a court of equity what might be obtained by an ejectment, and in such case the bill is to be dismissed: Rhea v. Forsyth, 37 Pa. 503 ; North Penn. Coal Co. v. Snowden, 42 Pa. 488; Bitting\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 517. And see High on Injunctions, \u00a7 486 ; Washb.

Moreover, \u201c a court of equity, which is never active in relief, against conscience or public convenience, has always re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fused its aid to stale demands when a party has slept upon his rights and acquiesced for a great length of time: \u201d Smith v.

The findings of fact by an auditor or master will not be set aside unless the error clearly appears: Thompson\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 603; Bedell\u2019s App., 87 Pa. 510; Atkinson\u2019s App., 10 Cent. R. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-7\">2. As to the fifth assignment of error, it is clearly established that when the supply of water failed, and the commissioners went upon the defendants\u2019 premises for the purpose of examining the ground and ascertaining what was necessary to be done, they were forbidden to enter, and threatened with an arrest. The lack of water at the county buildings was an evil that required a prompt and speedy remedy. The commissioners had no personal interest, and could not await the termination of an action of trespass or a criminal action. Moreover, in the deed from Ridgway to Willis, under which defendants hold, there was a full and complete reservation of the right of the water from the spring, to be brought to the public square \u201c in such a way as may be desired, and the repairing and relaying'of said conveyance without molestation.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-8\">3. It is not enough that there is a remedy at law; it must be plain and' adequate, or, in other .words, as practical and efficient to the ends of justice .and its prompt administration, as the remedy in equity: Boyce v. Grundy, 3 Pet. 210; Watson v. Sutherland, 5 Wall. 74; Story Eq. J. 24; hence, the exercise of chancery powers must often depend on the sound discretion of the court: Bierbower\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 14; Brush Electric Co.\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 574. So a bill may be sustained solely on the ground that it is the most convenient remedy: Kirkpatrick v. McDonald, 11 Pa. 387. \u201c We think our tribunals should lean to a liberal exercise of the powers which the legislature after long hesitation has conferred, without, however, encouraging the technical niceties in the modes of procedure and forms of pleading which have tended rather to retard than to facilitate the great object of the- jurisdiction : \u201d Kirkpatrick v. McDonald, supra.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>4. The commissioners had no power to make the alleged agreement of surrender, and if they had such power, the rights vested in the county were an interest in land, and the statute of frauds prevents a transfer except in writing: Reed on Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 718; Collam v. Hocker, 1 R. 107. Moreover, \u201cIn actions respecting real property, when the rights of the parties are admitted in the pleadings, or otherwise clearly appear, an equity based upon those rights, superinduced by the acts of the parties, may be asserted by bill in equity and appropriate equitable relief obtained without a prior establishment of said rights in a court of law: \u201d Ferguson\u2019s App., 117 Pa. 426. And see Bitting\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 517; Scheetz\u2019s App., 85 Pa. 88; Adams\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 449. The remedy by injunction being preventive in its nature, it is not necessary that a wrong should have been actually committed before a court of equity will interfere: High on Injunctions, \u00a7 31; McCarthur v. Kelly, 5 Ohio 154 ; Lawrence Co. v. Leonard, 83 Pa. 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">5. The grant to the county was without limit, and not, therefore, to be confined to the buildings at the time about to be erected: Alden\u2019s App., 93 Pa. 182. The allegation of irreparable damage would have been merely formal, and this court would allow an amendment if necessary: Darlington\u2019s App., 86 Pa. 513. There is no laches, no estoppel: Larkins\u2019s App., 38 Pa. 457; Edelman v. Yeakel, 27 Pa. 26. Ejectment will not lie for an incorporeal hereditament: Black v. Hepburne, 2 Y. 331.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"ADb\">Mr. Justice Stekrett :</author>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">The learned master\u2019s report, which was approved by the court below, contains such a clear and accurate statement of all the material facts of the case, and of the principles of law applicable to them, that, in connection with the opinion of the learned president of the Common Pleas, it may be adopted as an ample vindication of the decree. There appears to be nothing in the findings of fact or conclusions of law that requires special notice. The specifications of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">It is clear that under Mr. John J. Ridgway\u2019s deed of November 5, 1843, the county of Elk was invested with all the rights and privileges specified in that instrument, and that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>vested rights were neither modified nor abridged by any thing that was subsequently done by the commissioners. The .arrangement made with Earley in 1874, as the master correctly found, was only of a temporary character, not made with the view of surrendering any of the rights of the county to the spring. The appellants, in possession of and claiming title to the lot on which the spring is located, had no occasion to interfere with the appellees in the exercise of their right \u201cto freely use and enjoy......without limit, so much of the water\u201d of the spring in question, as might be necessary or convenient to supply the public buildings of the county, etc., according to the true intent and meaning of the grant. In the deed of July 7,1859, conveying said lot, the right of the county to the use of the spring, acquired sixteen years before, is distinctly recognized and reserved by the grantor thus : \u201creserving the right for the water from the large spring to be brought to the public square in such way as may be desired, and of repairing or relaying said conveyance at any time without molestation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The subject of complaint in the fifth specification is the master\u2019s conclusion of law, \u201cthat the acts alleged to have been done and threatened by the defendants were sufficient to support a bill for an injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">There was no error in this. When the supply of water through the pipes failed and the commissioners went to the premises occupied by defendants and on which the spring is located, for the purpose of examining the ground and ascertaining what was necessary to be done, they were forbidden to enter and threatened with arrest if they attempted to do so. As public officers, intrusted with the care and management of the public property, and acting clearly within the line of their duty, the commissioners were not bound to wait until some overt act of violence was committed by the defendants, nor to provoke a breach of the peace by ignoring the threats that were made and proceeding to discharge their duty. The situation was one that required prompt and efficient action. The continued lack of water at the public buildings might have been attended with serious consequences, especially in case of fire. It would have been unwise to wait until the termination of an action of trespass or even of a criminal action. Under the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>cumstances, they acted discreetly as well as legally in promptly appealing to the court for protection from threatened injury and interference with the proper discharge of their duty. Nobody doubts the soundness of the principle that equity will not assume jurisdiction where there is a full, complete and adequate remedy at law. In this ease no legal remedy that could have been resorted to would have been either full, complete or adequate. As was said in Bierbower\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 14, 17, \u201c Jurisdiction in equity depends not so much on the want of a common law remedy as upon its inadequacy, and its exercise is a matter which often rests in the discretion of the court; <em>in </em>other words, the court may take upon itself to say whether the common law remedy is, under all the circumstances and in view of the conduct of the parties, sufficient for the purposes of complete justice, or whether the intervention of chancery may not for that purpose be required and beneficially applied: Bispham, Eq., \u00a7 484.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">But, as already intimated, it is not our purpose to elaborate subjects that have been so fully and ably discussed by the learned master, and correctly disposed of by the court below. The unjustifiable interference of the defendants would perhaps have warranted the court in going a step further than it did, and imposing the costs on them, but that question is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at. the costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
