The provisions of Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will, dated June 23, 1855, so far as material to the questions raised, were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-5\">All the rest and residue of the property and estate to me belonging or subject to my appointment I devise and appoint unto my brothers, John Large aud James Large, their heirs and assigns, In Trust for the sole and separate use of my children, James L.

Kenower, 7 W. &amp; S. 288; Physick\u2019s App., 50 Pa. 128, the master was of opinion that Mrs. Mifflin took but a life estate in the premises described in the deeds referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">2. Did the existence of the powers in said deeds, or either of them, enable her to dispose of the fee in the same way as if she had a seisin in fee ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">The master, citing or discussing 2 Chitty\u2019s Bl. Com., 108; 4 Kent, Com., 319; Second Ref. P. Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 223; Ege v. Medlar, 82 Pa. 101; Lancaster v. Dolan, 1 R. 248; Drusadow v. Wilde, 63 Pa. 170, examined the contention of the respondents, that while the existence of the powers conferred might not absolutely vest a fee, yet that it gave to their possessor such attributes of ownership over the estate that she might be considered as enabled to make all dispositions thereof which could be made by the owner of the fee; and he was \u2022of the opinion that the question was ruled by Smith\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 492; and, studying that case and Sugden on Powers, Law Lib. ed., 495*; Lewis on Perp., 83*, 84*, 482*; Gray on Perp., \u00a7 524; Gray v. Hammersley, 3 Sim. 513 ; Barford v. Street, 16 Ves. 135; Irwin v. Farrer, 19 Ves. 86; Reith v. Seymour, 4. Russ. 263 ; Scott v. Joslyn, 26 Beav. 174; Hughes v. Wells, 9 Hare 749; Birdsall v. Richards, 18 Pa. 256; Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492, he did not find that there was any authority which justified him in holding that an unexercised power of appointment could be of any avail in supporting the dispositions made in Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will; it seemed to the master that she did not have an estate in fee simple, and that the mere fact that she was the donee of certain powers of appointment during her life, which she did not exercise, would not prevent the appointment, under the powers which she did exercise, from being, read into the original instrument under the rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">3. ' Were the limitations in Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will good, as appointments-under her powers ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">The master held:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-9\">\u201c The answer to this question is to be found in Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 492, already cited. It being conceded or demonstrated that the provisions of Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will are to be interpreted as if read into Exhibits A and B, the conclusion follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that by those deeds it was attempted to do what the rale against perpetuities forbids, viz., to limit an estate for the life of a person not in being. The case now under consideration is, indeed, a stronger case than Smith\u2019s Appeal. In Smith\u2019s Appeal the rule against perpetuities was held to have been violated, because the dispositions of the will then in question <em>might </em>have resulted in limiting an estate for a life not in being; here they actually <em>did </em>so result. William Mifflin, the complainant, was not bom until between six and seven years after the deed of 1813 was executed. Reading the provisions of his mother\u2019s will into that deed, and the instrument will be a declaration by John Large (the trustee) that he is seized in fee of certain real estate in trust for Mrs. Mifflin for life, with remainder to her son, William Mifflin (born six years after the date of the deed), for life, with remainder to his children in fee, but with a power of appointment given to him to limit, by his will, the estates of his children upon the same trusts as those declared in his mother\u2019s will in respect to himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-5\">u To state the substance of this deed with the language of Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will incorporated in it, is to demonstrate that this case is upon this question ruled by Smith\u2019s Appeal. I therefore think that the limitations in Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will, so far as they relate to property included in deeds A and B, are invalid, inasmuch as they cause those instruments to offend against the rule forbidding perpetuities. Mrs. Mifflin, therefore, is to be considered as having died without exercising her power of appointing by will, so far as these properties are concerned ; and her children, therefore, took remainders in fee which were not directed by her will, but which passed by their wills, if any, or if none, under the intestate laws. The trustee under her will, I suppose, took the dry legal estate by virtue of her devise to him, but he was seized thereof, as the trusts declared by her were invalid as to said properties, under the evidence in this cause, as to one sixth in trust for the defendant J. Sergeant Price, as trustee under the will of James L. Mifflin, deceased, and as to five sixths in trust for the complainant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b243-6\">Considering next the question whether the rights of \u25a0 the plaintiff had been affected by lapse of time, or by any family settlement, in the light of the facts in evidence as governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>by the principles of cases discussed: Burkholder\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 37; Wilen\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 124; Follmer\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 121; Hagerty v. Albright, 52 Pa. 274; Downes v. Bullock, 25 Beav. 54, affirmed in 9 H. of L. 1, the master concluded by recommending an interlocutory decree that the complainant was entitled to the five sixth interest in the premises described in the two assurances ; that a partition of said real estate be had and the share of the complainant set off to him in severalty ; that an account should be had between the parties, and that the plaintiff should be entitled to be recouped out of the trust fund the over-payments made to the defendants for the six years last past, by reason of the mistake in paying to them one half instead of one sixth of the rents, issues' and profits and income of said premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-4\">It was alleged in various exceptions filed by the defendants that the foregoing report of the master was erroneous, for the reasons, inter alias:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-5\">1. Because the master erred in reporting in respect to the premises described in deed marked Exhibit A, and appended to this exceptant\u2019s answer, that the same were not affected or controlled by the will of Sarah L. Mifflin, deceased, and that in respect to the same premises her will infringed upon the rule against perpetuities.2</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-6\">2. Because the master has. erred in reporting in respect to the premises described in deed marked Exhibit B, and appended to this exceptant\u2019s answer, that the same were not affected or controlled by the will of Sarah L. Mifflin, deceased, and that in respect to the same premises her will infringed upon the rule against perpetuities.3</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-7\">3. Because the master has erred in awarding partition of the two parcels of realty referred to in the foregoing two exceptions, or either of them, in the' manner and form contained in his report.4</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-8\">The said exceptions having been overruled by the master after due consideration, they were then renewed in court, and on the argument thereof, the court, Hare, P. J., on November 26, 1887, filed the following opinion and decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-9\">By deeds dated June 9, 1813, and March 19, 1816, respect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ively, as annexed to the complainant\u2019s bill, Sarah Mifflin took an estate for life in the premises in controversy, with a general power of appointment by deed or will. She devised the land to her children for life, with power to appoint the same by any instrument in the nature of a will, with remainder to their children; and the question is whether such an execution of the power conferred by the deeds is valid in favor of the grandchildren who claim under it, or fails as tending to a perpetuity, because they might have been, as some of them actually were, born after the delivery of the deeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-5\">Agreeably to the view taken by Mr. Gray, a perpetuity is an estate or interest which, from its indestructibility and incapacity for alienation, if the law tolerated it, might be transmitted indefinitely, under the authority conferred by the original donor, without power on the part of the holders to treat it absolutely as their own, or blend it with the mass of property which each successive owner may dispose of as he thinks proper: Gray on Perpetuities, \u00a7\u00a7 140, 141, 526. Such also substantially is the definition given by Chief Justice Gibson, in Hillyard v. Miller, 10 Pa. 334, and adopted in Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 495.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\">Reasoning from these premises we are led to a conclusion favorable to the defendants. In whatever words an estate is conferred, and although it be only for life, it cannot, agreeably to the above view, be a perpetuity, if the holder is clothed with power that will enable him to set aside the limitations imposed by the original grantor and confer an absolute interest on himself or on another person. Such a tenant is, so far as he himself is concerned, and in every essential particular, as much an owner as if he had the fee, and the property would descend at his death to his heirs. He can at any moment loose the bonds by which it is fettered and render it as available for the purposes of life and business as if there were no settlement. It is not therefore surprising that the English courts should have held that when property is settled on A. for life, with power to will and convey, he may make any disposition of it which would be valid if he were absolutely the owner; and, in determining whether the limitations which he creates contravene the rule against perpetuities, the computation will date from the period when the power is exercised, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and not from the execution of the instrument by which the power was conferred. The rule came to us from England, and was formulated there by judges who, from Taltarum\u2019s Case to the present day, have shown themselves indisposed to tolerate any scheme of settlement which would unduly extend the authority of an owner beyond the grave, and enable him to subject future generations to his caprice or wishes. We should not, therefore, deviate from the path which the English courts have marked out, unless some decision in this state points in a different direction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">Smith\u2019s Appeal, above cited, is said to be such a case. The testator, Lewis Ryan, there devised his property in trust for the sole and separate use of his daughters for life, and immediately on the death of any of them, to pay over the principal sum to such person or persons as such daughter might direct by any instrument of writing in the nature of a last will and testament. One of the testator\u2019s daughters, Mrs. Smith, died some years afterwards, and her will gave all the residue of her estate, including that which she was authorized to appoint under her father\u2019s will, in trust for her sons and daughters for life, and upon their deaths to assign the same to such person or persons for such estates as they should appoint by will. The question was, whether this execution of the power was valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-6\">It seems to have been taken for granted, both by court and counsel, that the interest conferred by Ryan\u2019s will was indestructible and would therefore be a perpetuity, if it could be prolonged, under the authority conferred by him, beyond a life or lives in being at his death, and twenty-one years after-wards. The' test consequently was to write the clause of Mrs. Smith\u2019s will when executed, into the will of Lewis Ryan, when it -would clearly be bad, as including children -born after his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-7\">This conclusion would seem to be sound from whatever point of view it may be regarded. The power conferred on Mrs. Smith was to be exercised by an instrument which could not take effect until after her death, and did not take the case out of the rule that nothing can be done under a power which could not have been done by the donor. The reason is so clearly stated by Mr. Gray that I will not attempt to put it in other words. \u201cIf a man who has a vested limited interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>property has the present unconditioned right to turn that limited interest into an absolute interest, and thus to acquire the present unconditioned, absolute interest, he is regarded by the rule against perpetuities as already having such interest. A tenant in tail is such. A life tenant, with a general power exercisable by deed is also such a person. To this extent, the rule sacrifices form to substance, but the substance must be there. There must be a person with a vested limited interest, who has the immediate right to become the present absolute owner. Such is not the case when a life tenant has a power which he can exercise only by will. The general rule must govern unless the exception is made out, and the exception is not made out, unless there be a present right to acquire the present absolute interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-5\">If the above reasoning is correct, and it is not easy to discern a flaw, the life tenant in Smith\u2019s Appeal was, and the life tenant in this case was not, within the rule of perpetuities. The deeds under which the testatrix, Sarah Mifflin, acquired the property in dispute, authorized her to agree with any person or persons for the sale and purchase of the premises, and by deed or deeds of conveyance to grant the same to the purchaser or purchasers thereof in fee simple, and the money so derived to apply in such manner as she <em>may see </em>fit. The deed set forth in Exhibit A is to the same effect. Although the power so conferred on Mrs. Mifflin was \u201cto sell and convey,\u201d there is, I think, little doubt that she might have executed it by a deed of bargain and sale for a nominal consideration, in trust to reconvey to herself; because she was authorized to apply the purchase money as she saw fit, and whether this was much or little, concerned no one but herself. If this inference is just, she liad an immediate right to become the present absolute owner, and even if a trust to reconvey would have been beyond the scope of the power, she could undeniably have vested an absolute interest in the buyer, and so put the property beyond the scope of a rule which only applies where the holder\u2019s estate is indestructible. A power to sell, and re-invest the purchase money for the same uses, would stand on a different footing; but that cannot well be a perpetuity which may be converted at any time into a fee simple, and, together with its proceeds, given, sold, or otherwise disposed of, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>parties interested may desire. We may therefore infer that the judgment in Smith\u2019s Appeal is consistent with the rule against perpetuities as therein defined, and the conclusions drawn by Gray and other writers of like repute, and tends to sustain rather than condemn the execution of the power now before us. If the declaration in Smith\u2019s. Appeal that the test of the execution of a power is to write the word in the instrument through which the power came, had been laid down as a universal rule, we should have applied it unhesitatingly from deference, to the tribunal by which it was enunciated, but the language of a court must be taken relatively to the subject-matter, which in that instance was a perpetuity, while in this it is a destructible estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">It seems proper to add, that the master, to whom we are indebted for much valuable light, would have reported in favor of the defendants, had the powers conferred by the deeds of June, 1813, and March, 1816, been exercised, but he was of opinion that a destructible estate is within the rule against perpetuities, unless it is actually destroyed. In the absence of an authority directly on the point, it cannot be regarded as settled. But the view which we have taken seems to be in accordance with the definition of a perpetuity given in Smith\u2019s Appeal, and the cases there cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">The exceptions to the master\u2019s report, saving the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, are sustained, and a decree will be made to carry out the conclusions at which we have reached.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-7\">A decree having been entered accordingly, the complainant took this appeal, specifying as error, inter alia:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-8\">1.

Mrs. Sarah Mifflin died seised of but a life estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-14\"><em>(a.) </em>The conveyances in trust were expressly for her natural life, with remainder to her children, and with limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>over. Under such limitations she had but a life estate and her children took by purchase: Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9; Chew\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 23; and the ulterior limitations, after the remainder to children, did not enlarge her life estate: Melsheimer v. Gross, 58 Pa. 412; Sheets\u2019 Est., 52 Pa. 268. In Stewart v. Kenower, 7 W. &amp; S. 228, the estates united because there were no children; as the court stated, it was an union sub modo.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">(5.) Mrs. Mifflin had two powers: To direct a sale in her lifetime; to appoint by instrument to take effect after her death: Neither enlarged her express life estate into a fee. When she devised, it was solely by the power of appointment. The distinction is between an express estate for life, with additional powers superadded, and an estate the quantity of which is not defined, and additional powers are added. In the former case the intention is clear, and the superadded powers do not enlarge the previous life estate. When she conveys, it is by the power.and not as absolute owner, and the test is, the requisites of the power must be obeyed: Second Ref. P. Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 223; Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 497; Yarnall\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 342; Hinkle\u2019s App., 116 Pa. 490; 2 Chitty\u2019s Bl. Com. 108 n.; Kent\u2019s Com., 8th ed., 526 ; Earp\u2019s App., 75 Pa. 119; Ege v. Medlar, 82 Pa. 101. The eases cited by appellees were all cases in which the estate of the first taker was not an express life estate: Lancaster v. Dolan, 1 R. 231; Morris v. Phaler, 1 W. 389; Drusadow v. Wilde, 63 Pa. 170.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">II. The limitations by way of appointment in Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s will, transgress the rule against perpetuities, and this case is identical with Smith\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 492, save that in the present case Mrs. Mifflin possessed powers of sale which she did not exercise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">(A.) Upon principle: The will must be written into the deeds creating the power; for, upon questions of remoteness, a power exercisable by an instrument which can only take effect after the donee\u2019s death, stands upon the footing of a particular power and not of a general power: Smith\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 492; Commonwealth v. Duffield, 12 Pa. 277 ; Commonwealth v. Williams, 13 Pa. 29; Swaby\u2019s App., 14 W. N. 553. The complainant was not born at the creation of the powers, and the limitation over of the ulterior shares to his children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>and issue is to the unborn children and unborn grandchildren of a person who was himself unborn at the creation of the power, which is of course invalid: Lewis on Perp., 413; Williams, Real Property, 228; Leaks v. Robison, 2 Mer. 363 ; Pearks v. Mosely, L. R. 5 App. C. 714; 2 Williams, Executors, 250*, 1250*; Farwell on Powers, \u00a7\u00a7 229, 233; Wollaston v. King, L. R. 8 Eq. C. 165.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-5\">(5.) Upon authority: The case is flatly ruled by Smith\u2019s App., 88 Pa. 492; Gardette\u2019s Est., 13 W. N. 316. Smith\u2019s Appeal is a much weaker case than the present, for there the fact was conceded that all the children were born in the lifetime of the original donor of the power. The court below, however, relied upon a very recent treatise of a living author, Gray on Perpetuities, who reaches his conclusion by denouncing Smith\u2019s Appeal as erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-6\">III. The existence of the unexercised powers of sale does not vary the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">The court below, it is respectfully submitted, fell into the errors: (a.) Of totally mistaking the scope of the power of appointment conferred. The power was limited to a will or an instrument to take effect after the donor\u2019s death. The powers to be exercised by deed were powers of conveyance in Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s lifetime, not powers of appointment. (5.) Of relying upon indestructibility as the main definition of a perpetuity, whereas, first, the estate had become indestructible by reason of the non-exercise of. the dead powers of sale; and second, the only authority quoted and relied upon, says:. \u201c The original meaning of a perpetuity is \u2018 an inalienable,, indestructible interest,\u2019 \u201d and that author only arrives at his conclusions by disregarding Smith\u2019s Appeal: Gray on Perp., \u00a7\u00a7 140, 523. (c.) Of holding that under the deeds a tenant, like Mrs. Mifflin, \u201c is, so far as he himself is concezmed,, and in every essezitial particular, as much an owzzer as if he had the fee, and his property would descezzd to his heirs.\u201d This is clearly erroneous, azzd palpably violates the principle-referred to, that a general power of sale or appointment given, to a life teziant does not enlarge a life tenant\u2019s estate: Ante, I (a.), (5.) The conclusion of the master, that \u201cthe znere fact, that she was the donee of certain powers which she did not. exercise, would not prevent the appointment which she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>exercise from being read into the original instrument,\u201d it is submitted, is sustained by the authorities both in England and Pennsylvania: Hughes v. Wells, 9 Hare 749; Scott v. Josselyn, 26 Beav. 174; Reith v. Seymour, 4 Russ. 263; Barford v. Street, 16 Ves. 135; Irwin v. Farrer, 19 Ves. 86; Flinthave\u2019s App., 11 S. &amp; R. 24; Commonwealth v. Duffield, 12 Pa. 280; Ege v. Medlar, 82 Pa. 100 ; Sugden on Powers, 8th ed., 395; Chance on Powers, \u00a7 1222; Gray on Perp., \u00a7 324; Holmes v. Coghill, 12 Ves. 212; affirming s. c.: 7 Ves. 499; Ex. p. Gilchrist, L. R. 17 Q. B. 521. If not exercised, the power is treated as if it never existed. In fact, an unexercised power is no more property than the power to write a book or paint a picture. It may result in property when exercised, but until then it does not invest the donee with any of the attributes of property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-5\"><em>Mr. J. B. Townsend </em>and <em>Mr. Geo. W. Biddle </em>for the appellees :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">Did the will of Mrs. Mifflin transgress the rule against perpetuities, as to the real estate conveyed by the deeds ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">1. All the authorities: Randall on Perp., 48; Sanders on Uses and Trusts, 96; Lewis on Perp., 164; Folwell on Powers, 226, recognize that the object and purpose of the rule are to put a bar upon the grantor or devisor of a settled or devised estate, to prevent his tying it up unreasonably, so as to keep it out of the hands of any beneficiary who can convey a fee. The moment any owner or beneficiary for life has a general power of appointment, either by deed or will, as he or she may please, this, so far as the rule against perpetuities is involved, is equivalent to the ownership in fee by the possessor of such power, for the reason that all future limitations can be destroyed by such beneficiary, and the property is as fully alienable in his or her hands as if he or she were the fee simple owner. \u201c It is the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power, which puts the possessor of such power on the same footing as an owner, in regard to the application of the rule against perpetuities: \u201d Lewis on Perp., 483, 484. \u201c If property is given to A. for life, with power to appoint it by deed or will to whom he pleases, he has the absolute control of it. There is in truth no future interest; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the life tenant can deal with it as if he owned it in fee. Therefore, in the execution of such a power, the remoteness of the appointment under it is to be judged from the point of time of its exercise, and not from the time of its creation: Gray on Perp., \u00a7 524, citing Gray v. Hammersley, 3 Sim. 513; s. c. sub nom. Bray v. Bree, 2 Cl. &amp; F. 453, and many other authorities. . . 2. \u201c If a man who has a vested limited interest in property, has a present unconditioned right to turn that limited interest into an absolute interest, and thus to acquire the present unconditioned absolute interest, he is regarded by the rule against perpetuities as already having such interest: \u201d Gray on Perp., \u00a7 526. The appointment made by Mrs. Mifflin in her lifetime, under her powers, to a purchaser from her, or her appointment and direction to her trustee to hold the same to the only proper use and behoof of herself, her heirs and assigns, would, under the statute of uses, carry the title pursuant to her appointment so made in her lifetime, and would have vested such title in the appointee, without even the joinder of the trustee under the deeds: Moore v. Shultz, 13 Pa. 98; Rush v. Lewis, 21 Pa. 72; Lewis on Perp., Law Lib. ed., 488. It is not necessary, nor have we advanced the proposition, that Mrs. Mifflin had the fee simple ownership in the premises at the time of her death. She had a life estate and unrestricted powers of absolute disposition by deed or will at her pleasure; and this we maintain placed her actually in the same status, in applying the rule against perpetuities, as if she were the fee simple owner.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-4\">3. The third fallacy of the argument for the appellant is that Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 492, rules this case and requires a reversal of the court below. We do not suppose that we can add any force to the careful analysis and consideration which Judge Hake has given in his opinion, of the decision in Smith\u2019s Appeal, nor to the' clear demonstration that he gives, that it cannot and ought not to rule tins case. They are so totally different in their features that the claim made for it by the appellant as ruling the present case ought surely to be rejected. Mrs. Smith, the tenant for life in Smith\u2019s Appeal, had a special and limited power only, to wit, a power to appoint by will given to her by the will of her father, Mr. Ryan. She had no power in her lifetime to unfetter and convey away the trust estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Mrs. Mifflin had at all times the amplest power to do that very thing. And the law is only concerned to know that the power of free alienation exists, without regarding the quantum of estate vested in the party holding that power.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Opinion,</p>\n<author id=\"Als\">Mr. Justice Green :</author>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">If the element of indestructibility of the estate of the person who, for the time being, is entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, is an essential in the definition of a perpetuity, the decision of the court below is right. In at least two instances, this court has approved a definition which does include that element. Thus in Hillyard v. Miller, 10 Pa. 334, Chief Justice Gibson said: \u201c A perfect definition of a pepetuity has not been given, and the nearest approach to it is found in Lewis on Perpetuities, ch. 12, where it is said to be a future limitation, whether executory or by way of remainder, and of real or personal property, which is not to vest till after the expiration of, or which will not necessarily vest within, the period prescribed by law for the creation of future estates, and which is not destructible by the person for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, except with the concurrence of the person interested in the contingent event.\u201d The same judge in the same opinion said: \u201c It was the indestructibility not only of springing and shifting cases (uses ?) and of executory devises, but also of future trusts, which forced upon the judges the rule against perpetuities, in order to set bounds to the remoteness of not only legal, but equitable limitations ; and it acts upon perpetuities wherever they appear, except in conveyances in mortmain or to charitable uses.\u201d In Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 495, the foregoing extract containing the definition by Lewis was repeated by our Brother Paxson in the course of the opinion which was delivered by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In the definition given by other text writers the same idea is expressed. Gray in his work on the rule against perpetuities, in sections 140 and those which follow, clearly points out that a perpetuity is an indestructible and inalienable interest in its original sense; and, while he shows that it has another or artificial meaning, to wit, that \u201c it is an interest which will not vest till a remote period,\u201d yet in all his illustrations he shows that interests which were destructible were not perpetuities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>At \u00a7 203' he says: \u201c Thus a future interest, if destructible at the mere pleasure of the present owner of the property is not regarded as an interest at all, and the rule does not concern itself with it. For instance, limitations after an estate tail are never too remote ; the present tenant in tail can destroy them all at any moment by docking the entail.\u201d Again, at \u00a7 443' he says: \u201c A future estate which at all times until it vests is in the control of the owner of the preceding estate, is, for every purpose of conveyancing, a present estate, and is therefore 'not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities.\u201d Under the head of Powers, at \u00a7 477 he says : \u201c A power given to the unborn child of a living person is too remote ; that is, if it is a power to be exercised by will only, or a special power to be exercised by deed. But if such unborn child has a general power to appoint by deed, he has the absolute control exactly as if he had the fee, since he can at once appoint to himself. Such general power to appoint by deed is therefore not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities; \u201d citing Bray v. Hammersley, 3 Sim. 513. Again, at \u00a7 524: \u201c If property is given to A. for life with power to appoint it by deed or will to whom he pleases, he has the absolute control over it. There is in truth no future interest; the life tenant can deal with the property as if he owned it in fee. Therefore, in the execution of such a power, the remoteness of an appointment under it is to be judged from the point of time of its exercise, and not from the time of its creation; \u201d citing a number of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Mr. Lewis in his work on Perpetuities, on p. 483 says, \u201cThe great aim of the law against remoteness is secured in the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power.\u201d Farwell on Powers, p. 226, says, \u201c The rules against perpetuities apply to instruments executing powers, as well as to other instruments ; but there is an important distinction between general and particular powers in this respect. The donee of a general power is virtually the absolute owner of the property on which his power extends, and he is regarded as absolute owner for the purpose of considering the application of the rule against perpetuities to him.\u201d In Gray\u2019s work at section 526 <em>i </em>the author says : \u201c And if a man who has a vested limited interest in property has the present unconditioned right to turn that limited interest into an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>absolute interest, and thus to acquire the present unconditioned absolute interest, he is regarded by the rule against perpetuities as already having such interest. A tenant in tail is such a person; a life tenant with a general power exercisable by deed is also such a person. To this extent the rule sacrifices form to substance, but the substance must be there. There must be a person with a vested limited interest who has the immediate right to become the present absolute owner. Such is not the case when a life tenant has a power which he can exercise only by will. The general rule must govern unless the exception is made out, and the exception is not made out unless there be a present right to acquire the present absolute interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In Lewis on Perpetuities, at page 484, the author speaking of general powers says: \u201c Of this kind is a limitation of property to such uses or upon such trusts as A. shall appoint, and subject to any appointment to A. in fee, or to B. in fee, or to any other person or succession of persons for life, in tail, in fee or otherwise. In such cases, as the power is so general and absolute as to be equivalent, for the purposes of alienation, to the ownership in fee simple, an appointment under it, so far as concerns the proper period for the vesting of the interests thereby conferred, rests on the same footing with an original conveyance. Nor is there any greater tendency to a perpetuity in a general power of appointment over property, and the possibility of the exercise of such power in opposition to the laws of remoteness, than in a simple absolute right of ownership. The general power authorizes as complete and as immediate a disposition of the property as could be effected were the donee entitled to the fee or absolute interest; and it is of course clear that such a power may be exercised by the donee in favor of himself. And, as regards the estate limited in default of appointment, when not given to the donee of the power, there can be no necessity to consider how far a perpetuity may be created; because, although that estate may be defeated at any time by an exercise of the power, yet the great aim of the laws against remoteness is secured in the immediate and unrestrained alienability of the property by means of the power. It may be true that any alienation of the property must be merely and simply by virtue of the power, and th\u00e1ft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the exercise of such' power must take effect by reference to the'deed or will creating it, and, so far, a necessity may seem to exist, for restricting the donee to the appointment of interests which would have been good if limited in the original will or settlement; but if the essence of a perpetuity be wanting in the nature of the power, or rather if the scope and spirit of the power be directly adverse to a perpetuity, it seems too much to argue that it will not authorize limitations which might have been created by a person having the absolute dominion, <em>i. e., </em>such limitations as will necessarily vest within lives in being and twenty-one years, computed from the time at which they are raised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHp\">The foregoing views are undoubtedly correct; they are not at all impeached by text writers or decisions. In our opinion they control this case. As a matter of course, if Mrs. Mifflin had actually executed the power of sale and caused the title to be conveyed to herself in fee simple, as she had the plain right to do, the limitations of her will would have to be determined upon their own merits, regarding her as the owner in fee and disregarding the previous state of the title. But so far as the application of the rule against perpetuities is concerned, the situation is precisely the same as if she had executed the power. For the question i.s, whether the provisions of the original deeds of 1818 and 1816 are inoperative because of the rule against perpetuities. They are, if they create inalienable and indestructible estates, to continue longer than the prohibited period. But the estate of Mrs. Mifflin was neither inalienable nor indestructible. It was destructible by her own act. It was entirely within her power to become the owner in fee simple of the estates granted and to totally defeat any ulterior limitations. It proves nothing to say she did not exercise her power and .that therefore the situation is the same as though she never had the power. For certain purposes and in certain cases that, of course, is true. But in considering merely the application of the rule against perpetuities, it is not true, because that rule requires that the estates in question should be indestructible, and an estate which can be destroyed by the person who holds it for the time being is not indestructible.</p>\n<p id=\"AE2L\"><em>We </em>do not think it necessary to follow the learned counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>on both sides, through the very able and interesting discussions contained in their paper boobs. We will say, however, that Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa . 492, does not control this case. Mrs. Smith had only a limited \u00a1lower -of appointment by will which, of course, could only operate after her death. She could in no manner acquire the title herself, and her estate was an indestructible one, whereas Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s estate was destructible beyond all question. In our opinion the-learned court below was right in the view taken of Mrs. Mifflin\u2019s estate and therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The decree is affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
