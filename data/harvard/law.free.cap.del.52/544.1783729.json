C. </em>\u00a7 302, relating to the maximum hours and days of employment of female employees. It was alleged therein that defendant employed females to work more than six days during the period of March 30th through April 5th, 1959, inclusive; with permitting females to work more than ten hours in one day during that period and with employing females to work more than fifty-five hours during that period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Defendant pleaded <em>nollo contendere </em>as to the counts relating to certain of the employees and filed a motion to dismiss as to the remaining counts. The motion was denied and a minimum fine imposed on each count of each Information. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The Diamond State Telephone Company was permitted without objection to intervene as <em>Amicus Curiae.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The trial judge, conceding that the term \u201ccalendar week\u201d has been frequently interpreted as referring to a period of seven days, beginning immediately after midnight on Saturday night and ending at midnight on the following Saturday night, stated that the meaning of these words was not fixed and that they varied with their use. He further held that the words \u201ccalendar week\u201d and the word \u201cweek\u201d, as used in the statute, are apparently intended to refer to the same method of computing time. He stated that they must be interpreted in their context and in accordance with the purpose or purposes behind the statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">The trial judge found that the obvious purpose of the statute is to protect the health of female employees. He noted that under defendant\u2019s interpretation thereof, a female employee could be required to work twelve days in a row provided such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>week was evenly split by the start of a new calendar week and provided further that the employee had a day off before and after the twelve-day period. He made similar comparisons relative to the period of ten hours a day and the fifty-five hour work week. He then stated that the practical application of the opposing interpretations led him to conclude that the State\u2019s interpretation was in accord with the purpose of the statute and with the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Defendant contends that there is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of the statute; that even in the event of such ambiguity, the only common and approved usage of the term \u201ccalendar week\u201d is that meaning a period of seven days from Sunday to Saturday inclusive. Defendant avers that the \u201cpractical application\u201d of the statute by the trial judge has no support in the legislative history of the statute or in logic and is, moreover, inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">19 <em>Del. C. </em>302, the applicable statute, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, no female shall be employed or permitted to work in an establishment or office to which this chapter applies, more than 6 days in any one calendar week, nor more than 10 hours in any one day, or more than 55 hours in any one week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">\u201c(b) Any female may be permitted to work 12 hours in one day only of each week, on the condition that her total hours of employment for any week shall not exceed 55 hours. * * *99</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-9\"> As originally enacted on March 20, 1913, 27 <em>Del. </em>L., Ch. 175, the statute contained the prohibition against a female working more than ten hours in any one day or more than fifty-five hours in any one \u201cweek\u201d. As amended on March 22, 1917, 29 <em>Del. L., </em>Ch. 230, the prohibition against employing females more than six days in any one \u201ccalendar week\u201d was inserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>We think that the language of the statute is clear and needs no construction. It is not disputed that absent any language therein requiring a contrary construction or showing a contrary intent, the words \u201ccalendar week\u201d must be construed to mean a week beginning at midnight on Saturday and ending at midnight on the following Saturday. <em>Sonoma County v. Sanborn, </em>1 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 26, 36 <em>P. </em>2d 419; <em>Syversen v. Suffer, Misc., </em>140 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 774, affirmed 1 <em>A. D. </em>2d 897, 150 <em>N. Y. S. </em>2d 551; <em>Scilley v. Red Lodge-Rosebud Irr. Dist., </em>83 <em>Mont. </em>282, 272 <em>P. </em>543; <em>King County v. City of Seattle, </em>7 <em>Wash. </em>2d 236, 109 <em>P, </em>2d 530. See <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary </em>(2d ed.). In 1 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 303, it is stated that words and phrases shall be construed according to common and approved usage of the English langauge. Giving the words \u201ccalendar week\u201d their common and approved usage, we find that these words, as used in 19 <em>Del. </em>C. \u00a7 302, refer to the period from midnight Saturday to midnight the following Saturday. It follows that the word \u201cweek\u201d as used thereafter in this section relates hack to \u201ccalendar week\u201d and must therefore be given the same meaning. See 2 <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 4908, p. 393.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The cases of <em>Griffith v. Griffith, </em>1 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>(31 <em>Del.) </em>1, 108 <em>A. </em>209, and <em>Bozman v. Bozman, 2 W. W. Harr. </em>(32 <em>Del.) </em>45, 118 <em>A. </em>657, cited by defendant, do not require a contrary conclusion. Both of these cases involved an interpretation of the Divorce Act <em>(Rev. Code </em>1915, Ch, 86), 13 <em>Del. C. </em>\u00a7 1501 <em>et seq., </em>relative to the issuance of an alias summons in divorce in the absence of personal service, by providing for publication for \u201cone month\u201d. The Court stated that this meant a calendar month, which it interpreted to mean a month ending on the day of the next succeeding month corresponding to the day in the month on which the first publication was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The term \u201ccalendar month\u201d is commonly defined in two different senses: (1) Any of the months as adjusted in the calendar, and (2) the time from any day of any month to the corresponding time of the next month. <em>Webster\u2019s International Die</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number><em>tionary </em>(2nd ed.). In both of these cases the Superior Court approved the latter of these commonly used definitions. This is not the situation here. There is only one commonly used interpretation of \u201ccalendar week\u201d and that is as contended by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We think there is nothing in the statute requiring a different interpretation or which would permit the elimination therefrom of the word \u201ccalendar\u201d, nor is there a rule of construction so requiring. 2 <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 4926, p. 462. In fact, the presumption is strong that the Legislature hy the use of the word \u201ccalendar\u201d in the amendment intended to give a different meaning, or at least to clarify, the language of the statute. A change in the phraseology of the amendment creates a presumption that the Legislature intended a change of meaning. <em>Crawford Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 304, p. 618. An amended statute should he construed as if it had been originally passed in its original form since the amendment becomes a part of the original enactment. <em>Myers v. Fortunato, </em>13 <em>Del. Ch. </em>148, 116 <em>A. </em>623; <em>In re Andrews\u2019 Estate, </em>3 <em>Terry </em>(42 <em>Del.) </em>376, 34 <em>A. </em>2d 700. In so construing the statute as a whole, it is clear that when the word \u201cweek\u201d is used, it relates back to \u201ccalendar week\u201d. To give it any other construction would be to say that the Legislature in one part of the section was referring to a calendar week and in the other parts of the same section to seven days.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Neither do we agree that the \u201cpractical application\u201d of these words demands such a strained construction as given by the trial judge. While it is clear, as the trial judge states, that in some isolated instances a female might work more than fifty-five hours in any given seven days or more than twelve hours in more than one day out of seven, it must be conceded, in general, that the purpose of the statute as defined by the trial judge is carried out. To give to the statute the construction suggested by the State, and as given by the trial judge \u2014 if such a constuction should be desirable \u2014 is a matter for the Legislature rather than the courts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed with instructions that the motions to dismiss shall be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
