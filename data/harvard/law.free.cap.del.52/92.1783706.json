C. </em>\u00a7 1168:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cReturns * * * shall be filed by every taxable * * * on or before the thirtieth day of April in each year, for the preceding year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">30 <em>Del.

Petitioner argues that (1) this section contemplates only civil penalties and is not intended as a criminal statute; and (2) if it is to be deemed a criminal statute it is unconstitutional as an arbitrary attempt to create a conclusive presumption of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">These contentions call for a construction of the three statutes quoted above \u2014 \u00a7 1184(c), \u00a7 1187(e) and \u00a7 1187(f). They are <em>in pari materia </em>and must be construed, if possible, so as to form a consistent pattern. This is a task of some difficulty, for the statutes are poorly drawn, and the exact meaning of \u00a7 1184(c) is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Postponing until later the consideration of \u00a7 1184(c) we note that \u00a7 1187(e) deals generally with the subject of evasion of the \u201crequirements\u201d of the Tax Department <em>(i.e. </em>of the law and regulations) by (1) failing to pay the tax, (2) failing to make, sign or verify the return, (3) failing to supply information, or (4) making a false return or supplying false information. Any of such acts is a criminal offense, provided that the intent to evade is proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">What then is the function of \u00a7 1184(c) ? It deals only with the failure or refusal to make a return or pay the tax \u2014 matters puy \"(a)\u00bf8H \u00a7 Xq paadAoo Xpeoyioads atom pue Xpuapigns what is meant by declaring that one who fails to make a return or pay the tax \u201cis guilty of fraud\u201d? There is no common-law crime of \u201cfraud\u201d as such, and the statute contains no definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">And how can there be a conclusive presumption of \u201cfraud\u201d from the failure to file a return? We think it quite unreasonable to hold that the statute creates the crime of \u201cfraud\u201d and makes the sole test the failure to file a return or pay the tax. Obviously, one may fail to file a return in order to avoid paying taxes; or one may fail to file it through absence, sickness, oversight or simple neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Such a construction would raise a serious constitutional question, for it has been held that the Legislature may not establish by <em>fiat </em>an irrebuttable presumption contrary to the facts. <em>Appeal of Brown, </em>4 <em>Terry </em>(43 <em>Del.) </em>608, 49 <em>A. </em>2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The conclusion must be that although \u00a7 1184(c) is in form a criminal statute, it does not define any crime separate and distinct from the crimes defined in \u00a7 1187 (e), and no indictment can be founded upon its terms. The greatest effect that could be given to it, we think, is that it might be construed to create a <em>prima facie </em>presumption of intent to defraud the State of revenue by failing to make a return or pay a tax, and thus support an indictment under \u00a7 1187(e) charging an intent to evade the requirements of the law. In that view \u00a7 1187(e) and \u00a7 1184(c) could be read together so as to create two kinds of offenses: (1) fraud in the return, and (2) refusal or failure to make the return or pay the tax. Each species of offense would require proof of intent to evade. In the first case the intent must be inferred from the circumstances disclosed; in the second case the intent might be supplied, <em>prima facie, </em>by the statutory presumption found in \u00a7 1184(c). But whatever construction be given \u00a7 1184(c), an indictment must be based on \u00a7 1187(e) and an intent to evade the requirements of the law is an essential ingredient of either species of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The Attorney General seeks to sustain the indictment by suggesting that the phrase \u201cshall be guilty of fraud\u201d in \u00a7 1184(c) is mere surplusage, and \u00a7 1184(c) is to he construed as though it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cIf a taxable fails * * * to make a return * * *, such taxable shall be liable to the penalties provided for fraudulent returns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In this view, \u00a7 1184(c) creates the distinct offenses of failure to file a return and failure to pay the tax aside from any intent to evade the law; that is to say, it prescribes punishment for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The insuperable difficulty with this contention is that if it is accepted \u00a7 1187 (f) becomes wholly superfluous \u2014 indeed meaningless. That section creates the specific offenses of failing to file a return or to pay the tax \u201cwithin 30 days\u201d after the return is due or the tax is payable. No intent to defraud or other specific intent is required to constitute either offense. It is obvious that if the State cannot prove fraud or intent to evade it may proceed criminally against a defaulting taxable under \u00a7 1187(f). But in that case the taxable has a grace period of 30 days. Under the State\u2019s construction of \u00a7 1184(c) a taxable who is a day late in filing his return may be immediately indicted and prosecuted under \u00a7 1184(c). The grace period provided by \u00a7 1187(f) then becomes meaningless. Such an unreasonable construction must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">It follows that the indictment before us is defective because it fails to include a charge of intent to evade, as specified in \u00a7 1187(e), and should have been quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">It is true that the construction we have adopted does not make the pattern of the statutes wholly consistent. Thus, as noticed by the court below, the same penalty is prescribed for an offense under \u00a7 1187(f), involving no fraud, as is prescribed for offenses under \u00a7 1187(e), involving fraud or intent to evade the requirements of the law. But this is an unavoidable consequence of any construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">There remains the question whether the writ of prohibition should issue. The petition charges, as it must, that the court below was without jurisdiction of the cause. Our conclusion is, as above stated, that the indictment is defective. Should we therefore dismiss the petition? We think not. On the face of the petition we had jurisdiction to entertain it. And the result of dismissal would be to allow the prosecution to continue, and thus possibly lead to a futile waste of time. Moreover no new indictment could be found, since more than two years have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>elapsed and the indictment is required to specify a date within the two-year period. The writ will therefore issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">One other point must be noticed. Reindictment of the petitioner, a member of the bar, will be prevented by the statute of limitations. But this does not alter the fact that a member of the bar of this Court has been charged with an unexplained failure to discharge his duty as a citizen. The failure, or refusal, by a member of the bar to perform those duties may well be such a breach of the standards of professional ethics as to require disciplinary action by this Court, irrespective of the failure of a prosecution for the charged violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Prior to the finding of the indictment in this case, the Court had instructed its Censor Committee to investigate publicly known alleged income tax irregularities by certain members of the bar, and to report to the Court with respect to the possibility that such irregularities might require disciplinary action against lawyers involved. Subsequently, the petitioner was indicted and, under instructions from this Court, the Censor Committee deferred its report to this Court pending the disposition of the indictment against the petitioner. This action was taken by us to avoid any suggestion of prejudice for or against the petitioner in his trial on the indictment. Since the issuance of the writ in this case now finally disposes of the criminal charge against the petitioner, there is no reason for further deferring the Censor Committee\u2019s investigation and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The Censor Committee will, therefore, be forthwith instructed to proceed with its investigation and to report its findings concerning the petitioner\u2019s conduct to this Court for such action as may be appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
