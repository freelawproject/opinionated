L. Dabney, as administrator of tl^e estate of Benjamin F. Dabney, deceased, founded on Thomas &amp; Dabney\u2019s indorsement of Thomas J. Harper\u2019s promissory note for $11,100. The declaration averred the indorsement of the note by the partnership name of Thomas &amp; Dabney, in the life-time of Dabney, the demand and non-payment of the note at its maturity, and notice to Pitt Thomas, the surviving partner of Benjamin F. Dabney, deceased. The defendant plead^nonassumpsit. Upon the trial the plaintiff read to the jury the note and indorsement sued on, and then proved a demand and non-payment of the note when it became due, and notice to Pitt Thomas, the surviving partner of the late firm of Thomas &amp;, Dabney, and rested his case. The defendant then proved the plaintiff knew when the note matured, that Benjamin F. Dabney had previously departed this life in Hinds county, in this state, and that the copartnership of Thomas &amp; Dabney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>was consequently dissolved. This was all the evidence offered. After argument the court at the request of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel instructed the jury 11 that if they believed, from the evidence, payment of the note sued on was demanded at its maturity, and notice of non-payment duly served on Pitt Thomas, the surviving partner of the late firm of Thomas &amp; Dabney, they must find for the plaintiff.\u201d To which opinion of the court the defendant excepted. The jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant now brings the case to this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b746-4\"><em>A.

Persons being joint payees of a note, who severally indorse it, are entitled each to notice of non-payment. They being joint, does not necessarily constitute them partners. The act of assembly relied on by the appellant, found in Statute Laws of Mississippi, H. &amp; H. 595, merely affects the remedy and not the right, and was passed to facilitate creditors in obtaining judgment for their just demands against one or all of several partners.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
