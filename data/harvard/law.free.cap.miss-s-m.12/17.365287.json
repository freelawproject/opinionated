During the trial, a plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>was pleaded, alleging that since the last continuance the plaintiffs had transferred the note sued on to the Bank of the United States, contrary to the provisions of the statute of this state, prohibiting the banks of this state from transferring any of their bills receivable. The counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the plea, but the court overruled the objection. They then demurred to it, by filing a general demurrer, with an assignment of special causes ; there was a joinder, and upon argument the demurrer was overruled ; a replication was then filed, a trial upon this issue, and a verdict for the defendants followed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-12\">A motion for a new trial was made by plaintiffs, but it was overruled, and exceptions taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-13\">This short reference to the facts will show the points upon which the plaintiffs rely for a reversal of the judgment of the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b15-14\">\u25a0 And in the remarks we shall make, we shall confine ourselves to the law of the case, as it arises upon the plea of <em>puis darrein continuance. </em>There might be some minor questions arising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>upon the record in this case; but we think the demurrer to the plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>raises fairly and fully the question, whether the provision of the act of the legislature of 1840, recited in the plea, be constitutional and binding on the Planters Bank, or the assignees of any of her assets; or whether that provision is void when brought to bear on the assignment of a note by the Planters Bank of this state. It is upon this question our clients are most desirous for the decision of this court, and this question we will now proceed briefly to discuss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-4\">The provision of the law of 1840, being the 7th section of the laws of Mississippi of that year, will be found on page 1 to 14 of the pamphlet laws of the session of the legislature of that year. It in substance makes it unlawful, and prohibits the banks of this state from transferring, by indorsement or otherwise, any note, bill of exchange, or other evidence of debt, and if it shall appear in evidence, upon the trial of any action upon such note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt, that the same was transferred, the same shall abate on the plea of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">The Planters Bank, then plaintiffs, were incorporated by an act of the legislature, passed on the 10th February, 1830. Rev. Statutes 1824 \u2014 1838, p. 237. The 6th section, p. 240, gives them most extensive rights, powers, and privileges \u2014 as extensive as we recollect ever to have been conferred on a bank by its charter. The plaintiffs are \u201c capable and able in law to have, possess, receive, and enjoy to themselves and successors, lands, rents, tenements, hereditaments, goods, chattels, and effects, of what kind soever, nature, and quality, not exceeding $6,000,000, including the capital stock; and the same to grant, demise, aliene, or dispose of for the good of the bank.\u201d The 17th section authorizes them \u201cto receive money on deposit, discount bills of exchange, and notes, with two or more good and sufficient names thereon,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c to make loans to citizens,\u201d on mortgages, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">In December, 1830, the legislature passed a supplemental act.

So on the 5th February, 1833, another amendatory act was passed. Rev.

Here is an unqualified and express grant to this bank, to dispose of her assets, in any manner, for the good of the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">But independently of this express grant of powers and privileges to this corporation, it is incident to it, at common law, to purchase and aliene lands and chattels, unless restrained by the charter or laws in force <em>at the time of the grant of the charter. </em>2 Kent\u2019s Com. 277, 281.

And how much stronger is the case there presented against the validity of the act of the bank than in the present instance 7 If a bank, by no greater powers conferred on it by its charter, can take in pledge, to secure a debt, cotton, and dispose of the same, surely she could dispose of a debt to pay a debt, or for any such purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Again.

The right of disposition impliedly exists, coextensively with the right of acquisition, whether derived from a grant to an individual, or a grant of a charter to a corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\">But besides, \u201c Every corporation, unless expressjy forbidden, has by implication the power to do such acts as are essential to its existence, or necessary to enable it to perform its functions.\u201d Same opinion of High Court, citing <em>2 </em>Al.

For if the banks of this state had not the right to transfer their paper at the time of the passage of this act, why pass the act 7 If they have not the right under the charter, then counsel have wholly misconceived this-case; I may add, too, on both sides of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\">We submit, then, that we have shown that the bank, not only as incident to it as a corporation, but by the express language of the grant itself, has by that grant the right to transfer her bills receivable. This right or power is prohibited by the 7th section of the law referred to, -and the remaining question for our consideration is, whether that section be constitutional or not. As this 'is -the only section bearing on the case, we will confine ourselves to it. Whether the residue of the statute be constitutional or not cannot affect the decision of the court upon this provision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-8\">We insist, then, that this section violates that provision of the constitution of the United States, which prohibits <em>\u201c </em>a state from passing a law impairing the obligation of a contract,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and violates a similar provision contained in the latter clause of the 18th section of 1st article in the constitution of this state. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-4\">The charter of the plaintiffs is a contract between the people of the state and the bank. The acts of incorporation constitute an executed grant of whatever rights, powers, and privileges are contained in it, and usually incident to such grant. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 305. 6 Cranch\u2019s Rep. 88, 89. Ib. 43. 1 Paige, 102. <em>Dartmouth College </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>4 Wheat. Rep. 518, 697, 700. Besides, it is a private corporation. \u201c A bank, whose stock is owned by private individuals, is a private corporation, although its objects and operations partake of a public nature, and although government may have become a part owner, by sharing in the stock.\u201d 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 274. <em>United States Bank </em>v. <em>Planters Bank, </em>Ang. &amp; Ames, 21. 9 Wheat. Rep. 907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-6\">The question then resolv\u00e9s itself into this \u2014 \u201c to this complexion it must come at last \u201d \u2014Whether this court will maintain the doctrine, that the legislature may repeal or modify, or in any way impair charters granted to associations of individuals, forming <em>private </em>corporations, by <em>subseqent </em>legislation. But indeed it is no question at all; such a doctrine will not be entertained for a moment by this court. When the <em>constitution, </em>which the judges are sworn to support, and an act of the legislature come in conflict, the latter will be pronounced void. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 305. 6 Cranch R. 88. 7 Ib. 154. 9 Ib. 43, 292. <em>Dartmouth College Case, </em>4 Wheat. 518, 697, 700.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">This last case, we believe, has settled the law upon this subject ; and our state convention, in 1832, with this knowledge, inserted the provision we have referred to, knowing that the prohibition would extend to any legislation touching private corporations and their franchises, as effectually, as to legislative interference with the grant or vested rights of an individual.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">Again ; if the law impairs or alters, in the slightest degree, any of the rights or powers of the corporation, secured to it by its charter, it is equally void, as if it attempted a repeal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>whole charter. 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 305. <em>Green </em>v. Riddle, 8 Wheat. Rep. 1, 84.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\">And whether the power or right attempted to be altered or destroyed be an express one contained in the grant or charter, or an implied one, as incident to the corporation, the principle is the same. The attempt is equally a violation of the constitution. <em>People </em>v. <em>Manhattan </em>Company, 9 Wend. Rep. 351, 383, 392, 393.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">We have then shown, we trust, that the plaintiffs have, under their charter, the right to transfer the note sued on to the Bank of the United States. That the 7th section of the law of 1840, prohibiting them from doing so, interferes with this vested right, and is in direct violation of the provisions of the constitution of the United States and this state, and consequently that that <em>section is </em>absolutely void and of no effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">And it might be further urged that this 7th section, while it strikes at the rights of the bank, strikes equally at the rights of the creditor; prevents him from taking the assets of the bank in payment of a debt, or for any other purpose, and on this ground is equally unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">But it may be contended, by the opposite counsel, that the latter part of the 7th section redeems the first part from all objections on the score of unconstitutionality. The latter clause provides merely for the <em>abatement </em>of the suit <em>on the </em>plea of the defendant. But we insist that this provision is as obnoxious to the constitutional objection, as the other provision in the section. Admitting, for argument sake, that the bank might still sue on the return of the evidence of debt to her, after an abatement of the suit in the name, or for the use of the assignee, it takes away all remedy upon the transferred paper from the assignee, and is therefore, we insist, unconstitutional and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">How far the legislature may vary the remedy, or protract or delay it, without infringing on the right, presents, in many cases, a delicate and difficult question to decide. But when the remedy is <em>altogether </em>taken away, we believe there can be no difference of opinion as to the unconstitutionality of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>legislation. A right, without a legal remedy to enforce it, or to protect it, is no legal right at all. No <em>legal </em>obligation of a contract can exist, where there is no legal remedy; and the law which impairs or destroys the remedy, impairs or destroys the obligation. And if in legislation the effect of impairing the obligation of \u2022 the contract is produced, <em>\u201c </em>it is immaterial whether it is done by acting on the remedy, or directly on the contract itself. In either case it is prohibited by the constitution \u201d of this state, as well as of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\">How strong and how applicable the language of the supreme court of the United States, in the case of <em>Green </em>v. Riddle, 8 Wheat. R. 1, 75, 76.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">This doctrine is reiterated by the same court, in the case of <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Kinzie, et al, </em>decided at January Term, 1843. 1 How. Sup. Court U. S. Rep.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">We have thus briefly discussed the leading questions we conceive to be involved, in this case. If we are correct in the grounds we have insisted upon for a reversal of the judgment of the court below, we think this court can have no dif\u00f1culty as to the judgment to be pronounced. If the court shall sustain the demurrer to the plea of <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>the judgment in this court will be entered for the amount of the note sued on and interest. For the plea of <em>puis darrein continuance </em>is a waiver, on the part of the defendants, of all former pleas and issues in the case. It reposes the defence on this plea alone. <em>Yeates </em>v. <em>Linn, </em>5 Pet. R. 224, 231. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>McConnell, </em>13 Pet.

The doctrine, that corporations are subject to subsequent legislation, has already been recognized by this court, in the case of <em>The Commercial Bank of Manchester v. Nolan, et als. </em>This statute is a general one, in reference to all banks in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Corporations, like individuals, are subject to legislative action ; and hence all contracts made by them, in contravention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>of the general laws of the land, are voidable, or may be void by force of statutory provision.\u201d Ang. &amp; Ames on Corp. 142.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-4\">In England, the statute of 15th Geo. 2d, chap. 13, prohibited <em>any body </em>corporate, or any other <em>persons in partnership exceeding </em>six, from borrowing, owing, or <em>taking </em>up any money, on their bills or notes payable at demand,'or at any less-period than six months from the-borrowing; but did not expressly avoid securities ill contravention of the act.\u201d A. &amp; A. 144. This statute was certainly more objectionable than the one now before the court, as it postponed the execution of contracts already entered into. Yet this statute was held to be good. Our statute does not render the securities transferred - void, but simply declares the transfer unlawful, and abates the suit on proof of the transfer of the note or bill sued on. It does not prevent the bank from collecting the amount due on her notes or bills receivable, but simply prohibits the bank from conferring that power on other persons. Does this divest the bank of any vested rights specially granted by the charter <em>1 </em>The bank had a right to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, but had no power to authorize other persons to sue on its own contracts. /</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">The object of <em>the </em>creation of the bank was to loan money, and to take security for the repayment of the same, and the right to sue enabled it to collect money on such securities. The right of the bank, if any, to transfer her bills and notes, was an implied right, and by no means essential to attain the ends of the corporation; and therefore the prohibition of the legislature divests no positive grant, and is not <em>ex post facto </em>in its operation. But if the court shall be of a different opinion, and shall pronounce that part of the statute unconstitutional, which prohibits the transfer of its paper, they will certainly not deny that the legislature have the power to regulate the <em>legal remedies </em>on the contracts of banking corporations, and to declare what matters may be pleaded in abatement. Statutes of limitation as to time, have never been regarded as impairing the obligation of contracts ; this law limits the right of action to the banks,' on their own bills receivable. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>case the action is brought by the hank, but,the proof shows a transfer in fraud of the law. The bank has lost all interest in the note sued, and is not entitled to prosecute the suit for want of interest. The title in the note is in the United States Bank, (if the law be void,) and the suit must abate for want of interest in the plaintiff.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b23-4\">Mr. Justice Clayton</author>\n<p id=\"A95\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The only point of difference between this case, and that of <em>Payne, Green Wood </em>v. <em>Baldwin, Vail and Huffy, </em>decided at this term of the court, is that in that case the assignment by the PlantersBank appeare d upon the face of the declaration; in this the transfer is set up and relied on by a <em>flea, puis darrein continuance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The object of the legislature, in passing the act of 1840, prohibiting the transfer of their bills receivable and evidences of debt by banks, would seem to have been, to enable the debtors of the banks under all circumstances to pay their debts in the notes of the banks. Hence when the suit is in the name of the bank, and ostensibly for its own use, as the judgment may be satisfied by the payment of its own bills, the case would appear not to'fall within the reason of the law. Yet the terms of the act forbid all transfers. Its words are, <em>\u201c </em>it shall not be lawful for any bank in this state to transfer by indorsement or otherwise, any note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt; and if it shall appear in evidence, upon the trial of any action, upon any such note, or other evidence of debt, that the same was so transferred, the same shall abate, upon the plea of the defendant.\u201d Acts of 1840, p. 15, sec. 7. This language is too plain to admit of more than one construction, and we cannot refuse to enforce it because the case may not seem to come fully within the mischief intended to be remedied. Upon the trial the plea was sustained by the evidence, and the jury found a verdict for the defendants. A judgment <em>in bar </em>was entered by the court, but according to the act it should have been <em>in abatement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">It is now the settled doctrine, that an act prohibited by astat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ute, will not lay the foundation of a suit that can be sustained in a court of law. The penalty annexed to the transgression of this statute is an abatement of the action \u2014 what will be the consequence of such abatement, we are not now called on to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">It is possible that if another suit be brought, and the same matter be pleaded, that a replication that there had been a re-transfer of the instrument to the bank, would enable it to maintain the action. But it is not proper for us to volunteer an opinion in this respect. We have no intention to do so, but simply to mark the limits of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The judgment of the court below must be reversed, because entered in bar, and one here entered in conformity with the statute in abatement.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b24-6\">Mr. Justice Thacher:</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">I concur in the above opinion and judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b24-7\">Mr. Chief Justice Sharkey</author>\n<p id=\"Aq\">delivered the following dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">Although it is with great reluctance that I dissent in any case, yet I cannot bring my mind to the conclusion that this action should be abated on the plea of the defendant. This suit is not brought in the name of an assignee or indorsee, nor is it for the use of a third person, but it is in the name of the Planters Bank, as plaintiff. The assignment of the note since the suit brought is pleaded. The language of the statute is very broad, it is true, but still we must look at its spirit and meaning. If the object of the legislature be apparent, it should be so construed as to accomplish that object, and there it should end. It declares \u201c That it shall not be lawful for any bank in this state to transfer by indorsement or otherwise any note, bill receivable or other evidence of debt; and if it shall appear in evidence, upon the trial of any action upon any such' note, bill receivable, or other evidence of debt, that the same was so transferred, the same shall abate upon the plea of the defendant,\u201d I regard this provision not as a punishment on the bank, by compelling a forfeiture of its right of action, but as intended solely and exclusively for the benefit of bank debtors. Bank paper was then generally very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>much depreciated, and the country was full of this depreciated currency, and it was designed to secure to debtors the right to pay the banks in their own notes. By allowing them to transfer their notes, debtors would have been compelled to pay the indorsees in the constitutional currency. But when the suit is brought in the name of the bank, this difficulty cannot occur. An assignee can then have no control of the matter. The legal rights of parties are determined by the record. If the bank alone is plaintiff of record, all the legal consequences follow and no assignee can change the rights of parties by asserting a claim. The court would not, under such circumstances, recognize the right of any one who was not a party to the record, and when the reason of the law fails the law itself should cease. An assignment made after suit brought, is but a transfer of the proceeds of the suit. The indorsee cannot make himself plaintiff in the suit; nor can he vary the right of recovery, or the defendant\u2019s right to offsets, or his right to make satisfaction in a particular way. I regard the statute as applying only to cases in which the suit is brought in the name of the assignee or for his use. In such cases it gives the defendant the right to have the suit abated or not, at his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">In the case of <em>Payne, Green &amp; Wood </em>v. <em>Baldwin, Vail, and Hufty, </em>(3 S. &amp; M. 661,) we held that the legal right of the bank to sue was not impaired by this act. Any act impairing that right would be unconstitutional. In this action she only seeks to enforce that right, she does not seek to enforce the right of the indorsee. She may sue on her notes, and she must sue in her own name, and if we abate this action, the only remedy she has is to bring another in the same way. There is no defect in the form of the action, or in the legal rights of the parties to the record. The transfer is prohibited by law, and it is therefore either void, or it is voidable. If it be void, it did not change any right. The legal right is still in the bank, and the suit being in her name, how can it be abated by that which was a nullity ? But suppose it be voidable merely, then what does the defendant get rid of by his plea? He gets rid of the assignment only. He remains debtor to the bank instead of being debtor to a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>person. Now I believe such assignments .to be voidable only, subject to be affirmed or avoided by the m'aker. When the action is brought in the name of the indorsee, by pleading the transfer in abatement, the maker gets rid of that action, because the plaintiff\u2019s title fails. But when the suit is.in the name of the bank, she may answer such a plea by saying, admitting it to be true that the note has been transferred, your plea avoids nothing but the transfer; it does not affect our right of action, which does not depend on an indorsement. Such a plea strengthens our right to recover, because it admits a promise made to us,, and avoids the attempted change of that right. As an evidence that the act was only designed to prevent the banks from coercing payment in a sound currency, I may cite the supplemental act, passed.the day after the original act, which compels the banks to receive their notes at par in payment of debts due them. This act was no doubt intended to explain fully, and to .carry out.the original design. Thinking then that this plea was defective in substance, and regarding it as a waiver of all other pleas, my opinion is that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
