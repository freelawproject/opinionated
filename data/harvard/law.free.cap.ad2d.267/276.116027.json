The issues raised on appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p><p id=\"b347-8\">The appellant\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court erred in granting the plaintiff leave to enter a judgment upon her failure to appear and answer is without merit. The plaintiff established its prima facie entitlement to judgment and the appellant failed to proffer any excuse in opposition to the motion, much less a reasonable excuse, for her failure to appear and answer the verified complaint <em>(see, </em>CPLR 3012 [d]; 3215). The appellant\u2019s belated argument that the plaintiff is not a holder in due course of the dishonored check due to a lack of endorsement, raised for the first time on appeal, is unpreserved for appellate review <em>(see, Dufficy v Wharf Bar &amp; Grill, </em>217 AD2d 646; <em>Gordon v Hong, </em>126 AD2d 514). In any event, it is without merit since <em>\u201ca </em>default admits all factual allegations of the complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom\u201d <em>(Silberstein v Presbyterian Hosp., </em>96 AD2d 1096).
