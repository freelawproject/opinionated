In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Mangano, P. J., Ritter, Gold-stein and H. Miller, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
