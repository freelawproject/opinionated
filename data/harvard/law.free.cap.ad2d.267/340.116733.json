Hamilton, Inc., to compel the plaintiffs to accept their answer as timely served and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 cross motion for leave to enter a judgment against them upon their failure to timely appear and answer. Since the respondents did not demonstrate a reasonable excuse for the delay and provide a meritorious defense <em>(see, Santiago v Siega, </em>255 AD2d 307; <em>Pumarejo-Garcia v McDonough, </em>242 AD2d 374), the plaintiffs may enter a default judgment against them. S. Miller, J. P., Thompson, Krausman, Florio and Schmidt, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
