The doctor concluded that the plaintiff sustained a permanent consequential limitation of the use of his left shoulder and neck. The affirmation was based upon, <em>inter alia, </em>the doctor\u2019s review of a magnetic resonance imaging report which, although unsworn, was relied upon by the defendant and therefore was properly before the court <em>(see, Raso v Statewide Auto Auction, </em>262 AD2d 387; <em>Pietrocola v Battibulli, </em>238 AD2d 864, 866).</p><p id=\"b360-6\">The plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability was properly denied since it was untimely pursuant to CPLR 3212 (a). The plaintiffs cross motion was made over 120 days after the filing of the note of issue, and without leave of court on good cause shown <em>(see, Stransky v Tannenbaum, </em>262 AD2d 301). Mangano, P. J., Ritter, Joy, Mc-Ginity and Smith, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
