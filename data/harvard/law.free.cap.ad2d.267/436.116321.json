The \u201creckless disregard\u201d standard requires evidence that the actor has intentionally done an act of an unreasonable character in disregard of a known or obvious risk that was so great as to make it highly probable that harm would follow <em>(see, Szczerbiak v Pilot, </em>90 NY2d 553, 557; <em>Saarinen v Kerr, </em>84 NY2d 494, 501, supra; <em>Campbell v City of Elmira, </em>84 NY2d 505, 510).</p><p id=\"b507-4\">The plaintiff police officer testified at trial that he and his partner were responding to a radio report of a robbery in progress when the accident occurred. Since the officers were thus engaged in an \u201cemergency operation\u201d as defined by statute <em>(see, </em>Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 114-b), the trial court should have instructed the jury, as a matter of law, that the appellant could only be held liable if the conduct of the operator of the vehicle demonstrated a reckless disregard for the safety of others <em>(see, McCarthy v City of New York, </em>250 AD2d 654). In view of the failure to so charge, and the existence of a triable issue of fact as to whether the operator\u2019s conduct rose to the level of reckless disregard <em>(see, Gordon v County of Nassau, </em>261 AD2d 359; <em>McCarthy v City of New York, </em>250 AD2d 654, <em>supra), </em>we grant a new trial.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
