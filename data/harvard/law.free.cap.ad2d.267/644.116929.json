Supreme Court dismissed the petition and we affirm. The issues advanced by petitioner have been or could have been raised in his pending direct appeal or in a CPL article 440 motion <em>(see, People ex rel. Brown v Commissioner of N. Y. State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>252 AD2d 602). Furthermore, we find no circumstances warranting a departure from traditional orderly procedure <em>(see, id.), </em>notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s contention to the contrary.</p><p id=\"b714-7\">Mercure, J. P., Crew III, Peters, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
