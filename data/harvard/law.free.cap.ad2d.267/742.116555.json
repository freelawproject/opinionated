The record establishes that claimant certified for benefits on the days that she received holiday pay, vacation pay or was unavailable for work <em>(see, e.g., Matter of Libes [New York City Bd. of Educ.</em>\u2014Hudacs], 199 AD2d 801, 802). Although claimant suffered from a learning disability, the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that she understood the reporting instructions and that her responses to the certification questions, which she verified, were not attributable to her learning disability. Claimant\u2019s exculpatory explanation for the inaccurate responses to the certification questions merely presented a credibility issue for the Board to resolve <em>(see, Matter of McEwen [Commissioner of Labor], </em>249 AD2d 672). Under the circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the Board\u2019s decision.</p><p id=\"b812-6\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III, Peters and Spain, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
