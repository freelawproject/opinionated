In a portion of the order under review from which the plaintiff did not appeal, the Supreme Court directed the parties to arbitrate this matter. In light of these circumstances, it is clear that the Supreme Court did not err in denying the plaintiffs motion to compel an accounting. This is a matter for the arbitrator, rather than for the Supreme Court, to resolve (see, <em>Matter of Vann v Kreindler, Relkin &amp; Goldberg, </em>supra; <em>see also, Weiss v Kozupsky, </em>237 AD2d 514; <em>Berg v Dimson, </em>151 AD2d 362). Bracken, J. P., Thompson, Friedmann and Smith, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
