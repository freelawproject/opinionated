We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the sentences imposed were harsh and excessive and should be reduced in the interest of justice. The\" record reveals that County Court and the public defender received the presentence investigation report so there is no basis to conclude that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>not considered by the court in sentencing defendant. Given the presumption of regularity afforded to judicial proceedings <em>(see, People v Nazario, </em>253 AD2d 726; <em>People v Kalakowski, </em>120 AD2d 763, <em>lv denied </em>68 NY2d 669) and the fact that defendant was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentences imposed in the interest of justice.</p><p id=\"b671-4\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgments are affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
