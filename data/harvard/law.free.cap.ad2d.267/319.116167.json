O\u2019Brien, J. P., Ritter, Santucci and Florio, JJ., concur.</p>\n<opinion><p id=\"Aaqv\">\u2014Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ruchelsman, J.), rendered October 6, 1997, convicting him of assault in the second degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.</p><p id=\"b389-8\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p><p id=\"b389-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was legally insufficient to establish that he intended to cause serious physical injury is unpreserved for appellate review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]). In any event, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant initially punched the victim, causing him to fall to the ground. Thereafter, the victim got up and went to a nearby fire alarm box to try to summon help. When the victim returned, the defendant repeatedly punched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>him in the face, despite the fact that the victim was bleeding from the ears, nose, and mouth. The victim finally fell to the floor, suffered a fractured skull, a frontal contusion, contusions on both sides of the brain and bleeding inside the brain. Under the circumstances, a jury could have reasonably concluded that the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury <em>(see, People v Martinez, </em>224 AD2d 254, 255; <em>People v Crawford, </em>200 AD2d 683, 684; <em>People v Delgado, </em>167 AD2d 181, 182; <em>People v Figueroa, </em>143 AD2d 767).</p><p id=\"b390-3\">The defendant also failed to preserve for appellate review his contentions that the prosecutor\u2019s impeachment of the codefendant\u2019s witness, and the court\u2019s related jury instructions, violated the rule of <em>People v Dawson </em>(50 NY2d 311; <em>see, People v Douglas, </em>248 AD2d 550). In any event, these claims are without merit.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
