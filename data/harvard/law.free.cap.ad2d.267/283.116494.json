Aronin, J.), dated June 25, 1998, which, among other things, granted the cross motion of the defendants Marie Bazile, s/h/a Marie Darcelin and Greenpoint Bank for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them.</p><p id=\"b353-7\">Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed from, with costs.</p><p id=\"b353-8\">The plaintiff was the successful bidder at a mortgage foreclosure sale. Although he signed the memorandum of sale and made a 10% deposit on the purchase price, the sale was never consummated. He thereafter commenced this action seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>specific performance. However, the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is an application before the court in the underlying foreclosure action, not a plenary action <em>(see, Lane v Chantilly Corp., </em>251 NY 435; <em>Goodwin v Simonson, </em>74 NY 133; <em>National Bank v Van Keuren, </em>184 AD2d 92; <em>Jorgensen v Endicott Trust Co., </em>100 AD2d 647; <em>State Bank v Wilchinsky, </em>128 App Div 485; <em>Burton v Linn, </em>21 App Div 609; 3 Bergman, New York Mortgage Foreclosures \u00a7 30.05 [3]). Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the respondents\u2019 cross motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against them.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
