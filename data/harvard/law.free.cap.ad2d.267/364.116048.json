The issues raised on the appeals from the orders are brought up for review and have been considered on the accompanying appeal from the judgment (see, CPLR 5501 [a] [1]; <em>Musumeci v Musumeci, </em>267 AD2d 365 [decided herewith]).</p><p id=\"b434-8\">A court may impose a sanction against an attorney for frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>lous conduct which includes conduct \u201cundertaken primarily to delay or prolong the resolution of the litigation, or to harass or maliciously injure another\u201d (22 NYCRR 130-1.1 [a], [c] [2]). Here, however, the motion brought by the attorney on behalf of the husband was not frivolous, and no sanction will be imposed. Santucci, J. P., Joy, Friedmann and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
