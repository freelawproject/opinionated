Pursuant to an investigation, it was discovered that claimant had incorrectly completed consulate letters to be forwarded to the Federal government for immigration purposes and also, without following banking procedures, had approved a $45,000 wire transfer, later discovered to be fraudulent, resulting in a substantial loss to the employer. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to disturb the Board\u2019s decision that claimant\u2019s conduct, which disregarded the employer\u2019s best interest, rose to the level of disqualifying misconduct <em>(see, Matter of Hartman [Roslyn Sav. Bank</em>\u2014Commissioner <em>of Labor], </em>257 AD2d 878; <em>Matter of Vinci [Commissioner of Labor], </em>253 AD2d 994; <em>cf., Matter of Donlin [Ross], </em>63 AD2d 1113).</p><p id=\"b623-8\">Mikoll, J. P., Crew III, Carpinello, Graffeo and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the decision is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
