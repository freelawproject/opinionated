According to the first misbehavior report, petitioner told his instructor in a loud voice that if she tried to \u201cticket\u201d him for engaging in \u201chorseplay\u201d, he would \u201cbeat the ticket\u201d and, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cget [her] into a lot of trouble with Albany\u201d. The second misbehavior report, involving an incident occurring the next day between petitioner and the same instructor, was written after petitioner ignored a direct order to proceed with his work correcting papers and, instead, engaged in a social conversation with another inmate. Petitioner\u2019s administrative appeal of these determinations was unsuccessful, prompting him to commence this CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p><p id=\"b723-8\">In our view, the detailed misbehavior reports provide substantial evidence of petitioner\u2019s guilt <em>(see, Matter of Foster v Coughlin, </em>76 NY2d 964, 966), and petitioner\u2019s various exculpatory explanations for his behavior merely raised a credibility issue for the Hearing Officer to resolve <em>(see, Matter of De La Rosa v Portuondo, </em>247 AD2d 810, 811). Notably, his claim that he could not correct papers because of an unrelated injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>his right shoulder was refuted by the facility nurse, who testified that the medical records did not support petitioner\u2019s claim that he could not write with his right hand <em>(see, Matter of Kavazanjian v Goord, </em>264 AD2d 886).</p><p id=\"b724-3\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments, including his claims that one of the misbehavior reports was improperly dated and that the charges were improperly heard at a tier II proceeding, have been examined and found to be unpersuasive.</p><p id=\"b724-4\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Peters, Carpinello and Graffeo, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
