CLARK, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">The appellant, Alex Grote, was convicted under two counts of an information charging him with violating 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, in that, for the years 1975 and 1976, he failed to file income tax returns \u201cstating specifically the items of his gross income and any deductions and credits to which he was entitled.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal he challenges the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury; the exclusion of evidence offered as relevant to his specific intent; the admission of opinion testimony by an IRS agent concerning the \u201cacceptability\u201d to the Service of those 1040 forms filed by the appellant for the two years in question; the adequacy of his arraignment proceedings; his prosecution under an allegedly unpublicized change in agency policy; and the trial court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him based on an arrest warrant issued pursuant to an unverified information. Finding no merit in any of appellant\u2019s contentions of error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">The evidence at trial disclosed that during the years in question the defendant Grote was an employee of the Hill Bookbindery in Austin, Texas. His employer's W-2 forms show that Grote received $10,000 in \u201cwages, tips, and other compensation\u201d in 1975, $10,323.00 in 1976. Grote did not submit his W-2\u2019s for either of those years along with his 1040\u2019s; instead his returns reported \u201ctotal income\u201d figures of $155.00 for 1975 and $554.00 for 1976. He attached to his 1975 return a letter explaining his belief, only recently arrived at, that Federal Reserve notes were not \u201clegal money\u201d under the Constitution, and complaining further that his privacy rights are violated by the filing requirements of the income tax laws. Grote applied for a refund of the $177.30 which was withheld by his employer in 1975. No withholdings were made in 1976, presumably the result of a withholding exemption certificate, purportedly filed by Grote in January of that year, in which he stated that he expected to incur no income tax liability in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">The first of Grote\u2019s enumerations of error, in the order in which they are said to have occurred, concerns the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person. It is undisputed that the defendant\u2019s presence at his arraignment proceedings was secured by an arrest warrant issued pursuant to an unverified information. Fed.R.Crim.P. 9(a) provides for the issuance of an arrest warrant for a defendant named in an information, but only \u201cif it is supported by oath ....\u201d The procedure for raising objections to the personal jurisdiction of the court, however, is governed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>United States v. Kahl, </em>583 F.2d 1351, 1356 (5th Cir. 1978) (citation omitted). Grote contends that his objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction at arraignment preserves the issue of the defective warrant on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the motions which were filed by Grote\u2019s counsel after arraignment and before trial make clear, however, defendant\u2019s .objection was to the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. R., pp. 22, 44-51. At no time was the trial court\u2019s attention ever called to the defective warrant. Grote\u2019s failure specifically to object to the personal jurisdiction of the court under the faulty arrest warrant thus constitutes a waiver of that objection under Rule 12(b)(1).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Rule 12(b)(1) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that objections based on the institution of the prosecution be raised prior to trial, and the failure to adhere to the requirements of that Rule results in a waiver of the objection. Unlike the objections to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court which cannot be waived under Rule 12(b)(1), ... objections to personal jurisdiction over a particular defendant can be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Grote next complains of the conduct of the arraignment proceedings. The record discloses that the trial court failed specifically to read the indictment, to read the contents of the information to the defendant or to state to him the substance of the charge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the record also reveals that, subsequent to the appointment of counsel to represent Grote, a recess in the arraignment proceedings was held in order for counsel to consult with Grote concerning the charges against him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cVacating convictions for lack of formal arraignment proceedings is predicated on the existence of possible prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>469 F.2d 1317, 1317-18 (5th Cir. 1972). We do not believe that any prejudice has resulted from the failure of the trial judge personally to inform the defendant of the charges against him. The trial judge, assigned that responsibility to appointed counsel, and he satisfied himself that that responsibility had been discharged before calling upon the defendant to plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">The appellant next complains of two evidentiary rulings made by the court in the course of trial. The first of these concerns the testimony of David Clore of the IRS. In its effort to prove knowledge on the part of the defendant in failing to make the required disclosures of income on his 1975 and 1976 returns, the Government sought testimony from Clore concerning the contents of Grote\u2019s returns for the three years prior to 1975. Throughout this line of inquiry Clore was allowed, over objection, to contrast the evidence of these returns with those of 1975 and 1976 in terms of the \u201cacceptability\u201d of each return to the Service for purposes of computing a tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Grote objects to the use of the word \u201cacceptable\u201d as suggesting to the jury that it should defer to the opinion of the IRS on the question of his guilt. This argument is without merit. As the Government\u2019s counsel made clear by successive questioning, the purpose of this inquiry was to contrast the contents of those returns which were in fact accepted by the Service with those which were not, in order to show prior knowledge on Grote\u2019s part of what was required of him. Clore\u2019s qualifications as a witness were as Chief of the Criminal Investigation Staff at the Austin, Texas, Service Center with access to the documents themselves. Trans., Vol. 2, pp. 46-48. As such, his testimony in the form of an opinion concerning the acceptability to the Service of the returns in question is admissible under F.R.E. 701 so long as it is \u201climited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d The \u201cfacts in issue\u201d were the contents of the returns and the inferences that the jury might draw therefrom. It might have been possible for the Government to highlight this contrast without having Clore express an opinion as to the acceptability of any of these returns. But \u201c[tjestimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionabl\u00e9 because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d F.R.E. 704. We conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Appellant also objects to the exclusion from evidence of a court opinion which purportedly held that returns substantially similar to Grote\u2019s had been accepted by the court and the Government in that prior action. Unfortunately, the record fails to disclose the citation of this authority, so we have no occasion to assess its relevance to Grote\u2019s argument that he relied thereon in filing his own returns. This does not foreclose us from ruling on this objection, however, for it appears from the record that Grote\u2019s argument was fully developed before the jury. David Martin, the \u201ctax consultant\u201d whose advice is no doubt partly responsible for the trouble Grote finds himself in, was called, recalled, and recalled again, to testify to the defendant\u2019s version of this missing judgment. \u201cWith the essence of desired evidence before the jury, any harm in the . . . exclusion [of the documentary evidence] was eliminated.\u201d <em>United States v. Sanfilippo, </em>581 F.2d 1152, 1155 (5th Cir. 1978). See also <em>United States v. Ashley, </em>555 F.2d 462, 465 (5th Cir. 1977). Since we are unable to conclude that \u201ca substantial right of the [appellant] is affected,\u201d F.R.E. 103(a), we find no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">When both sides closed, Grote moved the court for a judgment of acquittal. His motion was denied. He contends that it had been the policy of the Government not to prosecute protest tax returns of his variety before 1975, and that his prosecution marked a departure from that alleged policy without the benefit of notice and comment rulemaking. The sole support for the existence of this policy is the cross-examination testimony of Clore that such returns \u201cmay have been\" accepted before 1975.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, Grote contends that similar transgressors in the past have not been prosecuted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Mindful of the separation-of-powers implications permeating this entire area, [this court has held] that in order to make out a claim of selective prosecution, the defendant must show: 1) that others similarly situated have not been prosecuted, and 2) that the Government\u2019s prosecution of him is selective, invidious, in bad faith or based on impermissible considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>such as race, religion, or his exercise of constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 819 (5th Cir. 1979) (footnote omitted); <em>United States v. Kahl, </em>supra, at 1353. Grote alleges no more than that he has been \u201ccaught in the net of increased awareness and sensitivity to particular classes of crimes,\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>supra, at 818. Alone this fails to support a motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Grote\u2019s last objection, in point of time, concerns the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. In the course of its charge the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">There are three essential elements which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the offense of failure to file a return as charged in Count One and Count Two of the information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">First, the defendant was required by law or regulation to make a return of his income for the taxable year charged. Secondly, that the defendant failed to make such a return at the time required by law, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Third, that the defendant\u2019s failure to make the return was willful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-10\">You are further instructed that a taxpayer\u2019s return which does not contain financial information enabling the Internal Revenue Service to\" determine the party\u2019s tax liability, if any, is not a return within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulation adopted by the Commission of Internal Revenue Service.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFP\">The correct standard of review to be applied to challenges to jury instructions is whether the court\u2019s charge as a whole was a correct statement of law. <em>United States v. Arguelles, </em>594 F.2d 109, at 112, n. 3 (5th Cir. 1979). See also <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>586 F.2d 593 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Sanfilippo, </em>581 F.2d 1152 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">Appellant does not object to the first part of the excerpted charge, which we agree accurately sets forth the elements of the crime charged in the information. He argues instead that the \u201cyou are further instructed\u201d part of the charge had the effect of directing the jury to find the second element of the offense set forth immediately before, namely, \u201cthat the defendant failed to make such a return ....\u201d We cannot agree. This language merely instructed the jury, in light of the evidence that had been introduced at trial, how it might find the existence of the second element of the offense charged, and was an accurate statement of the law. See <em>United States v. Wade, </em>585 F.2d 573, 575 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>577 F.2d 1304, 1311 (5th Cir. 1978). The responsibility to find the second element of the offense was clearly the jury\u2019s under the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">.
