The practices sought to be enjoined arise out of an ongoing investigation of food stamp fraud by the state attorney. The state attorney subpoenaed and secured from HRS the files of all food stamp recipients who received at least $125 per month in food stamps. The state attorney had no reason to believe that any particular recipient engaged in food stamp fraud. In denying the injunction, the trial court found the state attorney, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.1(c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cdirectly connected with enforcement of the Food Stamp Program,\u201d so that HRS may release any requested files absent such reason to suspect fraud. Further, the trial court found \u201cno protected right of privacy in the information furnished.\u201d Our interpretation of the regulations is that they mandate a showing of suspicion of fraud prior to release by HRS of recipient files. The Food Stamp Act also manifests a strong congressional intent to maintain the confidentiality of recipient files. In accordance with this interpretation, we find that the proposed preliminary injunction satisfied the established requirements for granting an injunction. We therefore hold that the trial court abused its discretion, and we reverse the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">Appellants, (hereinafter recipients) and members of the class they seek to represent, are low-income individuals who reside in the three-county area of the Fourth Judicial Circuit, and who participate in the Food Stamp Program in Florida. In early 1979, there were 3,117 individuals participating in the Food Stamp Program in Nassau County, 2,604 in Clay County, and 59,647 in Duval County. Recipient households participating in the Food Stamp Program receive monthly coupon allotments which may be used to purchase certain grocery items. Congress created the Food Stamp Program to alleviate hunger and malnutrition among the nation\u2019s low-income households. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Food Stamp Program is a cooperative endeavor between federal and state governments. The federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>government provides the entire value of the food stamp coupons to state agencies, along with fifty percent or more of all administrative funds for program operation. The state agencies (HRS in Florida) agree to administer the program in accordance with the Food Stamp Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>Income, expenses, and assets of applicant households determine eligibility for food stamps. Household income and expenses fix monthly household coupon allotments. HRS, through local food stamp offices, receives and acts upon applications from households seeking food stamps. For each applicant household HRS maintains an individual case file containing information provided to the food stamp office by the household and a case record of participation in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">Appellee, Austin, is the State Attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit. The Office of State Attorney is a constitutional office created by Article 5, \u00a7 17 of the Florida Constitution. The state attorney, as the prosecuting attorney in each judicial circuit, is responsible for the prosecution of public assistance fraud, which is a state criminal offense pursuant to Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 409.325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">In February of 1979, the State Attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit initiated an investigation of food stamp recipients in Nassau County, Florida. Assistant state attorneys went to the Nassau County Food Stamp Office and requested the food stamp case files of all persons in the county who were receiving a monthly food stamp coupon allotment of $125 per month or more. The state attorney made this request without any lawful process, subpoena or warrant. The case files requested for investigation were chosen solely because the affected households received food stamp allotments of $125 a month or more. No official of HRS, and no representative of the state attorney, had any reason to suspect that particular members of the affected households had engaged in public assistance fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">The supervisor of the Nassau County Food Stamp Office gave all requested files to the state attorney. Subsequently, HRS requested to be served with a subpoena for the files already reviewed by the state attorney and for any future files. The state attorney complied, and served a subpoena mandating the production of \u201cany and all applications, records, worksheets, or any other pertinent information pertaining to any Nassau County food stamp recipient.\u201d After HRS released the case files, the state attorney reviewed the files and filled out information sheets for all affected households, recording each household\u2019s source and amount of income, resources, household composition, medical expenses, rent or mortgage amounts, utility costs, child support or alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-10\">These information sheets were distributed to local police personnel. The state attorney advised the police to conduct a criminal investigation and verify, through standard criminal investigative techniques, the information collected on these forms. The state attorney asked the police to contact neighbors, employers, and others who might be familiar with the household\u2019s circumstances to verify the information previously provided to the Food Stamp Program. The state attorney also instructed the police not to disclose unnecessarily any of the information obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">Over the next six months, an estimated 500 households in Nassau County were <em>sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number><em>jected to criminal investigations. </em>The local police compared the information obtained in the community with that which applicants previously gave to the food stamp office. The sole basis for investigative targets was the amount of food stamps received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">During the summer of 1979, the state attorney initiated a substantially similar investigation in Clay County. Without requiring any showing or reason to suspect fraud, HRS again turned over hundreds of case files. In turn, the state attorney disseminated this information to local police for verification through criminal investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">It remains the position of HRS that so long as the state attorney provides a subpoena, HRS officials will release any and all requested case files without regard to whether there is any basis to suspect affected households of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">In district court, recipients asserted that HRS\u2019s release of all requested food stamp case files to the state attorney without any reason to suspect individuals of fraud violated the statutory rights of recipients. Recipients base this statutory claim on the Food Stamp Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. They assert that the regulations prohibit HRS from releasing file information to the state attorney unless there is some reason to suspect fraud, notwithstanding that the state attorney may be \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the enforcement of the Act, within the meaning of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.1(c). Recipients also claimed violation of their constitutional rights to privacy, to freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, and to due process. Recipients sought damages arising from the release of the information and investigative activities that have occurred. Furthermore, recipients sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent HRS from releasing case files without any basis to suspect individuals of fraud, and to prevent the state attorney from demanding access to food stamp case files in the absence of a proper referral of the case by HRS, or absent a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">The state attorney justified access to the food stamp files on the basis of the general investigative power of the office and because the office of state attorney is \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the enforcement of the Act, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. 272.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">The trial court, following a hearing and a finding of jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337, denied recipients\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction. The trial court concluded that recipients were not substantially likely to prevail on their claim of violation of the Food Stamp Act and its regulations, and that they were not substantially likely to prevail on their claim of deprivation of constitutional rights. The trial court addressed the regulatory question first and concluded that because the state attorney is, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.1(c), \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with enforcement of the Food Stamp Act, HRS may release recipient files to him without regard to whether the recipients are suspected of committing fraud. The trial court obviously determined that such a conclusion was mandated by several factors, the most critical factor being the language contained in the Florida Food Stamp Application Form. That language states: \u201cI authorize Division of Family Services and the Division of Public Assistance Fraud to verify any information given herein and to make any inquiry of past or present employers and records and financial or otherwise.\u201d Further, such language complies with Fla.Stat.Ann. 11.50(b). Additionally, the trial court noted that Fla.Stat.Ann. 409.355 makes public both the names of recipients of public assistance and the amount of assistance received. Finally, the trial court found that regulatory references, most notably 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.16(e)(2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>couraging the referral of suspected fraud cases to the State Attorney do not require the conclusion that the State Attorney may not act other than in referred cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">As to the constitutional question, the trial court found that the Food Stamp Act provided certain protections for recipients\u2019 privacy, and following <em>Plante v. Gonzalez, 575 </em>F.2d 1119 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1129, 99 S.Ct. 1047, 59 L.Ed.2d 90 (1979), balanced these privacy protections against the governmental interest in having unimpeded access to the files. The trial court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQZ\">there is a substantial governmental and public interest in the restricted disclosure of this information. The term restricted is used because there is no suggestion or contention that there is either desire or intention to make this information general public information or to extend its use or disclosure to other than those \u2018directly connected\u2019 with and who therefore have a legitimate official interest in its use. The governmental and public interest in such restricted disclosure is served in this use because fraud in the program is thereby curtailed, benefits are limited to those for whom they were intended and the public perception of the Food Stamp Program as a whole is changed from one described derisively as having recipients driving up in late model Cadillacs to pick up their food stamps to one recognized for serving the laudable purpose for which it was created. That there are instances of fraud should come as no surprise to anyone, but certainly the program should not be permitted to be publicly typified by those who abuse it. To this extent the government and the public have a vital interest in ferreting out those who do abuse the program and without access to the applications and reports, effective detection of fraud would be virtually impossible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">The trial court concluded that because recipients \u201chad no protected privacy right in the information furnished,\u201d recipients would not face irreparable harm from HRS\u2019s planned release of information or from the state attorney\u2019s criminal investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-10\">Recipients ask us to determine:</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-11\">1. whether the trial court erred in finding that the state attorney can subpoena and secure records of food stamp recipients, where the affected recipients are not suspected of fraud, because the state attorney is \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the enforcement of the Food Stamp Program; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">2. whether the trial court erred in holding that HRS\u2019s release of recipients\u2019 case files to the state attorney without reason to suspect fraud did not violate the recipients\u2019 constitutional right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"Au1b\">As we recently stated in <em>Shamloo v. Miss. State Bd. of Trustees, Etc., </em>620 F.2d 516, 524 (5th Cir. 1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-14\">This court clearly established the requirements for granting a preliminary injunction in <em>Canal Authority of Florida v. Callaway, </em>489 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1974) as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-17\">Id. at 572. The grant or denial of a preliminary injunction rests in the discretion of the district court. <em>Johnson v. Radford, </em>449 F.2d 115 (5th Cir. 1971).

Kagan, </em>585 F.2d 749 (5th Cir. 1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">The above four requirements considered by the trial court are mixed questions of law and fact and \u201c[o]n review the district court\u2019s findings of fact are to be upheld unless \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). The district court\u2019s conclusions of law [however] are subject to broad review and will be reversed if incorrect.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. United States Postal Service, </em>508 F.2d 259, 267 n. 24 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">I. The Regulatory Claim</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">A. Congressional Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-7\">Resolution of this issue turns upon our construction of the Food Stamp Act and the regulations thereunder. As noted by the Supreme Court, \u201cour task is to interpret the words of these statutes [and regulations] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve.\u201d <em>Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Org., </em>441 U.S. 600, 608, 99 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, 60 L.Ed.2d 508 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-8\">The trial court found \u201cthat the State Attorney is within that category of persons \u2018directly connected\u2019 with the enforcement of the Food Stamp Act and is entitled to access to the recipient files for use in the enforcement of the Act.\u201d The trial court interpreted a finding of \u201cdirectly connected\u201d to be a finding of a right to complete access to recipient files. Such an interpretation ignores the possibility that those \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the administration or enforcement of the Act might be restricted in their use and disclosure of program information. We reject the trial court\u2019s approach as too limited when the entire Act and regulatory structure is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-14\">When a household applies for food stamps, the completed application contains a large amount of personal information concerning the household\u2019s circumstances. This information is reviewed by the food stamp certification caseworker, in an \u201cofficial and confidential discussion of household circumstances,\u201d with the applicant\u2019s \u201cright of privacy\u201d protected during this interview. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(e).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1270-15\">Verification is the process of confirming the household statement about factors of eligibility through either documentary sources, collateral (third-party) contacts, or a home visit. The areas of verification and the means of verification are not left to the discretion of the certification worker. Pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the absence of consent from the household, a certification worker is not free to verify any factor of eligibility or to make contacts with third persons in order to verify information provided by the household.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-16\">The federal regulations governing verification expressly distinguish between factors of eligibility for which verification is mandatory (gross non-exempt income, alien status, utility and medical expenses), and all other factors of eligibility. For non-mandatory factors, the state agency, here HRS, can only require verification if the household\u2019s assertions are \u201cquestionable.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f)(1) and (2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>caseworker has no reason to believe that the household\u2019s assertions are questionable regarding a non-mandatory factor, household composition for example, the caseworker cannot require verification of this factor. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f)(2) and (i).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIK\">Where verification is allowed or required, the nature of verification is not left to caseworker discretion. The primary source of verification is documentary evidence provided by the household. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.-2(f)(4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the household is unable to provide acceptable documentary verification, the caseworker may make use of a collateral contact. The caseworker, however, is first required to ask the household to name and agree to a mutually acceptable collateral contact. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f)(5).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>household unreasonably refuses to provide acceptable collateral contact verification, the application can be rejected or the case terminated. The caseworker, however, cannot proceed to contact a third party for verification without the permission of the household. We base this view of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(b)(5) on the Department of Agriculture comments that accompanied promulgation of this section.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-4\">Many commentors recommend that the regulations prohibit the use of a collateral contact without the express written consent of the household. Since the proposed regulations clearly state that the state agency must rely on the household to provide the name of a collateral contact, the Department believes the recommended change is unnecessary. 43 Fed. Reg. 47856, (Tuesday, October 17, 1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A92\">When a collateral contact is necessary, the regulations establish a balance between the state agency\u2019s right to ensure that only eligible persons receive food stamps and the household\u2019s right to maintain its privacy and dignity. Congress recently expressed its awareness of this dilemma and emphasized the need to ensure protection of recipient privacy rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-5\">The legal barriers that need to be lowered, or in some instances withdrawn entirely, are substantial, appropriately so in light of the privacy considerations involved and the danger of abuse of confidential information for illegitimate purposes by both federal and state food stamp personnel. The Program need for certain information is great, but it must be carefully balanced by the need to protect needy individuals from having their privacy bartered away in order to assuage their hunger. Existing protections should not be reduced without careful consideration and without the substitute</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1272-7\">of other meaningful safeguards. The committee\u2019s bill attempts to achieve this balanced approach to disclosure of relevant wage and benefit information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1272-8\">H.R. Rep. 96-788, Food Stamp Act Amendments of 1980, at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-9\">The balance between the household\u2019s privacy rights and the need to investigate household statements to ensure accuracy shifts after there is reason to suspect the household has provided incorrect information to the Food Stamp Program. This suspicion may arise in a number of ways. The recipient may submit inconsistent or questionable information during regular re-determinations of eligibility; an informant may provide information which contradicts representations made by the households; regular computer checks of information given to the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program or the Social Security program may reveal inconsistent reporting. At any point when the information provided by the household to the Food Stamp Program appears questionable, the state worker can require an additional document or verification and, if that verification is inadequate, a collateral contact. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f). If the information continues to be suspect, or the household refuses to cooperate, a fraud investigation may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-10\">The regulations authorize referral to state prosecuting authorities in cases where individuals are suspected of committing fraud. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.16(e)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This regulation is the sole reference in the Food Stamp Act and regulations providing a case file to a state prosecutor; and 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.16(e)(2) carefully limits referral to \u201ccases where individuals are suspected of committing fraud.\u201d The careful limitation on information disclosure throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>regulatory structure, the qualified language of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.16(e)(2), and the absence of any reference to providing case files to prosecuting authorities anywhere else in the regulatory structure, leads to the conclusion that the state agency cannot release a file to a prosecutor until the agency determines there is reason to suspect fraud. Further, we find it relevant that \u00a7 273.16(e)(2) encourages referral only for \u201cprosecution,\u201d not investigation. This is not to say, of course, that, upon referral, the state attorney cannot make use of certain investigative tools, like the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">Clearly, Congress intended to establish a structure where the state agency can contact third persons to verify information, and engage in investigations, only after the household has provided questionable information. After establishing such a careful structure, Congress did not intend that it be circumvented by allowing the agency to turn over the files to the prosecutor for criminal investigation at any time, without regard to whether the household has engaged in questionable behavior. Given this regulatory structure, and the clear intent of Congress, we must disagree with the trial court, since it effectively held that by the simple expedient of turning over all case files to a state attorney, HRS may accomplish indirectly the verification which it is barred from doing by the federal food stamp regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-6\">In resolving any ambiguity in the regulatory structure at the Food Stamp Program, it is useful to examine the Department of Health and Human Resources\u2019 interpreta; tion of the substantially similar \u201cuse or disclosure\u201d provision of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-662. Health and Human Resources, in administering the AFDC program, has interpreted its \u201cuse or disclosure\u201d provision in a manner which clearly forbids the indiscriminate release of case files by a state agency to a state prosecutor without any basis to suspect fraud. Health and Human Resources advised Congress that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-7\">although a well-run state welfare program could turn up most cases of welfare fraud, it is not possible for the state or local welfare agency to identify all such cases. Where law enforcement officials identify a case of suspected welfare fraud which has gone undetected by the welfare agency and wish to take action there is no federal statutory provision or HEW [HHR] regulation which prevents a statewide welfare agency from disclosing information bearing on the question of welfare fraud to those officials. Disclosure of information unrelated to the suspected fraudulent conduct is, of course, both unnecessary and undesirable, and the welfare agency therefore has the responsibility to make available from the case file only such information as is needed for the investigation of the fraudulent activity in question. Also, it would be administratively disruptive and a violation of the legislatively mandated principle of confidentiality to permit unlimited access to all case files when the law enforcement officials have no specific instance of welfare fraud in mind, but merely suspect that such fraud exists generally in the program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">\u201cEstablishing Priorities among Programs Aiding the Poor,\u201d Hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, 92d Cong., Second Sess. at 149 (Feb. 15, 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">It is also worth noting that 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.110, the Health and Human Resources equivalent of Agriculture\u2019s 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.-16(e), provides for referral to law enforcement officials in situations \u201cin which there is valid reason to suspect that fraud has been practiced.\u201d In <em>United States v. McDaniels, </em>370 F.Supp. 293 (E.D.La.1973), the court interpreted this provision as barring referral of a case file when there is no basis to suspect fraud. There, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1273-11\">The HEW Regulation with respect to suspected fraud contemplates some preliminary investigation by the agency before a ease is turned over to a law enforcement officer. Each state plan must provide methods and criteria for identifying situations in which a question of fraud may exist. That procedures must be developed for referral to law enforcement offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>cers of \u201csituations in which there is valid reason to suspect that fraud has been practiced\u201d implies that cases where \u201cvalid reason\u201d does not exist will not be referred. This conclusion is buttressed by the express provision that the state agency plan (not its law enforcement program) must provide \u201cFor methods of investigation of situations in which there is a question of fraud ....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">370 F.Supp. at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-5\">This prohibition on blanket release of files by the state agency, which exists in the AFDC Program, is precisely what HRS denies exist in the Food Stamp Program. There is no reason, however, to believe that Congress intended any less protection for the low-income households who receive federal food assistance than for the low-income households who receive federal financial assistance. Indeed, millions of households receive both food stamps and AFDC benefits, and pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.-2(j),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> state agencies are required to develop procedures for a single application and interview when a household is eligible for both programs. Much of the information regarding household income, resources, and composition is necessary for both eligibility determinations. It is inconsistent to say that Congress intended to bar the state agency administering the AFDC Program from giving a prosecuting authority the AFDC file without valid reason to suspect fraud, but intended to allow the state agency to turn over the food stamp file without restriction. We need not interpret either of the regulations in a manner which results in the same congressional language leading to inconsistent protections. Accordingly, we find that Congress intended the state agency administering the Food Stamp Program to turn over case files to a state prosecutor only when there is valid reason to suspect fraud in the particular household.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-9\">Contrary to the trial court\u2019s holding, a finding that the state attorney is \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the enforcement of the Food Stamp Act does not compel the conclusion that HRS may release all files of all persons receiving food stamps to that state prosecutor. The state attorney contends he gets his power to investigate because he is, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.1(c), \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with the enforcement of the Act; the state attorney then disassociates himself from the other regulations limiting investigative authority. If the state attorney is \u201cdirectly connected\u201d with enforcement of the Act, then he is also bound by those provisions restricting his authority to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">The trial court, in concluding that HRS could refer case files to the state attorney for investigation of their eligibility, expressly relied upon aspects of state law and practice. The trial court relied upon a waiver provision of Florida\u2019s food stamp application. It also relied upon Fla.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 409.355 which provides, in part, that \u201cthe lists of names of all persons who have received public assistance payments and the amount of such payments are a matter of public record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>Federal regulations clearly prohibit HRS from requiring verification of a number of factors of eligibility when the applicant has not provided \u201cquestionable\u201d information. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.2(f)(1), (2). Federal regulations prohibit the requirement of collateral contacts when documentary verification is adequate, and prohibit the state agency from engaging in collateral contacts absent the household\u2019s consent. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.-2(f)(4), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">This limitation on agency discretion and the verification process demonstrates an awareness by Congress and the Department of Agriculture that, absent carefully structured limits on the state agency\u2019s ability to verify, the verification process can be used to harass or delay eligibility determinations for applicant households. The Food Stamp Amendments of 1980 broadened the rights of state agencies to verify information provided by \u201cerror-prone\u201d households. In developing a model by which those households which are more subject to error are also subject to increased verification, Congress expressly rejected the option of allowing states to verify any factors of eligibility for any or all households. In rejecting this option, the House Agriculture Committee noted \u201cthe carefully maintained balance between verification that reduces costly program error and verification that harasses applicants and prevents participation without impacting on error ...\u201d H.R. Rep. 96-788, Food Stamp Amendments of 1980, at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">The Food Stamp Act also expressly prohibits a state agency participating in the Food Stamp Program from levying additional eligibility requirements for applicant households. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020(e)(5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, the Food Stamp Act expressly requires the state agency to undertake certification of applicant households in accordance with the procedures prescribed in the federal regulations. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020(e)(6).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-9\">It is not necessary for us to resolve whether Florida law and practice conflict with federal law. The question of the constitutionality of Florida law and practice is not specifically before us. Our only necessary task is to interpret the Act and accompanying regulations in view of the purposes Congress sought to serve. This we have done. We do note that a court does not give intent to congressional purpose by reference to state law and practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-10\">Our interpretation of the Act and regulations results in a finding that HRS cannot release files to a state prosecutor in the absence of a basis to suspect fraud. Such an interpretation in no way impedes the state attorney, a constitutionally authorized body, from investigating fraud. Our interpretation merely prohibits the state attorney from conducting a fishing expedition in food stamp files. Whenever the state attorney has reasonable suspicion to suspect fraud in a particular case file, he may request that file and conduct a normal fraud investigation. The state attorney may also conduct normal fraud investigations of \u201cthose individuals suspected of committing fraud,\u201d referred to the state attorney by HRS, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 273.16(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">Accordingly, there is a substantial likelihood that recipients will prevail on the merits of their regulatory claim. Further, the injunction will not harm either HRS or the state attorney. Nor will the injunction be adverse to the public interest. The injunction will not alter the normal process of investigation and prosecution of food stamp fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">B. Irreparable Harm</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-13\">As mentioned, the trial court determined \u201cfrom the language of 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272.1(c), that the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>provide some degree of confidentiality of the personal information of the food stamp recipients by preventing general public disclosure or disclosure to persons not directly connected with the program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">We agree with the trial court that the Act and accompanying regulations give recipients statutory protection from disclosure of confidential information. As such, recipients possess a legitimate expectation that the information will be kept confidential. Certainly, recipients do not legitimately expect local police officers to peruse their food stamp files. This court has held that \u201c[w]hen a legitimate expectation of privacy exists, violation of privacy is harmful without any concrete consequential damages. Privacy of personal matters is an interest in and of itself, protected constitutionally, as discussed above, and at common law.\u201d <em>Plante v. Gonzalez, </em>575 F.2d 1119, 1135 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 1129, 99 S.Ct. 1047, 59 L.Ed.2d 90 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">The trial court, therefore, erred in finding no irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">II. The Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-7\">Recipients assert that HRS\u2019s release of their food stamp files to the state attorney without reason to suspect fraud violated their constitutional right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-8\">This court has a policy of deciding cases on the narrowest legal grounds available. <em>Shamloo v. Miss. State Bd. of Trustees, Etc., </em>620 F.2d 516 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Penthouse International Ltd. v. McAuliffe, </em>610 F.2d 1353 (5th Cir. 1980). This policy is particularly applicable where, as here, constitutional questions are involved. As Justice Frankfurter wrote, \u201c[i]f there is one doctrine more deeply rooted than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality unless such adjudication is unavoidable.\u201d <em>Spector Motor Service v. McLaughlin, </em>323 U.S. 101, 105, 65 S.Ct. 152, 154, 89 L.Ed. 101 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">In this case, recipients seek reversal of a denial of a motion for preliminary injunction. Our holding concerning recipients\u2019 regulatory claim is sufficient to reverse the denial. Consequently, we need not decide the constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">The trial court abused its discretion in denying the preliminary injunction. There is a substantial likelihood that recipients will prevail on the merits. Based on <em>Plante v. Gonzalez, </em>recipients have suffered irreparable injury and will continue to suffer injury unless the injunction is granted. Granting the injunction will not be adverse to the public interest; nor will granting the injunction harm either HRS or the state attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order denying the preliminary injunction is vacated, the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to grant a preliminary injunction, consistent with this opinion, enjoining HRS from releasing food stamp files to the state attorney absent any basis to suspect that the affected households have committed fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">. 7 C.F.R. 272.1(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-6\">(c) Disclosure.

The appellees have argued persuasively that there is a need to verify information supplied by food stamp recipients to program administrators in Florida by suggesting in their brief that fraud may be involved in as many as 40 percent of all food stamp cases. The type of verification that appellees sought to conduct was fairly standard; ostensibly, it was no more intrusive or violative of privacy than typical verification procedures used by banks in approving loan applicants or employers in considering job applicants. While such a procedure might reveal fraud, or even deter fraud, I would not conclude, as does the majority, that the households whose entitlements were being verified \u201cwere subjected to criminal investigations,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 1205-1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">Although it would seem that a verification procedure such as that urged by appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>lees would ultimately benefit those persons truly in need of food stamps and legally entitled to them,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is clear that the <em>desirability </em>of such a procedure is not an issue for our determination. Our function is to determine whether, under the laws passed by Congress and under the regulations properly promulgated by the various administrative agencies, this type of verification procedure can be undertaken. I conclude, along with the majority, <em>see ante, </em>at 1208-1211, that Congress through the Food Stamp Act, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011-2027 (1976), and the Department of Agriculture though its regulations, <em>e.g. </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 272 (1979), have precluded the action that appellees seek to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\">The results reported to us at oral argument, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra, </em>suggest that further study of the legislative policy involved in this case is warranted. But if another course is to be chosen, the fine men and women who have been elected to represent the people are quite competent to the task. The judiciary should neither assume the responsibility nor usurp authority not delegated to it. <em>See Wilson v.
