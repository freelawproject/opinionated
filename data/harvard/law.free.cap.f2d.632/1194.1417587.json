He was also found to be a habitual offender and was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. On appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, his conviction was affirmed. <em>State v. Nicholas, </em>359 So.2d 965 (La.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">The issue of unconstitutionality of the five-member jury was raised on direct appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court by petitioner\u2019s co-defendant, but was rejected by that Court. In <em>Ballew v. Georgia, </em>435 U.S. 223, 98 S.Ct. 1029, 55 L.Ed.2d 234 (1978), the United States Supreme Court held that conviction of a criminal defendant before a five-member jury was unconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as applied to the states by the Fourteenth. In <em>State v. Robinson, </em>361 So.2d 864 (La.1978), the Louisiana Supreme Court held that <em>Ballew v. Georgia </em>would not have retroactive application. The petitioner has not sought redress on the retro-activity of <em>Ballew </em>through state habeas corpus. Nevertheless, we find it was unnecessary for him to exhaust state remedies under the doctrine announced in <em>Layton v. Carson, </em>479 F.2d 1275 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-16\">Respondent argues that federal habeas corpus relief is barred because petitioner elected to be tried by a five-member jury rather than a six-member jury after being informed of his right to so choose. We find no waiver in this case. A waiver is \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Despite the respondent\u2019s insistence that petitioner should have been able to anticipate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Ballew </em>three years down the road, petitioner clearly did not waive a \u201cknown right or privilege.\u201d In fact, petitioner was forced to choose between what were to become two unconstitutional choices: a five-member jury, held unconstitutional in <em>Ballew, </em>or a six-member jury where the concurrence of five members could support a conviction, also held unconstitutional in <em>Burch v. Louisiana, </em>441 U.S. 130, 99 S.Ct. 1623, 60 L.Ed.2d 96 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-17\">The dispositive issue in this case has recently been decided by this court. <em>See Thomas v. Blackburn, </em>623 F.2d 383 (5th Cir. 1980). Therefore, the judgment of the district court is reversed, and the cause is remanded with instructions to issue the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-18\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
