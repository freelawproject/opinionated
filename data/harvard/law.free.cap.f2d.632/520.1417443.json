After purchase, Tinker discovered that the car was the amalgamation of two other vehicles. He sued, claiming violations of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act [hereafter, the Act] and various state common law and statutory violations. The court below dismissed Tinker\u2019s federal statutory claims for failure to state a cause of action and the state claims as not arising from a common nucleus of operative fact. Tinker appeals with respect to appellee DeMaria Porsche-Audi only.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Tinker\u2019s most vigorous claim is that DeMaria violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 regarding odometer and mileage disclosure. That section requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-7\">1) Disclosure of the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">2) Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the odometer reading is known to the transferor to be different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">DeMaria\u2019s form reversed this order, stating that actual mileage was unknown and that the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer was 39,266. Tinker claims that this reversal was \u201cconfusing\u201d and \u201cmeaningless,\u201d and thus violated \u00a7 1988. He also claims that DeMaria should have stated that actual mileage was approximately 41,-000, as the last transferor had indicated upon selling the car to DeMaria. We find no merit in these contentions. The order of disclosures does not affect their lucidity: DeMaria\u2019s meaning regarding the vehicle\u2019s mileage was clear. Nor does the statute require DeMaria to go beyond the disclosures he made-recorded mileage and actual mileage unknown-to state his beliefs regarding the car\u2019s actual mileage, so long as his silence does not stem from an intent to defraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">In this case, such fraudulent intent is not present: the difference between 41,-000 and 39,266 miles is negligible. A buyer given the information Tinker was provided would be likely to conclude that actual mileage was greater than the 39,266 miles shown. We do not have before us the case in which a dealer states actual mileage is unknown and gives the odometer reading without saying more, knowing that actual mileage is 100,000 miles greater than that shown. <em>(See Ryan v. Edwards, </em>592 F.2d 756 (4th Cir. 1979).) Although DeMaria would have provided fuller disclosure by adding \u201cactual mileage approximately 41,000,\u201d such statement was neither required by the Act nor misleading in its absence. We hold therefore that DeMaria\u2019s mileage disclosures did not violate the Act and that dismissal was proper with respect to these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">Tinker\u2019s remaining federal claim is that DeMaria violated the Act by failing to disclose the vehicle\u2019s last license plate number, The license plate disclosure requirement explicitly appears within 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.4(a)(4) and implicitly within 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.4(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These are regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Transportation pursuant to his authority under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-15\">The Secretary shall proscribe rules requiring any transferor to give the following written disclosure to the transferee in connection with the transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-16\">1) Disclosure of the cumulative mileage registered on the odometer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-17\">2) Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the odometer reading is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>known to the transferor to be different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ags\">Both parties agree that appellee DeMaria failed to provide the last license plate num-. ber as the regulations require. DeMaria argues, however, that violations of the regulations do not give rise to civil liability\u2014 that the Secretary has no power to promulgate rules other than those regarding mileage disclosure. Alternatively, he argues that, if the regulations have validity, they require only that the transferor disclose information he has, not information publicly available. In <em>Purser v. Campbell Porsche-Audi, </em>431 F.Supp. 1235 (N.D.Fla.1977), the district court agreed with appellee\u2019s primary contentions. The court found that \u201cthe regulations were intended to address a single problem-odometer violations,\u201d 431 F.Supp. at 1237, and that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 580.-4(a)(4), requiring disclosures regarding the identity of the vehicle, did not fall within those bounds. Hence, it held that plaintiff\u2019s allegations of the transferor\u2019s failure to disclose the vehicle\u2019s last license plate number did not give rise to a claim under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1989. However, other courts have reached the opposite conclusion. <em>See, Clayton </em>v. <em>McCary, </em>426 F.Supp. 248 (N.D.Ohio 1976). We do not decide this issue because we conclude that as to this omission appellant failed to allege intent to defraud, necessary before any violation of the Act gives rise to civil liability under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1989. <em>Nieto v. Pence, </em>578 F.2d 640 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Tinker alleged that the Jaguar he purchased from DeMaria had been constructed from two other vehicles, one of which had been in a major collision. He did not allege, however, that DeMaria either knew of these facts or was responsible for the vehicle\u2019s reconstruction. There is no allegation that DeMaria intended to defraud nor can we infer such intent from Tinker\u2019s allegations. We will permit liberal amendments of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint where it appears that by amending, the plaintiff will be able to state a claim. <em>Lone Star Motor Imports, Inc. v. Citroen Cars Corp., </em>288 F.2d 69 (5th Cir. 1961). However, the court below correctly concluded that Tinker would not be able to allege that DeMaria\u2019s failure to provide the vehicle\u2019s last license plate number was based upon an intent to defraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is noteworthy in this regard that the information in question was publicly available.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Once the district court properly dismissed Tinker's federal claims, its exercise of pendent jurisdiction over Tinker\u2019s state claims lay within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>In Re Carter, </em>618 F.2d 1093 (5th Cir. 1980). In exercising that discretion, some of the factors the district court should consider are \u201cwhether the federal claims were dismissed before trial, whether the state claims predominate, whether the state claims are closely tied to questions of federal policy, and whether the jury is likely to be confused by the treatment of divergent legal theories of relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1104-05. Applying those factors to the instant case, we conclude that the district court\u2019s refusal of pendent jurisdiction over Tinker\u2019s state claims was not an abuse of discretion. As we noted in <em>United States ex rel. Glynn v. Capeletti Brothers, Inc., </em>621 F.2d 1309, 1317-18 (5th Cir. 1980), \u201ca district court has wide discretion to refuse to hear a pendent claim. \u2018[I]f the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not in substantially a jurisdictional sense, the state claim should be dismissed as well.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-11\">. Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1989 civil liability cannot be imposed without showing the transferor\u2019s intent to defraud. <em>Nieto v. Pence, </em>578 F.2d 640 (5 th Cir. 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-18\">. Section 580.4(d) requires the transferor to use the disclosure form provided under \u00a7 580.6 where no state document exists for that purpose. None does under Florida law. The form shown by \u00a7 580.6 provides a space in which the last license plate number is to be placed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\">. We are of the opinion, however, that the judge below should have exercised greater restraint in his courtroom remarks; the judge\u2019s beliefs as to the merits of the Act are irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
