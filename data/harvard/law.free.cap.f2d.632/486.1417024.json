The case went to trial in November 1979 and on November 21, 1979, the district judge filed findings of fact and conclusions of law wherein he found that Portis was entitled to back pay and attorney\u2019s fees. A hearing on attorney\u2019s fees was held in January 1980 and final judgment was filed on February 22, 1980. On March 4,1980, Harris County, the appellants here, filed a timely motion to reform the judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). At the same time they filed a notice of appeal. An amended final judgment was filed on March 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">We dismiss the appeal due to our lack of jurisdiction. The appellant filed the Rule 59 motion and notice of appeal at the same time. Under Rule 4, Fed.R.App.P. 4(a), the filing of a timely Rule 59(e) motion \u201chas the effect of nullifying a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of the motion. Such a notice of appeal \u2018shall have no effect\u2019, and \u2018[a] new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the motion.\u2019 \u201d 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 204.12[1] (2d ed. 1980). When the Rule 59(e) motion was timely filed, the judgment of the district court was no longer a final judgment. The judgment became final only after the disposition of the Rule 59(e) motion on March 10. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a) requires that the notice of appeal be filed within 30 days of that final judgment, which was not done here. A timely notice of appeal is necessary for this court to have authority to act. <em>Hardy v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., </em>599 F.2d 628, 629 (5th Cir. 1979). Accordingly, we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
