The NLRB found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Dadco committed several unfair labor practices during a time when the union was seeking to organize the employees. It ordered Dadco to cease and desist from unlawfully interfering with the organization efforts, to post appropriate orders, and to recognize and bargain with the union. In opposition to the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement, Dadco raises three issues. The first two issues are relatively minor: whether the Board erred in determining that certain Dadco employees were supervisory, and whether there was sufficient evidence to support the finding of unfair labor practices. The crux of this proceeding lies in the third issue, whether the unfair labor practices warranted a bargaining order. We hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings and to warrant imposition of a bargaining order, and we therefore grant enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">I. The Organizational Battle</p>\n<p id=\"ANv\">Dadco Fashions, a manufacturer of children\u2019s clothing, employed approximately 90 people in the small town of Coushatta, Louisiana, at the time of the dispute. In August 1976, the International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union began a campaign to organize Dadco\u2019s production and maintenance employees. The union held several meetings with employees in late August, and by August 26 had obtained signed authorization cards from a majority of the 82 employees in the bargaining unit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That card majority quickly dissipated, however; by the middle of October, 26 of the 45 employees who had signed cards requested that the union return their cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">A series of actions attributable to the company allegedly caused this loss of the union\u2019s card majority. On August 30, the company\u2019s owner, David Dorsky, and its plant manager, Melvin Cauthen, made speeches to the assembled employees. Dorsky complained that the union supporters were trying to \u201cstab him in the back\u201d and had made personal attacks on him. He indicated that he knew what had been said at the meetings, and that he resented the fact that employees even attended the meetings and listened to the union organizers. He also stated that almost all of the plants operated by his family were nonunion, and that they had closed other union plants. Cauthen indicated that he too knew what went on at the union meetings. He read the employees a newspaper editorial about a Kentucky labor dispute which portrayed plant closure, economic disaster, and bitter violence as the natural outcome of union organizing. In addition, Cauthen told the employees that there was no reason for additional workers to sign union cards since the union already had enough to force an election, and offered the company\u2019s help to those employees who signed cards but were having \u201csecond thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Lower level company officials also acted in opposition to the union\u2019s efforts. Supervisors Dorothy Longino and , Alta Mae Allen<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> encouraged several employees to attend a lunchtime speech given by employee Randy Tisdale. Tisdale stated that the plant would close if the employees joined the union; Longino and Allen attended the meeting and did not contradict Tisdale. Several supervisors, including Longino, Allen, and Sandra Matthews, let employees know in advance that they would be attending a union meeting held at a local church on August 26; they went to the church that evening, and there is testimony that they attended and made comments at the meeting even though supervisors were explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>excluded by the union representatives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 2, Longino and others slowly drove back and forth past another union meeting held at a roadside park on September 2. Finally, Longino, Allen, and Matthews questioned at least three employees about their union sentiments and asked them about withdrawing their union authorization cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">The union demanded recognition and bargaining rights on September 16, 1976. After the company refused, the union charged the company with unfair labor practices in violation of Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1) and (5)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The NLRB General Counsel, after reviewing the matter, issued a complaint on November 11, 1977. The complaint was heard by an Administrative Law Judge in late July 1978; on March 30,1979, the judge found that the company had coerced its employees, threatened them with plant closure, engaged in surveillance and created the impression of surveillance of union meetings, interrogated employees about their union sentiments, and solicited employees to withdraw their union authorization cards all in violation of Section 8(a)(1). He further found that the unfair labor practices warranted a bargaining order. The Board adopted the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s recommended order with only minor modification on August 8, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">II. The Preliminary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AuD\">The company\u2019s first contention is that the Board erred in determining that Alta Mae Allen and Sandra Matthews were supervisors. \u201cThe Board\u2019s decision on the factual question of ... supervisorial status is conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Sweeney &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>437 F.2d 1127, 1131 (5th Cir. 1971). We find that substantial evidence supported the Board\u2019s finding. The labor act defines supervisor as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">The term \u201csupervisor\u201d means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11). The functions of a supervisor listed in the statute are disjunctive; the Board need not show that an employee performed all or several of the functions to support a finding of supervisory status. <em>NLRB v. Security Guard Service, Inc., </em>384 F.2d 143, 147 (5th Cir. 1967). In the present case, there was considerable evidence before the Administrative Law Judge and the Board that Allen and Matthews did little production work for themselves, but instead told other employees what work to do. The employees were told by the company to obey Allen and Matthews; they performed additional supervisory duties such as monitoring the time cards of late employees, signing production sheets and assigning new work.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">Appellant next contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support the unfair labor practice findings. This contention depends in part on Dadco\u2019s claim that Allen and Matthews were not supervisory and therefore their actions could not be imputed to the company.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since we affirm the Board\u2019s finding that Allen and Mat-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>thews were supervisors, we also affirm its unfair labor practice findings in regard to Allen and Matthews. In addition, Dadco argues that the evidence in regard to the speeches of Dorsky and Cauthen did not support the unfair labor practice findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The complete texts of the speeches are in the record, and they certainly give the impression that the company conducted surveillance of the union meetings. They may also reasonably be construed to threaten plant closure and to solicit withdrawal of authorization cards. There is thus substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s unfair labor practice findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">III. The Bargaining Order</p>\n<p id=\"Amp\">The principal issue in this case is whether the unfair labor practices warranted a bargaining order. The company contends that the Board did not take into account the criteria listed in <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>414 F.2d 661, 668-69 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed.2d 266 (1970), for determining whether it should issue a bargaining order under <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), and that if it had properly taken those criteria into account it would not have issued the order. In particular, Dadco claims that the Administrative Law Judge and the Board did not consider events subsequent to August 1976 which it contends demonstrate that traditional remedies would suffice to insure a fair election. While we would prefer to see more comprehensive and specific findings, the Board did make at least perfunctory findings on the <em>American Cable </em>criteria and the record supports these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In <em>Gissel, </em>the Supreme Court decided that the NLRB could issue an order to bargain in situations where an employer committed serious unfair labor practices which tended to undermine a union\u2019s majority support if those practices made the holding of a fair election unlikely. 395 U.S. at 610-11, 89 S.Ct. at 1938. The Court noted that under these circumstances a cease-and-desist order and a new election would be an empty remedy since the employer had already undermined the union\u2019s strength and destroyed the \u201claboratory conditions necessary for a fair election .... \u201d 395 U.S. at 612, 89 S.Ct. at 1939. Without a bargaining order, the employer would benefit from its own misconduct; it would not only succeed in delaying a fair election, perhaps repeatedly, and delaying the possible onset of unionization, but it would also instill fear in the voting workers. In order to justify such a bargaining order, however, the Board would have to find that a fair election would be unlikely;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">If the Board finds that the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election ... by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order, then such an order should issue</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">395 U.S. at 614-15, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">In <em>American Cable, </em>this court, interpreting <em>Gissel </em>just a month after it was decided, required that the Board make specific findings that the union had a card majority, that the unfair labor practices were \u201cserious and extensive,\u201d that traditional remedies would be unlikely to insure a fair election, and that the employees\u2019 interests would be best served by a bargaining order. On remand, the Board once again issued a bargaining order. This court again denied enforcement, holding that the Board should have determined whether a bargaining order was needed to insure a fair election at the time of the remand, rather than at the time of the unfair labor practices. <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, </em>427 F.2d 446, 448-49 (5th Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>In the present case the Board and the Administrative Law Judge certainly found that the union had a card majority and that the company committed several serious unfair labor practices. As to the need for a bargaining order, the Administrative Law Judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">Based on the foregoing credible evidence, I find and conclude that [Dadco\u2019s] unlawful conduct (unfair labor practices), were serious, pervasive, egregious and substantial enough to prevent the holding of a free election. The unfair labor practices in my opinion, warrant the issuance of a bargaining order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">I find that the unfair labor practices engaged in by [Dadco] were serious, pervasive, egregious and substantial enough to undermine the Union and destroy its majority status making the conduct of a free election impossible. Accordingly, under the criteria set forth in <em>Gissel, </em>[Dadco] has violated Section 8(a)(5) of the Act and a bargaining order is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ado\">Record on Appeal, Vol. 1 at 530, 532. The Board, in its Decision and Order, considered and rejected the company\u2019s contention that the unfair labor practices, in light of the passage of time, did not warrant a bargaining order. The Board noted that \u201cthe impact of a respondent\u2019s serious and flagrant misconduct remains long after it occurs.\u201d Record on Appeal, Vol. 1 at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The generality of the Board\u2019s findings do not compel us to set aside the bargaining order where, as here, the record substantially supports the Board\u2019s conclusions. <em>Chromalloy Mining and Minerals Alaska Division, Chromalloy American Corp. v. NLRB, </em>620 F.2d 1120, 1129-30 (5th Cir. 1980). The record shows the pervasive and egregious nature of the unfair labor practices committed during the 1976 organizational campaign. In a town the size of Coushatta, Louisiana,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the knowledge and the threatening effect of the company\u2019s actions might certainly have remained from August and September 1976 to July 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Accordingly, enforcement of the order of the Board is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\">. There was some disagreement between the parties as to how many employees were employed in the bargaining unit at the time of the incident and how many valid authorization cards the union obtained. The Administrative Law Judge determined that there were 81 employees in the unit, but the Board included one employee who had been excluded by the judge. Record on Appeal, Vol. 1 at 530, 559. Both the Administrative Law Judge and the Board ex-eluded one of the 46 employees who had signed authorization cards, leaving the union with 45 valid cards for 82 employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\">. The Administrative Law Judge and the Board found Alta Mae Allen and Sandra. Matthews to be supervisors, and we affirm that determination later in this opinion. The company concedes that Dorothy Longino was a supervisor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. There is testimony in the record that Allen admitted just after the meeting that she was a supervisor and that she had been sent to observe the meeting by higher company officials. Longino apparently gave Cauthen a report on the meeting. Record on Appeal, Vol. 1 at 520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. The Section 8(a)(5) violation is wholly dependent on the Section 8(a)(1) violations; absent unfair labor practices warranting a <em>Gissel </em>bargaining order, the company would clearly have been within its rights to refuse to bargain pending an election even though the union had obtained authorization cards from a majority of the bargaining unit employees. <em>Linden Lumber Division, Summer &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>419 U.S. 301, 310, 95 S.Ct. 429, 434, 42 L.Ed.2d 465 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b558-13\">. <em>See </em>Respondent\u2019s Brief at 17 and 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b559-8\">. The company apparently does not contest the finding that Longino committed several unfair labor practices; instead it urges that her misconduct was \u201crelatively mild and of brief duration,\u201d and did not warrant a bargaining order. Respondent\u2019s Brief at 25.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"A2i\">. This court has since held that in a case not involving a remand to the Board, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>should evaluate the appropriateness of the bargaining order as of the date of the unfair labor practice proceedings, not as of the date when the matter comes before the court. <em>J. P. Stevens &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>441 F.2d 514, 525 n.16 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 830, 92 S.Ct. 69, 30 L.Ed.2d 59 (1971); <em>see also NLRB v. Gibson Prod. Co., </em>494 F.2d 762, 766 n.4 (5th Cir. 1974). In the present case, we therefore evaluate the bargaining order as of July 1978, the time of the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b560-16\">. The 1970 Census population of Coushatta was 1,492.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b560-11\">GEE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvY\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">I concur in the judgment of the court except insofar as it enforces the Board\u2019s bargaining order. As to that, I would remand for further findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">In <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Supreme Court recognized that bargaining orders could be appropriate remedies in certain <em>limited </em>circumstances. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledged that elections were the preferred method of protecting employee free choice. Attuned to these directives, we have refined and applied the lessons of <em>Gissel </em>in a number of cases, most notably <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>414 F.2d 661 (5th Cir. 1969) <em>(American Cable I), </em>and <em>NLRB v. American Cable Systems, Inc., </em>427 F.2d 446 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 957, 91 S.Ct. 356, 27 L.Ed. 266 (1970) <em>(American Cable II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-14\">In the <em>American Cable </em>cases this court required the Board, in its efforts to impose bargaining orders, to make certain specific findings about the difficulty of holding free elections and the need for such a drastic alternative. The court condemned Board efforts to seek enforcement of these orders based on \u201ca litany, reciting conclusions by rote without factual explication.\u201d <em>American Cable II, </em>427 F.2d at 449. In <em>NLRB v. Gibson Products Co., </em>494 F.2d 762, 766-68 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>(5th Cir. 1974), the court explained further the specificity requirement, mandating findings such as the express inability of less drastic remedies to \u201cpurify\u201d electoral conditions. The findings of the Board here fail the <em>American Cable </em>specificity test (indeed, the Board\u2019s initial brief to this court does not mention these cases). The Board found the company to have committed serious and pervasive unfair labor practices-the leap from that finding to imposition of the bargaining order is made on no further analysis. This is not much more than the \u201cjejune regurgitation\u201d of the company\u2019s past offenses condemned in <em>American Cable II, </em>427 F.2d at 448-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In a very recent panel opinion, <em>Chromalloy American Corp. v. NLRB, </em>620 F.2d 1120 (5th Cir. 1980), we dealt with a similar situation. There the Board\u2019s findings were similarly vague and unspecific; and Judge Wisdom wrote that \u201cthe Board has ignored the specificity requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1129. That deficiency, however, was not fatal. Citing <em>Gibson Products </em>for the proposition, the court held that it \u201cmay provide the necessary analysis to avoid further delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130 (a somewhat shaky reference, as in <em>Gibson Products </em>the case had already been remanded once to the Board for these <em>American Cable </em>findings). Relying on the findings made by the Board, the court looked to the severity of the unfair labor practices and the past history of antiunion behavior on management\u2019s part to find the likelihood of recurrence to be such as to make the imposition of a bargaining order the necessary remedy. Despite the absence of clear <em>American Cable </em>findings, the court enforced the bargaining order because the situation met, in its opinion, the standards set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Gissel. Id. </em>at 1130-31. The absence of express findings therefore does not, in very extreme cases, call for remand to the Board or preclude enforcement. But considering the overwhelming reliance in <em>Chromalloy </em>on the employer\u2019s egregious past record and the inability of that or any panel to overrule <em>American Cable I </em>and <em>II, </em>one cannot say that <em>American Cable </em>findings are no longer required in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">In <em>Chromalloy </em>and in this case the companies argue that substantial employee turnover makes the bargaining orders unfair and inappropriate. Perhaps the Board need not be overwhelmed by such evidence: <em>Chromalloy </em>states that the Board need not determine that the actual, present sentiment of the majority of the workers favors unionization before a bargaining order can issue. <em>Id. </em>at 1132. Rather, it asserts, the focus should be on the unlikelihood, at the time of the order\u2019s issuance, of an election\u2019s being an accurate indication of employee sentiment, due to the unfair labor practices of the employer. I think this dubious, but at the least employee turnover between the time of commission of the practices and the hearings before the ALJ remains a relevant factor in evaluating the need for a bargaining order. <em>See Chromalloy, </em>620 F.2d at 1133; <em>Bandag, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>583 F.2d 765, 773 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">In <em>Chromalloy </em>the court found whatever relevance the turnover figures there enjoyed to be outweighed by two other findings: (1) employer recidivism was strongly suggested by the recent past history of union opposition; and (2) the employer was found guilty of a discriminatory refusal to recall an employee, suggesting that the turnover was due at least in part to these antiunion sentiments. 620 F.2d at 1133. Findings of this or of a similar nature are absent from the Board\u2019s opinion in this case. The Board\u2019s response to Dadco\u2019s arguments about employer turnover consists of two sentences, the first a pronouncement of Board power to issue such an order, and the second a reference to a recent Board determination that the impact of grievous misconduct remains long after the particular events. These are not \u201cfindings\u201d in this case by the Board but mere assertions: I give them in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As such, they are entitled to no special deference from us.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The Board\u2019s course of decision comes ever closer to \u201cthe cavalier use of bargaining orders\u201d condemned in <em>American Cable II, </em>427 F.2d at 449. The <em>Gissel </em>remedy is an exceptional one, not the rule: Elections are the preferred method. These are three-party, not two-party, situations; and such actions as the Board has here taken, focussing on penalizing an obstreperous employer, do so at the risk of forcing an unwanted union on employees. Unwilling to bow to the Board\u2019s apparent resolve to broaden the <em>Gissel </em>exception, ignore our <em>American Cable </em>decisions, and impose its view on our circuit, I would remand for proper <em>American Cable </em>findings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">. It is also well settled that the Board is not precluded from issuing a bargaining order where, as here, there has been a considerable length of time and a substantial amount of turnover since the commission of the unfair labor practices. In this connection, the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>recently held with respect to the significance of the passage of time that the impact of a respondent\u2019s serious and flagrant misconduct remains long after it occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-25\">(footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
