(\"Quest\"); Athena Diagnostics, Inc. (\"Athena\"); and ADI Holdings Inc. (\"ADI\") (hereinafter collectively, \"Defendants\") in the Court of Common Pleas for Richland County, South Carolina. The action was removed to this court on March 28, 2016. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants negligently performed diagnostic testing on her son (\"Decedent\"), and that the negligent acts or omissions give rise to claims for wrongful death, a survivorship action, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and violation of South Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the court on Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) filed on June 24, 2016, ECF No. 25. Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendants' motion on July 25, 2016, ECF No. 28, to which Defendants filed a reply on August 11, 2016. ECF No. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Decedent was born on August 23, 2005. When he was four months old, he began suffering from febrile focal motor seizures. Decedent's treating clinical geneticists, John McKinley Shoffner, M.D. and Frances Dougherty Kendall, M.D., diagnosed him with probable mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 15. Decedent's physicians extracted Deoxyribonucleic acid (\"DNA\") from a blood sample and provided the DNA to Athena's lab for a SCN1A DNA Sequencing Clinical Diagnostic Test so as to confirm or deny the diagnosis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Athena issued a SCN1A DNA Sequencing Clinical Diagnostic Report on June 30, 2007 (the \"2007 Report\"), which indicated Decedent possessed a DNA mutation in the SCN1A gene classified as a \"variant of unknown significance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. The glossary included in the 2007 Report defined variant of unknown significance as, \"DNA sequence variants that are detected reproducibly, but have not been correlated with clinical presentation and/or pathology in the current literature, nor do they result in a readily predictable effect upon protein structure and function.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. In a section entitled \"Interpretation,\" the 2007 Report provided the following information: \"This individual possesses a DNA sequence variant or combination of variants in the SCN1A gene whose significance is unknown (missense variant of unknown significance). Testing of the biological parents is strongly recommended to resolve the uncertainty of these test results.\" ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   No. 24-1 at 7. In a section entitled \"Comments,\" the 2007 Report further stated: \"[T]he results of this analysis cannot be definitively interpreted ...\"; \"Testing of the biological parents is strongly recommended (for no additional charge) to help resolve the uncertainty of this sequent variant's pathogenicity and the uncertainty of the predicted phenotype\"; \"Most mutations that cause SMEI are de novo, or sporadic (arise in the affected individual rather than being inherited) an inheritance pattern that can be confirmed by testing of parents\"; \"In order to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of this patient's SCN1A results, Athena Diagnostics is requesting samples from the biological parents of this patient\"; and \"Athena will perform a target analysis on these samples for variant(s) identified in gene SCN1A only and use the findings to help interpret the patient's SCN1A result(s) at no additional charge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 8, 12. Drs. Shoffner and Kendall and Decedent's treating neurologist, Timothy Scott Livingston, M.D., relied on the classification to administer treatment to Decedent appropriate for epileptic seizures not caused by Dravet Syndrome. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mutation in Decedent's SCN1A gene \"possessed the characteristics expected of a disease causing alteration,\" and had been reported and studied as a mutation associated with Dravet Syndrome. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 22. The 2007 Report correctly identified \"the transversion in question located on the correct SCN1A gene,\" but Athena had \"simply [ ] mislabeled\" the mutation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24. Decedent subsequently passed away on January 5, 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2014, at the request of Plaintiff, Decedent's physicians contacted Athena and Quest to ask for a copy of the 2007 Report. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 43. Before that time Plaintiff had not seen or read the 2007 Report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. On January 30, 2015, Quest and Athena jointly produced a Revised Report (\"2015 Report\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. The 2015 Report classified Decedent's DNA mutation correctly as a \"known disease associated mutation\" consistent with Dravet Syndrome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that, because of the error in the 2007 Report, Decedent was not provided with proper medication and treatment, and, in fact, the treatment he received exacerbated his seizures. Plaintiff alleges that Decedent lost his life as a proximate result of Athena's negligent laboratory practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At all times relevant to this lawsuit, Athena employed Narasimhan Naga, Ph.D. and Hui Zhu, Ph.D. as Directors of Genetics and Sat Dev Batish, Ph.D. as Chief Director of Genetics. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. The 2007 Report lists these individuals as those who reviewed the laboratory results and submitted the clinical information. ECF No. 24-1 at 17. Plaintiff alleges that at the time the 2007 Report was issued, Athena employed Joseph J. Higgins, M.D. as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA\") Laboratory Director and license holder, and that Dr. Higgins signed the Report in that capacity. ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 24-1 at 17. CLIA refers to a \"federal certification process for laboratories that perform clinical diagnostic tests on human specimens in the United States.\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 27. ADI owns all outstanding shares of Athena.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. In 2011, Quest purchased ADI and acquired all of that company's outstanding shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the removal of this action to federal court, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint with the consent of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ECF No. 19, 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants thereafter filed a motion to dismiss, arguing\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that the amended complaint is barred by the six-year statute of repose applicable to actions brought against licensed health care providers, and that Athena qualifies as a \"licensed health care provider,\" as described by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-79-410\">\n    S.C.

On January 4, 2017, the court heard oral argument on the motion and took the matter under advisement. ECF No. 34. The court subsequently indicated its inclination to certify to the South Carolina Supreme Court the question of whether diagnostic laboratories are considered health care providers pursuant to S.C. Code \u00a7 38-79-410, and heard limited argument from the parties on the topic during a telephone conference held March 2, 2017. ECF No. 36, 39. The court thereafter certified the following question to the South Carolina Supreme Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Is a federally licensed genetic testing laboratory acting as a \"licensed health care provider\" as defined by S.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 38-79-410 when, at the request of a patient's treating physician, the laboratory performs genetic testing to detect an existing disease or disorder?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ECF No. 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 27, 2018, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion answering the certified question in the affirmative. ECF No. 59. The Court held that genetic testing laboratories such as Athena that perform testing at the request of a patient's treating physician for the purpose of assisting the treating physician in detecting an existing disease or disorder constitute licensed health care providers as contemplated by section 38-79-410.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2038-79-410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court thereafter granted the parties leave to file supplemental briefs addressing whether the amended complaint alleges medical malpractice or ordinary negligence.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff alleges negligence resulting in wrongful death and giving rise to a survivorship action as to Athena only, and claims negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and violation of the Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"UTPA\") as to all Defendants. Defendants assert five grounds for dismissing the amended complaint. First, they argue that the applicable statutes of limitation operate to bar each claim because Plaintiff had constructive notice of her potential claims from warnings and recommendations included in the 2007 Report. Second, Defendants argue that the wrongful death and survivorship actions and claims for negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud are predicated on the alleged misdiagnosis of Decedent's medical condition in 2007, and are subject to the six-year statute of repose for medical malpractice claims as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015-3-545\">\n    S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 15-3-545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A), regardless of when Plaintiff had constructive notice. Third, they contend that the claims for negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud fail to sufficiently allege justifiable reliance on the alleged false statement. Fourth, they contend that by virtue of their unitary ownership they are incapable as a matter of law of conspiring with themselves; and the conspiracy claim does not set forth additional facts or special damages unique to the alleged conspiracy. Finally, Defendants argue Plaintiff fails to adequately plead that Defendants' wrongful acts affect the public interest so as to state a claim under the Unfair Trade Practices Act. ECF No. 25-1 at 4.

Indeed, Defendants assert, Plaintiff attaches to the amended complaint the affidavits of two of Decedent's treating physicians, who each opine as to Athena's duty and breach of care with respect to the misclassification of the mutation. Plaintiff contends in response that Defendants' failure to accurately classify the mutation \"may have resulted from a routine scrivener's error, whereby a laboratory technician simply failed to select, or write in, the correct category after reviewing correct results.\" ECF No. 28 at 23. She further posits:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [a]nother possibility might simply be that Athena did not update its database used to compare mutations with other known disease associations or even that Athena's database may have had corrupted information or information that was entered into the database in such a way as to make the ensuing comparative search ineffective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.

Plaintiff alleges that Decedent's physicians extracted his DNA and provided it to Athena to perform the SCN1A test \"for the very limited purpose of 'detecting an existing disease, illness, impairment, symptom or disorder' on the particular gene where a connection to Dravet would likely be found.\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 17. The amended complaint raises allegations that support different theories as to why the mutation was misclassified. First, Plaintiff asserts allegations that appear to implicate the provision of medical services. For example, Plaintiff alleges, \"[b]y not providing [Decedent's] doctors with the definitive answer that the mutation was known to be associated with Dravet Syndrome, which was the main reason for conducting the test in question, Defendants breached a duty of care owed to [Plaintiff] by misleading the child's doctors.\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 24. Plaintiff also alleges the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   the 2007 Report indicates that ... [Dr.] Batish, reviewed the laboratory results and submitted the erroneous clinical information of [Decedent]. Moreover, Batish is one of the authors of the Harkin et al., 2007 publication ..., which identifies [Decedent's] mutation as one associated with Dravet. This scholarly paper was\n   submitted and published prior to Athena's issuance of the 2007 Report. As such, Batish clearly knew, or should have known, that a mistake was apparent on the 2007 Report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 31. As Defendants note, Plaintiff offers the affidavits of Drs. Cook-Deegan and Wiznitzer to support her theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   However, Plaintiff also asserts a second theory, which sounds in ordinary negligence. She notes that Athena accurately \"detected and identified 'a transversion from thymine (T) to adenine (A) at nucleotide position 1237 at codon 413 resulting in the amino acid change of tyrosine (Y) to asparagine (N).\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 24. She then alleges that, notwithstanding the proper detection of the transversion, \"Athena negligently failed to correctly classify the DNA missense mutation in the decedent's SCN1A gene.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Plaintiff attributes that error to Athena's failure to follow \"classification procedures of Athena's CLIA certification,\" described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   the laboratory must have an adequate system(s) in place to ensure test results are accurately and reliably sent from the point of data entry to final report destination, in a timely manner and [ ] the laboratory must establish and follow written policies and procedures for an ongoing mechanism to monitor, assess, and when indicated, correct problems identified in the analytic systems.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32. Plaintiff further alleges that \"[a]s a result of the various violations of CLIA and the errors in classification cited above, doctors for [Decedent] continued in their mistaken original diagnosis that [Decedent] suffered from a mitochondrial disorder and continued with treatments designed for same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. Finally, Plaintiff argues in opposition to the motion that \"[t]he need to update a database, necessary for proper comparative purposes, or the need to ensure the selection of a label that agrees with the information provided 'raise issues that are within the common knowledge and experience of the [fact finder]' and as such raise claims of ordinary negligence.\" ECF No. 28 at 24 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The record is unclear as to what caused the staff at Athena to misclassify the Decedent's mutation. While Plaintiff asserts allegations that implicate the inadequate provision of professional services in classifying Decedent's mutation, she also asserts allegations sufficient to demonstrate that the misclassification of Decedent's mutation could have been caused by ordinary negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079500\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/408/171/\">\n    758 S.E.2d at 504-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that differentiating between medical malpractice claims and ordinary negligence claims depends heavily on the facts of each case, and holding that an action against a hospital related to \"nonmedical, administrative, ministerial, or routine care\" sounds in ordinary negligence).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iodice v.

Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiff had \"means of knowledge\" and access to a definitive diagnosis for Decedent because the 2007 Report stated \"repeatedly and with emphasis that the classification was inconclusive and uncertain,\" and that \"parental testing was 'strongly recommended' in order to confirm or refute that the genetic mutation was pathogenic.\" ECF No. 25-1 at 24-25. The 2007 Report also stated that Athena \"offered to perform genetic testing of the biological parents free of charge, and included a form 'Requisition for Parental Testing' with instructions on how to obtain the free parental testing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"892385\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/366/204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff forewent testing for herself despite the warnings and recommendations contained in the Report, and, thus, Defendants contend, she cannot now claim to have relied on the misclassification. Additionally, during oral argument, Defendants argued that even if Plaintiff did not read the 2007\n   Report until September 2014, Decedent's doctors' knowledge of the Report should be imputed to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35 at 11:7-13, 12:25-13:9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 31 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In opposition, Plaintiff argues that Decedent's doctors \"should have been able to rely on the classification of the variant type listed on the 2007 Reports Technical Results when diagnosing and prescribing a set of appropriate treatments.\" ECF No. 28 at 26. Plaintiff further asserts that Defendants' argument that reliance on the classification was not justifiable given the stated inconclusive nature of the results \"grossly distorts the very nature of the classification system used by Defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"892385\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/366/204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiff contends that in revising the classification of Decedent's mutation in the 2015 Report, Athena all but admitted it negligently misrepresented Decedent's mutation in the 2007 Report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In the amended complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Decedent's doctors expected the test administered by Athena to \"clearly confirm whether [Decedent] possessed a DNA mutation linked to Dravet,\" because the test was \"specifically designed and marketed to identify mutations linked to Dravet Syndrome.\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 23. Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Athena licensed and utilized the patent for SCN1A DNA clinical diagnostic testing in the United States, and that because the process for identifying Decedent's particular mutation of the SCN1A gene was, at the time of the 2007 Report, subject to this patent and because Athena \"had the sole responsibility for creating and defining the possible 'Variant Types' listed in the Technical Results,\" Decedent's doctors had no \"meaningful opportunity for second opinions.\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30. Plaintiff further alleges that the 2007 Report reflects that Dr. Batish, who had earlier in 2007 co-authored a publication identifying the mutation as one associated with Dravet Syndrome, reviewed the clinical findings and \"submitted the erroneous clinical information of [Decedent].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"The general rule is that questions concerning reliance and its reasonableness are factual questions for the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Unlimited Services, Inc. v.

However, even if knowledge of the 2007 Report and the warnings and recommendations contained therein is imputed to Plaintiff, the question remains whether she acted reasonably in relying on the classification. In light of the allegations regarding Athena's expertise in administering SCN1A DNA clinical diagnostic testing and the lack of opportunity for Decedent to obtain a meaningful second opinion, the court cannot determine as a matter of law that Plaintiff acted unreasonably, or without justification, in relying on the classification stated in the 2007 Report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

ECF No. 25-1 at 25. Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff \"alleges nothing more than a combination ...

Rather, Plaintiff contends that Quest conspired with ADI and Athena prior to the 2011 acquisition, \"[a]t some point between the issuance of the 2007 Report and the issuance of the 2015 Report,\" ECF No. 24 at \u00b6 77, and that \"[a] jury could well determine that acts in furtherance of the conspiracy occurred on Athena's part prior to the 2011 purchase of the entity by Quest.\" ECF No. 28 at 28.

Second, Plaintiff has provided no particularized allegations necessary to find a conspiracy prior to 2011.

As Defendants note in their reply:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The pleading does not allege any action by Quest prior to the 2011 acquisition of ADI. To the contrary, the Amended Complaint alleges that the purpose of the Defendants' conspiracy was \"exclusively to protect corporate assets of defendants Athena, ADI, and Quest.\" [ ] The pleading then goes on to allege, as to Quest, that it and Athena \"jointly issued the revised 2015 Report ... and forwarded this revised 2015 Report to [Plaintiff].

Quest purchased them I believe it was 2011.
