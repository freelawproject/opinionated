The motions are fully briefed and ripe for review. Having considered the motions, briefing, and applicable law, the Court finds that Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 19) should be and is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 16) should be and is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulation, ECF No. 15. On April 4, 2012, Sharon Shadic (whose married name is now Sharon Barnes) filed a qui tam action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, captioned\n   <em>\n    United States of America ex rel. Sharon Shadic v. UFC Aerospace, United Fastener Company, Inc. and Douglas B. Davis, on behalf of the United States of America\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In that case, the United States sought to recover damages and penalties from defendants under Section 3729, et seq. of the False Claims Act (\"FCA\"), arising from Defendant UFC misrepresenting itself as a woman-owned small business to obtain government contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States intervened in the qui tam action filed by Sharon Shadic on or about October 5, 2015. Shortly thereafter, a Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Dismissal was entered into by the United States, Sharon Shadic (as Relator), and the Defendants in the qui tam action, which called for a settlement payment from Defendants\n   to the United States in the total amount of $ 20,015,956.92. The United States and Sharon Shadic simultaneously entered into a Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Release in which it was agreed that Sharon Shadic was entitled to receive $ 3,602,872.25, or 18%, of the total settlement payment. The Release provides that it \"does not resolve or in any manner affect any claims the United States has or may have against the Relator arising under Title 26, U.S. Code (Internal Revenue Code), or any claims arising under this U.S. Relator Release Stipulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs Sharon and Duncan Barnes timely filed a joint Form 1040 for the 2015 tax year, reporting the $ 3.6 million relator award on Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business. The Barnes paid income tax in the amount of $ 914,922.00. Plaintiffs then timely filed an amended Form 1040X for the 2015 tax year, seeking a refund of federal income tax of $ 875,005.00 plus statutory interest, on the basis that settlement proceeds from a qui tam action are not taxable income. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service disallowed all but $ 67,912.00 of the amount claimed as a refund. The IRS proposed to re-characterize the relator share award from net business income/profits on Schedule C to Form 1040, line 21, \"Other Income,\" resulting in a refund of $ 67,921.00 of self-employment taxes reported and paid. Plaintiffs Sharon and Duncan Barnes subsequently timely filed this suit for a refund. Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs move for summary judgment, arguing that a qui tam recovery is not subject to taxation. Br. Supp. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 1, ECF No. 17. In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that qui tam settlement proceeds are taxable as capital gains rather than as ordinary income.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment contends that qui tam awards are taxable income. Br. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 5, ECF No. 20. Defendant also argues that qui tam awards are taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains. Def.'s Resp. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 4, ECF No. 21. These\n   cross-motions present the Court with two legal issues. First, whether a relator's qui tam award is subject to federal income tax. And if so, whether the award is subject to ordinary income or capital gains treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Qui Tam Awards Are Taxable Income\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that proper application of the \"origin of the claim\" doctrine would show that a qui tam award is not subject to taxation. Br. Supp. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 3, ECF No. 17. Plaintiffs' argument rests on four premises: (1) under the origin of the claim doctrine, taxability is determined by the origin and nature of the claim to which the recovery relates; (2) assignment does not change the character of proceeds for tax purposes; (3) pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency of Nat. Resources v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n    529 U.S. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), by filing an action under the FCA, the relator effects a partial assignment of the Government's claim for damages; and (4) the United States does not pay taxes. Br. Supp. Pls.' Mot. Summ. J. 3-4, ECF No. 17. Therefore, Plaintiffs contend that \"the partial assignment of the Government's claim to the relator does not alter the non-taxable character of the original claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For Plaintiffs, any \"recovery retains its nontaxable character, whether or not the recipient of the damages is the injured party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue that taxing the relator's award violates the terms of the FCA by effectively increasing the Government's share of the recovery beyond the FCA's 85% statutory cap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant responds that, even under the origin of the claim doctrine, qui tam payments are subject to taxes. Def.'s Resp. Pls.'s Mot. Summ. J 2, ECF No. 21. Because qui tam awards compensate for personal services, and are really a bounty or a fee, Defendant argues they constitute ordinary income. Br. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 6, ECF No. 20. Moreover, Defendant contends that in\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court \"merely held that the FCA effects a partial assignment of the claim for purposes of standing.\" Def.'s Resp. Pls.'s Mot. Summ. J 3, ECF No. 21. Finally, Defendant rejects the argument that Plaintiffs should be treated as co-equals with the Government and therefore not be taxed on their award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues that the relator acts as an instrumentality of the Government and that the claim belongs to the Government as the injured party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") broadly defines gross income as \"all income from whatever source derived.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2061\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Text and precedent confirm this. The qui tam provisions of the FCA were \"enacted in 1863 to combat fraud by Civil War defense contractors,\" and authorized \"private citizens (called relators) to sue on behalf of the government and, as a bounty, share in any recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Where the action is one which the court finds to be based primarily on disclosures of specific information (other than information provided by the person bringing the action) relating to allegations or transactions in a criminal, civil, or administrative hearing, in a congressional, administrative, or Government Accounting Office report, hearing, audit, or investigation, or from the news media, the court may award such sums as it considers appropriate, but in no case more than 10 percent of the proceeds,\n   <strong>\n    taking into account the significance of the information and the role of the person bringing the action in advancing the case to litigation\n   </strong>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203730\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (emphasis added). This language reflects the nature of the qui tam award as one that compensates the relator for his role in the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Supreme Court, this Circuit, and the majority of circuit courts have also deemed the relator's award a bounty or fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Black's Law Dictionary defines a bounty as \"premium or benefit offered or given, esp. by a government, to induce someone to take action or perform a service.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Therefore, Plaintiffs' argument that the application of the \"origin of the claim\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   doctrine precludes taxation of qui tam awards is erroneous, because a qui tam relator's payment is itself in the nature of a bounty or fee that rewards an individual for his assistance in assisting the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument requires improperly characterizing the relator's award and expanding the scope of the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency\n   </em>\n   evaluated a relator's Article III standing under the FCA.\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n    529 U.S. at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509149\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/765/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For this reason, the Court does not find Plaintiffs' view of\n   <em>\n    Vermont Agency\n   </em>\n   persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the Court also finds that taxing the relator's award does not contravene the statutory caps found in the FCA because the language of the FCA limits the\n   <em>\n    relator's award\n   </em>\n   , not the Government's proceeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   31 U.S. C. \u00a7 3730(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 16) and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion Summary Judgment (ECF No. 20) on the issue of gross income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As discussed above, the relator's fee is a bounty or reward for bringing the litigation. Contrary to Plaintiffs' view that the relator's \"exclusive interest in the action\" makes it \"property,\" Plaintiffs' interest is in future payment for services rendered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340169\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/885/#p888\">\n    799 F.3d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analogizing to an attorney's interest under a contingency fee arrangement, the court explained \"[t]he attorney's interest in future compensation for legal work, and [the relator's] interest in a future award for his investigative work, both constitute an interest in future payment for services\"). As the Seventh Circuit explained, \"[t]reating a relator's reward as a capital gain would contravene the long-recognized rule that a 'capital gain' generally involves a 'realization of appreciation in value accrued over a substantial period of time' of an initial investment of capital.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340169\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/885/#p888\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Commissioner v.
