The parties agree that this matter is appropriate for resolution by summary judgment with each contending they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court, having reviewed the wealth of motions, memoranda, responses, and other documentation in this case, listening to oral argument, and being otherwise fully advised, finds as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case has a long history before this Court. The dispute centers on recently enacted Wyoming statutes which impose criminal and civil penalties for data collection on private land or when private land is crossed to reach public land without landowner permission. The Tenth Circuit has summarized many of the relevant facts,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, Wyoming enacted a pair of statutes that prohibited individuals from entering \"open land for the purpose of collecting resource data\" without permission from the owner. Wyo. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414 (2015) ; 40-27-101 (2015). The statutes were largely identical, with one imposing criminal punishment, \u00a7 6-3-414(c) (2015), and the other imposing civil liability, \u00a7 40-27-101(c) (2015). \"Resource data\" was defined as \"data relating to land or land use,\" including that related to \"air, water, soil, conservation, habitat, vegetation or animal species.\" \u00a7 6-3-414(d)(iv) (2015). And the term \"collect\" was defined as requiring two elements: (1) taking a \"sample of material\" or a \"photograph.\" or \"otherwise preserv[ing] information in any form\" that is (2) \"submitted or intended to be submitted to any agency of the state or federal government.\" \u00a7 6-3-414(d)(i) (2015). Information obtained in violation of these provisions could not be used in\n   any proceeding other than an action under the statutes themselves. \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414(e) (2015) ; 40-27-101(d) (2015). The statutes also required government agencies to expunge data collected in violation of their provisions and forbade the agencies from considering such data \"in determining any agency action.\" \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414(f) (2015) ; 40-27-101(f) (2015).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The 2015 criminal statute imposed heightened penalties above and beyond Wyoming's general trespass provision. It provided a maximum term of imprisonment of one year and a S1,000 fine for first time offenders. \u00a7 6-3-414(c)(i) (2015). Repeat offenders faced a mandatory minimum ten days' imprisonment, a maximum of one year, and a $5,000 fine. \u00a7 6-3-414(c)(ii) (2015). The 2015 civil statute imposed liability for proximate damages and \"litigation costs,\" including attorneys' fees. \u00a7 40-27-101(c)(2015).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs, who are advocacy organizations, filed suit to challenge the 2015 statutes. They argued that the statutes violated the Free Speech and Petition Clauses of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and were preempted by federal law. Defendants moved to dismiss. Granting the motion in part and denying it in part, the district court held that plaintiffs had stated plausible free speech, petition, and equal protection claims, but failed to state a preemption claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   After the district court's decision, Wyoming amended the two statutes. Wyo. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414 (2016) ; 40-27-101 (2016). The revised statutes continue to impose heightened criminal punishment, \u00a7 6-3-414, and civil liability, \u00a7 40-27-101. But the amendments eliminate reference to \"open lands\" and instead penalize any individual who without authorization: (1) enters private land \"for the purpose of collecting resource data\"; (2) enters private land and \"collects resource data\"; or (3) \"crosses private land to access adjacent or proximate land where he collects resource data.\" \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414(a) - (c) ; 40-27-101(a)-(c). Under the current version of the statutes, there is no requirement that resource data be submitted to, or intended to be submitted, to a government agency. Instead, the term \"collect\" now means: (1) \"to take a sample of material\" or \"acquire, gather, photograph or otherwise preserve information in any form\"; and (2) \"recording ... a legal description or geographical coordinates of the location of the collection.\" \u00a7\u00a7 6-3-414(e)(i) ; 40-27-101(h)(i).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs amended their complaint to challenge the 2016 statutes, re-alleging free speech and equal protection claims. Defendants again moved to dismiss. This time, the district court granted the motion in full. It concluded that the revised version of the statutes did not implicate protected speech. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, plaintiffs challenge only the district court's ruling regarding subsections (c) of the statutes under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Western Watersheds Project v.

First, taking Plaintiffs' motion and drawing all inferences against Plaintiffs, they have shown standing to bring a First Amendment claim. Plaintiffs have shown a causal connection and redressability, which Defendants do not contest. Plaintiffs have also shown, and Defendants do not contest, they have engaged in the past in the type of speech affected by the challenged government action. Further, Plaintiffs have provided affidavits stating a present desire, though no specific plans, to engage in such speech. Only element three of the\n   <em>\n    Initiative &amp; Referendum Inst.\n   </em>\n   'chill test' is truly at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue any harm resulting from mistaken trespass is conjectural because Plaintiffs are professionals who should know their location and cannot rely on the assumption they will mistakenly trespass. Defendants point to the fact that Plaintiffs can utilize various measures to ensure they do not trespass and can exercise caution knowing the limitations of the resources available. These arguments ignore the language of the test for standing. Plaintiffs must only assert a \"a plausible claim\" that they have self-censored \"because of a credible threat that the statute will be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Initiative &amp; Referendum Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3090001\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/1082/#p1089\">\n    450 F.3d at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even taking all of Defendant's arguments as true, Plaintiffs can\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     plausibly\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   argue given the inaccuracies of maps and GPS and the intertwined nature of public and private lands in Wyoming, that Plaintiffs have refrained from protected speech activity out of fear of enforcement. There is no indication there is not a credible threat of enforcement given the recency of the statute and lack of a governmental vow of non-enforcement. Plaintiffs provide the report of an expert which points out the inaccuracies of GPS technology and even Defendants agree that GPS and maps are not \"100% accurate\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 96-12, 99). Plaintiffs also provide affidavits of individuals alleging fear of prosecution given these inaccuracies and their desired conduct. While Defendants point out extensive alternate measures Plaintiffs could take, the same risk of inaccuracy applies. Additionally, some of these measures could be extremely costly, at least in time if not in other resources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    American Civil Liberties Union v.

Defendants do not directly challenge these affidavits in their responsive briefing beyond stating the chill is \"unsupported by [Plaintiffs'] responses to the State Defendants' interrogatories,\" but do thoroughly cover this argument in their own motion for summary judgment. Even drawing all inferences against Plaintiffs, the affidavits do support a finding of standing. The Natural Resources Defense Council (\"NRDC\") Plaintiffs point to an investigation of air quality near the Beartooth Front that was suspended in light of the 2015 and 2016 statutes and that NRDC continues to be interested in carrying out (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Buccino Aff. \u00b6 12-13). The fact that this chill began with the 2015 laws and continues with the laws today does not invalidate the claim as Defendants suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Western Watersheds Project (\"WWP\") Plaintiffs also identify numerous sites they would collect data from if not for the threat imposed by the statutes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Molvar Aff. \u00b6 21). The Affidavit indicates numerous measures have been taken to prevent mistaken trespass, but that \"maps often are not at the scale needed to determine exact boundaries, boundaries in Wyoming are often unmarked, and, even if WWP knows the exact location of the boundary, GPS devices are imprecise\" (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Defendants argue WWP Plaintiffs could do more to ascertain the correct boundaries, but even taking this as true, Plaintiffs' can establish standing where the statute imposes sufficiently significant and costly compliance measures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11560706\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/194/1149/#p1154\">\n    194 F.3d at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants allege WWP representative Jonathan Ratner would be chilled even by the general trespass statute given his deposition testimony, making his affidavit meaningless. However, after discussing this chill, Mr. Ratner goes on to immediately indicate he had still engaged in his collection activities prior to these statutes given his good faith about his use of only public lands. The removal of this good faith protection has led to chilling for Mr. Ratner (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99-7) (Ratner Depo. at 47);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-303\">\n    Wyo.

Mr. Ratner also indicated these new statutes have prevented him from further activity since they illustrate there will be punishment from \"significantly powerful political enemies\" for resource data collection (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-303\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-303\">\n    at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Many of Defendants arguments seem to boil down to 'if the Plaintiffs simply do not seek to engage in their protected speech creation activities, they will not risk violating the statute.' This is not constitutionally acceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Defendants challenge the specific claims of Plaintiff National Press Photographers Association (\"NPPA\"). NPPA Plaintiffs identify several stories and photographs they have not been able to complete\n   given fears of mistaken trespass and the pressing timelines that exist in the field of journalism (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Thuermer Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 12-14). Defendants argue NPPA Plaintiffs could take measures to avoid much of this risk. However, this again ignores what Plaintiffs need to show to establish the challenged element, a plausible claim that they presently have no intention to engage in the protected speech or conduct because of a credible threat that the statute will be enforced. Further, given the highly time-sensitive deadlines involved in journalism, NPPA Plaintiffs have a strong argument regarding the high costs of compliance measures. The NPPA allegations support a finding of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Turning to Defendants' motion for summary judgment and making all inferences against Defendants, the Court finds this motion must be denied. Defendants have not shown Plaintiffs' chill claims are too speculative or that the specific Plaintiffs lack concrete injuries. Plaintiffs have made a plausible claim that they presently have no intention to carry out their desired speech activities because of a credible threat that the statutes will be enforced. Defendants make identical arguments in their own motion for summary judgment as they do in response to Plaintiffs' motion. These claims will be rejected for the reasons outlined above. If anything, Plaintiffs' claims are even stronger in this framework given the posture of this motion which requires the Court to draw all inferences in favor of Plaintiffs. The Court finds Plaintiffs have standing and now turns to the claims on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. Facial Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, the Court must address whether the challenge is as-applied or facial in nature.

Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), for the proposition that a \"challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" Plaintiffs argue that Defendants misstate the law in their responsive briefing. Defendants also allege Plaintiffs' as-applied challenge fails because \"the laws have not been 'applied' to anyone, and the record is insufficient\" (ECF No. 99 at 20-21). Plaintiffs ask the Court to find the statutes unconstitutional and enjoin their enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A plaintiff \"may challenge the constitutionality of a statute by asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.

A district court in the District of Utah has faced a similar issue, and concluded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n    The State's final argument is that even if the lying and recording criminalized by the Act are otherwise protectable speech, the First Amendment plays no role in this case because the Act applies only to speech on private property, and the First Amendment does not apply on private property.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    The cases cited by the State deal with the first concept. They stand for the proposition that the First Amendment is typically not a defense to generally-applicable tort laws. Specifically, as relevant here, they hold that the First Amendment does not provide a license to trespass on private property, and, as a corollary, nor does it provide a defense in a trespass suit. In short, the cases cited by the State answer the question of whether a landowner can remove someone from her property or sue for trespass even when the person wishes to exercise First Amendment rights. And generally, as the cases make clear, the answer is yes. But that is not the question before the court. The question here is whether the State (not a private landowner) can prosecute (not sue for damages) a person based on her speech on private property. And at this point in the analysis, the question is the threshold one of whether it can do so without even justifying or tailoring the law. The State cites no authority for this proposition. Nor has the court found any, and seemingly for good reason: it is contrary to basic First Amendment principles. If a person's First Amendment rights were extinguished the moment she stepped foot on private property, the State could, for example, criminalize any criticism of the Governor, or any discussion about the opposition party, or any talk of politics whatsoever, if done on private property. This runs directly afoul of the First Amendment, which \"was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people,\" whether in the public square or in private coffee shops and cafes.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Animal Legal Def.

Utah 2017). The fact that some instances of criminalized conduct may occur on private land does not prevent this Court from conducting its' analysis. Defendants also ignore the fact that the law would be applicable to data collectors on private land with landowner permission who incidentally crossed other private land without permission. Defendants conceded at oral argument such individuals have a similar speech interest to those on public land. The Court asked both parties at oral argument whether the framework described in\n    <em>\n     Herbert\n    </em>\n    required a distinct analysis for the civil statute at issue in this case. Neither party seemed to believe any distinct analysis was required and the Court will not push the matter any further\n    <em>\n     sua sponte.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
