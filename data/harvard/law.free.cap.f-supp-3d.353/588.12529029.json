Van Tatenhove, United States District Judge\n   Federal judges often find themselves at the intersection of state law and federal law and faced with the dilemma of which direction to turn. Occasionally, an area of state law can circumvent the Founding Fathers' dictate that federal law reign supreme, but only in rare situations. This action is the third and final installment of several related cases, all concerning the same intersection of state law and federal law. After several hearings and many hundreds of pages of briefing, the Court finds that federal law governs. Kentucky's prohibition of arbitration between insolvent insurance companies and third-party contractors does not trump the mandate of the Federal Arbitration Act that valid arbitration agreements must be upheld. For the following reasons, the Liquidator's Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Kentucky Health Cooperative (KYHC) sought approval from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer health plans to Kentucky citizens in 2011 and 2012. During this time, KYHC contracted with Milliman, Inc., whereby Milliman would provide actuarial services to KYHC. [R. 6 at 2.] Through this Consulting Services Agreement (CSA), Milliman agreed to provide consulting services to KYHC. [R. 1-2; R. 1-3.] The CSA included a section where parties agreed to arbitrate claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the CSA. [R. 1-2 at 1; R. 1-3 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Similarly, KYHC contracted with CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., for CGI to perform administrative services [\n   <em>\n    CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc. v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-0037-GFVT, R. 71-1], and around the same time, KYHC contracted with Beam Partners, LLC, for Beam Partners to provide management and support services to KYHC [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 4-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   KYHC issued its initial health plan policy on January 1, 2014, but by late 2015, KYHC was insolvent and placed into rehabilitation by Franklin Circuit Court in Franklin County, Kentucky. [R. 6 at 2.] Pursuant to KRS \u00a7 304.33-010,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , Franklin Circuit Court placed KYHC into liquidation on January 15, 2016, and appointed H. Brian Maynard, Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, as the Liquidator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jeff Gaither and David Hurt were appointed as Special Deputy Liquidators. Pursuant to the Liquidation Order,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   The Liquidator and the Special Deputy Liquidators are hereby authorized to deal with the property, business, and affairs of KYHC and KYHC's estate, and in any necessary forum, to sue or defend for KYHC, or for the benefit of KYHC's policyholders, creditors, or shareholders in the courts and tribunal, agencies or arbitration panels of this states and other states, or in any applicable federal court in the Liquidator's name as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, in his capacity as Liquidator, or a Special deputy in his capacity as Special Deputy Liquidator, or in the name of KYHC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [R. 6-1 at 9.] Since that time, Nancy G. Atkins has replaced H. Brian Maynard as Commissioner of the Kentucky Department\n   of Insurance, and thus also as the Liquidator. See KRS \u00a7 304.33-200. Donald Roof was also appointed as a Deputy Litigator for KYHC on August 14, 2017. [R. 1 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 13, 2016, the Liquidator sued CGI in Franklin Circuit Court for breach of contract and negligence. [\n   <em>\n    CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc. v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-0037-GFVT, R. 71-1 at 2.] The Liquidator refused to honor the arbitration clause, so CGI removed that claim to this Court and filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These actions were consolidated in this Court. [\n   <em>\n    CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc. v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-0037-GFVT, R. 8.] Six months later, the Liquidator sued Beam Partners and Terry Shilling, along with Janie Miller,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joseph E. Smith,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Officers and Board of Directors of KYHC, and CGI for similar breach of contract and tort claims. [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 4-4.] The Liquidator again refused to arbitrate, and CGI removed that action to this Court. [\n   <em>\n    Jeff Gaither, Deputy Liquidator of Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. v. Beam Partners, LLC, et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-00094-GFVT, R. 1.] Beam Partners then filed a Petition to Compel Arbitration. [\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-cv-00004-GFVT; R. 1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over a year after filing suit against CGI, the Litigator amended the complaint to include actions against Milliman, Inc. [R. 6-2.] Milliman petitioned this Court for arbitration in March, and the Liquidator filed a motion to dismiss, raising many of the same issues raised in\n   <em>\n    CGI Techs. &amp; Sols., Inc. v. Atkins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC v. Atkins.\n   </em>\n   [R. 6.] In September, this Court filed contemporaneous Orders in\n   <em>\n    CGI\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners\n   </em>\n   denying the Liquidator's Motions for Summary Judgment and granting CGI's and Beam Partners' Motions to Compel Arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As an initial matter, the Liquidator challenges this Court's ability to hear this action by claiming the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine bars jurisdiction. [R. 6 at 5.] The doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction states, \"If two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, so that the court must have possession or some control over the property in order to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must yield to that of the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Cartwright v. Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070092\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/752/#p761\">\n    751 F.3d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (6th Cir. 2014.) This Court must assess \"whether the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction applies at the time of filing, and not any time thereafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevalier v. Estate of Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346283\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/789/#p803\">\n    803 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (6th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    In rem\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the status of a thing, and therefore the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). Conversely,\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction involves or determines \"the personal rights and obligations of the parties\" and is \"brought against a person rather than a property.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014). \"A normal action brought by one person against another for breach of contract is a common example of an action\n   <em>\n    in personam.\n   </em>\n   \" R.H. Graveson, Conflict of Laws, 98 (7th ed. 1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If the Liquidator is successful in its tort claims against Milliman, the Liquidator will likely be able to collect monetary damages from Milliman, thus increasing the\n   amount of assets that can be distributed among its creditors. However, the Liquidator has not provided sufficient case law to convince the Court that this results in an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action governed by the prior exclusive jurisdiction doctrine. The cases cited by the Liquidator involve creditors suing the insolvent company, whereas in the tort action here, the insolvent company is the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gillis v. Keystone Mut. Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182480\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/172/826/\">\n    172 F.2d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 1949) ;\n   <em>\n    Blackhawk Heating &amp; Plumbing Co. Inc. v. Geeslin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621272\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/530/154/\">\n    530 F.2d 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1976). By the Liquidator's logic, all suits brought by an insolvent company would need to be heard by the court of liquidation simply because those suits could increase assets available for distribution during liquidation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court is not convinced. This is a petition to compel arbitration for a tort claim involving a breach of contract. A favorable result in this matter does not affect the distribution of the liquidated assets held in Franklin Circuit Court. Nor does the Court need to have jurisdiction over the assets to resolve this matter. Thus, the Court finds that the doctrine of prior exclusive jurisdiction does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Liquidator also challenges the Court's power to hear this matter, claiming that Milliman has not complied with Kentucky's requirements for pursuing arbitration, and this Court cannot grant or deny relief without Milliman fully complying with Kentucky's arbitration requirements. [R. 6 at 10.] Under the IRLL, no party may institute an action against the liquidator without approval of the court. KRS \u00a7 304.33-270(1). However, the Federal Arbitration Act does not require parties to comply with state requirements before seeking a petition from federal court for arbitration. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring Milliman to comply with the IRLL before petitioning this Court assumes that the IRLL reverse preempts the Federal Arbitration Act in this case. As explained next, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Liquidator continues to argue that the IRLL reverse preempts the Federal Arbitration Act through the McCarran-Ferguson Act. [R. 6 at 16.] The Court has previously decided that it does not, however, the Court restates its analysis here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beam Partners, LLC, v.

The parties agree, under the FAA, this is a valid arbitration agreement. First, the contract itself is valid.

Neither party asserts that the CSA lacks one of these elements. In order to show validity of an arbitration agreement, Kentucky law provides for a burden-shifting framework: the party seeking arbitration satisfies its prima facie burden by simply providing a copy of the written and signed arbitration agreement, then the burden shifts to the opposing party to show a lack of an agreement.\n    <em>\n     MHC Kenworth-Knoxville/Nashville v.

Here, the arbitration clause is broad: \"any dispute arising out of or relating to the engagement of Milliman ... will be resolved by final and binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\" [R. 1-2 at 1; R. 1-3 at 2.] Thus, absent an express provision in the agreement excluding a specific dispute, and absent \"forceful evidence\" that the parties intended to exclude a specific dispute, the dispute is governed by the arbitration clause.\n    <em>\n     Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v.

The underlying dispute is a claim by the Liquidator that Milliman breached the CSA, a dispute that clearly relates to the CSA. Further, no language in the agreement and no evidence provided by the parties display an intent to exclude breach of contract claims from the arbitration requirement. Accordingly, the Court finds that the dispute falls within the substantive scope of the CSA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Javitch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20F.3d%20619\">\n     315 F.3d at 624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     2\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Despite its validity under the FAA, New York contract law, and Kentucky contract law, the Liquidator contests the validity of the arbitration agreement as inconsistent with the Kentucky IRLL. The purpose of the IRLL is stated as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n    (4) Purpose. The purpose of this subtitle is the protection of the interests of insureds, creditors, and the public generally, with minimum interference with the normal prerogative of proprietors, through:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    (a) Early detection of any potentially dangerous condition in an insurer, and prompt application of appropriate corrective measures, neither unduly harsh nor subject to the kind of publicity that would needlessly damage or destroy the insurer;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    (b) Improved methods for rehabilitating insurers, by enlisting the advice and management expertise of the insurance industry;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n    (c) Enhanced efficiency and economy of liquidation, through the consolidation of matters relating to the liquidation under the supervision of a single court so as to avoid divergent rulings by a multiplicity of judicial tribunals and through clarification and specification of the law, to minimize legal uncertainty and litigation;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    (d) Equitable apportionment of unavoidable loss;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    (e) Lessening the problems of interstate rehabilitation and liquidation by facilitating cooperation between states in the liquidation process, and by extension of the scope of personal jurisdiction over debtors of the insurer outside this state;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    (f) Regulation of the insurance business by the impact of the law relating to delinquency procedures and substantive rules on the entire insurance business; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    (g) Provision for a comprehensive scheme for the supervision, rehabilitation, and liquidation of insurance companies and those subject to this subtitle as part of the regulation of the business of insurance, insurance industry, and insurers in this state. Proceedings in cases of insurer insolvency and delinquency shall be deemed an integral aspect of the business of insurance and are of vital public interest and concern.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    KRS \u00a7 304.33-010(4). The IRLL grants exclusive jurisdiction to Franklin Circuit Court \"to entertain, hear, or determine all matters in any way relating to any delinquency proceeding under this subtitle, including but not limited to all disputes involving purported assets of the insurer.\" KRS \u00a7 304.33-040(3)(a). Once a delinquency proceeding has been initiated, the provisions of the IRLL \"shall govern those proceedings, and all conflicting contractual provisions contained in any contract between the insurer which is subject to the delinquency proceeding and any third party shall be deemed subordinated to the provisions of this subtitle.\" KRS \u00a7 304.33-010(6). The Liquidator argues, therefore, that the breach of contract claim, which is subject to the arbitration agreement in the CSA, must be submitted to the Franklin Circuit Court as part of the ongoing delinquency proceedings, and this Court should not compel arbitration.

The Liquidator points to\n    <em>\n     Preferred Care of Delaware, Inc.\n    </em>\n    to show that this case, albeit concerning arbitration, is parallel to\n    <em>\n     Gaither v. Beam.\n    </em>\n    [R. 6 at 25.] While the subject of arbitration does not foreclose abstention under\n    <em>\n     Colorado River\n    </em>\n    , the parallel cases of\n    <em>\n     Preferred Care of Delaware\n    </em>\n    both turned on the same legal question: whether, under the alternative dispute resolution agreement, VanArsdale had to arbitrate his claims against Preferred Care.\n    <em>\n     Preferred Care\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12392978\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/676/388/#p393\">\n     676 F.

This finding, however, does not end the analysis. When actions are parallel, the Court must then balance eight separate factors\n    to determine whether abstention would be appropriate:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    (1) whether the state court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property; (2) whether the federal forum is less convenient to the parties; (3) avoidance of piecemeal litigation; ... (4) the order in which jurisdiction was obtained ... (5) whether the source of governing law is state or federal ... (6) the adequacy of the state court action to protect the federal plaintiff's rights ... (7) the relative progress of the state and federal proceedings ... and (8) the presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction....\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Romine\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11669459\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/337/#p339\">\n     160 F.3d at 340-41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These factors are not a checklist, but rather considerations for the Court when using its discretion to abstain in a matter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    First, this action does not involve res or property. The res involved in the liquidation proceedings in Franklin Circuit Court are not at issue in this case. Additionally, the federal forum is located less than a quarter of a mile from the state forum, providing no more or less convenience to the parties. Furthermore, the state court action would not adequately protect Milliman's rights, given that Kentucky precedent is dictated by\n    <em>\n     Ernst &amp; Young\n    </em>\n    , which allows for reverse preemption of the FAA and denial of Milliman's petition for arbitration. Thus, the first, second, and sixth factors squarely oppose abstention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Factors three, four, and seven relate to the parallel proceeding in state court. Here, there is no danger of piecemeal litigation. While similar, the contracts involved in\n    <em>\n     Gaither v. Beam\n    </em>\n    are all different, and all include different provisions and protections. Resolving the contract dispute between the Liquidator and Milliman does not impact the resolution of other disputes and brings no danger of disparate judgments. Again, arbitration in this matter does not affect the liquidation proceedings and the policy holders. Thus, because there is no danger of piecemeal litigation, the third factor does not encourage abstention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    While Franklin Circuit Court first obtained jurisdiction, the primary focus of the litigation in the parallel proceeding has concerned the liability of Janie Miller and Joseph Smith, neither of which are a party to this matter in federal court. [R. 14 at 40-41.] This Court has spent the last two years hearing oral arguments and conducting briefing on this specific arbitration issue,\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    while the parties indicate that the Franklin Circuit Court has not yet considered it. So, while factor four favors abstention, the time spent debating this issue in federal court far exceeds the time devoted to this issue in state court, and factor seven strongly weighs against abstention. Factors five and eight relate to the jurisdiction and choices of law in both forums. Both forums have concurrent jurisdiction, and both courts could rule on the enforceability of arbitration. The issues relating to contract law and the IRLL are matters of Kentucky law, while the questions involving the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the FAA are matters of federal law. The Franklin Circuit Court could certainly rule on this issue, but so can this Court. Such factors do not clearly support abstention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Without the \"clearest of justifications\" that abstention is proper, the Court has a duty to exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by Congress.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <em>\n     RSM Richter, Inc. v.

After weighing all eight factors, only factor four suggests abstention is appropriate, while several other factors strongly oppose abstention. Accordingly, the Court finds that the narrow exception to jurisdiction provided by\n    <em>\n     Colorado River\n    </em>\n    abstention does not apply to this matter.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    This court has \"no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp that which is not given.\"\n    <em>\n     Cohens v.
