BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") action arises out of Smith's allegations that he did not receive overtime compensation while employed as a non-exempt transplant (or organ procurement) coordinator for Ochsner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The job description for a transplant coordinator at Ochsner included the following duties and responsibilities: responding to all calls for organs offered to the Ochsner Transplant Center; evaluating the medical management of the donor; verifying consent; communicating with physicians and surgeons to obtain acceptance of an organ; preserving the organ; arranging transplantation; transporting organs; and completing all associated reports.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties essentially agree that transplant coordinators at Ochsner rotated among four categories of duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Donor Coordinator\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The first category of duties was that of \"donor coordinator.\" In this capacity, the transplant coordinator would receive communications from the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency (\"LOPA\") regarding organs potentially available for transplant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The donor coordinator would then access the donor's information on a database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On occasion, when acting as donor coordinator, Smith would identify a mistake in the database or a need for additional information, and he would contact the donor's hospital to obtain the correct information to provide to the transplant surgeon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   After gathering this information, the donor coordinator could either decline the organ or, if the organ satisfied Ochsner's criteria (which is regulated by UNOS), enter a \"provisional yes\" before contacting the surgeon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"provisional yes\" indicated Ochsner was interested in the organ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To comply with UNOS regulations, Ochsner's established procedure required the donor coordinator\n   to contact the surgeon on call and relay certain standard information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Smith testified to having rejected an organ without first contacting a surgeon if, in his experience and as dictated by the UNOS regulations, he knew the surgeon would not accept it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, no coordinator's decision was final; all decisions were reviewed by the surgeon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. George Loss, a transplant surgeon at Ochsner who worked with Smith, testified that \"it takes two to say yes ... and three to say no\" to an organ, a rule of thumb that both parties agree constitutes Ochsner's policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, according to Dr. Loss, to accept an organ, the recovery coordinator and the surgeon may say \"yes\"; but to reject an organ, the recovery coordinator and two surgeons must say \"no.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith admits that he advocated for very sick Ochsner patients to receive organs ahead of patients at other transplant centers, as directed by his supervisors and as permitted under UNOS protocol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although LOPA could provide the matching program's results directly to the surgeon, Ochsner handled \"this aspect in-house\" by employing coordinators such as Smith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith testified that, as donor coordinator, he communicated to the surgeon basic information generated by LOPA's matching program, such as the potential recipient's status on the list and the recipient's height and weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On occasion, a donor coordinator would discuss with Dr. Loss, as transplant surgeon, the decision whether to accept the organ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Loss testified that the organ procurement coordinators were \"absolutely critical\" to Ochsner's success as a transplant center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Loss compared his interaction with the donor coordinator to that with a resident about a patient in the ICU: \"They don't tell me everything that's going on with that patient ...; they tell me the things I need to know. And they know the things I need to know because we work together and we know what's important. But then there are certain parts that I ask more information, and they have to know where to get it or how to get it. And if they don't, they ask me, and I tell them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Smith, the surgeons \"depended upon us to be correct. They trusted that the information we gave them would be correct to make a decision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once an organ was accepted, the donor coordinator would arrange for the transportation of the organs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the organ procurement coordinators would not enter into transportation contracts on behalf\n   of Ochsner, they would arrange transportation with companies under contract with Ochsner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   In one instance, Ochsner implemented Smith's suggestion to purchase flight hours, rather than renting planes, as a means of managing transportation costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Fly Out Coordinator\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The second category of duties for transplant coordinators was that of \"fly out\" coordinator. A fly out coordinator traveled with the medical team to assist in recovering the organ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   The fly out coordinator would contact the operating room where the organ was to be recovered, and then the fly out coordinator would apprise the surgeon and Ochsner's operating room of the organ's history and condition (such as the timeline of surgery, biopsy results, size, and viability problems, including whether there had been unexpected occurrences potentially affecting the organ like no heartbeat or no blood pressure).\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   To transport particular organs, Smith helped to create checklists of supplies and then stocked them based upon the surgeon's directives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Smith insists that his supervisors would authorize supply orders costing more than $10,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      Administrative and Backup Coordinator\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The third category of a transplant coordinator's duties was that of administrative coordinator. An administrative coordinator was responsible for completing the paperwork related to the organ and Ochsner's patients.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, after Ochsner's committee confirmed that a patient needed an organ transplant, the coordinator would input the patient's information into a database to be matched to a donor by the computerized system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The fourth and final category of an organ procurement coordinator's duties was that of backup coordinator. In this capacity, an organ procurement coordinator would assist with lab work and donors as needed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      The Rotating Duties in General\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   Under the supervision of a surgeon, the transplant coordinators working at Ochsner during Smith's employment conferred with each other to establish their schedule of rotating duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Generally, the hours were Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., though the coordinators were permitted to arrive later the next day following a late-night shift.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith and Kyle Leboeuf, who was also an organ procurement coordinator at Ochsner, testified that they would be on call for four days at a time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ochsner submits Leboeuf's testimony for the proposition that the organ procurement coordinators spent the majority of their time on donor coordinator duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith disputes this, citing Ochsner's Job Performance Standards that designate\n   duties by weight.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   These standards designate (1) fifteen percent weight to responding to calls for organ offers (including being on call \"24 hours a day, 365 days/year\"); (2) thirty percent weight to receiving and transporting organs for transplant preservation (including verifying legal aspects of the donor's consent and medical chart); (3) ten percent weight to having supplies and equipment on hand for cold storage preservation of organs; (4) ten percent weight to sending blood and tissue typing samples to the lab for cross-matching purposes; (5) ten percent weight to exchanges of donor/recipient information; (6) ten percent weight to preserving organs from living donor transplants; and (7) fifteen percent weight to assignment and documentation of costs and charges of the Ochsner Transplant Center's \"organ procurement activities (i.e., procurement cost sheets, patient standard acquisition billing, professional fees, etc.).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agree that Smith contacted and interviewed new employee applicants, but Smith insists that he had no authority to approve new hires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties agree that Ochsner hired Smith in April of 2001, but they disagree about the structure of his pay during the period from 2001 to 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Smith contends that he reported hours worked and received only straight time pay for all hours worked, Ochsner maintains that Smith was paid a yearly salary, plus a nominal hourly fee for on-call time and an additional straight hourly rate for work conducted outside of his normal shifts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the parties agree that, from 2012 through his resignation in 2017, Ochsner paid Smith an annual salary and a single bonus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the parties agree that, as of September 29, 2014 (three years prior to the filing of the complaint), Smith's annual salary was $121,971.20 (a weekly salary of $2,345.60) and that Smith would have been paid over $100,000 in 2017 had he not taken medical leave that year, as his weekly salary remained $2,345.60 until his resignation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

These functional duties entailed aspects of quality control and legal and regulatory compliance not unlike the employees in\n   <em>\n    Zannikos\n   </em>\n   who ensured the quality and regulatory compliance of oil transfers.

After all, it is Ochsner (not just Smith) that is the regulated entity, and Ochsner depended upon Smith to administer its program of organ procurement and transplant to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements imposed on Ochsner. While Smith's job title as \"organ procurement coordinator\" is not determinative, it is accurately descriptive, in that Smith's job involves the procurement of organs - a primary duty related to Ochsner's business operation of providing transplant medical services. Moreover, though perhaps not his primary duty, it is undisputed that Smith performed other administrative duties such as ordering supplies that could cost Ochsner $10,000 or more, arranging for the transportation of the donated organs, and interviewing candidates for positions in Ochsner's transplant department. In sum, even viewing the uncontested facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, the Court concludes, like the court in\n   <em>\n    Zannikos\n   </em>\n   , that Smith's work as a transplant coordinator was office or non-manual and directly related to the management or general business operations of Ochsner in the functional areas of quality control, procurement, and legal and regulatory compliance. Hence, the second element of the administrative exemption is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Third Element: Whose Primary Duty Includes the Exercise of Discretion and Independent Judgment with Respect to Matters of Significance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court now turns to the third element of the administrative exemption to ask whether Smith exercised discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. The regulations explain that exercising discretion and independent judgment generally \"involves the comparison and evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered. The term 'matters of significance' refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed\" and not solely the magnitude of the employer's potential financial loss if the employee fails to perform the job properly.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) &amp; (f).

Smith thus contends that in performing his job he merely applied Ochsner's established procedures and criteria, as strictly prescribed by UNOS, under the direction of the transplant surgeon. Smith says he was a \"conduit\" of information and had no discretion to withhold information. Even if he declined an organ before contacting the surgeon, Smith posits that the surgeon would have subsequently declined it anyway. In Smith's view, the surgeons and Ochsner's organ committees, not the transplant coordinators, exercised the discretion and independent judgment in matters related to organ procurement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Smith further contends that none of his regular or customary duties fit beyond dispute in the duties illustrative of discretion and independent judgment listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), while courts typically require at least two to three. Smith denies that the transplant coordinators exercised the primary duty of managing schedules or ordering supplies. Smith also disputes whether he had authority to commit Ochsner in matters having significant financial impact, because, though Smith could arrange for transportation and order supplies costing up to $10,000, such arrangements and orders were pre-authorized by Ochsner and relatively small in comparison to the company's overall size.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Smith's role as transplant coordinator involves him in discretionary decision-making requiring independent judgment, as part of a team at Ochsner. There is no doubt that decisions and judgments about organ donations are critical, and participation on a team does not necessarily undercut the significance of Smith's own role in such decision-making. Nevertheless, on this summary judgment record, the Court finds that genuine disputes of material fact exist relating to Smith's exercise of discretion and independent judgment. While the evidence supports Smith's adherence to \"closely prescribed limits\" that would not qualify him as exempt, the evidence also supports Smith's involvement in discretionary decision-making.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 541.704. \"This is evidence that must be weighed by a jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Dewan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276356\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/331/#p336\">\n    858 F.3d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The terms \"duties\" and \"responsibilities\" are not defined by the regulation. Many courts have found that the exemption applies when the employee meets either the second or third element of the administrative exemption.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ogden v. CDI Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%204508502\">\n    2009 WL 4508502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 n.2 (noting employer \"need not prove [the employee] exercised discretion or independent judgment in the performance of his duties,\" but requiring proof that his duty is the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of his employer);\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

Cal. 2015) (\"At least one regularly performed duty or task must fall squarely within ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   one of the 'duties' prong of the administrative exemption.\"). But these courts, in a pre-\n   <em>\n    Encino\n   </em>\n   world, applied the exemptions narrowly against the employer, looked only to the elements of the administrative exemption, and ignored the regulation's directive to forego a rigorous analysis of the employee's job duties in light of the employee's high compensation. A \"fair reading\" of the phrase \"any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities ... of an administrative employee,\" though, cannot mean that the employer must prove one of the administrative exemption elements as they are analyzed for purposes of that exemption. If that were so, the highly compensated employee regulation would have explicitly referred to the elements, not the \"duties or responsibilities,\" of the administrative employee. Instead, a \"fair reading\" of the phrase \"any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of ... an administrative employee\" would encompass work in the functional areas listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.201\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), including \"quality control; purchasing; procurement; ... legal and regulatory compliance; and similar activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In discussing the administrative exemption in Section III(c)(i) above, the Court concluded that Smith's primary duty involved the performance of non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of Ochsner. This conclusion necessarily satisfies the remaining element of the exemption for highly compensated employees. But Ochsner is not required to go even this far to prevail on the highly compensated employee exemption; instead, just one of the purportedly exempt employee's \"duties or responsibilities\" need be of an administrative character related to Ochsner's management or general business operations and customarily and regularly performed by the employee, and it need not be his primary duty. This relaxed standard applies because most of the water for the exemption is carried by the employee's high level of compensation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. Mercedes-Benz U.S. Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201566140\">\n    2012 WL 1566140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.D.

The Court concludes that at least one of Smith's duties and responsibilities as an organ procurement coordinator involved legal or regulatory compliance (for example, in provisionally accepting or declining organ offers), quality control (for example, in regard to the donated organs or Ochsner's organ transplant program), procurement (of organs pursuant to Ochsner's transplant program), or purchasing (for example, ordering and stocking supplies required by Ochsner's surgeons and by the regulation governing organ donations and transplants) that was thus administrative in nature, was customarily and regularly performed by Smith, and thereby satisfies the final element to qualify Smith as a highly compensated employee exempt from FLSA's overtime requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having found that Ochsner is entitled to summary judgment on the highly compensated employee exemption, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties' arguments on the applicable statute of limitations and standard for assessing damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
