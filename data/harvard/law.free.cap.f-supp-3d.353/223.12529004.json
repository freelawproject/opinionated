Kelsey (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action on February 1, 2018, alleging that defendant law firm Forster &amp; Garbus, LLP (\"Defendant\") sought to collect a debt from Plaintiff in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FDCPA\"). (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff claims that Defendant filed an attorney affirmation in an underlying state court action commenced against him that falsely asserted that he had failed to answer the summons and complaint or otherwise appear in that action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings. (Dkt. 6). For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is granted, and Plaintiff's Complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiff's Complaint unless otherwise indicated and are assumed true for purposes of this motion. (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff alleges that on March 24, 2017, Defendant filed a lawsuit on behalf of Navient Credit Finance Corporation (\"Navient\") against Plaintiff in New York State Supreme Court, County of Orleans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10). Defendant served Plaintiff with a summons and complaint on May 22, 2017, and Plaintiff filed his answer \"with the court and mailed the same to [Navient].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). However, on August 15, 2017, Defendant filed an attorney affirmation with the state court, affirming that the time for Plaintiff \"to appear or answer has expired\" and that Plaintiff has \"not appeared or answered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As a result, Defendant \"obtained a default judgment against Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about November 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed an order to show cause with the state court to vacate the default judgment rendered against him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 6-4 at 14-17 (state court filings) ). On or about November 17, 2017, a state court judge set a return date on the motion for December 15, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). By attorney affirmation, dated December 11, 2017, Defendant consented to the vacatur of the default judgment and agreed to accept the answer filed with the state court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19). The default judgment has since been vacated. (Dkt. 8 at 3 (Plaintiff's response papers) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 1, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this action against Defendant alleging that the attorney affirmation filed in state court falsely represented that Plaintiff failed to answer the summons and complaint\n   and had not otherwise appeared in the state action. (Dkt. at 3-4). Plaintiff alleges that he \"both appeared and answered by filing the answer with the court and serving it on [Navient].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21). Plaintiff claims that by filing this false affirmation in state court, Defendant violated \u00a7 1692e of the FDCPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 15, 2018, Defendant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking dismissal of this action. (Dkt. 6). Defendant argues that Plaintiff did not comply with state court procedures in answering the summons and complaint, and thus, Plaintiff failed to properly appear in the state action. (Dkt. 6-1 at 3-4). Defendant also contends that Plaintiff's attempts to serve his answer did not constitute an \"informal appearance\" in that action, and even if they did, Defendant's affirmation was \"technically accurate\" because Plaintiff \"did not appear in the [state court] action as contemplated under CPLR 320(a).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6).
