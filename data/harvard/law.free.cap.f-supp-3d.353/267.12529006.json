Both parties have moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, Cardoza's motion for a remand is granted and the Commissioner's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cardoza applied for Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\") and Supplemental Security Income (\"SSI\") on October 8, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Administrative Record, filed Mar. 8, 2018 (Docket # 11) (\"R.\"), at 26, 78, 85, 155. He alleged that his disability began on August 1, 2013, when he was 40 years old. R. 26, 264.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied the applications and Cardoza sought review by an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). R. 115-16. The ALJ held an initial hearing on December 15, 2015, R. 78-84, and an additional hearing on May 10, 2016, R. 48-74. In a written decision dated October 4, 2016, the ALJ found Cardoza not disabled within the meaning of the Act. R. 26-40. On August 28, 2017, the Appeals Council denied Cardoza's request for review of the ALJ's decision, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Commissioner. R. 1-5. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Hearings Before the ALJ\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cardoza was represented by attorney Lawrence Mabes at his hearings. R. 48, 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the ALJ had not received certain records from Dr. Alan Ng, Lincoln Medical Center, and Clay Avenue Health Center prior to the initial hearing, the initial hearing was limited to a cursory inquiry into the different facilities where Cardoza received treatment through 2014. R. 79-82. At the second hearing, Cardoza testified to experiencing physical pain and mental health issues. R. 61-67. He testified to being unable to stand for more than an hour and noted that his pinched nerve forces him to sit most of the time, and that he is unable to walk more than a block and a half before he needs to stop and rest. R. 63. In order to walk at all, he uses a cane. R. 63. Because of the pinched nerve, Cardoza also cannot sit for more than \"45 minutes to an hour\" before he has to stand again. R. 63. Likewise, he cannot lie down for more than an hour because he experiences discomfort in his left leg and back. R. 64. He cannot bend over without experiencing pain in his back and left leg, and thus he does not usually tie his shoes without help. R. 64. He did testify that he is able to tie his shoes \"[i]f I have to do it,\" but that he can only do so \"little by little\" and \"would be in pain if I have to bend down.\" R. 64. Cardoza requires assistance from his daughters and wife to help with cooking, cleaning, shopping, and other home chores. R. 65. Cardoza relies on a medical taxi, paid for by Medicaid, to get to and from his medical appointments. R. 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cardoza sees a psychiatrist due to various symptoms, consisting of not wanting to talk to his wife, crying spells, and anxiety with related chest tightness. R. 66. He attributes the anxiety to feeling \"that everything is coming down on me,\" and explained, for example, that if he receives a bill in the mail, he becomes anxious and \"can't function\" because he fixates on the bill for up to three weeks at a time. R. 66. Cardoza takes medication as prescribed, and he testified that it \"[l]ately\" has helped \"a little\" but also that it \"doesn't really help very much.\" R. 66. The side effects of his medication include nervousness, fatigue, and tiredness. R. 66-67. At some point prior to his onset date, he was employed cleaning kitchens in restaurants and performing housekeeping at a hotel. R. 61;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Chaim Eliav, a medical doctor certified by the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, R. 608, testified that the record supported a diagnosis of a degenerative tear of the medial meniscus in Cardoza's knee. R. 50-51. He also reported that there was suggestion of injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in the knee as well as a bulging disc and a herniated disc in his back. R. 50-51. He identified the existence of other conditions in the spine, tenderness in both heels, and the fact that Cardoza was obese. R. 51-52. Dr. Eliav found that although there was diminished reflex capacity in the left knee, which would lead to difficulty lifting items over 10 pounds, Cardoza was able to \"ambulate even without an assistance device.\" R. 53-54. Dr. Eliav noted that Cardoza \"would not be able to stand for more than two hours in a day,\" R. 54-55, and that he would need to \"take a break from standing every half hour for five minutes,\" R. 55. Further, he could sit for only six hours total during the day, and would need to take an hourly break. R. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Jennifer Blitz, a clinical psychologist, R. 609, testified that the record showed a diagnosis for Cardoza of \"generalized anxiety disorder,\" an \"unspecified depressive disorder,\" and \"polysubstance dependance,\" which was in remission. R. 58. Though she found \"insufficient documented symptoms of depression to support a diagnosis of major depressive disorder,\" she noted that Cardoza's \"two severe mental impairments... do impose some mental\n   functional limitations on [him],\" which were not being able to interact with the public, experiencing anxiety in crowds and around people, paranoia, and being limited to doing \"simple, routine tasks.\" R. 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Amy Leopold, identified as a \"vocational expert\" (\"VE\"), testified that a hypothetical individual with physical and mental limitations and restrictions identified by the ALJ would be able to perform several unskilled and sedentary nationally-available jobs. R. 67-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Medical Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both Cardoza and the Commissioner have provided summaries of the medical evidence contained in the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 2-12; Def. Mem. at 2-15. While the Commissioner's summary is more detailed, Cardoza's summary is substantially consistent with it. The Court had directed the parties to specify any objections they had to the opposing party's summary of the record,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order, filed Mar. 9, 2018 (Docket # 12), \u00b6 5, and neither party has done so. Accordingly, the Court adopts Cardoza's and the Commissioner's summaries of the medical evidence as accurate and complete for purpose of the issues raised in this suit. We discuss the medical evidence pertinent to the adjudication of this case in Section III below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ denied Cardoza's application for DIB and SSI on October 4, 2016. R. 40. Following the five-step process set forth in SSA regulations, the ALJ found at step one that Cardoza had not engaged in \"substantial gainful activity since August 1, 2013, the alleged [disability] onset date.\" R. 28. At step two, the ALJ found that Cardoza had the following severe impairments: \"osteoarthritic changes of the left knee, lumbar herniated disc, obesity, plantar fasciitis, generalized anxiety disorder, and unspecified depressive disorder.\" R. 28. The ALJ also noted that Cardoza had non-severe impairments of hypertension, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea. R. 29. At step three, the ALJ concluded that none of Cardoza's severe impairments, singly or in combination, met or medically equaled an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 (the \"Listings\"). R. 29-30. The ALJ considered Listings 1.00, 11.00, and 12.00, as well as SSR 02-1p, in determining that Cardoza did not exhibit the necessary medical criteria. R. 29-30. The ALJ also considered the \"paragraph B\" criteria with respect to Cardoza's mental impairments. R. 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before moving to step four, the ALJ assessed Cardoza's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"). R. 30-38. The ALJ determined that Cardoza retained the RFC \"to perform sedentary work ... except when sitting, [Cardoza] must take a five minute break every hour in the vicinity of the work station, and when standing/walking [Cardoza] must take a five minute break every half hour in the vicinity of the work station.\" R. 30. In making this determination, the ALJ accorded varying weights to the opinions of Dr. Alan Ng, Dr. Michael Hossack, Dr. Lynne Portnoy, Dr. Johari Massey, Dr. P. Kennedy-Walsh, Dr. Chaim Eliav, and Dr. Jennifer Blitz. R. 31-37. Having determined Cardoza's RFC, the ALJ evaluated at step four whether Cardoza could continue his past work as a \"kitchen helper\" or \"cleaner\" and concluded that he could not. R. 38. At step five, the ALJ found that Cardoza's ability to perform \"all or substantially all of the requirements\" of a level of \"full range of sedentary work\" was \"impeded by additional limitations.\" R. 39. However, based on the testimony of the VE, the ALJ determined that Cardoza \"would be able to perform the requirements of representative\n   occupations,\" which exist in \"significant numbers in the national economy.\" R. 39-40. The ALJ thus determined that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) and 416.920(g) directed a finding of \"not disabled\" under the Act.

We discuss each argument next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Application of the \"Treating Source\" Rule\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In discussing the record and evaluating Cardoza's RFC, the ALJ assigned various weights to the opinions of different\n   physicians who opined on Cardoza's health over the years, including the medical experts who opined on Cardoza's medical records during the administrative hearing. In making her RFC determination, the ALJ gave \"[l]imited weight\" to the opinions of one of Cardoza's treating physicians, Dr. Ng. R. 32. Specifically, the ALJ gave limited weight to Dr. Ng's opinion that Cardoza was \"unable to work until further notice due to low[er] back pain.\" R. 32, 403. In giving limited weight to Dr. Ng's medical opinions, the ALJ found that Dr. Ng's opinion was not sufficiently specific, and that the determination as to whether Cardoza is disabled is \"a determination reserved to the Commissioner.\" R. 32. Cardoza contends that greater weight should have been given to the opinions of Dr. Ng, \"the rehabilitation specialist who treated [him] more often than any other physician in the record.\" Pl. Mem. at 16. He also argues that Dr. Ng's opinions \"were well supported by objective medical tests and clinical findings\" as well as other sources in the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. He claims that the ALJ's determination that Dr. Ng's statements were inconsistent with each other is contrary to the record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. After considering these arguments, we find no error in the ALJ's resolution of the conflicts among the medical opinions in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As previously discussed in Section II, a treating source's opinion, like that of Dr. Ng, is given controlling weight if the opinion is well supported by objective medical and clinical evidence in the record. If the opinion is inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record, the opinion need not be given controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green-Younger v.

To start with, the ALJ reasoned that Dr. Ng's opinions did not warrant controlling weight because several of his statements were inconsistent with each other. R. 33. For example, in August 2015, Dr. Ng noted that Cardoza could spend less than one hour in total standing or walking during an eight-hour work day, R. 447, and did not need to elevate his legs while sitting, R. 446. But in December 2015, Dr. Ng noted that Cardoza could spend two hours total standing or walking during the same period, R. 639, and would have to elevate his legs while sitting, R. 638. And on different occasions, Dr. Ng found that Cardoza's medical conditions existed since August 2013, R. 450 (August 2015 visit), and then since April 1998, R. 642 (December 2015 visit). He also found postural limitations in 2014, but did not identify any that were applicable in 2015. R. 448, 640. Despite finding Cardoza to be disabled, Dr. Ng also reported that Cardoza was \"able to perform chores without significant pain\" on his current dosage of medication. R. 768. He also noted on a different occasion that Cardoza was \"doing well on [his] current dosage.\" R. 809. The finding that Cardoza had his condition since 1998 was particularly open to attack since, as the ALJ noted, R. 33, Cardoza had history of performing heavy and medium work in the intervening period, R. 68-69, 283-86, 302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, there was other evidence in the record that contradicts Dr. Ng's opinions and statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 33. For example, Dr. Ng's notes suggest that Cardoza could sit 15 minutes or less continuously and then had to alternate his posture, R. 445, 637; spend less than one to two hours total sitting with the same restriction, R. 446, 638; and stand or walk continuously for less than 15 minutes before having to lie down or recline, R. 446, 638;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 16. But Dr. Eliav testified at the administrative hearing that Cardoza \"would be able to sit for a cumulative total of six hours in a day,\" albeit with an hourly five-minute break. R. 55;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   R. 89. The ALJ gave Dr. Eliav's opinion \"great weight,\" R. 35, which was a reasonable exercise of her discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

In another example, Dr. Ng opined that Cardoza's pain \"interfered with his ability to ambulate\" over his 34 examinations with Cardoza from November 2013 to December 2015. It was this pain that rendered him disabled, according to Dr. Ng.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 16; R. 732-848. But in July 2014, Dr. Gitkind of Montefiore Medical Center noted that Cardoza \"report[ed] excellent and almost complete relief of pain following his first [steroid injection for the pain] which lasted 5-6 days, followed by a return of pain, now back to baseline.\" R. 535. Dr. Gitkind noted that Cardoza \"was quite encouraged\" with the results of the medication and was eager to proceed with additional injections, which were so scheduled.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12124163\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/654/44/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Another physician noted only moderate limitation in Cardoza's range of motion, contradicting Dr. Ng's opinion that Cardoza was disabled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 399-401 (Dr. Portnoy's conclusion that Cardoza was only \"moderately limited from lifting, bending, repeated kneeling, climbing, stooping, and reaching\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Cardoza's testimony itself also appears to contradict Dr. Ng's opinion that Cardoza could not sit for one to two hours in a day. At the administrative hearing, Cardoza, in response to a question about his ability to stand, said \"I sit a lot. With the pinched nerve, I have to sit a lot. I can walk but not very much. I have to stand a lot.\" R. 63. Cardoza's testimony is consistent with the ALJ's conclusion that he could perform sedentary work,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 39-40, and is not consistent with Dr. Ng's opinion that Cardoza could only sit for one to two hours total during an eight-hour day. Certainly, as Cardoza notes, Dr. Ng \"examined Mr. Cardoza at least thirty-four times,\" Pl.

Certainly, there are indications that Cardoza had a diagnosis of asthma.

As part of an annual exam in August 2013, the Neighborhood and Family Health Center noted that Cardoza's asthma was \"stable\" and ordered a refill of his abuterol medication. R. 378. Dr. Portnoy found that the asthma was \"stable\" in December 2013. R. 401.

The ALJ considered Dr. Massey's views on Cardoza's ability to perform daily tasks of grooming and dressing and that he needed help cooking and cleaning. R. 36. Finally, the ALJ considered Dr. Massey's finding that Cardoza's ability to concentrate was \"mildly impaired,\" that Cardoza had a history of prior substance abuse, and that his \"abilities to learn new tasks and perform complex tasks were moderately to markedly impaired.\" R. 36;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 394. As the ALJ noted, R. 36, Dr. Massey found that \"[t]he results of the examination appear to be consistent with psychiatric problems,\n   <em>\n    but in itself does not appear significant enough to interfere with the claimant's ability to function on a daily basis\n   </em>\n   .\" R. 394 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition to the above, the ALJ considered other record evidence when considering the effect of Cardoza's psychiatric limitations on his RFC. This includes Dr. Kennedy-Walsh's opinion that Cardoza could \"understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions,\" R. 36 (citing R. 88); NY Psychotherapy and Counseling Center's September 2015 report that Cardoza was not receiving psychiatric therapy, but that he had done so in the past and that his current medication was helping, R. 36 (citing R. 618); and Dr. Blitz's testimony that Cardoza, due to his anxiety and depressive disorders, was \"limited to simple, routine tasks,\" R. 37, and that his ability to function in such a manner depended on \"compliance with his medication,\" R. 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Cardoza contends that the ALJ erred in affording Dr. Massey's opinion only \"some weight\" because the record corroborates Dr. Massey's opinions, and because the ALJ should have considered the importance of an in-person examination in the mental health context.

Although a sedentary job is defined as one that involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met. \"Occasionally\" means occurring from very little up to one-third of the time, and would generally total no more than about 2 hours of an 8-hour workday. Sitting would generally total about 6 hours of an 8-hour workday. Unskilled sedentary work also involves other activities, classified as \"nonexertional,\" such as capacities for seeing, manipulation, and understanding, remembering, and carrying out simple instructions....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Since most unskilled sedentary work requires only occasional lifting and carrying of light objects such as ledgers and files and a maximum lifting capacity for only 10 pounds, an individual who uses a medically required hand-held assistive device in one hand may still have the ability to perform the minimal lifting and carrying requirements of many sedentary unskilled occupations with the other hand. For example, an individual who must use a hand-held assistive device to aid in walking or standing because of an impairment that affects one lower extremity (e.g., an unstable knee) or to reduce pain when walking, who is limited to sedentary work because of the impairment affecting the lower extremity, and who has no other functional limitations or restrictions may still have the ability to make an adjustment to sedentary work that exists in significant numbers. On the other hand, the occupational base for an individual who must use such a device for balance because of significant involvement of both lower extremities (e.g., because of a neurological impairment) may be significantly eroded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   In these situations, too, it may be especially useful to consult a vocational resource in order to make a judgment regarding the individual's ability to make an adjustment to other work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20374185\">\n    1996 WL 374185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, *7 (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The problem here is that the ALJ did not consult a vocational resource to make a judgment as to how Cardoza's use of a cane would affect his ability to perform work.

The Commissioner does not explain why the omission of the cane from the hypothetical to the VE permits us to conclude that the hypothetical was an \"accurate[ ]\" reflection of Cardoza's limitations.

The VE here was never asked to opine on the availability of jobs for a person with Cardoza's RFC who uses a cane. Accordingly, we cannot be assured that the VE identified jobs that Cardoza would be able to do. On remand, the ALJ must present to the VE a hypothetical that includes the fact that Cardoza uses a cane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    The Vocational Expert's Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Cardoza briefly argues that \"[t]he ALJ [s]hould have found Mr. Cardoza disabled based on the VE's testimony.\" Pl.

We reject this argument. The fact that Cardoza was late to the hearing, experienced pain, and missed some appointments hardly required the ALJ to conclude that he would be late to or miss work on a regular basis. As for his testimony about fatigue, the ALJ could properly rely on Dr. Massey's opinion that Cardoza \"is able to ... maintain a regular schedule.\" R. 394;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Cardoza's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 13) is granted and the Commissioner's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Docket # 21) is denied.
