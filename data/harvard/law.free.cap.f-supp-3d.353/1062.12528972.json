Bastian, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is the United States' Motion to Partially Dismiss Case For Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction, ECF No. 10. A hearing on the motion was held on October 31, 2018, in Spokane, Washington. Plaintiff was represented by John M. Colvin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The United States was represented by Rika Valdman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are suing the United States to recover federal income tax they maintain was erroneously, illegally, or improperly assessed and collected from them for the taxable year 2012. They are seeking recovery of $859,557 plus interest that has accrued and continues to accrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs timely filed their 2012 federal income tax return that sought a refund of $1,364,363. They asked that they be refunded $500,000 and that the remainder ($864,363) be applied to the 2013 taxes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not pay the requested refund. Rather, on March 31, 2014, it informed Plaintiffs that it was holding the refund until it finished reviewing their tax returns and asked Plaintiffs to provide more information. ECF No. 12-2. On May 7, 2014, Plaintiffs sent a letter to the IRS, providing additional information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November, 2014, the IRS sent a letter disallowing some of the refund. ECF No. 10-1. Specifically, the IRS indicated it was allowing only $839,999 of the claim, and disallowing the remainder because \"we are unable able to verify the total amount of your withholding based on information provided by the Social Security Administration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The amount of the disallowed claim was $524,364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs replied by letter on December 5, 2014, indicating they were requesting a formal Appeal to the findings and also requesting an oral hearing. ECF No. 12-2. They also provided additional information regarding the requested refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nothing happened until May, 2016 when the IRS sent another letter, this time stating it was disallowing the entire $1,364,363 refund claim. ECF No. 10-1. Specifically, the letter stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   This letter is your notice that we've partially disallowed your claim for credit for the period shown above. We allowed only $.00 of the claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The letter also indicated that Plaintiffs were now going to owe interest and penalties. Although it did not explicitly say so in the letter, the determination of the $.00 allowance of the claim meant the IRS was also disallowing $839,999 of the refund claim that it has previously allowed as indicated in the November, 2014 letter. Because of this, Plaintiffs were now being assessed an outstanding liability of $859,557.84. As a result, the IRS took $335,871 from the 2014 refund and applied it to the 2012 tax liability since this amount had come from Plaintiffs' request to forward the remainder of the 2012 refund claim to the next year's tax bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its Motion, the United States argues that while Plaintiffs' suit is timely with respect to their claim for $355,871, it is untimely with respect to the remaining amount. It maintains the claim for refund of the amount of $523,686 was not filed within two years after the IRS disallowed Plaintiffs' refund claim, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206532\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' refund claim for $523,686, but has jurisdiction to hear the matter regarding Plaintiffs' refund claim for $355,871.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A jurisdictional challenge under Rule 12(b)(1) may be made either facial or factual.\n   <em>\n    Safe Air for Everyone v.

Second, the time limitation is purely procedural and has no substantive impact on the amount of recovery. It speaks only to a claim's timeliness and not to a court's power. Third, the recovery of a wrongfully withheld refund is akin to the traditional common law torts of conversion. Fourth, the deadline set forth in \u00a7 6532(a) is not cast in jurisdictional terms and the language/text used does not have any jurisdictional significance. Finally, the text does not define a federal court's jurisdiction over tort claims generally, does not address its authority to hear untimely suits, or in any way limit its usual equitable powers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The next question, then, is whether Plaintiffs' claim before this Court for $859,557, plus interest, is timely. The answer is yes. Even with assistance from counsel, it is very confusing to the Court when exactly Plaintiffs' refund claims for the 2012 tax return were decided, and what amounts were covered by the first and second letters. The record suggests that the first time Plaintiffs were aware that the $839,999 refund claim, which had been accepted by the IRS as of November, 2014, was being disallowed was from the May, 2016 letter. Even then, the IRS did not explicitly notify Plaintiffs that this was the case. Instead, the IRS simply indicated to Plaintiffs that their entire claim, which presumably was for $1,364,363.00, was being disallowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   When Plaintiffs received the letter in November, 2014, they were informed the IRS allowed $839,999.00 of their $1,364,363.00 refund. There would have been no reason to appeal this decision, except to appeal the decision to not allow the claim for $524,364, which Plaintiffs did. Fast forward to May, 2016, after being informed that their entire refund claim was being rejected, the amount of their refund claim being rejected for the 2012 tax return returned to the original amount of $1,364,363.00. By bringing suit in district court for only $839,999 plus interest charged, Plaintiffs are implicitly agreeing that the claim for $524,364 is time-barred. Because that amount was addressed by the November, 2014 letter, Plaintiffs had two years from the date of the letter to bring their claim to the district court for that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In May, 2016, however, Plaintiffs were informed implicitly that they no longer were going to be receiving the $839,999 refund. Instead, they now owed interests and penalties. And the letter informed them that they had two years from the date of the letter to appeal this decision. It is this decision-the disallowal of the $839,999 and interest and penalties-that is the underlying basis for Plaintiffs' claims before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The United States attempts to manufacture a limit regarding Plaintiffs' claim by arguing that the Court only has jurisdiction\n   over $335,871, which is the amount of the overpayment that had been credited to the 2014 taxable year but was taken away and credited to the 2012 tax liability. However, the only reason this amount was taken by the IRS, and not the $859,357 owed, was because there was an outstanding, yet unexplained credit of $523,686.45 on Plaintiff's account that apparently should not have been there. The United States' explanation is that the IRS did not immediately adjust the account transcript for the taxable year 2012 to reflect the disallowed refund amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But if it had timely made the adjustment and Plaintiffs had no credits, then presumably it would have taken more than $335,871 from the 2014 taxable year to pay the outstanding 2012 tax. If that credit was properly adjusted pursuant to the November 2014 letter, that is, the credit was subtracted from Plaintiff's account, the logical conclusion would be that the IRS would have taken $859,557 from later tax returns to make up the difference for the now disallowed claim plus the interest charged. Under the United States' theory, Plaintiffs would have two years from the date of the letter to appeal this decision to the district court. The fact that there happened to be a credit on the account that was similar to (although not the same amount as) the 2014 disallowed claim, should not limit Plaintiffs' ability to appeal the decision of the IRS to disallow the $839,999 claim as set forth in the November, 2016 letter. The amount of Plaintiffs' claim before this Court should not be artificially limited due to the IRS's own accounting delays or errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Notably, the United States acknowledges the credit of $523,686 does not accurately reflect the $524,364 credit that was disallowed by the November, 2014 letter. ECF No. 10 at 5. (\"Therefore, to the extent that Plaintiffs are seeking refund of any amount up to $524,364, including the $523,686 that is part of this refund suit, their claim is untimely and this Court has no subject matter jurisdiction over it.\"). There is no explanation in the record as to when, where, or why this amount appeared as a credit. Clearly, it does not match the disallowed refund claim of $524,364. This appears to be nothing more than an arbitrary number that the United States is now seeking to use to reduce Plaintiffs' claim before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As said before, Plaintiffs are not challenging the IRS's decision to disallow the refund of $524,364. Indeed, if they were, presumably in this lawsuit their requested relief would be $1,364,363, plus interest. And if that were the case, the Court would agree with the United States that Plaintiffs' claim for $524,364 would be untimely. But it is clear Plaintiffs are not bringing such a claim. Rather, they are challenging the IRS's decision to disallow $839,999 of the $1,364,363 refund claim-a decision to which they were notified of in May, 2016. Consequently, Plaintiffs' claim before the Court is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Alternatively, even if the time limits for the $839,999 portion of the refund claim started to accrue on November, 2014, equitable considerations set forth above, including the fact that Plaintiffs were informed that $839,999 of the requested refund claim was not going to be allowed less than 6 months before the statute of limitations expired, require the tolling of the statute of limitations. As such, the Court has jurisdiction to hear the entire\n   amount of Plaintiffs' refund claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206532\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1.
