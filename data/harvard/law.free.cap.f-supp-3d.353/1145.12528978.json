In the Notice of Appeal, Petitioner wrote: \"The Board of Education of Rio Rancho Independent Schools, pursuant to Rule 1-074 NMRA and Sections 22-2-14(I), 39-3-1.1 NMSA, hereby gives notice of its appeal of the New Mexico Public Education Department's Decision, initially issued on June 29, 2018, regarding Significant Disproportionality ... and finalized on September 18, 2018.\" The Notice of Appeal attached Respondent's final decision, which provided that its \"determination of Significant Disproportionality ... was issued in accordance with federal law.\"\n   <strong>\n    Doc. 1, Ex. 2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the Motion for Stay filed contemporaneously with the Notice of Appeal, Petitioner sought a stay or injunction of Respondent's decision requiring it to transfer 15% of the special education budget to early intervention programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Respondent removed this case to this Court on September 26, 2018.

Rather, Petitioner filed this appeal in state court pursuant to NMSA \u00a7\u00a7 22-2-14(I) and 39-3-1.1(D), challenging an administrative decision by the New Mexico Public Education Department. Petitioner asserts that Respondent's administrative decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was otherwise arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner argues that this appeal raises no substantial federal question. Because the issue appears primarily to be fact based, and the manner in reaching the significant disproportionality determination\n   is left to the discretion of the Respondent, the Court concludes that there is no substantial federal question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     New Mexico Law\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   This matter is before the Court pursuant to NMSA \u00a7\u00a7 22-2-14 and 39-3-1.1.

It therefore required Petitioner to reserve funds, i.e., move funds, from providing services for students with disability to a fund for early intervening services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The IDEA provides causes of action to individuals affected by certain state or local education agency decisions, challenging, for example, whether they received due process or procedural protections under \u00a7 1415. Section 1415 specifically provides that the federal district courts have jurisdiction to hear actions brought by individuals under that section. \u00a7 1415(i)(2),(3). The IDEA also provides a cause of action to the states, to file an action challenging adverse actions regarding funding, in the relevant United States Court of Appeal. \u00a7 1416(e)(8).

This case primarily involves a factual question, and the methodology for calculating \"substantial disproportionality\" is left to the states. Therefore, it appears that this matter will be judged under state law whether it was arbitrary and capricious, or supported by substantial evidence. The resolution of this case will not guide the resolution of other\n   cases outside New Mexico, because each state may use its own methodology in determining significant disproportionality.

Whether Respondent used the right data or exercised its discretion in a manner that is not arbitrary and capricious under state law, is not important to the federal system as a whole. The\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   opinion stressed that the \"substantiality\" element essentially means that the federal issues must affect more than the parties to the case, and will usually impact the operation of the federal system itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p262\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 1066-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted in\n   <strong>\n    Section II\n   </strong>\n   above, Congress created a number of causes of action under the IDEA. But Congress omitted any cause of action for a school board to challenge the decision of a state education department pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201418\">\n    20 USC \u00a7 1418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Respondent argues that a federal district court may exercise federal jurisdiction over a state administrative appeal.
