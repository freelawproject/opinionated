INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Commerce and Industry Insurance Company brought this subrogation action following the payment of insurance benefits to Phil and Fia Richmond, for a policy claim resulting from red dirt damage to the Richmonds' primary residence on Kauai. Plaintiff sues for negligence, trespass, and private nuisance, alleging that the Defendant construction companies\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   unreasonably and tortiously caused damage to the Kauai residence, and seeking\n   all damages proximately caused by Defendants. Before the Court are Defendant Unlimited's Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings and Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the Court concludes that Defendant's defense of consent precludes Plaintiff's trespass and nuisance claims, and Defendant's waiver and assumption of risk defenses preclude Plaintiff's negligence claim. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is therefore GRANTED, and the Court need not address Defendant's Motion for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are not in dispute. In 2007, Philip and Fia Richmond (\"the Richmonds\") purchased Lot 79 in the Kukui'ula residential development on Kauai, with plans to build a custom home for themselves and their son Palmer, who had special needs. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14; Plaintiff's First Supplemental Separate and Concise Statement of Facts (\"Pl.'s FSCSF\") at \u00b6 3. Plaintiff Commerce and Industry Insurance Company (\"CIIC\") provided homeowners insurance coverage to the Richmonds for the custom home, located at 2791 Uluwehi Street in Koloa (\"the Property\"). Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 14. The Richmonds purchased the Property on January 10, 2008, Doc. No. 140 at n.2, and were represented by attorney Anne Lopez in conjunction with the property conveyance. Defendant's Separate and Concise Statement of Facts (\"Def.'s CSF\") at \u00b6 7. The Richmonds acquired the Property via a Limited Warranty Deed (\"the Deed\"), which provided in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Lot is also subject to (in addition to the matters set forth above) each and every provision of that certain Community Charter for Kukui'ula, dated May 8, 2006, and recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances of the State of Hawaii (the \"Bureau\") as Document No. 2006-088739 ... which imposes upon the Lot and other real property, under a general plan of development, certain covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, servitudes and other provisions running with the land and binding title to the Lot and all owners of any portion thereof or interest therein, whether or not referenced in any future deed or instrument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Def.'s CSF at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8.

It is undisputed that the Richmonds received a copy of the Charter at the time of closing. Def.'s CSF, Ex. A at 140-142.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Richmonds moved into their completed home on May 16, 2013. Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 14. Starting in November 2014, the Richmonds began noticing heavy amounts of red dirt accumulating in their home. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6 9; Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 15. Plaintiff alleges that the Richmonds' housekeeper, who had been cleaning the home for eight to ten hours a week, then had to assist daily with cleaning the red dirt, and could not keep up with the dirt entering the home. Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 17-21. Fia Richmond (\"Fia\") testified that when using the pool at their residence, she had to brush red dirt off the seat to find a place to sit. Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 2 at 56. Plaintiff alleges that at this time, multiple construction projects were underway near the Property. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12-13. Defendant Unlimited was constructing bungalows directly west of the Property, while Defendant Kukui'ula Development Company (\"KDC\") was conducting landscaping work directly north of the Property, and Defendants Kainani Villas (\"Kainani\") and Kukui'ula Residential Development (\"KRD\") were constructing a new resort community northeast of the Property. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12-13. Defendant Unlimited began constructing on September 26, 2014. Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 22. It is unclear from the record when the KDC, Kainani, and KRD projects began, but Plaintiff's Amended Complaint alleges that the damage began \"on our about November\n   6, 2014,\" and that Defendants were constructing \"[a]t all pertinent times.\" Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6 9-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In any event, the Richmonds testified that there were \"piles and piles of dirt\" on the construction sites for \"weeks on end\" and \"for over a year, year and a half,\" and that \"many times...dirt was left uncovered.\" Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 2 at 39-42. Fia said during her deposition that Defendant Unlimited's dust fence was too low, and was lower than the dust fence the Richmonds were required to use when constructing their home. Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 2 at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On or about December 5, 2014, the Richmonds met with representatives from Defendant Unlimited to discuss the excessive amount of dirt entering their home. Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 24. Phillip Richmond (\"Phil\") testified that the purpose of the meeting was \"[t]o understand what the extent of the construction was\" and that he had \"concerns as a homeowner.\" Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 1 at 54. Fia testified that they discussed the red dirt in the house and on the lanai, and Phil asked \"how they were going to manage or take care of cleaning it.\" She explained, \"Phil's biggest issue was how they were going to deal with the red dirt and the iron deposits.\" Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 2 at 56-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sometime after the meeting with Defendant Unlimited, the Richmonds filed a claim with CIIC. Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 1 at 95-96. CIIC alleges that it paid the Richmonds $817,769.08 as a result of the red dirt damage caused by Defendants' construction projects. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff filed its Complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii on November 3, 2016. Doc. No. 1. The Complaint alleges that Defendants' negligence caused damage to the Richmonds' residence (Count I), that Defendants trespassed on the Richmonds' Property by causing red dirt to flow onto the Property (Count II), and that the red dirt resulting from Defendants' behavior constituted a private nuisance (Count III). Doc. No. 1 at 4-8. Plaintiff contends that Defendant Unlimited engaged in unreasonable and tortious behavior, resulting in an unusual amount of fugitive red dirt blown by the wind and causing damage to Property, including the staining of tiles and furniture and damage to the pool filtration system. Doc. No. 27 at \u00b6 13. Plaintiff seeks various forms of relief, including all damages proximately caused by the Defendants, individually and/or joint and severally. Doc. No. 1 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant filed the present Motion for Summary Judgment on June 13, 2018. Doc. No. 110. Plaintiff filed its Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment on October 17, 2018. Doc. No. 136. Defendant replied to the Motion on October 24, 2018. Doc. No. 141. Plaintiff submitted its First Amended Separate and Concise Statement of Facts on November 1, 2018, and Defendant replied on November 5, 2018. Doc. Nos. 145, 147. The Motion was heard on November 7, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Doc. No. 136. at 13 (citing Restatement 2d of Torts, \u00a7 892A ). According to the Restatement, \"To be effective, consent must be ... to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct.\" Restatement 2d of Torts, \u00a7 892A. The Hawai'i Supreme Court has not analyzed the scope of consent in a contract for land, but the Court has acknowledged that consent to an intentional tort can be limited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burrows\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1449801\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/49/351/#p360\">\n    49 Haw. at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=417%20P.2d%20816\">\n    417 P.2d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this case, there is no evidence that Defendant Unlimited's conduct went beyond the scope of consent defined in the contract.

However, the Deed provides notice of \"blasting, excavation, construction, and other activities within Kukui'ula, which may cause windblown dust and other nuisances typically associated with such activities\" and continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (c) that the Declarant, any Declarant Affiliate,\n   <em>\n    and all of their agents, contractors, subcontractors, licensees, and other designees, successors, and assigns, shall not be liable but, rather, shall be held harmless for any and all losses, damages (compensatory, consequential, punitive, or otherwise), injuries, or deaths arising from or relating to the aforesaid activities\n   </em>\n   ; (d) that any purchase or use of any portion of a Unit has been and will be made with full knowledge of the foregoing; and (e) that this acknowledgement and agreement is a material inducement to the Declarant or its Declarant Affiliates to sell, convey, lease, and/or allow the use of Units.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   FSCSF, Ex. 3 at 62 (emphasis added).

There is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Unlimited's behavior fell within the scope of the Richmonds' consent, as acknowledged in the Charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, there is no evidence that the Richmonds revoked their consent when they met with Defendant's representatives to inquire about the excessive dirt entering their home. Pl.'s FSCSF at \u00b6 24, Ex. 1 at 53-55. Phil testified that the purpose of the meeting was \"[t]o understand what the extent of the construction was[.]\" Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 1 at 54-55. Fia testified that they discussed the red dirt in the house and on the lanai, and Phil asked \"how they were going to manage or take care of cleaning it.\" Pl.'s FSCSF, Ex. 2 at 56-57. Even interpreting the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, these statements do not suggest a revocation of consent. Therefore, the consent defense precludes Plaintiff's trespass and nuisance claims, and Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED as to Counts II and III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
