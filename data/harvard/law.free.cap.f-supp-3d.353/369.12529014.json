The February 2015 Evaluation Report considered a wide variety of information and data, including results relating to S.'s memory, decision speed, understanding of directions, phonological processing, performance on a battery of standard achievement tests and subtests, and his classroom performance and behavioral and emotional characteristics. F.F. at 4-6. The February 2015 Evaluation Report concluded that S. was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ineligible for special education services under the IDEA. The evaluation found that Student experienced moderately limited alertness in the classroom, meeting the IDEA definition of Other Health Impairment, but concluded that Student was not a child with a disability as defined in the IDEA because Student did\n   not need specially designed instruction, in view of Student's grade-level progress and achievement in the curriculum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   F.F. at 4.

In May 2016, the District offered an IEP for S.'s sixth-grade year (2016-2017) with additional supports. F.F. at 9. Because S.'s parents believed the program and placement offered in this May 2016 IEP proposal was inappropriate, S.'s parents ultimately decided to place S. at Upland Country Day School, a private academic school, and provided the District with written notice of their decision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

After a close examination of the facts at issue, including several days of hearings, the Hearing Officer found that the District did not violate the IDEA or Section 504 in the period leading up to December 2015. Instead, the Hearing Officer found that S.'s February 2015 Evaluation Report was thorough and well-supported:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he District had a comprehensive knowledge of [S.'s] needs based upon the February 2015 [E]valuation [R]eport. That report depicted a child whose cognitive ability was well within the average range overall, and deviated below that range only slightly in a few areas of weakness.... The report also noted that [S.] was diagnosed with epilepsy, and experienced multiple seizures. It noted that this disability would be expected to affect [S.'s] attention, stamina and ability to follow complex or multi-step directions.... [S.'s] history - after being diagnosed and before [S.'s] seizures were brought under better but not perfect control with medications - was one of high achievement in school.... In fourth grade, as the demands of the curriculum became more difficult, [S.'s] achievement was lower, but it remained within the average range - at grade level and with marks at the level of \"B\" and \"C\" - expected for a child with average intelligence. Standardized testing indicated average achievement in reading comprehension, mathematics (except fluency) and writing. Standard behavior inventories elicited no clinically significant emotional, behavioral or social problems, nor did teachers report observing problems in these domains, except for a certain reticence or withdrawal socially, which teachers were addressing through regular education interventions.... [T]he report recommended a number of interventions to address [S.'s] cognitive weaknesses with complex directions and mathematics fluency, as well as measures to help improve [S.'s] self-esteem and reduce anxieties, especially in testing. The District issued a Section 504\n   plan with 23 accommodations to address Student's needs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   HO Decision at 18-19. The Hearing Officer then concluded, after evaluating the District's course of action in light of the February 2015 Evaluation Report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I have reviewed both the recommendations in the evaluation report and the subsequent section 504 service agreement, and I conclude that the service agreement addresses Student's educational needs appropriately and comprehensively with modifications in the regular education setting. Contrary to Parents' argument, the modifications in the service agreement do not fail in any material way to address the needs identified in the February 2015 evaluation report.... [T]here was no red flag indicating that the District must reconsider its section 504 interventions, or revisit its evaluation denying the need for special education. I find no basis to conclude that the District's services were inappropriate based upon what it knew at this point in time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   HO Decision at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   An independent review of the record indicates that the Hearing Officer correctly decided that the District acted appropriately in relation to the February 2015 Evaluation Report and the March 2015 Section 504 Service Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Instead of an IEP, the February 2015 Evaluation Report identified accommodations that S. would receive through a Section 504 Service Agreement. S. contends that the February 2015 Evaluation Report and its conclusion were inappropriate because S. struggled over the course of the remainder of his fourth-grade year (2014-2015) and during the beginning of his fifth-grade year (2015-2016). In support of this argument, S. points to the District's subsequent evaluation of S. in November 2015. S. argues that, since the District concluded in its November 2015 Evaluation Report that S. was eligible for an IEP and SDI, the February 2015 Evaluation Report must have been inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under Third Circuit precedent, S.'s reliance on the District's reevaluation of S. is misplaced. In\n   <em>\n    D.K. v. Abington School District\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff challenged a school district's compliance with its duties under the IDEA on the grounds that the district conducted an inappropriate initial evaluation in April 2006.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3530516\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/233/#p244\">\n    696 F.3d at 249-250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff argued that because a subsequent school district evaluation in November 2007 reached a different result, the school district's initial evaluation must have been insufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3530516\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/233/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3530516\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/233/#p244\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court in\n   <em>\n    D.K.\n   </em>\n   explicitly rejected the plaintiff's reasoning: \"[t]he mere fact that a subsequent evaluation of [the plaintiff]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   yielded a different result-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   he was found disabled with an 'other health impairment' in November 2007 but did not qualify in April 2006-does not necessarily render the earlier testing inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3530516\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/233/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Circuit reached a similar conclusion in\n   <em>\n    M.R.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880672\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/260/#p268\">\n    680 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that a later reevaluation that reaches a different conclusion does not suffice to show that the plaintiff had been denied a FAPE in the period between the initial evaluation (finding ineligibility) and the second evaluation (finding eligibility).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880672\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/260/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court reasoned that after an evaluation concluding that a student is not eligible for special education under the IDEA, \"the school district must be afforded a reasonable time to monitor the student's progress before exploring whether further evaluation is required.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880672\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/260/#p268\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   S.'s challenge to the Hearing Officer's decision fails. The District monitored S.'s progress in the classroom after his initial evaluation and found, after taking that new information into account in its November 2015 Evaluation Report, that S. should be eligible for SDI and therefore eligible for an IEP. Taking this and other relevant factual findings from the administrative proceedings as\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   correct, an independent review of the record does not evince sufficient contrary nontestimonial, extrinsic evidence to undermine the Hearing Officer's conclusion that the District's February 2015 Evaluation Report complied with the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537721\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/260/#p270\">\n    336 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, I will deny S.'s Motion for Judgment on the Administrative Record as it relates to the District's February 2015 Evaluation Report and the District's compliance with its \"child-find\" obligations during the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the March 2015 Section 504 Service Agreement Provided S. with a FAPE\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   S. also contends that the District's March 2015 Section 504 Service Agreement failed to provide S. with a FAPE. Specifically, S. argues that the Section 504 Agreement did not provide S. with SDI (especially consistent small group and direct instruction) that he required to make meaningful educational progress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   S.'s objections to the Hearing Officer's finding fall short. Here, S. primarily adopts the same line of reasoning that he used to challenge the February 2015 Evaluation Report. Specifically, S. contends that the March 2015 Section 504 Service Agreement was inappropriate because the District subsequently decided in Fall 2015 that S. was eligible for SDI and an IEP. As discussed above, this line of reasoning fails under Third Circuit precedent given\n   the pace at which children's needs change as they develop and progress through the curriculum.\n   <em>\n    See.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3530516\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/233/#p244\">\n    696 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   249-251 ;\n   <em>\n    M.R.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3880672\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/260/#p268\">\n    680 F.3d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taking the Hearing Officer's factual findings on this issue as prima facie correct, an independent review of the record does not evince sufficient contrary nontestimonial, extrinsic evidence to undermine the Hearing Officer's conclusion that the District's March 2015 Section 504 Service Agreement provided S. with a FAPE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537721\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/336/260/#p270\">\n    336 F.3d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
