(\"EIP\") (collectively \"defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before the court are cross-motions for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth below, Reed's motion is granted and defendants' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Reed is a professional photographer specializing in the production of fine-art nature photography. Decl. Aaron C. Reed \u00b6 2 (\"Reed Decl.\"), ECF # 26-1. Reed offers his works through his website in the form of museum quality fine-art prints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. He sets strict production limits of between 50 and 200 prints for each work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. His pieces sell for thousands of dollars each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A (displaying invoices of $12,000 for four pieces, $4,250 for two pieces, $4,800 for one piece, and $5,000 for one piece). His customers pay a premium due to the artificial scarcity of each piece.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Reed has expended great time and effort establishing his brand as a fine-art nature photographer and is very selective about when and how his works are used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. While Reed endeavors to protect his intellectual-property rights to the best of his ability, he does not have the time or financial resources to stop the widespread copyright infringement of his photographs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, Reed took a photograph at the Japanese Garden in Portland, Oregon (\"the Image\"), and displayed it on his website. Joint Stip. Undis. Facts \u00b6 1, ECF # 22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A (showing a copy of the Image). Reed registered the Image as part of a group registration of photographs taken in 2010 and did not assert a claim in the selection, coordination, or arrangement of the works included within the group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. On January 30, 2013, the Copyright Office issued registration certificate number VAu 1-119-527 for the group of photographs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ezelle is a real estate broker licensed in Oregon and California and operates a real estate business. Decl. Glenn D. Ezelle Jr. \u00b6 1 (\"Ezelle Decl.\"), ECF # 24-2. He is the sole owner and president of EIP. Joint Stip. Undis. Facts \u00b6 7, ECF # 22. In 2016, Ezelle searched Google for \"free images\" to display on EIP's website and found the Image. Ezelle Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF # 24-2. It is unclear where Ezelle procured the Image. Decl. Ryan E. Carreon \u00b6 4, Ex. B, ECF # 35-1. Regardless, Ezelle maintains that he did not see a watermark or any other information suggesting the Image was copyrighted, and he believed he could use the Image for free. Ezelle Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF # 24-2. On September 7, 2016, Ezelle uploaded a copy of the Image to EIP's website where it was displayed in rotation with seven other photographs in five-second intervals at the top of the website's homepage. Joint Stip. Undis. Facts \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, ECF # 22;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C (showing screenshot of EIP website with the Image). The parties dispute the amount of website traffic the EIP website received during the relevant period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2017, Reed discovered the Image on EIP's website and instructed his attorneys to contact Ezelle to try to resolve the matter. Reed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, ECF # 26-1. In July 2017, through his attorneys, Reed\n   sent Ezelle a cease-and-desist letter. Ezelle Decl., Ex. A, ECF # 24-3. The communication included a Rapid Conditional Release License Agreement (\"Proposed Settlement Agreement\"), which provided Ezelle the option of immediately settling the matter for $5,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Proposed Settlement Agreement contained the following confidentiality clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The terms of this Agreement are confidential; provided however, that each Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement, as necessary to enforce its terms, in response to valid legal process or as otherwise required by law, and/or to its financial advisors and/or legal advisors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Proposed Settlement Agreement \u00b6 7, ECF # 24-3. It also provided that the \"Agreement may not be modified or amended except by written agreement, signed by all Parties,\" and contained a severability clause.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon receipt of the letter, Ezelle immediately removed the Image from EIP's website and retained counsel. Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 31, ECF # 24-6. Several days later, Ezelle's counsel sent Reed's counsel an email, sparking negotiations via email that lasted a little under a month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In two emails sent in late July 2017, Ezelle's counsel stated his belief that Reed had seeded the internet with his photographs with the intent of later bringing dubious legal claims. Higbee Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-14 &amp; Ex. B, ECF # 26-1. Ezelle's counsel also stated that he was writing an article about these practices for publication in a legal magazine, and made several disparaging comments on online forums.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10 &amp; Ex. B, E. Nevertheless, to quickly resolve the matter without the expense of litigation, the parties made several attempts to settle the dispute. Reed Decl. \u00b6 20, ECF # 26-1; Ezelle Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, ECF # 24-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 11, 2017, Ezelle's counsel sent an email to Reed's counsel stating that \"[a]t this juncture, we intend to do as previously mentioned, but in the amount of $1000.\n   <em>\n    We are not making a settlement offer in this amount\n   </em>\n   , although you are welcome to accept it. We are going to send a check, payable to Mr. Reed in the amount of $1000.\" Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 7, ECF # 24-6 (emphasis added). Reed's counsel responded, \"I have conveyed the $1000 offer to my client which he accepted. Please see attached the release agreement for your review. Please sign it and return it ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ezelle returned the Proposed Settlement Agreement, but with lines drawn through the agreement's confidentiality clause. Ezelle Decl., Ex. C, ECF # 24-5;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D at 6-8, ECF # 24-6. In response to inquiries from Reed's counsel regarding the modification of the agreement, Ezelle's counsel's said, \"If the deletions are unacceptable, you can return the check to me.\" Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 7, ECF # 24-6. Through counsel, Reed responded that the confidentiality clause was non-negotiable and demanded $20,000 to settle the case. Reed Decl. \u00b6 28, ECF # 26-1; Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 4, ECF # 24-6. In a later email, Ezelle's counsel stated that \"[t]he only thing we did not agree on was the confidentiality clause demanded by your office.\" Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 2, ECF # 24-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After negotiations fell through, Ezelle's counsel made what Reed considered additional disparaging comments on online forums characterizing Reed's efforts as \"an 'extrajudicial business model' driven by dishonest representation[s] ....\" Higbee Decl., Ex. E, ECF # 26-1; Reed Decl. \u00b6 24, ECF # 26-1. Reed considered the confidentiality clause to be non-negotiable, because he might otherwise suffer reputational harm from Ezelle's counsel's disparaging comments about his attempts to protect his intellectual property. Higbee Decl. \u00b6 11 &amp; Ex. D, ECF # 26-1; Reed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26, ECF # 26-1; Decl. Naomi M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sarega \u00b6 7, ECF # 26-1.

When the parties attempted to put their agreement in writing, they reached an impasse regarding whether a confidentiality clause should be included. The plaintiff filed a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, arguing that the parties had no contract because the agreement omitted the material term of a confidentiality clause. The court opined that \"[a] case clearly may be settled without a confidentiality clause.

Here, the facts show that the confidentiality clause was always an essential part of the deal that Reed wanted to make. Every proposed agreement that Reed sent to Ezelle contained a confidentiality clause. Reed insisted on confidentiality because Ezelle's counsel began making disparaging comments that he was somehow engaging in fraudulent and unethical behavior for attempting to protect his intellectual property. Reed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-30, ECF # 26-1; Higbee Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, ECF # 26-1.

In\n   <em>\n    Ingenuity\n   </em>\n   , attorneys with \"shattered law practices\" obtained the copyrights to pornographic movies they did not produce, monitored BitTorrent activity, sued Internet service providers to determine the identities of the subscribers of IP addresses, and then sent cease-and-desist letters to subscribers demanding settlements of about $4,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. \"This nationwide strategy was highly successful because of statutory[ ]copyright damages, the pornographic subject matter, and the high cost of litigation,\" resulting in millions of dollars in proceeds due to the\n   numerosity of the defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The plaintiffs misrepresented their operations, relationships, and financial interests, and attempted to deceive the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.

He has not attempted to deceive this court or obfuscate the facts. Instead, Reed found the Image on defendants' business website, where it had been posted for nine months. After contacting Ezelle with an initial settlement offer, Ezelle's counsel began making disparaging comments online and in settlement negotiations.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Clear Skies\n   </em>\n   , where the defendant admitted he knew the movie was copyright-protected, the uncontroverted evidence in this case is that Ezelle downloaded the Image from a \"free website\" and believed the Image was \"free.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204021121\">\n    2017 WL 4021121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 ; Suppl. Ezelle Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF # 34. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Unicolors\n   </em>\n   , where the defendants made no attempt to find copyright information, Ezelle \"believed he took steps to make sure he was using a free image\" by searching only for \"free\" images.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277332\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/853/980/#p991\">\n    853 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   991-92 ; Ezelle Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF # 24-2. Ezelle further declares that he did not see a watermark or any other copyright information before downloading the Image. Suppl. Ezelle Decl. \u00b6 7, ECF # 34. Thus, defendants' infringement was not willful as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Innocent Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To be an \"innocent infringer,\" a defendant must show he was \"not aware and had no reason to believe that his ... acts constituted an infringement of copyright.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

In\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   , for example, the defendant downloaded copyrighted music online rather than obtaining it from phonorecord discs. The plaintiff provided copyright notices on the surface of their phonorecords. Although the music posted online lacked copyright notices, the court reasoned that the inquiry is \"whether 'access' to legitimate works was available rather than whether infringers earlier in the chain attached copyright notices to the pirated works.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594266\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/888/#p892\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Similarly, here, defendants cannot prove that they were innocent because, while a copyright notice did not appear alongside the Image when Ezelle downloaded it, information that a copyright existed was readily discoverable. Brown Decl. \u00b6 3, ECF# 28; Suppl. Higbee Decl. \u00b6 8, ECF # 31-1. As in\n   <em>\n    BMG\n   </em>\n   , defendants could have learned about the copyright through basic online research. Thus, defendants cannot prove that they had no reason to believe their acts constituted an infringement. As such, they are not innocent infringers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Statutory Damages on Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   When a plaintiff demands more than the minimum amount of statutory damages in a copyright infringement action and a party demands a jury trial, the Seventh Amendment entitles that party to have a jury decide the amount of statutory damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the parties confirmed at oral argument that they both waived their right to a jury trial. As such, this court may award statutory damages on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FRCP 38(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because this case involves neither willful nor innocent infringement, the court may award statutory damages of \"not less than $750 or more than $30,000. \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20504\">\n    17 USC \u00a7 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

Arguably, with his level of professional experience, Ezelle should have known that he could not use the Image in this case. While it is unclear from which website Ezelle downloaded the Image, in this court's view, simply searching Google for \"free images\" and not immediately seeing a watermark lacks the type of diligence that would mitigate an award of statutory damages. Moreover, the infringement was not merely for personal use; Ezelle used the copyrighted work for profit and to further his own business interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On the other hand, Reed has not presented any evidence of actual damages or lost profits. Reed has not specified what if any remaining value the image has, whether it has ever been sold and at what price, and the importance of this specific image related to his whole practice as a fine-art nature photographer. Defs.' Resp. 3-5, ECF # 28. Moreover, only a few thousand people may have even visited the EIP website in the nine months during which the Image was displayed, and the Image was displayed in rotation with seven other photographs at five-second intervals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Furthermore, Ezelle and Reed are not competitors. Reed sells high-quality fine-art prints, while Ezelle sells real estate. Ezelle infringed the copyright in the Image by visually enhancing his website-not by reselling the Image itself. However, such use could still devalue Reed's brand and destroy his ability to offer that piece for sale as part of his fine-art collection. Reed's customers could be less likely to view his work as \"fine art\" or to pay a premium for its artificial scarcity if they saw the same photo being used in that context. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. 13, ECF # 26; Reed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, ECF # 26-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, and importantly, Ezelle terminated his infringing use immediately after receiving Reed's cease-and-desist letter. Ezelle Decl., Ex. D at 31, ECF # 24-6. Ezelle's immediate compliance is a factor in favor of a lower award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Considering all the circumstances, a statutory award of $1,500, i.e., twice the minimum, is just in this case. The minimum award of $750 seems insufficient, given the length of time the image was used on Ezelle's commercial site and Ezelle's level of experience as a professional. An award that is twice the minimum would put \"infringers on notice that it costs less to obey the copyright laws than to violate them,\" while anything higher would fail to discount for Ezelle's immediate compliance when he learned of the infringement.\n   <em>\n    BMI v.
