Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant is a Honduran national who first entered the United States in 2007. On August 1, 2008, he was served with a Notice to Appear, alleging that he was removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Notice to Appear directed Defendant to appear before an immigration judge \"on a date to be set at a time to be set to show why [he] should not be removed from the United States....\" On August 18, 2008, Defendant was served with a Notice of Hearing, scheduling his master hearing before the immigration court on October 20, 2008, at 1:00 p.m. Defendant was subsequently served with ten more Notices of Hearing, each continuing the master hearing to a later date. Finally, on December 8, 2010, the immigration judge ordered that Defendant be deported to Honduras. Defendant was deported on December 17, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant reentered the United States. Immigration officials determined that Defendant was removable through reinstatement of the December 2010 order of removal. Defendant was deported on September 13, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was apprehended on February 10, 2018, after reentering the United States. He is now charged with illegal reentry \"after having been ... removed ... on or about September 13, 2017[.]\" He argues that his charge must be dismissed because the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction to enter the December 2010 order of removal, a fact which would preclude the Government from relying on that order or its reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

District courts that have concluded that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   extends to other contexts are themselves divided, however. Some have found that, because the immigration court lacked jurisdiction and could not issue a valid order of removal, a defendant need not show under \u00a7 1326(d) that he exhausted administrative remedies or that he was denied the opportunity for judicial review; in those cases, the defendant's collateral attack succeeds.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nov. 7, 2018). Others have found that, even though a notice is defective under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the defendant can waive that defect and must still show that he exhausted administrative remedies and was denied judicial review; a defendant's collateral attack can thus fail despite the defect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Immigration Court's Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant emphasizes that the August 2008 Notice to Appear did not provide the date and time of his master hearing and contends, therefore, that it is not a \"notice to appear\" under \u00a7 1229(a). Since jurisdiction does not vest with the immigration court until a \"notice to appear\" is filed, he argues, the immigration court was without jurisdiction to order him removed from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Government contends that Congress did not address by statute whether or when jurisdiction vests in the immigration court, and thus that issue is governed by the regulations implemented by the Attorney General. It argues that since the regulatory definition of a \"notice to appear\" does not require time-and-place information,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), the August 2008 Notice to Appear was valid and sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the immigration court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Judge Bowman agreed with Defendant, finding that only a valid \"notice to appear\" can confer jurisdiction on the immigration court, and that a notice is invalid if it omits the date-and-time information. Judge Bowman further found that a lack of jurisdiction cannot be waived, and that an invalid notice cannot be cured by subsequent service of a \"notice of hearing.\" Therefore, since the immigration court lacked jurisdiction, Judge Bowman recommends finding that Defendant's removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair and ordering that the indictment be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its Objections, the Government urges this Court to follow the other cases in this district that have rejected arguments identical to Defendant's. The Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   expressly limited its holding to cases involving the stop-time rule, which is not at issue in this case. The Government asserts that, if\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   did have such far-reaching consequences, the Supreme Court would not have remanded for further proceedings because there would be no jurisdiction for such proceedings. The Government also argues the Court should adhere to pre-\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   case law upholding the two-step practice of serving a notice without time-and-place information and then a subsequent notice of hearing containing that information, and to post-\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   administrative decisions that reject a broad reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendant. Although the Supreme Court narrowly defined the issue in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , it held clearly and repeatedly that a notice that omits the time and place of the removal proceedings \"is not a 'notice to appear under section 1229(a).' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110, 2113-14, 2115, 2118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, the Supreme Court explained that the time-and-place requirement is \"definitional,\" and that, \"when the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere in the statutory section, including as the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \u00a7 1229(a).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The foregoing language indicates that the stop-time rule is only one context in which the \"notice to appear\" definition applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court disagrees with the Government that deference should be given to the regulatory definition of a \"notice to appear,\" or to any administrative decisions that adopt a narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . \"Congress has supplied a clear and unambiguous answer to the interpretive question at hand\"-i.e., a notice that does not specify the time and place of the removal proceedings is not a \"notice to appear\" under \u00a7 1229(a) -and an inconsistent agency regulation cannot displace Congress' intent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2113-14 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The defendant is charged with illegally re-entering the United States after being removed from the country on about 9/13/17. The removal was based on an order reinstating a prior order of removal that was entered on 12/8/10. The 2010 removal order was initiated by a Notice to Appear (NTA), dated 8/1/08. (Ex. 13) The NTA before an immigration judge includes the place of the defendant's initial removal hearing but does not provide a date or time. Instead it states \"a date to be set\" at \"a time to be set\". The NTA is signed by the defendant, indicating that he requested a prompt hearing. Thereafter, the defendant was served with 11 Notices of Hearing (NOH), beginning on 8/18/08. After numerous continuances, the last notice was\n   served on 11/23/10. (Exs. 8-10, 12-18, 20) The final NOH set a master hearing on 12/8/10. A review of Exhibit 6, an audio recording of the 12/8/10 hearing, confirms that the defendant attended the removal hearing and was represented by counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was ordered removed and waived his right to appeal. (Ex. 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court finds that the NTA is deficient. The immigration court did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The removal order was invalid and could not be reinstated and relied on to remove the defendant from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   - Due process allows a defendant charged pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , re-entry of a removed alien, to challenge the underlying removal order upon which the charge is predicated.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The defendant's position is that without a NTA that complies with the statute, subject matter jurisdiction did not vest with the immigration court and any order of removal without jurisdiction was invalid. Eight C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14(a) explains that \"Jurisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court by the Service.\" Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   states that removal proceedings are initiated when a written notice to appear is given in person to the alien. It sets forth the information that must be provided, to include \"the time and place at which the proceedings will be held\", per subsection (G)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The government responds that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) does not address when or how jurisdiction vests with the immigration court. It refers the Court to the \"comprehensive framework\" of regulations, including\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1003.15, for its position that the NTA in this case complies with the regulatory requirements that the agency is authorized to promulgate. Section 1003.15(c) sets forth the required contents for a NTA for removal proceedings. Five items are listed, but date and time of the hearing are not included. The government argues that the NTA was proper in conjunction with the NOH that followed and provided the date and time of the hearing. Its position is that the immigration court\n   properly exercised jurisdiction over the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.

Defendant's position is that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   has far-reaching implications and addresses some of the same issues present in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The government argues that the Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   stated several times that the holding was intended to be narrow and to address the intersection of the statutory provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) and 1229(a). The focus of the discussion was on the information a NTA must contain to trigger the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) \"stop-time rule\", which ends a noncitizen's period of continuous presence in the United States for purposes of an application for cancellation of removal. According to the government, the holding cannot be expanded to apply to anything other than the stop-time rule and the Court did not address jurisdiction. The government cites\n   <em>\n    Popa v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668807\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/890/\">\n    571 F.3d 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 895-96 (9th Cir. 2009) for its holding that the NTA and NOH together provide the alien with the required notice to initiate proceedings. It points out that although\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   was decided prior to\n   <em>\n    Periera\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court did not specifically overrule the 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit's holding that the government is permitted to use the two-step process. The government is correct in stating that\n   <em>\n    Periera\n   </em>\n   did not explicitly overrule\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, this court concludes, based on the Supreme Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Periera\n   </em>\n   , that\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   , the 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit held that an alien can be ordered removed in absentia, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. s 1229a(b)(5)(A), even if the original NTA fails to specify the time and date of the hearing as long as notice of the hearing's time and date is sent in a later communication.\n   <em>\n    Popa v.

The court held that this \"two-step\" notice procedure is permissible. The court did not explicitly explain its reasoning, but it appears that court adopted the reasoning of the 8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit, which in\n   <em>\n    Haider\n   </em>\n   approved of the \"two-step\" notice procedure.\n   <em>\n    Haider v.

The\n   <em>\n    Haider\n   </em>\n   court concluded as follows: \"The INA simply requires that an alien be provided written notice of his hearing; it does not require that the NTA served on Haider satisfy all of \u00a7 1229(a)(1)'s notice requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996842\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/902/#p907\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Haider\n   </em>\n   court held that as long as the alien received adequate \"notice\" the specific statutory requirements of \u00a7 1229(a)(1) were not mandatory. The 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit apparently approved of this reasoning because when quoting the relevant removal statute, the court elided any reference to the NTA statute. The court stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A), an \"alien who, after written notice ... has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding ... shall be ordered removed in absentia if the [government] establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668807\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/890/\">\n    571 F.3d at 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (elisions in original). Without the elision, the statute reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Any alien who, after written notice\n   <em>\n    required under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title\n   </em>\n   has been provided to the alien or the alien's counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding ... shall be ordered removed in\n   absentia if the [government] establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added) The elided passage is not surplusage. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Periera\n   </em>\n   , when the INA refers to the notice statute explicitly, the NTA must contain all statutory elements. The NTA in\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   failed to give the time and date of the hearing. It was therefore defective and could not trigger the removal procedure under \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A) contrary to the 9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Circuit's holding. This court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   is no longer good law after\n   <em>\n    Periera\n   </em>\n   , and the government's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Popa\n   </em>\n   in the pending action is misplaced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira v.
