Turpin have filed motions to vacate their sentences pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   contending they were improperly sentenced under a statute enhancing the term of imprisonment for those using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 5, 2006, Brymer and Turpin were each sentenced imprisonment for 32 years based on their guilty pleas to two counts of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which prescribes certain punishments for \"any person who, during and in relation to any\n   <em>\n    crime of violence\n   </em>\n   or drug trafficking crime ... used or carries a firearm.\" (emphasis added). The predicate \"crime[s] of violence\" supporting Brymer's and Turpin's \u00a7 924(c) convictions were bank robbery (in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2113(a) and (d) ) and carjacking (in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Based on Supreme Court precedent since their convictions, Brymer and Turpin contend that their predicate crimes no longer constitute \"crime[s] of violence\" under \u00a7 924(c)(3) and, as a result, that they are entitled to post-conviction relief. More recent First Circuit precedent applying the Supreme Court teachings upon which they rely has undercut their contentions. For the reasons explained below, I will deny their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

At least one of the men wielded and brandished a large silver revolver. The man with the revolver threatened one teller with the gun and banged the barrel of the gun on the glass during the robbery. The other man approached a second teller and showed her a bag into which she placed the contents of her cash drawer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After departing with $5,756, Brymer and Turpin made off in a stolen van they had been spotted in earlier in the day. Two witnesses (a woman and a security guard from the shopping mall) followed Brymer and Turpin to a location several blocks away where a switch car (also stolen) was waiting. The woman saw Brymer get out of the driver's side of the getaway van and hold up a large silver revolver. The guard arrived shortly after and saw a man hold up a silver revolver and threaten him with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Brymer and Turpin, who had removed their masks, fled in the switch car. After driving the car several blocks, they abandoned it, and carjacked a Dodge pickup\n   truck at gunpoint. During the carjacking, one of the men held the gun to the driver's head and told him he would kill him unless he gave up the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A few blocks away, the two men abandoned the pickup truck, jumped a fence, and ran onto a highway offramp, where they unsuccessfully attempted to carjack a second car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later that evening, the police picked up Brymer and Turpin in the general area in which they had fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 12, 2003, a grand jury charged both defendants with: one count of aggravated bank robbery (in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (d) ); one count of carjacking (in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ); one count of attempted carjacking (in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) ); and three counts of use of a firearm during a crime of violence, specifically the three aforementioned offenses (in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to a plea agreement, both Brymer and Turpin pled guilty to Counts Two (violation of \u00a7 924(c) with respect to bank robbery) and Four (violation of \u00a7 924(c) with respect to carjacking) of the superseding indictment. In exchange, the Government agreed to dismiss the other four counts. The parties agreed to a disposition requiring Brymer and Turpin each to serve the mandatory minimum sentence on both counts consecutively, for a total of 32 years in prison. On January 5, 2006, after accepting the parties' agreed upon recommendation, I sentenced each defendant to 32 years imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 15, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit rejected Brymer's appeal concerning his sentence.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brymer\n   </em>\n   , 06-1323 (1st Cir. Nov. 15, 2007). None of the issues raised in his current habeas corpus petition were raised on Brymer's direct appeal. Turpin did not appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 6, 2016, both Brymer and Turpin filed the motions now before me to vacate the sentences pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On September 12, 2016 the government filed a joint opposition to Brymer and Turpin's petitions. Though the parties filed a joint motion for extension of time for Brymer and Turpin to file a memorandum in reply to the government's opposition, no such reply was filed. Meanwhile, case law further developing the implications of\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   has been unfolding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Government contends that as a result, their claims are untimely because they fall outside the one-year limitation period for habeas corpus petitions set by \u00a7 2255(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under \u00a7 2255(f), the one-year limitation period begins to run from the latest of four enumerated events.

In the ACCA, the term \"violent felony\" is defined in a residual clause to include any felony that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" The Court held in\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

Construed narrowly,\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   created a \"right\" with respect to collateral review of defendants sentenced pursuant to the ACCA's residual clause. However, construed broadly, one could say\n   <em>\n    Johnson II\n   </em>\n   created a \"right\" that calls into question the constitutionality of other similarly worded residual clauses, including \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sessions\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).

The \"prejudice inquiry dovetails with the merits inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Lassend\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517923\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/115/#p123\">\n    898 F.3d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 123 (1st Cir. 2018) (Lynch, J.). Consequently, I turn now to the merits, recognizing that resolution of the merits resolves the procedural default issue of prejudice as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MERITS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Brymer and Turpin claim that the predicate offenses (federal bank robbery and carjacking) for their convictions do not constitute crimes of violence under either the force clause (also referred to as the \"elements clause\") or the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3). I need address only the force, or elements, clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   note 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) defines a crime of violence as an offense that is a felony and \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\" \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Binding First Circuit precedent holds that the predicates for Brymer and Turpin's convictions are such felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As to the predicate crime of bank robbery, in violation of 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d), the First Circuit has held that \"federal bank robbery, and a fortiori federal armed bank robbery, are crimes of violence under the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3).\"\n   <em>\n    Hunter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264393\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/388/#p390\">\n    873 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (1st Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the predicate crime of carjacking in violation of 18. U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(1), the First Circuit has held that carjacking constitutes a \"crime of violence\" pursuant to the force clause of \u00a7 924(c)(3) as well.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518691\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/904/63/#p66\">\n    904 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66 (1st Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Consequently, both predicate crimes that were the bases for Brymer and Turpin's \u00a7 924(c) convictions were crimes of violence under the force clause.\n   <em>\n    Johnson II's\n   </em>\n   treatment of the residual clause is irrelevant here\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and their convictions properly stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the reasons set forth more fully above, Brymer and Turpin's motions to vacate their sentences [Dkt. No. 133; Dkt. No. 134] are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The following facts are taken from Brymer and Turpin's Presentence Reports prepared by the Probation Office after their guilty pleas to the charges.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Sessions\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     138 S.Ct. 1204\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     200 L.Ed.2d 549\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018), the Court dealt with the definition of an \"aggravated felony,\" which includes a \"crime of violence\" as defined in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    8. U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Section 16's definition of \"crime of violence\" contains a residual clause which defines the term as any other offense that is a felony and that \"by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" \u00a7 16(b). Notably, this quoted statutory wording is identical to the statutory wording of the residual clause in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). In\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court held that the residual clause of \u00a7 16 was void for vagueness.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2016\">\n     at 1213-16, 1218-23\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    I will not separately address whether these convictions were crimes of violence under the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c). While the First Circuit post-\n    <em>\n     Johnson II\n    </em>\n    case law has held the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c) is not void for vagueness,\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Douglas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518971\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/907/1/#p4\">\n     907 F.3d 1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 4 (1st Cir. 2018), the issue has since been accepted for review by the Supreme Court when on January 4, 2019, certiorari was granted in\n    <em>\n     United States\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518556\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/483/\">\n     903 F.3d 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5th Cir. 2018) (invalidating \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) ),\n    <em>\n     cert. granted,\n    </em>\n    No. 18-431, --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623972,12623973,12623974,12623975,12623976,12623977\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/782/\">\n     139 S.Ct. 782\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , --- L.Ed.2d ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%2098544\">\n     2019 WL 98544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (U.S. Jan. 4, 2019). Consequently, the First Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Douglas\n    </em>\n    will likely not be the last word on the issue. It would be improvident, especially because it is unnecessary, for me to opine on the outcome of a case now awaiting argument before the Supreme Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
