U.S. Auto initiated this action to contest the imposition of an enhanced single entry bond requirement assessed at three times the amount of the entire shipment value on each container of merchandise imported by U.S. Auto (\"SEB Requirement\") at the Port of Norfolk, which U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"Customs\") mandated in response to Plaintiff's continued importation of goods alleged to infringe trademarks in violation of\n     <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201124\">\n      15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2012) and\n     <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201526\">\n      19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1526\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (e).
