BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action finds its origins in the April 4, 2015 Easter egg hunt at the Wesley United Methodist Church in Marysville, Pennsylvania. A report of Plaintiff Lance H. Farmer (\"Plaintiff\")'s verbal confrontation with a woman at that event was made to the Pennsylvania State Police. Defendant Decker, a Pennsylvania State Trooper, investigated the complaint and cited Plaintiff for disorderly conduct. On April 19, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint against Trooper Decker alleging First Amendment \"Retaliation for Protected Speech\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count 1), and claims for Malicious Prosecution and Abuse of Process under Pennsylvania law (Counts 2 and 3). (Doc. No. 1.) On August 15, 2016, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss Counts 2 and 3 of Plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the state law claims should be dismissed by operation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth and its employees. (Doc. Nos. 8, 11.) On March 9, 2017, the Court issued an Order denying Defendant's motion to dismiss, noting that Defendant did not fully address the relevant legal issues in his brief in support of his motion, and finding that while it was a \"close call,\" the Court could not conclude that Plaintiff \"failed to allege facts from which it can reasonably be inferred that Defendant's actions were motivated solely by personal concerns,\" that would potentially remove him from the scope of sovereign immunity's protection. (Doc. No. 15 at 3-4.) The Court's Order denied the motion without prejudice to Defendant's ability to renew this issue in connection with a properly-supported motion for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the close of discovery, on October 17, 2017, Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment as to all three counts of Plaintiff's complaint (Doc. No. 28), with a statement of material facts (Doc. No. 29), and supporting brief (Doc. No. 30). After receiving an extension of time to respond\n   to Defendant's motion, Plaintiff filed his brief in opposition to Defendant's motion on November 17, 2017 (Doc. No. 34), as well as an \"Answer to Defendant's Statement of Facts and Plaintiff's Statement of Additional Facts\" (Doc. No. 33). After the Court granted an additional extension of time, Defendant filed his reply brief on December 15, 2017 (Doc. No. 38), as well as a response to Plaintiff's additional facts (Doc. No. 37). Accordingly, the motion has been fully briefed and is ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Evidentiary Challenges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before setting forth the material facts as presented by Defendant in connection with his motion, the Court addresses two challenges made by Plaintiff to the evidence proffered by Defendant in support of his motion for summary judgment. First, Plaintiff challenges Defendant's Declaration (Doc. No. 29-2), in support of his motion as a self-serving declaration that is insufficient to support a motion for summary judgment, citing\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. v. Philly Family Practice, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3387794\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/525/718/#p726\">\n    525 F.Supp.2d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726 (E.D. Pa. 2007). In response, Defendant notes that declarations in support of motions for summary judgment are expressly permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c)(4), and that Defendant's Declaration simply recounts his investigation of the incident that forms the basis of this action and is fully consistent with his deposition testimony. (Doc. No. 38 at 7 n.2.) In addition, Defendant points out that the case cited by Plaintiff is clearly distinguishable from the instant case, as the declaration at issue in\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   sought to advance a self-serving interpretation of a potentially ambiguous contract provision, rather than recount events within the declarant's personal knowledge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff's challenge to Defendant's Declaration is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, in responding to the statements offered by Defendant by way of his Declaration, Plaintiff raises a hearsay objection to such evidence, arguing that the statements set forth in Defendant's Declaration, recounting information reported to him by the individual involved in the incident with Plaintiff, as well as witnesses to it, are offered for the truth of the matter asserted and therefore, should be disregarded by the Court as inadmissible hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 801. (Doc. No. 34 at 2-3.) In response, Defendant notes that the claims asserted against him depend on the circumstances surrounding the actions he took in response to the incident and the information reported to him, and as a result, the relevant legal inquiry focuses on what information Defendant possessed at the time he issued the Citation/Summons for Disorderly Conduct (\"Citation/Summons\"). (Doc. No. 38 at 9.) Accordingly, Defendant maintains that the statements challenged by Plaintiff as inadmissible hearsay are not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather, are offered to demonstrate the universe of information upon which Defendant based his issuance of the Citation/Summons to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) In addition, Defendant maintains that, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the relevant statements constitute inadmissible hearsay, they fall within Federal Rule of Evidence 803(1)'s present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule and are potentially admissible on that basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiff's hearsay objection to the statements at issue (which, as noted above, consist of Defendant's description of information provided to him by the individual involved in the incident with Plaintiff, as well as witnesses to it), to be unavailing. As Defendant correctly notes, even assuming that the statements constitute hearsay, they can be properly considered\n   on a motion for summary judgment if such evidence is capable of admission at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Therefore, the party proffering such evidence \"must demonstrate that it could satisfy the applicable admissibility requirements at trial before the evidence may be used on summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Bender v. Norfolk Southern Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065945\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/994/593/#p599\">\n    994 F.Supp.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (M.D. Pa. 2014). The Court is persuaded that Defendant has demonstrated that the statements at issue could be admissible at trial for two potential reasons. One, the Court is persuaded that the statements are not offered for the truth of the matters asserted, but rather, to shed light on the basis for Defendant's issuance of a Citation/Summons to Plaintiff. Second, as the Declaration reveals that Defendant's conversation with the individual involved in the incident with Plaintiff took place shortly after the incident occurred, even assuming that information provided by her constitutes hearsay, such evidence potentially falls within Federal Rule of Evidence 803(1)'s present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule. Accordingly, the Court turns to a recitation of the relevant material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   While on duty on April 4, 2015, Defendant received a call from police dispatch informing him that a complaint had been lodged by a Chief Aaron Richards on behalf of Mrs. Richards. (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 2.) Subsequently, while on duty, Defendant called Mrs. Richards and spoke with her regarding the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) During the interview, Mrs. Richards reported to Defendant that she had attended a church Easter egg hunt that day, also attended by approximately 50 other people. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6.) Defendant was not present at the Easter egg hunt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Mrs. Richards told Defendant that Plaintiff approached her while at the event, which she attended with her children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mrs. Richards told Defendant that Plaintiff spoke to\n   her in a loud voice and called her children liars and \"little assholes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10.) Mrs. Richards reported to Defendant that others attending the Easter egg hunt witnessed the interchange, and provided him with contact information for three to five individuals who she believed had been witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Defendant contacted these individuals, who confirmed to him that a confrontation occurred between Plaintiff and Mrs. Richards and also generally confirmed Mrs. Richards' description of the events. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant attempted to contact Plaintiff, whom he had never met, to discuss the incident, but was ultimately unable to make contact with him to hear his version of the events at the Easter egg hunt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 17.) Plaintiff was not present for Defendant's interviews with Mrs. Richards or any witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) After consultation with his supervisor, Defendant drafted a Citation/Summons for disorderly conduct to be issued to Plaintiff, and submitted it for the approval of his supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) The Citation/Summons was approved and forwarded to a magisterial district judge for processing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After processing by the magisterial district judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Citation/Summons for disorderly conduct was mailed to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The Citation/Summons notes that Plaintiff's conduct occurred at a church Easter egg hunt and that \"Plaintiff's tone was loud and alarmed the children's parents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Defendant maintains that he did not provide Plaintiff's name to any news outlet regarding the Citation/Summons. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, after a hearing on June 16, 2015, Plaintiff was found not guilty of disorderly conduct. (Doc. No. 33 \u00b6 25.) At the hearing, the magisterial district judge stated that Plaintiff's conduct at the Easter egg hunt was \"totally inappropriate and reprehensible given that it was in a church setting and it was at a children's Easter egg hunt, the language - that's not the time and place to confront someone and be calling their children assholes and with children present ... But it's totally unwarranted and the church could have rightly said leave.\" (Doc. No. 29 \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment is warranted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual dispute is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law, and it is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that would allow a reasonable fact-finder to return a verdict for the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248-49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    91 L.Ed.2d 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). At summary judgment, the inquiry\n   is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to the jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    at 251-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on the claims asserted against him because: (1) there exists no genuine issue of material fact as to his entitlement to sovereign immunity on Plaintiff's claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process; and (2) Plaintiff fails to point to evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that he engaged in First Amendment retaliation. (Doc. No. 30 at 12-19.) Further, he maintains that even assuming that there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to Plaintiff's First Amendment retaliation claim, he is entitled to qualified immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-22.) The Court addresses the claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's State Law Tort Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's state law tort claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process because these claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The doctrine of sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth and its employees is established by 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2310. The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Pursuant to [S]ection 11 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, it is hereby declared to be the intent of the General Assembly that the Commonwealth and its officials and employees acting within the scope of their duties, shall continue to enjoy sovereign immunity and official immunity and remain immune from suit except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive the immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1 Pa.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Further, Defendant states that he drafted the Citation/Summons and submitted it to his supervisors for approval while he was on duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, Defendant avers that he had never met and, therefore, had no personal relationship with Plaintiff before the date of the Easter egg hunt, so his actions could not have been motivated by any personal animus between him and Plaintiff.

The undisputed facts demonstrate that Defendant's investigation of the incident and issuance of the Citation/Summons is the type of action that Defendant is employed to perform as a Pennsylvania State Trooper, and that his investigation, which was prompted by a call from the Pennsylvania State Police dispatch, occurred \"substantially within the job's authorized time and space limits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%2029283\">\n    2007 WL 29283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Further, as to the issue of Defendant's motivation to issue the Citation/Summons, the Court is persuaded that the undisputed facts relating to the circumstances of Defendant's investigation, coupled with the lack of a prior relationship between Plaintiff and Defendant, demonstrate that Defendant's actions were motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff points to no record evidence to support his theory that Defendant cited him because as a member of the Christian faith Defendant was personally offended by Plaintiff's words and actions. Even were Plaintiff able to make such a showing, because the law of sovereign immunity in Pennsylvania requires only that the employee's conduct be \"motivated\n   <em>\n    at least in part\n   </em>\n   by a desire to serve the employer,\" Defendant is protected by sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%2029283\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In light of the undisputed facts recited above, Plaintiff has failed to point to evidence of record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Defendant's actions were\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   motivated by personal animus, and, therefore, outside the scope of his employment. Accordingly, Plaintiff's state law tort claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity, and consequently, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment as to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. No. 30 at 14.) Plaintiff disagrees, arguing that the evidence of record supports a reasonable factfinder's conclusion that Plaintiff's speech was protected by the First Amendment. (Doc.

The gist of the disagreement between the parties is whether Defendant's issuance of a Citation/Summons to Plaintiff for violating Section 5503(a)(3) of Pennsylvania's disorderly conduct statute, charging him with disorderly conduct based on the use of \"obscene language,\" was prompted by Defendant's disapproval of the contents of Plaintiff's speech or, rather, was based on probable cause to believe that Plaintiff's conduct violated 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5503(a)(3). Viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving party, the Court finds that, pursuant to the relevant authorities, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Plaintiff's speech, which consisted of him undisputedly confronting Mrs. Richards loudly regarding her children and calling them liars and \"assholes,\" was subject to First Amendment protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eichenlaub v.

As noted above, in connection with his response to Defendant's statement of material facts, Plaintiff filed a \"Statement of Additional Facts.\" (Doc. No. 33.) Defendant filed a response to that document wherein he argues that Plaintiff's \"Statement of Additional Facts\" was improperly filed and should be stricken and/or disregarded by the Court. (Doc.
