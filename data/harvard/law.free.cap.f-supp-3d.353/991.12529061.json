(ECF No. 27). FOA then filed a response (ECF No. 30) to which defendants replied (ECF No. 33). On October 29, 2018, the court held a hearing on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and a similar motion in a companion case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny FOA's motion for summary judgment and grant defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action concerns the BLM's approved plan to gather, round-up, and permanently remove approximately 9,000 wild horses from the Antelope and Triple B wild horse complexes (\"Antelope and Triple B Complexes\") located in southeastern Elko County and northern White Pine County, Nevada pursuant to the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act (\"WHBA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The BLM oversees and administers the Antelope and Triple B Complexes alongside the wild horses which call the complexes home. The Antelope Complex is composed of the Antelope Herd Management Area (\"HMA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Antelope Valley HMA, the Goshute HMA, and the Spruce-Pequop HMA. The Triple B Complex is composed of the Triple B HMA, the Maverick-Medicine HMA, and the Cherry Springs Wild Horse Territory. Together, these two wild horse complexes comprise over 2.8 million acres of public land managed by BLM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In February 2016 and March 2017, BLM conducted wild horse population inventories throughout the Antelope and Triple B Complexes. (Administrative Record (\"AR\") at 365). As a result of those\n   inventories, BLM determined there were roughly 9,525 wild horses then residing in the complexes and that wild horses were beginning to migrate outside of designated HMAs and were encroaching upon private land for forage and water. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The previously determined Appropriate Management Levels (\"AML\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   for wild horse populations in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes is between 899 horses on the low range and 1,678 horses on the high range. (AR at 11). Thus, at the time of the inventories, the total wild horse population on the complexes was eleven times greater than low AML and nearly six times greater than high AML. Based on this information, BLM determined that in Spring 2017, there were over 9,000 excess wild horses living in the complexes and that a gather to remove the excess wild horses was required under the WHBA to bring the wild horse population back within the AML range for the Antelope and Triple B Complexes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Initially, defendants compiled a preliminary gather plan and Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") for gathering and removing excess wild horses from the complexes known as The Preliminary Antelope and Triple B Complexes Gather Plan EA, DOI-BLM-NV-N030-2017-0010-EA. The preferred action under the preliminary plan was to gather and permanently remove approximately 6,700 wild horses from the complexes over a ten-year period, utilize population and fertility controls on a portion of the remaining wild horse population, adjust the sex ratio of the wild horse population within the HMAs, and manage a portion of the male wild horse population as castrated geldings. The preliminary gather plan was made available for public review and comment from July 21 through August 21, 2017. (AR at 196, 370). During this period, BLM received approximately 4,940 comment submissions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   including a comment from FOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AR at 370).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the close of the public comment period, defendants prepared a final gather plan and environmental assessment in December 2017: The Antelope and Triple B Complexes Gather Plan EA, DOI-BLM-NV-E030-2017-0010-EA (\"2017 Gather Plan\"). (AR at 1-364). On December 21, 2017, defendants issued a final Decision Record approving the proposed gather, removal, and fertility controls outlined in Alternative A of the 2017 Gather Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (AR at 365-373). Also on December 21, 2017, defendants issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\") for the 2017 Gather Plan, finding that \"implementation of [the 2017 Gather Plan] will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment\" and, therefore, \"preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") [was] not required as per Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (\"NEPA\").\" (AR at 374-377).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 25, 2018, FOA filed a complaint against defendants alleging five separate causes of action: (1) violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706 ; (2) violation of the WHBA; (3) violation of NEPA for failing to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement; (4) violation of NEPA for failing to consider and address reasonable alternatives to the 2017 Gather Plan; and (5) violation of NEPA for failing to take a \"hard look\" at the environmental impact of the 2017 Gather Plan. (ECF No. 1). On January 31, 2018, BLM conducted the first roundup under the 2017 Gather Plan removing roughly 1,300 wild horses from the Triple B Complex and then returning 62 horses to the complex including 28 mares treated with fertility controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Or. Apr. 2, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In its second cause of action, FOA alleges that defendants violated the WHBA when they made their initial determination that there were excess wild horses on the Antelope and Triple B Complexes and subsequently approved the 2017 Gather Plan based upon that erroneous excess determination. (ECF No. 1). In its motion for summary judgment, FOA raises three distinct arguments as to why defendants allegedly violated the WHBA. First, FOA argues defendants' excess determination that an overpopulation of wild horses currently exists, and will continue to exist, in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes throughout the duration of the 2017 Gather Plan was not based on \"current information\" as required by the WHBA. Second, FOA argues defendants erroneously relied on outdated AMLs for the Antelope and Triple B Complexes in both the excess determination and the 2017 Gather Plan. Finally, FOA argues that the 2017 Gather Plan does not constitute management of wild horses at the \"minimal feasible level\" as required under the WHBA. The Court shall address each argument below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1. \"Current Information\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FOA contends that defendants' 2017 decision approving a ten-year gather plan was not based on \"current information\" for future roundups authorized under the 2017 Gather Plan. (ECF No. 21). In particular, FOA contends that the WHBA requires that every wild horse \"excess\" determination and subsequent round up of wild horses be based on current information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). It argues that defendants did not have the required information in December 2017 when they approved the 2017 Gather Plan, which stated that removal of wild horses from the Antelope and Triple B Complexes will still be necessary ten years from now as range conditions and wild horse populations can fluctuate over such a long period. Further, FOA insists that defendants cannot act on the basis of current wild horse population inventories and information in approving a ten-year gather plan. Nevertheless, defendants approved Alternative A of the 2017 Gather Plan, which authorizes an undetermined number of roundups throughout the Antelope and Triple B Complexes over the next ten years. As such, FOA argues the 2017 Gather Plan, which authorizes round ups until 2027, is arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Initially, the Court notes that FOA's argument is premised on a fundamental misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the WHBA's excess determination requirements. FOA mischaracterizes the plain language of the WHBA to require BLM to make a new excess determination for each and every round up authorized under a gather plan and base that new excess determination on information then available at the time of that particular round up. Such an interpretation of the WHBA is in direct conflict with the specific language of the statute which \"entitles BLM to act 'on the basis of all information currently available to [it]' \" in making its excess determination.\n   <em>\n    Colorado Wild Horse v.

D.C. 1982) (holding that the WHBA specifically authorizes BLM to act \"on the bases of whatever information [it] has at the time of [its] decision.\"). Contrary to FOA's argument, the WHBA contemplates a single excess determination prior to approval of a gather plan. There is no requirement that a separate determination be made for each individual round up approved under a gather plan and the court shall not read such a requirement into the WHBA.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Animals v.

Prior to drafting the 2017 Gather Plan, defendants compiled substantial data regarding the utilization of forage and water by all animals throughout the Antelope and Triple B Complexes as well as trends in ecological conditions and climate patterns. (AR at 58-64). The data defendants compiled and then relied upon in their decision included information about current wild horse populations (based on inventories in 2016 and 2017), current livestock grazing in the complexes, and ecological and climate trends in the complexes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268347\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/53/#p63\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, defendants compiled several monitoring and utilization reports in 2017 which provided the most current information about HMA conditions. (AR at 26503-27411). After considering this information, defendants concluded that \"[w]ild horse population and resource monitoring data shows that current wild horse populations are exceeding the range's ability to sustain them.\" (AR at 369). The Court finds that the information defendants compiled and relied upon in support of the 2017 Gather Plan complied with the WHBA's mandate that BLM act \"on the basis of all information currently available to [it.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, FOA's argument fails in light of the widely accepted understanding that the WHBA \"conveys Congress's view that BLM's findings of wild horse overpopulations should not be overturned quickly on the ground that they are predicated on insufficient information.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Horse Protection Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868739,1487375\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/1310/\">\n    694 F.2d at 1318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Def. of Animals\n   </em>\n   , 751 F.3d at 1066 (finding that agency expertise deserves deference when an overpopulation exists and action is warranted). FOA's challenge to the 2017 Gather Plan essentially boils down to requiring that BLM act only upon perfect and up to date information at all times of a gather plan. Perfect information, however, is almost never available when predicting future environmental factors and effects. Moreover, such information is not required under the WHBA before BLM issues a decision pursuant to its statutory mandate. Therefore, the Court finds that defendants' excess determination under the WHBA and subsequent removal plan as outlined in Alternative A of the 2017 Gather Plan was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    2. Reliance on Outdated AMLs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   FOA also argues that the 2017 Gather Plan is arbitrary and capricious because it is based in part on outdated AMLs for several of the HMAs within the Antelope and Triple B Complexes that BLM had previously committed to reevaluate. (ECF No. 21). In particular, FOA contends that several AMLs and land use plans in a few HMAs will not be valid for the life of the 2017 Gather Plan without being reevaluated pursuant to the terms of the relevant land use plans, and thus, defendants could not rely on these AMLs to support the 2017 Gather Plan. In opposition, defendants argue that their reliance on the previously approved AMLs was not a violation of the WHBA. (ECF No. 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court agrees with defendants. There is no language in the WHBA \"requir[ing] the BLM to determine new AMLs based on current conditions every time the BLM decides to take action to restore the already-established AMLs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    In Def. of Animals\n   </em>\n   , 751 F.3d at 1064, n. 13.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of Animals v.

Apr. 2, 2018) (\"FOA provides, and the Court has found, no case law to support FOA's contention that BLM has an obligation to show that the AML 'applies' or remains valid in a given HMA before relying on it[.]\"). In fact, notwithstanding FOA's argument to the contrary, the WHBA \"does not create a statutory obligation for BLM to recalculate the AML at every gather.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of Animals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201612836\">\n    2018 WL 1612836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18. Instead, BLM is given great deference both in establishing AMLs and in reevaluating established AMLs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Habitat for Horses v.

Under the WHBA, BLM is mandated to \"immediately remove excess wild horses from the range so as to achieve [AMLs].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). It would run counter to the WHBA's statutory mandate to reevaluate an established AML prior to every removal decision. Thus, while the AMLs relied on in the 2017 Gather Plan have not been amended in the past few years, these AMLs are the currently applicable and established AMLs for the project area and BLM was required to rely on them in support of its excess determination.\n   <em>\n    In Def. of Animals\n   </em>\n   , 751 F.3d at 1064, n. 13. Therefore, BLM's reliance on the previously approved and established AMLs was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    3. Minimally Feasible Level\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, FOA argues that the 2017 Gather Plan violates the WHBA because managing a portion of the wild horse population as castrated/gelded horses does not constitute management at the minimal feasible level as required under the WHBA's provisions. (ECF No. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, FOA failed to plead or otherwise raise this WHBA claim in its complaint, and it cannot now pursue the claim on summary judgment. As pled in its complaint, FOA's WHBA claim only challenged the 2017 Gather Plan's excess and removal determinations. (ECF No. 1, \u00b6 117) (\"On the above facts and legal obligations, Defendants violated the WHBA by failing to make an appropriate determination that wild horses were excess and removal is necessary prior to authorizing the permanent removal of horses over a ten-year period from the Antelope and Triple B Complexes.\"). Nowhere in this claim did FOA challenge the 2017 Gather Plan's proposal of returning a portion of geldings under the \"minimal feasible language\" of the WHBA. Rather, FOA challenged the return of geldings to the Antelope and Triple B Complexes under NEPA, as alleged in FOA's third and fifth cause of action. (ECF No. 1). Therefore, the court shall dismiss this newly raised claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But even if FOA had pled this claim in its complaint, the Court finds that defendants' decision to utilize population control measures, including gelding of stallions, a portion of which are then returned back to the Antelope and Triple B Complexes, reasonably constitutes management of wild horses at the minimal feasible level and therefore was not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In Def. of Animals\n   </em>\n   , 751 F.3d at 1057-59 (finding that applying population control measures was management at the minimal feasible level). The only difference between past gather plans and the 2017 Gather Plan is that some geldings would be released back to the Antelope and Triple B Complexes instead of being shipped off for adoption or sale. Under the WHBA, BLM has explicit authority to utilize a range of population control measures, in addition to directly removing and euthanizing\n   excess horses, to manage wild horse populations to reach an established AML range.\n   <em>\n    W.

The WHBA's requirement that \"[a]ll management activities shall be at the minimal feasible level,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), can reasonably be read and interpreted, as BLM interprets the statute, to mean that BLM shall use \"[t]he minimum number of habitat or population management tools or actions necessary to attain the objectives\" for an HMA. The 2017 Gather Plan complies with this interpretation, as returning horses that would already be gelded back to the range does not increase the number of population management actions that BLM must take, and gelding provides a permanent way to render part of the herd non-reproducing. FOA's argument improperly reads NEPA requirements into the WHBA, suggesting that the WHBA provision does not permit \"controversial\" management actions or actions that have not been thoroughly studied. Such an interpretation is beyond the plain meaning of the WHBA. Because BLM's interpretation of the statute is reasonable and faithful to the plain meaning of the statutory terms of the WHBA, it shall not be rejected by the Court in favor of FOA's broad and baseless alternative. FOA has not established that defendants' gelding proposal would add additional material management actions to those otherwise planned by BLM. In fact, FOA has failed to identify any specific managerial conduct or intrusive action because of the gelding proposal that is not already identified in the 2017 Gather Plan for the other population control measures and BLMs monitoring of wild horse populations in general. Thus, contrary to FOA's unsubstantiated claims, managing a portion of the wild horse population as non-breeding geldings does not violate WHBA's requirement for management at the minimum feasible level.

As such, defendants' approval of the gather plan absent an EIS violates NEPA and was an arbitrary and capricious decision. FOA raises several challenges to the 2017 Gather Plan which it argues establishes that the gather plan is highly controversial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, FOA argues that a change to the boundary area between the preliminary gather plan, which identified a gather area of over 3 million acres, and the approved 2017 Gather Plan, which identifies a gather area of 2.8 million acres, establishes that there is a substantial dispute as to the size of the gather. (ECF No. 21). FOA's argument is without merit. It is undisputed that in the preliminary gather plan EA, BLM identified that the prospective gather area was over 3 million acres. Then in response to a public comment that the acreage figures used in the preliminary gather plan EA were higher than the established acreage in the HMAs and land use plans for the Antelope and Triple B Complexes, BLM reviewed the record for each HMA and concluded that the boundaries of four HMAs had been incorrectly measured and incorporated into the preliminary gather EA. BLM then corrected the gather acreage in the 2017 Gather Plan to reflect the actual acreage and boundaries for each HMA as established in the governing land use plans and explained the reason for the boundary change. (AR at 351-364). More importantly, BLM directly analyzed the relevant environmental concerns when the error occurred including the effect of the boundary change on each\n   HMA's AML range and the effect the proposed action would have on the AMLs under the correct boundaries. (AR at 351) (\"Even if the slightly higher acreage value given for [the HMAs] at the time the AMLs were established resulted in proportionally higher AMLs for those HMAs, this would not affect the proposed action and gather plan described in the Final EA.\"). Because BLM did not change the acreage in the governing land use plans, BLM is not required to re-analyze issues previously addressed in its land use plan NEPA analysis. The Court finds that this boundary change, which is reflected in the administrative record, is not highly controversial, nor does it raise substantial questions about the proposed action to trigger an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, FOA asserts that the 2017 Gather Plan's proposed use of gelding and other fertility controls to limit population growth in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes is highly controversial because these procedures involve unique risks to the health of the wild horse populations. In particular, FOA contends that BLM's decision to release geldings back into the complexes as a management tool is untested and not scientifically supported. FOA argues that several wild horse experts who submitted comments during the public comment period expressed their concern that castrating wild horses will affect the \"fundamental process\" of wild horse behavior (AR at 1396), will cause undue suffering to the gelded horses (AR at 821), and will \"destroy\" the social dynamics of wild horse herds (AR at 877-881). Thus, because there is no definitive scientific consensus on the impact of managing castrated stallions within existing wild horse herds, FOA argues that an EIS should have been prepared prior to approval of the 2017 Gather Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In opposition, defendants argue that the 2017 Gather Plan's use of geldings and fertility controls is not highly controversial and does not involve highly uncertain or unique risks. (ECF No. 27). The court agrees. Initially, the court finds that FOA fails to demonstrate that the effects of the proposed population controls are highly controversial, highly uncertain, or involve unique or unknown risks for purposes of NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495765\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/701/#p712\">\n    588 F.3d 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that for an action's effects to be \"highly uncertain\" there must be more than just \"some uncertainty\" about the proposed action). Even granting that this will be the largest and longest gather action conducted in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes, the 2017 Gather Plan's foreseeable effects are entirely precedential and non-controversial: the return of the wild horse population to the long-established AMLs. Achieving and maintaining established AMLs through a combination of both permanent removal of wild horses and other population control methods is a routine practice of BLM. In fact, it has been a long-standing practice of BLM to use both fertility controls (including injecting immunocontraceptives into mares) and the skewing of the stallion-to-mare ration to achieve a specific wild horse population sex ratio since at least 1992, and the comments on the preliminary gather plan and FOA's arguments to the contrary do not indicate that these practices are \"highly controversial.\" Further, at least one sister court of this district has held that use of fertility controls was not \"highly controversial\" back in 2011, and thus, did not require an EIS as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cloud Foundation v. BLM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160738\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/802/1192/\">\n    802 F.Supp.2d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Nev. 2011). Moreover, FOA has not presented any evidence that \"casts serious doubt\" upon the reasonableness of BLM's conclusions, and thus the court finds that the effects of those actions were not highly controversial at the time\n   BLM issued the FONSI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Locke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053051\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/1040/#p1047\">\n    626 F.3d at 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Similarly, the record does not establish any substantial dispute or high uncertainty over the management effects of releasing geldings into the complexes that would require an EIS. Gelding horses is hardly a new process and is a common surgical procedure used by BLM. (AR at 24) (\"BLM routinely gelds all excess male horses that are captured and removed from the range prior to their adoption, sale, or shipment to off-range holding facilities.\"). And although there is some uncertainty about gelding behavior in the wild compared to gelding behavior as adopted horses, that uncertainty alone does not warrant an EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kempthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495765\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/701/#p712\">\n    588 F.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, in contrast to FOA's argument, defendants detailed the possible effects and impacts of releasing gelded stallions back into the complexes. (AR at 25) (\"Management of a gelding population would allow management at mid-AML, instead of gathering and removing excess animals at low AML\"), (AR at 152) (noting that \"castration is thought to increase survival as males are released from the cost or reproduction;\" and that \"there is absolutely no evidence based on available research or observation that would suggest that a gelded wild horse would have its movements hindered or would become docile or obedient simply as a result of castration.\"). In fact, defendants spent fourteen pages of the 2017 Gather Plan addressing the effects of releasing geldings back into the wild. (AR at 141-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Third, FOA argues that defendants' decision to remove 95 percent of wild horses from the public lands will substantially destroy a historic and cultural resource. This argument is also without merit. FOA's allegations that the proposed action may have a significant impact on cultural and historical resources, specifically wild horses, is unsupported and contrary to NEPA. In fact, the WHBA does not describe or define wild horses as cultural resources, and defendants' similar statement in the 2017 Gather Plan was not in error. (AR at 310-11) (\"Research regarding the wild horse as part of the historic cultural landscape revealed that wild horses are not discussed in historic and pioneer journals, indicating their presence and impact on the [historic] environment ... was minimal, if present at all.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Fourth, FOA argues that the nearly 5,000 public comments that BLM received on the preliminary gather plan indicates that the plan is highly controversial and that an EIS was required. But the fact that BLM received 4,490 comments during the public notice and comment period does not make the action \"significant.\" Notably, 97 percent of the comments received were form letters generally opposing the plan. Moreover, the number of total public comments is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280369\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/1233/#p1240\">\n    428 F.3d 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1240 (9th Cir. 2005) (stating that the mere \"existence of opposition to a proposed agency action does not render that action 'highly controversial.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, FOA claims that the gather will improperly establish a precedent for future actions by encouraging future roundups of this scope and intensity. This argument, however, is foreclosed by Ninth Circuit precedent which holds that EAs are \"highly specific to the project and the locale, thus creating no binding precedent\" for future actions.\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. U.S. Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829198\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1124/#p1140\">\n    655 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1140 (9th Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on all the above, the Court concludes that BLM considered the relevant intensity factors prior to issuing its FONSI and provided a reasonable and convincing statement of reasons explaining why the 2017 Gather Plan's environmental\n   impacts were expected to be insignificant, and that an EIS was not required.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.

Therefore, defendants' decision to not prepare an EIS prior to approval of the 2017 Gather Plan was not arbitrary and capricious.

FOA's first proposed alternative was for BLM to re-evaluate all the AMLs in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes before approving a gather plan and conducting a wild horse gather. In its motion, FOA argues that re-evaluating the AMLs is a reasonable alternative to approved Alternative A of the 2017 Gather Plan. (ECF No. 21). The Court disagrees. Reevaluating and adjusting the AMLs throughout the Antelope and Triple B Complexes is outside the scope of the project's identified purpose and need of reducing wild horse population growth rates. FOA has failed to provide any support to show how a reevaluation and adjustment in AMLs would reduce the wild horse populations on the Antelope and Triple B Complexes or in any way promote the health of existing wild horse populations. As such, BLM was not required to address this alternative as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Headwaters, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539768\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/914/1174/#p1180\">\n    914 F.2d at 1180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth v.

But BLM did address this proposal in the 2017 Gather Plan and concluded that \"[m]onitoring data collected within the Complexes does not indicate that an increase in AML is warranted at this time,\" and in fact \"confirms the need to remove excess wild horses.\" (AR at 34). Thus, despite not being required to even address this public comment and proposed alternative, defendants considered this alternative, but reasonably eliminated it from analysis as a viable alternative to Alternative A of the 2017 Gather Plan because it was contrary to the principles of the WHBA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   FOA's second proposed alternative was for BLM to manage the excess wild horse population in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes through natural means by protecting the wild horses' natural predators. (ECF No. 21). BLM also reasonably eliminated this proposal from further consideration as it clearly did not meet the purpose and need of the 2017 Gather Plan. In the 2017 Gather Plan, defendants concluded that wild horses in these complexes are not adequately regulated by predators, have high foal survival rates, and \"do not self-regulate their population growth rate.\" (AR at 35). Defendants then concluded that management by natural means was not a reasonable alternative because it had not been feasible in the past as the major predators did not exist in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes and the alternative would result in less forage, poorer body condition, and decreased survival of wild horses. (AR at 35-6) (finding that \"[t]his alternative would result in a steady increase in the wild horse populations which would continue to exceed the carrying capacity of the range resulting in a catastrophic mortality of wild horses in the complexes, and irreparable damage to rangeland resources.\"). Moreover, FOA's proposed alternative is contrary to BLM management objectives and various statutory and regulatory mandates because the WHBA requires BLM to prevent range deterioration and manage wild horses as \"healthy animals.\" As FOA's proposed alternative of protecting predators would not have met the purpose and need identified in the 2017 Gather Plan, the Court finds that defendants properly considered and eliminated it from consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   FOA's third and final proposed alternative was for BLM to reduce the number of cattle and sheep allowed to graze in the Antelope and Triple B Complexes to improve the range conditions. The Court likewise finds that defendants' elimination of this proposed alternative was not arbitrary and capricious. In the 2017 Gather Plan, defendants explained that this alternative would simply exchange a limited amount of\n   current forage used by livestock for use by wild horses, which would not meet the purpose and need of the project to reduce wild horse growth rates; moreover, the proposed alternative would not conform to existing land use plans. (AR 34-5). Further, FOA's livestock alternative was outside the scope of the BLM's authority to manage wild horse populations under the WHBA because changes to livestock grazing allotments must be made through a separate process and not through wild horse gathers. Thus, this alternative was properly considered and eliminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Therefore, as addressed above, defendants reasonably addressed and adequately responded to FOA's proposed alternatives and FOA repeatedly ignores evidence in the record showing defendants gave due consideration to its proposed alternatives, even though the alternatives were outside the purpose and need of the 2017 Gather Plan. Accordingly, the court shall deny FOA's motion for summary judgment and grant defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment as to FOA's fourth cause of action for violation of NEPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Violation of NEPA - Hard Look (Claim 5)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   FOA's last cause of action alleges that defendants failed to take a \"hard look\" at the environmental impact of the approved 2017 Gather Plan as required by NEPA. (ECF No. 1). Specifically, FOA argues that defendants failed to take a hard look at the impact that releasing gelded/castrated wild horses will have on the behavior and physiology of wild horses, specific herd dynamics, and the genetic diversity of the herds. Further, FOA contends that members of the public and wild horse advocacy organizations submitted comments to defendants in response to the preliminary gather plan detailing multiple concerns from wild horse experts that castrating wild horses will have a significant impact on wild horses and strip them of their free-roaming behaviors. Finally, FOA contends that removing 95 percent of the wild horses from the Antelope and Triple B Complexes will have an adverse impact on the genetic diversity of the horses and that defendants did not appropriately address this significant issue. Thus, FOA argues that defendants violated NEPA by failing to appropriately address these issues or examine FOA's presented information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court has reviewed the documents and pleadings on file in this matter and finds that defendants did take the appropriate \"hard look\" at the impacts of the proposed gather plan to comply with NEPA. Initially, the Court notes that this challenge raises several of the same issues addressed in FOA's third cause of action for a violation of NEPA as it relates to the release of gelded wild horses back into the Antelope and Triple B Complexes. The Court's finding as to that claim are equally applicable to this claim, so the Court will not repeat its findings and conclusions here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds that BLM sufficiently analyzed possible effects and impacts to geldings based on currently available studies. BLM provided thorough and reasoned explanations, throughout the record, addressing the impact of the proposed action's gelding component based on current studies. (AR at 141-54). And as addressed above, BLM is not required to recite its assessment, consideration, and response to every comment on a EA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280369\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/1233/#p1240\">\n    428 F.3d at 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to FOA's allegation, the mere possibility of unknown effects by a proposed action does not render defendants' ultimate conclusion approving that action arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kempthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495765\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/701/#p712\">\n    588 F.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the fact that there are no field studies of gelded wild horse being returned to the range in the West is\n   not a reason to discount the informed opinion of those with extensive background on wild horses.\n   <em>\n    N. Plains Res. Council, Inc. v. Surface Transp. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049141\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1067/#p1075\">\n    668 F.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075 (9th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that \"in reviewing scientific judgments and technical analyses within the agency's expertise,\" the court is generally \"at its most deferential.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court further finds that defendants complied with NEPA by taking a hard look at the characteristics of the geographic area, impact of returning geldings to the range, and genetic impacts of the wild horse gather. FOA may subjectively believe that defendants' chosen outcome harms wild horse populations, but FOA's subjective belief does not constituted a NEPA violation. More importantly, FOA ignores the legal obligation that public ranges be managed for multiple uses, \"not merely for the maximum protection of wild horses,\" and thus, some removal of wild horses and associated population controls is necessary to protect the livelihood of the herd.\n   <em>\n    Am. Horse Prot.

Allen Rutberg, Bruce Nock, Jay Kirkpatrick, and Anne Perkins in approving the 2017 Gather Plan. The administrative record, however, establishes that defendants specifically considered and responded to comments from these alleged wild horse experts, noting that their opinions were speculative and not based on the commenter's own research. (AR at 288, 302-3). Further, BLM stated that the \"opinions about behavioral effects of gelding by Drs. Rutberg, Nock, or Kirkpatrick are speculative, given that none of them has conducted a study on topic.\" (AR at 288). Moreover, the existence of differing opinions on the environmental impacts does not invalidate BLM's expertise and conclusions, which are supported by the Final EA's review of the existing literature on the effects of geldings, and they are entitled to deference by the Court.\n   <em>\n    N. Plains Res. Council, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049141\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/1067/#p1075\">\n    668 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Similarly, as to FOA's claim that defendants failed to take a hard look at the genetic diversity of the horses, including unique herd characteristics, the Court finds that defendants also appropriately addressed this issue in the 2017 Gather Plan. Initially, the Court recognizes that the Antelope and Triple B Complexes are governed as meta-populations meaning that wild horses interchange throughout the HMAs. (AR at 14161). This factor helps increase genetic diversity even in the face of overall lower wild horse populations. FOA completely neglects this fact in its argument, instead choosing to criticize defendants for removing horses from specific herd families. Moreover, the administrative record directly refutes FOA's claim that the proposed action will critically destroy the genetic health of the herds. The 2017 Gather Plan specifically analyzes and discusses the genetic health and potential impacts of approve gather on future wild horse populations. (AR at 146, 177). Moreover, no genetic report that defendants consulted concluded that genetic variability was at risk under the governing AML range for each HMA. Finally, the approved plan provides for and includes ongoing monitoring and other efforts to ensure that genetic diversity remains in the complexes. (AR at 29) (stating that genetic health and herd characteristic date will continue to be monitored for the duration of the gather plan). Thus, the Court finds that defendants conclusion that the proposed action is not expected to affect the genetic health because \"[a]vailable indications are that these populations contain high levels of genetic diversity at this time\" and are likely to maintain that diversity\n   is not arbitrary and capricious. (AR at 153). Accordingly, the Court shall deny FOA's motion for summary judgment and grant defendants' cross-motion on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 21) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 27) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk of court shall enter judgment in favor of defendants the United States Bureau of Land Management and Jill Silvey and against plaintiff Friends of Animals in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Friends of Animals is a non-profit international advocacy organization that, through its Wildlife Law Program, advocates on behalf of wildlife in the United States legal system.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendant Silvey is the manager for the Elko District of the BLM.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The companion case,\n    <em>\n     American Wild Horse Campaign v.

Additionally, although the plaintiffs in both cases contest the same action, the administrative records are different.
