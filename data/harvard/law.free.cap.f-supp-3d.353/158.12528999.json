BESOSA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant Nelson Pereira (\"Pereira\") moves to compel the production of \"specific information, and/or documentation\" from the New Jersey Ports Authority and American Airlines for the second time. (Docket No. 2273.) Pereira also moves to compel the production of \"specific documentation, and/or records\" from the New Jersey Department of Corrections, Jersey City State College, and Air Transport Local 51 for the second time. (Docket No. 2274.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although the motions do not specifically mention Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17 (\" Rule 17\"), it is obvious that the motions to compel discovery have been filed pursuant to Rule 17. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Pereira's duplicative motions to compel. (Docket Nos. 2273 and 2274.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pereira's motions to compel constitute attempts to obtain discovery. In January 2018, Pereira moved for additional discovery pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 (\" Rule 16\"). (Docket No. 2162.) The Court denied Pereira's request, finding that: 1) \"[t]he Court ha[d] already ordered the government to produce all\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   material,\" that 2) \"the government agree[d] to provide any further material, should it become aware of new information,\" and that 3) \"[t]he [g]overnment deals with its case the way it wants to deal with its case\" and \"[i]f there is no corroboration, that's to Pereira's benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525381\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/312/262/#p274\">\n    312 F.Supp.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (D.P.R. 2018) (Besosa, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2018, Pereira moved to compel additional discovery through subpoenas issued pursuant to Rule 17. (Docket Nos. 2264 and 2265.) The Court denied Pereira's motions, holding that Rule 17 is an improper vehicle for discovery requests. (Docket No. 2268 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, Pereira again moves to compel discovery. (Docket Nos. 2273 and 2274.) Pereira explains,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Orders to obtain records, and/or documentation requested herein will serve to prepare for the retrial of the case, adequate presentation of defense, cross examination of Government's witnesses, and/or corroboration of essential information about Mr. Nelson Pereira.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Docket No. 2274 at p. 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 2273 at p. 4.) According to Pereira, he has \"identified particular persons related to [ ] Pereira, Newark Liberty International Airport, and/or American Airlines,\" and he \"will be requesting subpoenas for those particular persons, but it is necessary to obtain all documentation, and/or identity of the custodian of those records for adequate presentation of the trial.\" (Docket No. 2273 at p. 8; Docket No. 2274 at pp. 4-5.) Because Pereira misconstrues Rule 17, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   his motions to compel. (Docket Nos. 2273 and 2274.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Docket Nos. 2273 and 2274.) According to Pereira, \"it is necessary to obtain all pertinent documentation, rules, regulations, photographs, diagrams, and/or inspect and photograph relevant areas at Newark Liberty Airport, and American Airlines terminal at Newark Liberty Airport.\" (Docket No. 2273 at pp. 8-9.) Pereira's motions reflect discovery requests. Indeed, Pereira refers to his desired information as, \"discovery,\" and, \"the discovery requested.\" (Docket No. 2273 at pp. 11-12; Docket No. 2274 at p. 9.) The subpoenas requested by Pereira are for investigative purposes. They are \"fishing expeditions\" designed to assist Pereira in forging a defense against the allegations set forth in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 2273 at p. 4; Docket No. 2274 at p. 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowman Dairy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148220\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/214/#p221\">\n    341 U.S. at 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1148220\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/341/214/#p221\">\n    71 S.Ct. 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rule 17 is not a discovery device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
