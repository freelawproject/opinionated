Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Alissa Juech has been deaf since birth and communicates primarily through American Sign Language (ASL). (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 1.) On the morning of February 5, 2015, Juech took her approximately 3-month-old son, B.J., to the emergency department of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 35.) Juech's mother arrived at the hospital at roughly the same time, and Juech asked her to request the hospital provide her with a sign language interpreter. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 36.) Juech had been to Children's Hospital roughly 10 times before and had requested a sign language interpreter on each of those prior visits. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is Children's Hospital's policy to provide interpreters upon request, and it informs patients and families of the availability of interpreters. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, 21.) It is the hospital's policy to obtain an in-person interpreter if one is available. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 13.) If an in-person interpreter is not available, the hospital will provide a sign-language interpreter through video remote interpreting (VRI). (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Children's Hospital initially used VRI-essentially a live web cam-to communicate with Juech and to obtain B.J.'s medical history and chief complaints. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 39.) According to Juech, hospital staff did not know how to set up or use the VRI. (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 120.) According to Juech, \"[t]he VRI device was rarely utilized during B.J.'s treatment because Children's Hospital staff did not know how to set it up or use it.\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 121.) She alleges that \"[t]he VRI device took several minutes to start up ... [and] froze constantly.\" (ECF No. 510, \u00b6 121.) In one instance, Juech used the VRI device while breastfeeding her child, a task she found \"exceedingly difficult ... because she was forced to stand in order to see the machine and sign at the same time, all while holding her child.\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 127.) The hospital then used an in-person interpreter while B.J. continued to be treated in the emergency department; this interpreter also provided services after B.J. was moved to a nursing floor. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 43.) Hospital staff informed Juech that B.J. may have a respiratory virus and that he should stay overnight for observation. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Later that evening Juech's husband arrived at the hospital and the Jueches were informed that B.J. would be moved to the pediatric intensive care unit. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 50.) This discussion occurred with Juech using an interpreter through VRI, and her husband does not recall the VRI posing any difficulties or Juech having any questions or concerns that were left unresolved. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At other points during B.J.'s hospitalization Juech communicated with medical providers in writing-for example, by way of messages typed on a phone and then shown to the recipient, or by handwritten notes. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 68-71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   An in-person sign language interpreter was present when B.J. was discharged from the hospital on February 7, 2015. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two years later, in February of 2017, Juech returned to Children's Hospital with her four-month-old daughter, A.J. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 76.) The hospital provided her with an interpreter through VRI. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 78.) Hospital staff obtained A.J.'s medical history from Juech, although Juech does not recall if it was done using the VRI. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6\u00b6 79-83.) A physician later obtained A.J.'s medical history from Juech by way of the VRI. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 92.) Although Juech does not recall how it was communicated to her, she understood that A.J. would be admitted to the hospital for observation. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 88.) Juech requested an in-person interpreter for the following day (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 88), stating that the VRI does not work for her (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 94) and that she preferred in-person interpreters for questions, rounds, and especially discharge instructions (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 96). An in-person interpreter was provided at A.J.'s discharge. (ECF No. 46, \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Juech brought this action alleging that Children's Hospital and Health System, Inc. and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Inc. (collectively, \"defendants\" or \"Children's Hospital\") violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation\n   Act of 1973 (RA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20106.52\">\n    Wis.

It tends to focus on the ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims and refers to them interchangeably. It argues that Juech must choose only one of her claims because they are all duplicative. (ECF No. 38 at 19-20.) And it is true that, because the elements of a claim under the ADA and under the Rehabilitation Act are largely coextensive (with the exception of the additional element of receipt of federal funds under the Rehabilitation Act, which no one disputes is satisfied here), the\n   Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has said that a court would not err in dismissing one of the two claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jaros v.

At first blush, it would appear disputes of material fact clearly preclude summary judgment. After all, Juech disputes nearly all of Children's Hospital's proposed findings of fact. But her disputes are generally based upon empty rote objections, such as that the proposed fact is \"immaterial, vague, and misleading.\" As to her own proposed facts, they are often derived from her own deposition testimony, which itself is often inconsistent, marked by significant gaps in her memory, and sometimes not based upon personal knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Although Juech is, at times, arguably hyperbolic in her testimony regarding the extent of the problems, the court accepts that a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that it sometimes took \"several minutes\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 121)-\"probably five minutes\" (ECF No. 47-1 at 13)-for hospital staff to connect the VRI, and that the VRI would freeze and pixilate (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 121).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Notwithstanding Juech's preference for and expectation that Children's Hospital provide her with an in-person interpreter at all times, it was not required to do so as long as it could provide effective alternative means of communicating with her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    Silva v.

Technology is imperfect, and the Department of Justice undoubtedly appreciated as much when it adopted the relevant regulations approving VRI as a means for providing a qualified interpreter. Delays and difficulties in initiating the VRI do not necessarily amount to discrimination. In approving the use of friends or family to facilitate communication under certain circumstances when an interpreter is not available, the Department of Justice's regulations implicitly acknowledge that an interpreter might not be immediately available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3), (4). Given that it could be expected that it might take some time for an interpreter to arrive at the location where her services are needed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-2 at 19 (Juech's testimony discussing the need to schedule interpreters a month or two weeks in advance because \"it takes a while to set up interpreters\" and \"It's too hard to get an interpreter at the last minute\"), a delay in obtaining and starting up the VRI does not necessarily constitute discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nor does a finding of discrimination necessarily follow simply from the fact that a hospital tries to use an auxiliary aid that proves ineffective. For example, a hospital may attempt to communicate through written notes only to find that the issue being discussed is too complex for written notes. That does not, in hindsight, render the attempt discriminatory. Only if the hospital failed to provide an alternative auxiliary aid once it became clear that the initial method of communication was ineffective might there be a claim for discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On the other side, the court rejects Children's Hospital's argument that the fact that hospital staff were able to obtain relevant medical information from Juech demonstrates that the hospital was able to effectively communicate with her. Effective communication is a two-way exchange. That hospital personnel were able to get the information they needed from Juech does not establish that Juech was able to get the information she needed from them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nor does the court find that Juech is required to identify \"medically relevant information\" that was not effectively communicated. Children's Hospital's reliance on \"medically relevant information\" comes from\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/#p836\">\n    856 F.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the court held that \"the relevant inquiry is whether the hospitals' failure to offer an appropriate auxiliary aid impaired the patient's ability to exchange medically relevant information with hospital staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Children's Hospital reads\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   as limiting the scope of the ADA to the exchange of \"medically relevant information,\" but the ADA is broader than that. In fact, rather than limiting the scope of the ADA, the court in\n   <em>\n    Silva\n   </em>\n   was clarifying that the district court's overly narrow view of the ADA was improper. Specifically, the court took issue with the district court's conclusion that summary judgment was appropriate because the plaintiffs were able to\n   \"convey the primary symptoms, a treatment plan, and discharge instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/#p836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/#p836\">\n    at 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concluded that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act afforded greater protection than that. It concluded that disabled persons are entitled to exchange all \"medically relevant information\" and not merely information about \"primary symptoms, treatment plan, and discharge instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/#p836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276891\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/824/#p836\">\n    at 835-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ultimately, the court's focus at the summary judgment stage is whether evidence exists from which a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Juech was denied the use of auxiliary aids necessary for effective communication. Rather than offering specific examples of instances where a particular problem with an auxiliary aid resulted in an inability to effectively communicate with hospital staff, Juech tends to offer vague and sweeping allegations. For example, she alleges broadly that she \"had little to no understanding of her son's medical condition, the tests he underwent and the medication he received, or the instructions for his follow-up care\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 135), and that \"[i]n most instances, Alissa Jeuch was unable to engage in effective communication without the aid of a qualified ASL interpreter\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 136).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The only specific instance Juech has identified in her proposed findings of fact where she alleges the absence of an adequate auxiliary aid resulted in a lack of communication is the following: \"At one point during B.J.'s medical treatment, a nurse administered an IV to B.J. without explaining its nature or purpose to Alissa Juech, who was forced to attempt to ask the nurse about the procedure afterwards using pen and paper; consequently, Alissa Juech was unable to give informed consent for that treatment.\" (ECF No. 51, \u00b6 134.) In support of this proposed fact Juech cites to the following colloquy from her deposition: \"Q: And I just want to be clear. You have no criticisms as to the medical care? A: I said no, they did a wonderful job caring for him, but I'm complaining about the nurse coming in, doing the IV, not communicating until after it happened, plus the interpreter issue and those problems. That's what I'm complaining about.\" (ECF No. 47-1 at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The proposed finding of fact misstates the evidence insofar as it suggests that a nurse placed an intravenous line without telling Juech what she was doing. Her complaint was not with the IV line being placed without explanation to her. Rather, her complaint relates to an incident in the pediatric intensive care unit \"on the last day\" when a nurse came in to B.J.'s room and began doing something with the IV line. Juech used a pen and paper to ask the nurse what she was doing. (ECF No. 47-1 at 16.) According to Juech, the nurse wrote back, \"Just cleaning it out, so that they could pull out the IV.\" (ECF No. 47-1 at 16.) In her deposition Juech elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [A] I never said the staff didn't really take care of my son well. I thought they did really good. I was happy with the staff. But my complaint was about one nurse also that came in to clean the IV area and didn't communicate with me. And I was like: Whoa, what's going on here. And so, you know, I have a complaint about that, you know, but I have the right to know about what's going on before they do the IV or remove it, because there could have been allergies or whatever. Well, let's say in some situation I may not approve it, so I'm his mother and I should have been able to approve that before they started such a thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q And that was when the nurse withdrew the IV?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A Yes. And then inserted something to clean and then took it out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (ECF No. 47-1 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although a strong argument can be made that the use of written notes to explain what the nurse was doing was an appropriate aid in this context, the court finds that is not a question it can appropriately resolve at summary judgment. That is, the court cannot conclude as a matter of law that using notes in this context was an appropriate auxiliary aid and that the failure to provide a different auxiliary aid, such as an in-person interpreter, did not discriminate against Juech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The court also finds that, if a place of public accommodation provides a VRI that consistently results in \"lags, choppy, blurry, or grainy images, or irregular pauses in communication,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2), at some point it is no longer an isolated technical glitch but instead amounts to discrimination if it results in ineffective communication. Otherwise, the Department of Justice's requirements for VRI,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2036.303\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 36.303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), would be meaningless. Certainly, not every isolated failure of the VRI violates the ADA. But consistent and persistent problems could lead a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that the VRI denied Juech effective communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   By analogy, a telephone call might break-up temporarily, requiring a caller to repeat himself. Such hiccups do not materially impact the parties' ability to speak with each other. But at some point such problems can become so frustrating that the parties to the call would rather just hang up and talk later or communicate through email rather than carry on given the problems. If the problems Juech encountered with the VRI were of the latter degree-repeated and constant-it is plausible that Children's Hospital violated the ADA by refusing to provide her with an in-person interpreter. It is up to the finder of fact to determine whether the problems Juech allegedly encountered were sufficiently severe so as to render the VRI an ineffective means of communication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    4.3.

(ECF No. 45 at 25-26.) According to Juech, because the problems with the VRI were persistent, it would have been apparent to hospital staff that the VRI was ineffective. Thus, she argues, the fact that hospital staff still failed to provide an in-person interpreter despite these problems could lead a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent. (ECF No. 45 at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   However, at her deposition she testified that the hospital staff tried to work with her to find solutions to any problems she was having communicating with them. Asked if she believed Children's Hospital intentionally discriminated against her because she was deaf, Juech responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   I would not say the staff, because they did try to help me find things that would, you know, benefit me for communication. But I do believe that the administration is discriminating because they told me -- the staff did tell me that administrative [sic] did not want to pay for a live interpreter, and that's wrong.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (ECF No. 47-1 at 19.) Thus, she blamed the hospital administration, not the staff, for her communication problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   But her assertion that hospital administration \"did not want to pay for a live interpreter\" appears to be based entirely on impermissible hearsay. She recounts: \"I asked for a live in-person interpreter and they brought the VRI and I said please bring in a live interpreter again, and they said that the hospital will not be paying for a live interpreter, so that I had to use the VRI, and I was continuously fighting for that, that an interpreter in person would be there.\" (ECF No. 47-1 at 11.) Asked how she knew this, she explained, \"The nursing staff told my mother, and my mom interpreted to me and let me know that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (ECF No. 47-1 at 11.) Although Juech characterizes her mother as interpreting what the nursing staff said, she acknowledges that the statement was made to her mother, not to her. But the court was not presented with any testimony from Juech or her mother as to whether her mother was actually interpreting-that is, relating verbatim something medical staff told Juech (which would not be hearsay)-or simply relaying to Juech what she heard, perhaps with her own inferences and characterizations, which would make the statement hearsay. And the fact that Juech's mother is not fluent in sign language (ECF No. 47-1 at 18) certainly makes it less likely that the information Juech got from her mother was as a result of verbatim translation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But even if hospital administrators did require the use of the VRI over an in-person interpreter, that by itself would not constitute deliberate indifference. Only if the hospital administrators were aware of the alleged problems with the VRI but demanded its use anyway could a reasonable finder of fact conclude that the defendants were deliberately indifferent. Juech has not presented evidence to support such a conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   At best, the evidence might support the conclusion that individual staff members encountered problems. But there is no evidence that would allow a reasonable finder of fact to conclude that the staff members regarded the problems as anything other than isolated incidents.

She testified that she lives in Cudahy, Wisconsin. (ECF No. 47-1 at 9.) There are roughly a half-dozen hospitals closer to her home than Children's Hospital. And Juech has taken her children to other hospitals. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 48-2 at 7, 8-9.) But, of course, Children's Hospital is the hospital in the area that specializes in the care of children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As for the fact that her pediatrician refers her to Children's Hospital, it is unclear if Juech is describing Children's Hospital in the broad sense, which would encompass its clinics and specialists, or if she is referring to the emergency department specifically. As the defendants note, the discrimination she allegedly suffered occurred only during her visits to the emergency department and during the related admission of her children to the hospital. At her deposition she testified that when she attended pre-scheduled appointments at Children's Hospital she did not encounter any alleged discrimination. (ECF No. 47-1 at 19). (It is true that, in a second deposition two years later, Juech testified that she believed Children's Hospital\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   discriminate against her on other occasions by providing her VRI instead of an in-person interpreter, but she could not remember any instance (ECF No. 47-2 at 22).) Consequently, the court agrees with the defendants that the relevant inquiry is not Juech's likelihood of returning to any Children's Hospital facility, but the likelihood that she will return to the emergency department or have a child admitted to Children's Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   One way to demonstrate the likelihood of returning to a defendant hospital is through an established pattern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sunderland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12402387\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/686/807/#p815\">\n    686 F.

There is no evidence that Juech has any specific plans to return to Children's Hospital's emergency department or to have a child admitted to the hospital, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Scherr v. Marriott Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870254\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1069/#p1074\">\n    703 F.3d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1074-75 (7th Cir. 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Scherr\n   </em>\n   , because the plaintiff had many family members residing near the defendant hotel, she was likely to return to the area to visit them (and would need to stay in a hotel). In fact, she pointed specifically to an upcoming family wedding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870254\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1069/#p1074\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870254\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1069/#p1074\">\n    at 1074-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In contrast, Juech does not point to any upcoming event that creates a concrete and particularized likelihood that her return\n   to Children's emergency department, or that a need for one of her children to be hospitalized there, is actual and imminent. Juech offers only the barest speculation that she will have such a need. Such speculation is insufficient to convey standing. Therefore, Children's Hospital is entitled to summary judgment with respect to this aspect of its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   A reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Juech was subject to discrimination under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. However, no reasonable finder of fact could find that this alleged discrimination was the result of deliberate indifference. Therefore, Juech's Rehabilitation Act claim fails. Although Juech argues that she may still pursue nominal damages, she offers no relevant authority for that proposition. Instead, she cites only\n   <em>\n    Farrar v. Hobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/\">\n    506 U.S. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/\">\n    121 L.Ed.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), which held that a plaintiff who obtains only nominal damages in a suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985 is a prevailing party under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925002\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/103/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It made no reference to the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Juech's claim under Title III of the ADA also fails because she has failed to demonstrate that she has standing to pursue injunctive relief. The mere possibility that one of her children will at some point in the future need emergency care or hospitalization, and that Juech will seek that care at Children's Hospital rather than at any of the other hospitals closer to her home, does not constitute a sufficiently real and immediate threat of future injury to establish standing to seek injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The parties do not specifically address Juech's claim under the ACA. But because it derives from the Rehabilitation Act, Juech's ACA claim must fail for the same reasons as her Rehabilitation Act claim does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   That leaves only Juech's state law claim, which, again, the parties do not specifically address other than with respect to the question of punitive damages. Having dismissed all of the federal claims over which the court has jurisdiction, the court declines to exercise jurisdiction over her remaining state law claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    O'Neill v.
