Osuch, Energy ESC, LLC, Jonathan Casiano, and Bright Solutions, LLC, (collectively, \"plaintiffs\"), filed this action against the Governor, Treasurer, and Comptroller of the State of Connecticut (collectively, \"defendants\") in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Doc.

The plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Connecticut's\n   Public Act 17-2, as amended by Public Act 18-81 (the \"Act\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Act partially depletes two legislatively created funds: the Energy Conservation and Load Management Fund (the \"C &amp; LM Fund\") and the Clean Energy Fund, both of which are financed by surcharges on the electricity bills of certain Connecticut electricity users, including all of the plaintiffs in this case. Local Rule 56(a)1 Stipulated and Agreed Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"Stip. Facts\") (Doc. No. 26) at \u00b6\u00b6 3-12, 20, 21, 29, 30, 64-86. Specifically, the Act transfers money from the C &amp; LM Fund and the Clean Energy Fund to the state's general purpose fund (the \"General Fund\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-67. The plaintiffs claim that this transfer violates the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

In addition, they assert various claims under Connecticut state law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the court are the parties' Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pls.' Mot.\") (Doc. No. 25); Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Defs.' Mot.\") (Doc. No. 28). The plaintiffs seek summary judgment on their federal constitutional claims and their state law claim of promissory estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. at 1.

Stip. Facts at \u00b6 17. The EDCs serve approximately 1.5 million residential and business customers in Connecticut, while the Municipal Utilities serve roughly 125,000 customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Pursuant to section 16-2 of the Connecticut General Statutes, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (\"PURA\") regulates the rates and services of the EDCs, but not those of the Municipal Utilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Specifically, each EDC operates pursuant to a tariff that is approved by PURA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. The tariffs set forth the rate schedules, terms of service, rules and regulations of service, and standard template agreements that the EDCs use in operating their electric distribution systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. The tariffs may be revised, amended, supplemented, or changed by PURA, either upon accepting a filing by the EDCs or upon PURA's direction to the EDCs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. PURA typically approves new tariffs for the EDCs four times each year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1998, the Connecticut General Assembly (the \"General Assembly\") passed legislation creating the two funds at issue in this case: (1) the Energy Conservation and Load Management Fund (the \"C &amp; LM Fund\"), which is codified at section 16-245m of the Connecticut General Statutes ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   and (2) the Clean Energy Fund, which is codified at section 16-245n of the Connecticut General Statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22, 29.

Indeed, these provisions make clear that state government entities have full discretion over the use and disbursement of these Funds, not Connecticut ratepayers or the EDCs. Section 16-245m(d)(1), for example, gives the Commissioner final authority to \"approve, modify, or reject\" any Plan for spending money in the C &amp; LM Fund. Likewise, disbursements from the Clean Energy Fund may only be made \"[u]pon the authorization of the Connecticut Green Bank\" and \"in accordance with a comprehensive plan developed by [the Green Bank] to foster the growth, development and commercialization of clean energy sources[.]\" Conn.
