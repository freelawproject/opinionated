Schiltz, United States District Judge\n   Defendant/counter-claimant Amit Sela was insured under a homeowner's policy issued by plaintiff/counter-defendant Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina (\"Selective\"). In June 2015, Sela's property was damaged by a hailstorm, and Sela sought to be indemnified by Selective. After an investigation, Selective denied Sela's claim on grounds of fraud. Specifically, Selective found that Sela had lied when he claimed that certain property had been damaged only by the June 2015 hailstorm when, in fact, that property had also been damaged by an earlier hailstorm-a hailstorm that had occurred before Sela was insured by Selective. After Sela contested Selective's findings, Selective brought this action, seeking a declaration that it is not liable to Sela. Sela filed an answer and a counterclaim, seeking indemnification for his losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sela has now moved for leave to amend his counterclaim to add a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20604.18\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 604.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 604.18\") for bad-faith denial of insurance benefits. That statute forbids the insured from making a bad-faith claim in his initial pleading, but instead requires the insured to later move for leave to amend his pleading to add a bad-faith claim. The insured's motion must be accompanied by one or more affidavits establishing the factual basis for the bad-faith claim, and the insurer may submit affidavits in opposition to the motion. A court may not grant the motion unless the court finds, on the basis of the affidavits, that the insured has established a prima facie case of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 604.18, subd. 4(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sela's motion for leave to amend raises two difficult questions: First, in deciding whether Sela should be given leave to amend his counterclaim to add a bad-faith claim, should this Court apply \u00a7 604.18, or should this Court instead apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (which do not impose the pleading barriers found in \u00a7 604.18 )? And second, should Sela's motion for leave to amend be granted?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In an April 26, 2018 order, Magistrate Judge Steven E. Rau found that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 604.18 do not govern in federal court-and, applying the far less demanding requirements of the Federal Rules, Judge Rau found that Sela's motion for leave to amend should be granted. Selective now objects to both of Judge Rau's conclusions. Specifically, Selective argues that Judge Rau should have applied \u00a7 604.18-and that, under either \u00a7 604.18 or the Federal Rules, Sela should not have been given leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The standard by which this Court should review Judge Rau's order is unclear. A motion for leave to amend a pleading is a nondispositive motion, and typically, a magistrate judge's ruling on a nondispositive motion will be reversed only if it is \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a). But district judges in this District have held that, when a magistrate judge denies leave to amend a pleading because the proposed amendment would be futile, the magistrate judge's ruling is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magee v. Trs. of Hamline Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828763\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/1047/#p1062\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062 (D. Minn. 2013). The basis for this exception is not entirely clear, however, and thus it is difficult to know whether this exception is also meant to apply to a decision of a magistrate judge to\n   <em>\n    grant\n   </em>\n   leave to amend because the proposed amendment would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be futile. The Court will err on the side of caution and conduct a de novo\n   review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on that de novo review, the Court overrules Selective's objection and grants Sela leave to amend his counterclaim. The Court agrees with Judge Rau that the pleading requirements imposed by \u00a7 604.18 do not apply in federal court. The Court does not agree with the reasons given by Judge Rau for permitting Sela to amend his counterclaim under the Federal Rules. But given the unusual posture of this case, the Court will nevertheless permit Sela to bring his bad-faith claim, and the Court will address any problems with that claim on motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sela owns a large house and other property in Minnetonka, Minnesota. Am. Ans. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sela's property was damaged by a hailstorm in June 2010. Am. Ans. \u00b6 12(a); ECF No. 92-4 at 49. At the time, Sela's property was insured by Lexington Insurance Company (\"Lexington\"). ECF 92-4 at 49-50. Sela filed a claim with Lexington, and Lexington indemnified Sela and his then-wife in the amount of $510,797.23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26-4 at 18-19. Sela used part of the money to repair or replace some-but not all-of the damaged property. Am. Ans. \u00b6 12. Sela apparently pocketed the remaining part of the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sela later switched insurance providers, and from July 2014 to July 2015, Sela was insured under a homeowner's policy issued by Selective. Am. Ans. \u00b6 51; ECF No. 17-1 at 2-3. That policy covered the house, garage, and other structures, as well as personal property. Am. Ans. \u00b6 52; ECF No. 17-1 at 3, 11-14. The policy also contained two provisions that are particularly relevant to Sela's motion for leave to amend his counterclaim:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   First, the Selective policy contained an Anti-Fraud Provision, which essentially eliminates coverage when any insured has engaged in any act of fraud. Specifically, the Anti-Fraud Provision provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   We provide coverage to no \"insureds\" under this policy if, whether before or after a loss, an \"insured\" has:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Made false statements;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   relating to this insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ECF No. 17-1 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Second, the Selective policy contains an Appraisal Provision that applies when the parties agree that a loss is covered, but disagree about the amount that Selective must pay in connection with the loss. ECF No. 17-1 at 24. The Appraisal Provision provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent and impartial\n   appraiser within 20 days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire .... The appraisers will separately set the amount of loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ECF No. 17-1 at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Minnetonka was hit with another hailstorm, and once again Sela's property was damaged. Am. Ans. \u00b6 53; ECF No. 73-5 at 3. Sela submitted a claim to Selective on July 8, 2015. Am. Ans. \u00b6 55; ECF No. 73-5 at 3. In response, Selective promptly sent an independent claims adjuster to inspect the damage. ECF No. 73-5 at 3, 6-7. The adjuster spoke with Sela, took dozens of photos, and wrote a report, which he submitted to Selective's staff adjuster, Dave Clark. ECF No. 73-5 at 6-7, 8-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Several days later, Selective received an anonymous letter that accused Sela of submitting a fraudulent insurance claim. The letter also accused Sela of submitting fraudulent insurance claims in the past, and the letter provided information about the claim that Sela had submitted to Lexington following the 2010 hailstorm. ECF No. 26-6 at 3. After receiving the letter, Selective referred the matter to its Special Investigative Unit (\"SIU\"), which began an investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92-2 at 9; ECF No. 92-4 at 2. Charlene Pack (one of Selective's fraud investigators) and Clark (the staff adjuster) spoke about Sela's claim and determined they needed more information from Sela and Lexington before they could make a decision about coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92-4 at 16. Clark then personally inspected Sela's property on August 5, 2015. ECF No. 92-4 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Over the next several months, the SIU continued its fraud investigation and continued gathering information from and about Sela. ECF No. 92-4 at 21-25. In December 2015, Sela submitted a sworn proof of loss and supporting documentation. ECF No. 92-4 at 30. Sela claimed that he had suffered nearly $750,000 in losses as a result of the hailstorm. ECF No. 16-3 at 5. Selective reviewed the proof of loss and noted that some of the supporting documentation was \"very questionable\" and that the paperwork was missing \"vital information\" needed to resolve the claim. ECF No. 92-4 at 34. In January 2016, Pack and Clark agreed to request an examination of Sela under oath because of uncertainty surrounding Sela's prior hail-damage claim, the SIU's inability to verify what Lexington had paid to Sela, and the lack of confirmation about what Sela repaired or replaced after the 2010 storm. ECF No. 92-4 at 35-36. Selective continued to request (and receive) more information regarding Sela's claim. ECF No. 92-4 at 35-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 4, 2016, Selective notified Sela that it would not accept his proof of loss because Sela had not provided all of the requested documentation. ECF No. 26-2 at 2. Sela disputed that his proof of loss was inadequate. ECF No. 26-2 at 2. While the parties argued about the adequacy of Sela's documentation, Selective took further steps to investigate Sela's claim. In April 2016, Selective examined Sela under oath. ECF No. 92-4 at 58. Selective also retained an independent expert (Collins Ofori-Amanf) to inspect Sela's home and aid in the fraud investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 74-1 at 312-30. Ofori-Amanf inspected Sela's home, conducted an investigation, and described his conclusions in an expert report (the \"Collins Report\"). ECF No. 74-1\n   at 312-30. After reviewing the Collins Report, one of Selective's attorneys (Kristi Brownson) informed Selective's SIU that she believed that \"fraud [was] applicable\" and that Selective was at a \"point to determine if [it] want[s] to deny the whole thing, or pay the minor portion.\" ECF 92-4 at 61. Selective continued to collect information, confer with counsel, and evaluate the Collins Report in light of evidence submitted by Sela.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 92-4 at 61-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 2, 2016, Selective filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration that, under the Anti-Fraud provision of its policy, it had no obligation to indemnify Sela for any losses because he had concealed or misrepresented material facts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. In response to Selective's lawsuit, Sela submitted a written demand for an appraisal of the loss-a demand that Selective rejected. Am. Ans. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Sela also filed an answer and counterclaim, and later moved for leave to amend his counterclaim to add a claim for bad-faith denial of insurance benefits. ECF No. 88 (renewed motion to amend). The Court now turns to that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The initial question is whether Sela's motion for leave to amend his counterclaim is governed by state law (specifically, \u00a7 604.18 ) or federal law (specifically, Rules 8 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ). Judge Rau held that federal law applies. ECF No. 111 at 26-27. Selective disagrees. ECF No. 118 at 1, 6-9. Having carefully reviewed the question, the Court agrees with Judge Rau that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure-and not \u00a7 604.18 -govern Sela's motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As first-year law students are taught-if their Civil Procedure professor is brave enough to cover\n   <em>\n    Erie Railroad Co. v.

Specifically, Selective found that Sela made numerous false or misleading statements about material facts, such as when he said that certain property had not been damaged at all by the June 2010 hailstorm and when he said that other property that had been damaged by the June 2010 hailstorm had been repaired or replaced. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Selective was not required to submit this dispute to a panel of appraisers. The dispute between Selective and Sela is not a dispute over \"the amount of loss,\" such as a dispute over how much it would cost to replace the roof on Sela's home. Rather, the dispute between Selective and Sela is a dispute over whether Selective has any obligation to indemnify Sela\n   <em>\n    regardless\n   </em>\n   of \"the amount of loss.\" This is a coverage dispute-a coverage dispute that turns on whether Sela intentionally made false statements about what was damaged in the June 2010 hailstorm and about what he repaired or replaced after that hailstorm. Resolving this dispute will require determinations about (1) exactly what Sela said to Selective about the damage caused by the June 2010 hailstorm; (2) exactly what Sela said to Selective about Sela's own\n   actions following that hailstorm; (3) whether Sela's statements were false; and (4) whether Sela knew that his statements were false at the time that he made them. These determinations are not within the scope of the Appraisal Provision-and, indeed, are beyond the capabilities of appraisers. An appraiser knows how much it will cost to replace vinyl siding; an appraiser does not know how to resolve a dispute about what Sela told Selective about his actions five years earlier or about what was on Sela's mind when he made that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For these reasons, the Court holds that Judge Rau erred in finding that Sela's allegation that Selective refused to submit the dispute to appraisal stated a plausible bad-faith claim under \u00a7 604.18.

Bad faith does not \"arise simply because the insurer's construction of the policy was subsequently found to be legally incorrect.\"\n   <em>\n    Friedberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155271\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/800/1020/#p1024\">\n    800 F.Supp.2d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, bad faith arises only when the insurer has no \"reasonable basis\" for its construction of the policy. The fact that this Court\n   <em>\n    agrees\n   </em>\n   with Selective's interpretation of the policy is strong evidence that Selective's interpretation was at least reasonable. Nothing in Sela's pleadings suggests that Selective knew (or acted in reckless disregard of the fact) that it was required to submit this dispute to appraisal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   There is yet another problem with finding that Selective's refusal to submit this dispute to appraisal gives Sela a plausible bad-faith claim. Section 604.18 does not provide a cause of action against any insurer who acts unreasonably in any way. Rather, \u00a7 604.18 creates a cause of action against an insurer who acts unreasonably in\n   <em>\n    denying a claim\n   </em>\n   -or, as the statute puts it, in \"denying the benefits of the insurance policy.\" \u00a7 604.18, subd. 2(a).

But that would be unfair\n   to Sela. At the time that he filed his motion for leave to amend, Sela reasonably assumed (based on the case law of this District) that he was proceeding under subdivision 4(a) of \u00a7 604.18. Thus, Sela reasonably assumed that this Court would not be deciding whether his proposed counterclaim pleaded a plausible bad-faith claim, but instead deciding whether his affidavits established \"prima facie evidence in support of the motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Reflecting this understanding, Sela's proposed bad-faith claim is relatively brief and is pleaded in a relatively conclusory fashion. By contrast, the affidavits and other evidence that he submitted are detailed and voluminous. If this Court were to look only at the face of Sela's proposed counterclaim-and not at his affidavits-the Court would find that Sela has not pleaded a plausible bad-faith claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   So what should this Court do?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   On the one hand, it would be unfair to deny Sela leave to amend his counterclaim because of his failure to meet the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard when he could not have anticipated that this Court would be\n   <em>\n    applying\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard. This suggests that the Court should give Sela a chance to move again for leave to amend his counterclaim to add a bad-faith claim. Sela could then attempt to meet the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   by shifting some allegations from his affidavits into his pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   On the other hand, going through another round of briefing about whether Sela should be allowed to amend his counterclaim to add a bad-faith claim seems like a waste of time. This case is two years old. Discovery is over. The parties are ready to move for summary judgment. Given the posture of the case, the Court believes that, rather than continue to litigate over the question of whether Sela can adequately\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   a bad-faith claim (a question that focuses on the face of the pleadings), the Court and the parties should just cut to the chase and address the question of whether Sela can\n   <em>\n    recover\n   </em>\n   on a bad-faith claim (a question that focuses on the evidence).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For that reason, the Court will give Sela leave to file his proposed \"Amended Answer to Second Amended Complaint and Counterclaims\" (ECF No. 68-1). Selective can then move for summary judgment on the bad-faith claim, the Court can review the evidence in the record, and the Court can decide whether a reasonable jury could return a verdict in Sela's favor on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and on all of the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   1.
