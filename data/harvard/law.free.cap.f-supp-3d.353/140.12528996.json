Plaintiff subsequently requested to be discharged and pushed through several hospital employees to leave. Metro Crime Prevention (erroneously identified in Plaintiff's complaint as University of Massachusetts medical Center Patient Recovery Center Security), who had arrived due to Plaintiff's aggressive behavior, told Plaintiff they were \"not going to fight\" him and said, \"if you want to leave just leave.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After Plaintiff left the hospital, he experienced suicidal ideation because he \"was so agitated at police over the video and mistreatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.
