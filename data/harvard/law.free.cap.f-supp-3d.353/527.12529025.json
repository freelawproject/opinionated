At the checkpoint, the officers stopped oncoming vehicles, checked driver's licenses and insurance, and made sure that every\n   occupant of a car was wearing a seatbelt. Over the ensuing eighteen minutes, the officers stopped seven cars at the checkpoint. In order, respectively, the cars were stopped for approximate times of eighty seconds, thirty-seven seconds, thirty-four seconds, four seconds, twelve seconds, forty-five seconds, and eighteen seconds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Initial Stops of the Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At 12:08 a.m. on May 19, a Toyota RAV4 driven by Moline-Borroto, with Burgos-Coronado and Castro-Balza as passengers in the backseat, pulled into the checkpoint. Approximately thirty seconds after the RAV4 entered the checkpoint, a Volkswagen Jetta driven by Pena-Morales, with Vergara-Moran as a passenger, pulled into the checkpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Minga approached the RAV4 and asked Moline-Borroto for a license and proof of insurance. Moline-Borroto provided Minga a temporary Florida driver's license and stated that the vehicle was a rental. After Minga asked Moline-Borroto who the passengers in the rear seat were, Moline-Borroto spoke to the passengers in Spanish and rolled down the rear windows. Burgos-Coronado provided a temporary Florida driver's license and Castro-Balza provided a Venezuelan passport which was missing an entry stamp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bell felt the seating arrangement was a \"little strange\" because, in his experience, \"when there's an open front seat in a vehicle and there's a male passenger in there, usually the other male[ is] sitting up front.\" Bell testified that the seating arrangement, combined with the time of night and the absence of an entry stamp on Castro-Balza's passport, raised a concern that Castro-Balza was a victim of human trafficking or was otherwise being held against her will. At that point, Bell began to question Moline-Borroto about the car's travel plans so he could \"better see what[ was] going on with that situation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Bell testified that he asked Moline-Borroto: (1) where he was coming from and Moline-Borroto responded, \"Mississippi;\" (2) where he began his trip and Moline-Borroto responded, \"Florida;\" (3) to specify which part of Florida he was coming from and Moline-Borroto responded, \"Miami;\" (4) what was his destination and Moline-Borroto responded, \"the hotel;\" (5) what was his final destination and Moline-Borroto responded, \"Memphis;\" and (6) what the occupants of the vehicle were planning to do in Memphis and Moline-Borroto responded that they were going to visit his uncle from Venezuela. At that point, Bell asked Moline-Borroto for his uncle's name; Moline-Borroto paused and answered, \"Jes\u00fas.\" When Bell asked for a last name, Moline-Borroto paused again and provided a single name, which Bell testified he could not remember. Bell then asked, \"what was his mother or father's maiden name?\" After Moline-Borroto \"paused as if he didn't understand,\" Bell asked what his uncle's profession was, to which Moline-Borroto responded that his uncle was a \"business owner.\" Bell then asked for Moline-Borroto's occupation, and Moline-Borroto responded he was in construction. Bell asked how long they were planning on staying in Memphis and Moline-Borroto responded, \"ten to fifteen days.\" Finally, Bell asked Moline-Borroto if he was taking a vacation, and Moline-Borroto responded that he \"just took off.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During Bell's conversation with Moline-Borroto, Jones, who had been listening to the interaction, approached the Jetta. Jones asked Pena-Morales to provide a driver's license and proof of insurance and to state where he was coming from and where he was going. Pena-Morales provided Jones a Venezuelan passport and Vergara-Moran provided a temporary Florida's\n   driver's license. Doc. # 64-1 at 18. Pena-Morales \"was speaking pretty broken English\" but Vergara-Moran was translating for him. As translated by Vergara-Moran, Pena-Morales stated that they were heading to Tupelo, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   During his conversation with Pena-Morales, Jones observed the Jetta had a Florida registration and concluded that \"the dynamics of the vehicle were pretty similar, Venezuelan passport and Florida's driver's license.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Bell then asked Moline-Borroto if he was traveling with anyone. After a brief pause, Moline-Borroto responded that he was traveling with the occupants of the vehicle behind him. Jones and Bell then asked the same question to Pena-Morales, who responded that he and Vergara-Moran were traveling alone. Based on these inconsistent answers, which occurred less than five minutes into the stop of the RAV4, and the fact that Miami and Memphis are both \"source cities,\" Bell suspected the occupants were engaged in narcotics smuggling and asked the cars to pull into the highway's median area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Searches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After the cars pulled over, Bell obtained two consent to search forms from his vehicle. Bell told Moline-Borroto that he was going to request a consent to search and then walked over and provided a form to Pena-Morales. According to a translator at the evidentiary hearing, the consent form, which was in Spanish, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In order to cooperate with the investigation that's being conducted by the Highway Patrol of Mississippi, I _____, give my voluntary consent to highway officer _____ and other people who may assist him in searching the vehicle _____. I am totally aware that this may include all of its contents and/or load in the vehicle, luggage, electronic devices, cavities, and/or modifications that may have been made to the vehicle after market. I understand perfectly that all of this is totally voluntary on my part and that I am giving my consent under no threat, promise, or any act of coercion, either mental or physical, on the part of the highway official. Additionally, I understand that I have the right to reject this voluntary search and/or stop the search at any time that I may wish so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Bell left Minga to attempt to explain the consent form to Pena-Morales. Bell then returned to Moline-Borroto, provided him a consent form, and attempted to explain the form to him in English. Moline-Borroto seemed not to understand Bell's explanation, so Bell used a smartphone translation application to request consent to search. Eventually, Moline-Borroto told Bell he could \"look wherever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pena-Morales signed the consent form but Vergara-Moran filled out the form's vehicle information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Bell, who was also a K-9 Officer, then walked his drug dog, Apollo, around both vehicles to conduct an open air sniff test. During his sniff, Apollo alerted near the trunk of the RAV4. Apollo did not fully alert on the Jetta. Apollo did, however, exhibit an \"obvious change of behavior\" by the Jetta's right passenger door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The officers searched the RAV4 and discovered items allegedly related to a credit card skimming scheme in a Wal-Mart bag placed under luggage and in a spare tire wheel well. Other items, including marijuana, were found during a subsequent search of the Jetta. The officers also found the RAV4 rental agreement, which reflected that Pena-Morales rented the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution \"requires that\n   searches and seizures be reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Indianapolis v. Edmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505377\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/32/#p37\">\n    531 U.S. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505377\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/32/#p37\">\n    121 S.Ct. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505377\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/32/#p37\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). When a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine requires suppression of \"all evidence derived from the exploitation of [the violation], unless the Government shows that there was a break in the chain of events sufficient to refute the inference that the evidence was a product of the Fourth Amendment violation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jaquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8929666\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/338/#p341\">\n    421 F.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341 (5th Cir. 2005). \"Where evidence is found as a result of an illegal seizure, it must be suppressed even where it was not found as the result of an illegal search.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thibodeaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070893\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/276/372/#p381\">\n    276 F. App'x 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 381 (5th Cir. 2008) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, the automobiles were searched after the defendants were seized at the checkpoint. Therefore, as discussed in more detail below, the motion to suppress implicates two distinct issues: (1) whether the searches of the vehicles were reasonable; and (2) if the searches were reasonable, whether the justifications for the searches arose while the defendants were properly seized. In this regard, the Government contends that the searches of the vehicles were justified by the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and by consent. Doc. # 73 at 7-8. The Government further argues that the doctrine of Fourth Amendment standing limits the extent to which all defendants but Pena-Morales may challenge the relevant searches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Salemi-Nicoloso, has not, however, offered any evidence or authority which would suggest that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the wallet, which was found in a car in which he was not present and in which he claims no interest. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Salemi-Nicoloso lacks standing to challenge any aspect of the searches or seizures.

Bell testified that at the time Moline-Borroto was removed from the car (when the consent was given), he was no longer free to leave. Accordingly, the first factor weighs against a finding of voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   When considering the second factor-coercive police procedures-a court should consider whether the officer \"used verbal threats or intimidation to obtain ... consent or that an independent constitutional defect preceded or accompanied\" the request for consent.\n   <em>\n    Perales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516453\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/542/#p546\">\n    886 F.3d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record reflects no threats or intimidation. Furthermore, as explained in more detail below, no independent constitutional defect preceded or accompanied the request for consent. Accordingly, the second factor weighs in favor of a voluntariness finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the third factor-extent and level of cooperation with police-the evidence shows that Moline-Borroto was cooperative throughout his interactions with the officers. This factor weighs in favor of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Regarding the fourth factor, while Bell never told Moline-Borroto that he could refuse consent, he provided Moline-Borroto a consent to search form which informed him of his right to refuse consent and attempted to explain the document to him. There is no evidence Moline-Borroto refused to read the document or was unable to do so. Under these circumstances, the Court concludes that the fourth factor-the defendant's awareness of his right to refuse consent-weighs in favor of voluntariness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Miss. Sept. 16, 2016) (fifth factor weighed heavily against voluntariness where there was \"no evidence as to what was actually translated\"). However, because Moline-Borroto was given a form in his native language which set forth his rights, the Court concludes that a language barrier did not inhibit his ability to act knowingly and intelligently. Accordingly, the fifth factor is neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As for the final factor-belief incriminating evidence would be found-the evidence shows that the alleged contraband\n   was found underneath a pile of luggage and hidden in an empty spare wheel well in the RAV4. Given that these items were not in plain view, Moline-Borroto \"could have easily believed no incriminating evidence would be found.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the sixth factor weighs in favor of voluntariness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In sum, the first factor weighs against voluntariness; the second, third, fourth, and sixth factors weigh in favor of voluntariness; and the fifth factor is neutral. Although the Court is concerned about the use of the translation phone application, this concern is alleviated by the fact that Moline-Borroto was given a form in Spanish which stated his rights to refuse the search and was given time to review the form. The provision of this form,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   combined with the absence of coercive tactics, Moline-Borroto's general cooperativeness, and the hidden contraband, convinces the Court that Moline-Borroto's consent was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    b. Pena-Morales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Pena-Morales, like Moline-Borroto, was not free to leave at the time he consented. Additionally, like Moline-Borroto, Pena-Morales was cooperative and not subjected to coercive procedures. Also like Moline-Borroto, Pena-Morales was provided a consent to search form in Spanish which he was given time to review, and which, unlike Moline-Borroto, he actually signed. The primary difference between the circumstances of the two consents is that, unlike in the RAV4, it appears some of the seized items in the Jetta were in plain view. This distinction, while relevant, does not alter the Court's analysis in any appreciable way. Accordingly, for the reasons above, the Court concludes that Pena-Morales' consent was voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The Government further submits that the permissible detention period was then further extended by Moline-Borroto's statement that he was travelling between Memphis and Miami, two \"source cities\" for narcotics; the arrival of the Jetta; and the contradictory answers provided by Pena-Morales and Moline-Borroto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With regard to the initial grounds for an extension, \"[a]lthough traveling at an unusual time of day may not by itself give rise to reasonable suspicion, it is a permissible consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
