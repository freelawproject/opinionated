Misquitta has been detained approximately 10 months pending the completion of removal proceedings commenced following a felony conviction for mail fraud and service of 51 months of his federal sentence. Petitioner has been detained under the authority of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which provides for mandatory detention of aliens convicted of certain aggravated felonies without benefit of individualized bond hearings. The only ground for pre-removal release under section 1226(c) is a showing that release is necessary to protect a witness, a ground that is inapplicable here. Misquitta contends that his continued detention without an individualized bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and seeks release from custody unless Respondent affords him an individualized bond hearing before an immigration judge. On October 19, 2018, the court held a hearing on Misquitta's motion. For the following reasons, the court concludes Misquitta has not established a likelihood of success on the merits, and therefore, Petitioner's Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Misquitta, a citizen of India, was lawfully admitted to the United States in 1987 as a non-immigrant student. He later married a United States citizen and acquired lawful permanent residency in the 1990s. In July 2013, Misquitta was convicted of five counts of mail fraud (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), which subjects him to removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201228\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Misquitta was sentenced to 71 months in prison and ultimately served 51 months of that sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 15, 2017, ICE served Misquitta with a Notice to Appear stating Misquitta was subject to removal based upon his conviction. On November 15, 2017, a hearing on Misquitta's removability was held. At the hearing, Misquitta denied the charges of removability. The Immigration Court reset the case in order to allow ICE to file a brief and submit supporting documentation. ICE submitted its brief on November 29, 2017, and the Immigration Court subsequently issued a written decision on removability. The Immigration Court held another hearing on December 20, 2017 and again sustained the charges of removability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 6, 2018, ICE took Misquitta into civil immigration custody, as authorized by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Misquitta then submitted an application seeking to readjust his status by applying for a waiver pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This waiver was based upon an \"I-130 petition\" by Misquitta's wife, requesting that Misquitta be permitted to remain in the United States because his removal would cause extreme hardship to herself and their children, who are all United States Citizens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following a hearing on the application to readjust status, the immigration judge issued his Ruling on July 12, 2018, wherein it denied Misquitta's request for a waiver and ordered Misquitta's removal. Although the immigration judge found Misquitta had met the burden of proving a hardship, he declined to readjust Misquitta's status on discretionary grounds. Misquitta has appealed that ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the appeal remains pending at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Misquitta contends his continued detention without an individualized bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. He argues for a \"bright line\" rule that would require a bond hearing for section 1226(c) detentions that exceed six (6) months. To obtain injunctive relief on this claim, Misquitta must establish: (1) a substantial likelihood his cause will succeed on the merits, (2) a substantial threat of irreparable injury if the injunction is not granted, (3) the threatened injury outweighs the threatened harm the injunction may do to the opposing party, and (4) granting the injunction will not disserve the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Piedmont Heights Civic Club, Inc. v. Moreland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353856\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/430/\">\n    637 F.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1981). Here, the first requirement for injunctive relief -- a \"substantial likelihood of success on the merits\" -- requires consideration of the statutory context of section 1226(c) and the jurisprudence addressing the constitutionality of mandatory detention under that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Statutory Context\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 1226(c) is one part of a broader statutory scheme addressing the removal of aliens. Section 1226 broadly authorizes the detention of aliens pending a final order of removal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1226(a) provides that any \"alien\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). If an alien is arrested and detained under this provision, section 1226(a) provides that, \"[e]xcept as provided in subsection (c),\" the Attorney General \"may release the alien on-- (A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   or (B) conditional parole....\";\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3). Detention under 1226(a) is generally referred to as \"discretionary detention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 1226(c) governs the detention of certain \"criminal aliens,\" and is an exception to the discretionary detention authorized by section 1226(a). Section 1226(c)(1) describes a group of aliens that the government\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   detain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Attorney General\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   take into custody any alien who [is convicted of the enumerated crimes] when the alien is released, without regard to whether the alien is released on parole, supervised release, or probation, and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 1226(c)(2) thus mandates detention for this class of aliens. Section 1226(c) also eliminates the availability of release on bond except when \"necessary to provide protection to a witness....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2). Aliens subject to section 1226(c) detention are thus not entitled to bond hearings. Misquitta argues that aliens subject to detention under section 1226(c) are subject to indeterminate civil detention with no ability to seek a bond hearing, which he argues violates the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Due Process and Mandatory Detention Under Section 1226(c)\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Demore\n    </em>\n    and the Facial Validity of Section 1226(c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Demore v.

The Court observed that section 1226(c) was adopted \"against a backdrop of wholesale failure by the INS to deal with increasing rates of criminal activity by aliens,\" and that \"one of the major causes of the INS' failure to remove deportable criminal aliens was the agency's failure to detain those aliens during their deportation proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 518-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court further observed that the Attorney General had broad discretion to conduct individualized bond hearings and release criminal aliens from custody prior to the adoption of section 1226(c), and that Congress sought to limit that discretion based upon its concern that, \"even with individualized screening, releasing deportable criminal aliens on bond would lead to an unacceptable rate of flight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    at 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After that time period, the government would be required to make an individualized showing that the alien's removal from the United States was significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future. The\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   court distinguished\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   on the ground that\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   involved a different statutory provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which addresses detention of aliens during the 90-day removal period following a final order of removal.\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   involved continued detention where removal could not be accomplished within 90 days. As the\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   court noted, \"the period of detention at issue in Zadvydas was 'indefinite' and 'potentially permanent,' \" whereas detention under section 1226(c), which governs detention pending completion of removal proceedings, has a \"definite termination point.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    at 528-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

While\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   upheld the facial validity of section 1226(c), lower courts entertained \"as applied\" due process challenges to section 1226(c). Many of those courts relief upon language in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   that section 1226(c) detentions are generally brief - \"roughly a month and a half in the vast majority of cases in which it is invoked, and about five months in the minority of cases\" - and the separate concurrence of Justice Kennedy suggesting that an unreasonable delay by the government could support a due process challenge.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 530, 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lower courts, however, diverged in their approach to due process challenges under section 1226(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   One group of courts relied on the doctrine of \"constitutional avoidance\" in adopting a six-month limit on section 1226(c) detention.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lora v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that section 1226(c)'s mandatory detention language must be construed to contain an implicit reasonable time limitation to avoid due process concerns. These courts also concluded that a \"bright line\" six-month rule would provide consistency and predictability in rulings and ease administrative burdens.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lora\n   </em>\n   at 615 (noting that \"while a case-by-case approach might be workable in circuits with comparatively small immigration dockets, the Second and Ninth Circuit have been disproportionately burdened by a surge in immigration appeals and a corresponding surge in the sizes of their immigration dockets.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Other courts eschewed a bright line rule and assessed the reasonableness of mandatory detentions on a case-by-case basis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diop v.

In\n   <em>\n    Diop\n   </em>\n   , the court examined an array of case-specific factors, including the extent to which the detention was longer than the average length of detention under section 1226(c), and whether prolonged detention was the fault of the government or the immigration court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830734\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/221/\">\n    656 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   233 - 35.

There, the court considered six non-exhaustive factors, namely: (1) the length of time the criminal alien had been detained without a bond hearing; (2) the reason for the prolonged detention; (3) whether any impediments exist to final removal if ordered; (4) whether the alien's civil immigration detention exceeds the time the alien spent in prison for the crime that rendered him removable; (5) whether the facility for the civil immigration detention is meaningfully different from a penal institution for criminal detention; and (6) the foreseeability of proceedings concluding in the near future.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     What is the Appropriate Standard After\n     <em>\n      Jennings\n     </em>\n     ?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   and the post-\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, there is no basis in section 1226(c) or the Due Process Clause to create the six-month time limit on mandatory detention requested by Misquitta. The rationale for a bright line time limit is grounded in a statutory construction of section 1226(c) that was squarely rejected by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jennings.\n   </em>\n   The cases decided after\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   almost uniformly recognize that\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   precludes a bright line time limit on mandatory detention and have, instead, turned to a case-by-case assessment of whether\n   section 1226(c) violates due process\n   <em>\n    as applied\n   </em>\n   to the petitioner before the court. Indeed, some of these decisions come from courts in circuits that had previously adopted a bright line rule.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204849684\">\n    2018 WL 4849684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As explained in\n   <em>\n    Demore\n   </em>\n   , the purpose of mandatory detention under section 1226(c) is, in part, to prevent \"deportable criminal aliens from fleeing prior to or during their removal proceedings,\" a problem Congress viewed stemmed from the prior system of discretionary detention.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    538 U.S. at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9031152\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/510/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This purpose is served as long as deportable criminal aliens are held under section 1226(c) until removal proceedings are completed. This result does not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas. Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   precludes aliens from being held in\n   <em>\n    indefinite\n   </em>\n   detention, but section 1226(c) does not impose indefinite detention. It has a termination point, namely exhaustion of a petitioner's appeals and entry of a final order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At what point, however, does mandatory detention no longer serve the purpose of the statute; in other words, when does detention become so unreasonable and arbitrary that it violates a petitioner's right to due process? The factors that the post\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   decisions have identified provide some guidance.

These factors, however, must be tied back to the ultimate question for the court: has prolonged detention become unreasonable, unjustified, or arbitrary in light of the purpose of section 1226(c) ? It\n   is unlikely that a petitioner can satisfy this standard absent evidence of government wrongdoing in connection with the removal proceedings, such as actions that unreasonably prolong the removal proceeding or actions taken in bad faith. Where removal proceedings are delayed solely by a party's good faith exercise of its procedural remedies - whether by the petitioner or the government - continued detention is unlikely to trigger due process concerns in most cases because continued detention until completion of the removal proceedings still serves the purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204849684\">\n    2018 WL 4849684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Considering the record as a whole, the Court finds Misquitta has not established that his continued detention without a bond hearing is so unreasonable or arbitrary as to violate the Due Process Clause. Misquitta has been detained for approximately 10 months, following 51 months of incarceration. The record reflects that Misquitta is availing himself of the procedural remedies and defenses to removal available to him. The record does not reflect any unusual delays considering the progress of the case and the procedural remedies invoked by Misquitta. Misquitta recently appealed the decision of the immigration court to the Board of Immigration Appeals, and he has filed his appellate brief. Considering the status of the removal case, Misquitta's detention under section 1226(c) is not indefinite but has a definite termination point: the exhaustion of Misquitta's appeals and procedural remedies. More importantly, there is no evidence in the record that the government has acted in bad faith or otherwise unreasonably delayed Misquitta's removal proceeding. Misquitta's detention pending the completion of his appeal thus continues to serve the purpose of section 1226(c). Accordingly, Misquitta has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of his claim. Since Misquitta has not established a likelihood of success on the merits, it is unnecessary to consider the remaining factors required to grant injunctive relief. As such, the motion for injunctive relief must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Misquitta's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order with Notice or Preliminary Injunction [Doc.
