Genital Herpes Simplex Virus\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Genocea is an early-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that researches, develops, and seeks to bring to market T cell vaccines to treat infectious diseases. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20. Throughout the proposed Class Period - March 31, 2016 through September 25, 2017 - Genocea's only product candidate in active clinical development was a genital herpesimmunotherapy treatment called GEN-003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The genital herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) is an incurable disease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. After a patient is initially infected, the herpes virus can remain latent in the body until it periodically and sporadically reactivates; such reactivation is highly variable in individual patients.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. While the virus is active, it travels to a patient's skin and mucus membrane in a process known as \"viral shedding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. During active periods a patient may also develop genital lesions - sometimes referred to as \"outbreaks\" - because of the virus. The virus\n   can be sexually transmitted during viral shedding\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   the patient appears \"asymptomatic\" i.e., does not appear to have genital lesions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the time GEN-003 was in clinical trials, there were already products on the market to treat genital herpes, either through a daily pill to decrease the risk of transmission and outbreaks or through pills that patients take once an outbreak occurs to lessen the pain and discomfort.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. One drug, acyclovir, is very effective in minimizing genital lesion outbreaks and is \"dirt cheap.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Defendants were developing GEN-003 as a therapeutic vaccine, which could be administered every six to twelve months, rather than daily, to patients already infected with the virus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Phase 2b Clinical Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning in 2012, Genocea tested GEN-003's efficacy in three phased clinical trials - Phase 1/2a, Phase 2, and Phase 2b.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. During each of the phases, participants were randomly assigned to receive either a dose of the vaccine or a placebo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. To establish a baseline viral shedding rate for each patient, Genocea instructed trial participants to swab their genital areas twice-daily for 28 days before receiving any treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Participants then received three injections at 21-day intervals of either the vaccine or placebo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Immediately following the last injection, each participant swabbed his or her genital areas again twice-daily for 28 days (\"immediately post-dosing\"). Participants then swabbed again for 28 days at six months post-dosing, and twelve months post-dosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 42. Participants submitted their swabs for viral shedding analysis, as well as forms with self-reported lesion recurrences for analysis of genital lesion rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In anticipation of commercialization, Genocea announced a Phase 2b trial which would test a modified version of GEN-003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Up until this point, GEN-003 had been manually formulated; the modified GEN-003 would be manufactured using a commercial, scalable process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The goal of Phase 2b was to ensure that the new formulation remained safe and effective, and the primary end point for the phase was the reduction in viral shedding rates immediately post-dosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Secondary endpoints of the Phase 2b trial included viral shedding rate reductions at six and twelve months post-dosing and reductions in genital lesion recurrence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54. The Phase 2b trial contained two dose groups and one placebo control group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The two doses were a 60 \u00b5g per protein/50 \u00b5g of Matrix-M2 dose (\"60/50 dose\"), and a 60 \u00b5g per protein/75 \u00b5g of Matrix-M2 dose (\"60/75 dose\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 29, 2016, Genocea revealed results for the study's primary endpoint, the Phase 2b viral shedding results for\n   <em>\n    immediately\n   </em>\n   post-dosing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. The company found that the 60/50 dose produced a 40% reduction in viral shedding and was statistically significant compared to both the baseline and placebo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. The 60/75 dose showed a 27% decrease in viral shedding, but that result was not statistically significant against either the baseline rate or placebo control group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. The press release stated, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The study achieved its primary endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 40 per cent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 \u00b5g per protein/50 \u00b5g of Matrix-M2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. The viral shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at the same time point in a prior Phase 2 trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. On an earnings call held the same day, CMO Hetherington emphasized that GEN-003's viral shedding rate reduction results for Phase 2b were \"consistent with the statistically significant 41% reduction that we observed for this dose group in the prior Phase 2 trial, this gives us great confidence that the effect is robust and replicable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On November 3, 2016, CEO Clark announced that the six month post-dosing viral shedding results for Phase 2b would be released \"later in the first half of 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. The six month viral shedding results would not be released with the six month genital lesion results; this differed from the reporting schedule used previously in Phase 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On January 5, 2017, Genocea released the Phase 2b six month post-dosing genital lesion results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. At six months post-dosing, two different GEN-003 doses produced statistically significant reductions in genital lesion rates both against participants' baseline and the placebo control group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. The press release announced, \"Positive 6-Month Results from GEN-003 Phase 2b Clinical Trial - Trial meets statistical significance vs. placebo for multiple clinical endpoints through six months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. The release did not mention the Phase 2b six month post-dosing viral shedding results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to two confidential witnesses, at a company-wide meeting following the announcement of the six month genital lesion results, Clark announced that there was \"no interest\" from potential funding partners in sponsoring the planned Phase 3 trials for GEN-003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. Clark stated the company was going to focus more heavily on its oncology program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A confidential witness also noted that layoffs occurred after the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   SEC filings in February reiterated that the \"viral shedding rate reduction data at six months post dosing [was] expected in the first half of 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 5, 2017, Genocea filed its first quarter 10-Q, which summarized the genital lesion data that Genocea announced in January 2017, describing it as \"positive.\" 5/5/2017 Form 10-Q, Q1 2017 at 21. The company still did not disclose the Phase 2b six month viral shedding results, but stated \"viral shedding rate reduction data at six-months and twelve-months post dosing is expected in the middle of 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The form also reassured investors that Genocea continued \"to expect that GEN-003 will be Phase 3-ready in the fourth quarter of 2017.\" Compl. \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At a July 2017 internal \"all hands\" meeting, Clark announced the Phase 2b twelve month post-dosing results for both viral shedding and genital lesions. At twelve months post-dosing, GEN-003 showed statistically significant reductions in genital lesions for patients against the baseline rate as well as the placebo control group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. However, the viral shedding results were not positive. Participants in the 60/50 dose saw a 42% reduction in viral shedding ; while this was statistically significant against the baseline rate, it was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   statistically significant against the placebo group, which saw a 52% decrease in viral shedding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. The placebo group had performed better than the GEN-003 dose group in reducing viral shedding rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Outraged by the results, company scientists questioned Clark about the still undisclosed six month viral shedding results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to a confidential witness present at the meeting, scientist Scott Munzer asked Clark how the twelve month placebo result \"was even possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Clark stated that he did not have the answers and that Hetherington was better positioned to answer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hetherington responded that such results had happened in other trials\n   and that he would be looking into it more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 24, 2017, the company issued a press release announcing the Phase 2b twelve month post-dosing results. The press release stated that the 60/50 dose of the Phase 2b clinical trial had shown a statistically significant reduction in the median genital lesion rate and that \"[o]ther clinical endpoints for this dose improved or were consistent with previously reported positive data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. The press release language was silent as to the twelve month viral shedding results; however, the chart included with the press release disclosed the negative twelve month viral shedding results and the placebo effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Slides distributed for the July 24, 2017 analyst call announced: \"GEN-003 Phase 3 on Track to Start by End of 2017,\" and \"GEN-003 Strongly Positioned Ahead of Phase 3,\" with a footnote on each slide stating \"[s]ubject to obtaining capital.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. Defendant Clark started the analyst call by stating: \"I am delighted to be sharing the most important readout from our Phase 2b trial and maybe the most important data in Genocea's history as we look ahead to Phase 3.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. On the call, Hetherington explained the placebo effect seen in the twelve month viral shedding data, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   We know that GEN-003 works by reducing viral shedding and believe that variability in shedding data is a consequence of the sporadic nature of shedding in the small number of subjects provided [sic] data at this time point. We do not expect that this will be a factor in Phase 3 studies, given the much larger sample size.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. On July 24, 2017, after the announcement of the Phase 2b twelve month results, Genocea's stock price increased to over $6.00/share.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 60 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   During the proposed class period, Clark and Hetherington did not sell any of their Genocea stock. Poole made two sales of Genocea common stock - the first on May 8, 2017 and the second on July 24, 2017, the same day Genocea issued the Phase 2b twelve month post-dosing results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-102.

Without more, the Court cannot reasonably infer that the Defendants had the six month viral shedding results in January 2017. The only inference that can be drawn is that Defendants had the six month results by the time they released the twelve month post-dosing results in July 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Clark's January 2017 statement also provides little support for the inference. According to two confidential witnesses, at a company-wide meeting in January 2017, Clark announced that there was \"no interest\" from potential funding partners in sponsoring the planned Phase 3 trials and that the company was going to focus more heavily on its oncology program. Compl. \u00b6 60. Plaintiffs argue there was \"no interest\"\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   Defendants must have had the negative six month viral shedding results at that point, which must have scared off potential funders. This is farfetched because there are no factual allegations or even a reasonable inference that Defendants told potential funders about the six month viral shedding results that they allegedly knew at the time. Plaintiffs speculate as to why there was \"no interest\" from funders and then ask the Court to infer Defendants had the six month results in January 2017 based on that speculation. The Court, without more, cannot reasonably draw such an inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Vives v. P. R. Firefighters Corps of P.

If they had been positive, then Defendants would have released them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the Court only considers the allegedly material misstatements made on July 24, 2017. On that date, Defendants announced the Phase 2b twelve month post-dosing results for both genital lesions and viral shedding. The company's press release declared \"Genocea Reports Positive Top-Line 12-Month Phase 2b Data for GEN-003 in Genital Herpes.\" In the release, the company announced that at twelve months post-dosing, the 60/50 dose demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the medial genital lesion rate and that \"[o]ther clinical endpoints for this dose improved or were consistent with previously reported positive data.\" Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 87. The second page of the release included a chart disclosing that at twelve months post-dosing, GEN-003 did not produce a statistically significant reduction in viral shedding compared to the placebo group. The press release's language made no mention of the twelve month viral shedding results that were disclosed and was silent about the undisclosed six month viral shedding results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Slides distributed for an analyst call that same day declared \"GEN-003 Phase 3 on Track to Start by End of 2017,\" and \"GEN-003 Strongly Positioned Ahead of Phase 3,\" with a footnote on each slide stating \"subject to obtaining capital.\" Compl. \u00b6 89. On the analyst call, Clark declared the twelve month results were \"the most important readout from [the] Phase 2b trial and maybe the most important data in Genocea's history as we look ahead to Phase 3.\" Compl. \u00b6 90. In response to a question about the placebo effect seen for the twelve month viral shedding results, Hetherington stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We know that GEN-003 works by reducing viral shedding and believe that variability in shedding data is a consequence of the sporadic nature of shedding in the small number of subjects provided [sic] data at this time point.

Plaintiffs point to Clark's statement that the twelve month results were the \"most important readout\" from the Phase 2b trial, Compl. \u00b6 90. Plaintiffs also argue that Hetherington's statement to investors was misleading because he sought to \"explain away\" the negative twelve month viral shedding results. However, Plaintiffs do not allege facts to indicate that this was not the most important readout or that the placebo effect was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"a consequence of the sporadic nature of shedding in the small number of subjects [who] provided data\" at that point.

Genocea's stock price rose on July\n   24, 2017, following the release of the negative Phase 2b twelve month viral shedding results. Since Genocea's stock price did not drop when the company released the negative twelve month viral shedding results, the absence of the six month results is likely not material to investors who focused more on the genital lesion results. The release of the negative twelve month viral shedding results without consequence is fatal to Plaintiffs' allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiffs ask this Court to find a strong inference of scienter from the omission of the six month viral shedding results in July 2017.
