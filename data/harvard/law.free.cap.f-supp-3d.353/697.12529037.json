Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From the record and testimony at the evidentiary hearing, the Court finds the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 3, 2005, officer (now Detective) Andrew Hurst of the Clarksville Police Department (\"CPD\") was on patrol, wearing his police uniform and driving a marked police car. He parked his vehicle approximately 50 to 75 feet from a house located at 308 Glen Street to watch the comings and goings from the residence because he had heard from other officers that drug activity might be occurring there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly after 9:00 a.m., Hurst observed a 1987 Chevrolet Caprice Classic pull into the driveway, back out, and then back into the driveway and park partially under a carport. The carport was attached to the left side of the house, covered by a roof, and supported by two poles on the opposite side of the carport. The back wall of the house extended partially across the rear of the carport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The residence is on a corner lot at the intersection of Glen and Vine Streets. It is surrounded by a chain link fence, but there is no gate in front of the driveway. Whitlock did not live at the home, but he may have visited the house given his acquaintance with Clinton Person, and the interest in music they shared. Person lived in the residence with his mother, Robbie Gaines, and his sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Because of the rumors he had heard and his curiosity piqued by the maneuvering of the Caprice, Hurst pulled his car up adjacent to the curb, with the nose of the vehicle near the driveway. Before Hurst could get out of his vehicle, however, Whitlock exited the Caprice, walked towards Hurst, and asked him what was going on. Hurst responded that he suspected Whitlock's car might contain drugs. Whitlock then asked Officer Hurst to repeat the reason for the encounter. As Hurst was about to do so, Whitlock struck him with his fist, hitting Hurst on the head behind the left ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whitlock then took off running towards Poplar Street, the next street down from\n   the residence. After running across lawns and backyards, Whitlock was apprehended by Hurst approximately 300 feet from where the pursuit began. Whitlock was arrested for assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Whitlock was secured in a patrol car, Hurst was approached by CPD Officer Eric Love who informed Hurst that Whitlock ran because there was a \"cookie\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   located in the handle of the door. Hurst was a relatively new officer and unfamiliar with the term. He approached the vehicle under the carport and looked through the driver's side window. He claims to have seen the cookie sitting in a compartment located on the driver's side door. A subsequent search revealed not only the crack cocaine cookie, but also marijuana and a set of digital scales. It is those items that Whitlock seeks to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Instead, he was directed to it by Love who, tellingly, did not testify at the hearing. How Love discovered the cookie has not been established.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps he saw it by peering through the door window as Hurst testified, but the Court found this testimony a bit hard to believe. The cookie sat in what can best be described as a finger well. To see it from the outside, Hurst would have had to peer down over the door panel, and look through the door strap that was attached to the door on a piece of trim. Not only that, Hurst would have had to recognize from that vantage point that what he was seeing in the finger well was an illegal object.

He responded to the scene based on an officer in pursuit call. The only reason for him to look in the car was to see if there was evidence, a point made clear when Officer Love told Detective Hurst that he knew why Whitlock ran - it was because there was a crack cocaine cookie in the door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is attached to the structure and a back portion of the wall is an extension of the rear, exterior wall. The house is surrounded by a fence and the carport is withing the boundaries of the fence such that one has to pass through the fence to get to the carport. Personal effects also appear to have been stored in the carport. While the carport is essentially open on three sides and objects can be seen from the street, \"[s]o long as it is curtilage, a parking patio or carport into which an officer can see from the street is no less entitled to protection from trespass and a warrantless search than a fully enclosed garage.\"\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 1675.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the issue of curtilage, one more matter needs to be addressed. The Government argues that Whitlock lacks standing because he had no ownership or other rights to the 308 Glenn Street residence. In fact, he did not even live in the home. After citing numerous cases that stand for the proposition that visitors lack standing to challenge the search or an apartment or home, the Government argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   It stands to reason that, if casual visitors who are present\n   <em>\n    inside\n   </em>\n   a searched premises lack standing to challenge a search of that premises, Whitlock lacks standing to challenge the search of a vehicle parked\n   <em>\n    outside\n   </em>\n   a premises over which he has asserted no connection at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (Doc. No. 66 at 4, emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government's argument is a faulty syllogism, a prologism, or both, and the conclusion does not flow from the premise. It would be one thing if Whitlock were objecting to the search of the home, but he is not.

Here, the Third Superseding Indictment targets activities of the Gangster Disciples in and around Clarksville, Tennessee, including drug trafficking activities. As it relates specifically to Whitlock, the Government represents that he was involved in obtaining kilogram quantities of powder cocaine from his source in Atlanta, and cooking, packaging, and distributing controlled substance in Clarksville. In the Kentucky case, Whitlock pled guilty to conspiring to distribute more than fifty grams of crack cocaine because he facilitated a single sale of 141.5 grams of crack cocaine to an informant in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Fifth, the locations are different. In Kentucky, the alleged conspiracy operated in Hopkinsville, Kentucky and the surrounding counties. In this case, the Government claims the proof will show that the conspiracy involved conduct not only in Clarksville, but other states, including Georgia, Tennessee, and Indiana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition to the Kentucky charges, Whitlock claims that double jeopardy bars this case because he was also indicted for a drug conspiracy in the Northern District of Georgia styled\n   <em>\n    United States v. Whitlock\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 4:08-cr-44 (N.D. Ga. 2008). In that case, Defendant pled guilty to Count One, which charged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Beginning on a date unknown to the Grand Jury, and continuing until on or about August 22, 2008, in the Northern District of Georgia, the defendants,\n   <strong>\n    REX ANDREW WHITLOCK and TRAY DEANDREA GALBREATH\n   </strong>\n   , did willfully combine, conspire, confederate, agree, and have a tacit understanding with each other and with persons unknown to the Grand Jury, to violate Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1), that is, to possess with intent to distribute at least 5 kilograms of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance, all in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 846, 841(a)(1), and 841(b)(1)(A)(ii).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   (Doc. No. 676 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For two reasons, it is unnecessary to discuss Whitlock's double jeopardy claim relating to the Georgia Indictment in any detail. First, at the hearing on November 27, 2018, the Government represented that it did not intend to present any evidence during its case-in-chief about the facts and circumstances surrounding the Georgia Indictment. Second, even without that concession, the Georgia case and this case are vastly different in regard to the relevant factors: (1) the conspiracy in Georgia lasted until August 2008, while the alleged conspiracy here continued on for another ten years; (2) the Georgia case named only Whitlock and Deandrea Galbreath, who is not charged here; and (3, 4, &amp; 5) the Georgia case involved Whitlock's participation in conspiring to distribute powder cocaine found in a Pontiac Bonneville during a traffic stop, unlike the alleged ongoing conspiracy here involving assorted illegal drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, Whitlock's Motion to Dismiss Count 2 of the Second Superseding Indictment (Doc. No. 573) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

This included outlining its organizational structure and hierarchy (including the various titles of the upper-level leadership in the Middle District of Tennessee); the areas under its control in Clarksville; how one became a member (including recruitment efforts); what occurs at meetings; Gangster Disciples' terminology; the use of certain names and symbols to signify membership, oftentimes through tattoos; identification of the Gangster Disciples' sworn enemies; the purposes of the Gangster Disciples, not the least of which was to enrich its members; and the use of threats, intimidation, and violence to preserve and protect power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, Agent Daniels identified Whitlock's affiliation with the Gangster Disciples, noting that he appeared on dues rosters dating back to 2007 under the alias \"Stack\" and \"Stackhouse\"; that he rose to\n   power in the mid-2000s after securing a drug supplier in Atlanta; that he made numerous drug runs between Atlanta and Clarksville procuring kilogram quantities and carrying between $30,000 and $40,000 in cash; that he cooked cracked and sold from residences in Clarksville (often while armed); that he was arrested in Georgia during one of those drug runs; and that he has maintained his affiliation with the Gangster Disciples after his imprisonment, including posting videos on Facebook accounts, emailing fellow gang members, possessing gang literature, and obtaining new gang tattoos. Agent Daniels' affidavit next describes Whitlock's Instagram account noting that, while in federal custody, Whitlock posted several pictures of himself, along with Gangster Disciples' phrases, acronyms and gang signs. Finally, before identifying what was to be searched and seized, Agent Daniels' described how Instagram is used and how it operates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Even a cursory review makes clear that Agent Daniels' affidavit was not woven out of whole cloth. To be sure, he appears to rely on informants for some of the information, and may have utilized language regarding the Gangster Disciples organization that has appeared in the past.

Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based upon the record and the testimony received at the evidentiary hearing on November 28, 2018, the Court finds the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Kevin Cruce, an ATF Agent, and at least ten other law enforcement officers were tasked with executing an arrest warrant on Darden. This was as a result of an Indictment returned the same day charging Darden and ten others with assorted crimes, including a long-lasting racketeering conspiracy involving the Gangster Disciples, and a conspiracy to distribute a wide range of Schedule II controlled substances (including cocaine, crack cocaine and hydrocodone) that lasted more than a dozen years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Agent Cruce learned that Darden resided or stayed in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and either owned or worked at the Blue Magic Car Wash in that city. The Blue Magic Car wash is a small operation, consisting of an open stall where vehicles are hand washed and detailed, and an adjacent office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Because of its location, surveillance of the car wash was not an option, and so a marked police unit was sent to the site to insure that Darden was there. Once that was confirmed, agents and officers proceeded to the location\n   <em>\n    en masse.\n   </em>\n   All law enforcement officers were wearing identifying vests or uniforms, and some were in full SWAT regalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   When officers arrived, there was a sedan parked in the car wash stall. Four to six individuals were milling about, either in the stall or directly adjacent thereto. Darden was closest to the vehicle, standing most likely five feet, but no more than ten feet, away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   All of the individuals were ordered to the ground. Darden was arrested and placed in handcuffs. A search of his person revealed a plastic baggie containing marijuana, and $900 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After Darden was secured, Agent Cruce noticed two iPhones sitting on top of the vehicle parked in the car wash stall. Either by merely picking it up, or by pressing the home button, Agent Cruce saw a picture of Darden and a child on the home screen of the first iPhone (\"iPhone 1\"). On the second (\"iPhone 2\"), he saw what appeared to be some sort of beach scene on the home screen. The iPhones were covered with substantially identical, if not the same skins. Agent Cruce placed both phones in airplane mode to prevent manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Agent Cruce asked Darden (who by now was standing) about the iPhones. At that point, Darden had yet to be given his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Darden admitted to ownership of iPhone 1, but claimed not to know its password. He denied ownership of iPhone 2. Agent Cruce then asked the\n   other individuals at the car wash about iPhone 2, but all denied ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Because Darden was closest to the iPhones when officers swarmed onto the scene, and because he admitted ownership of iPhone 1 and ownership of iPhone 2 (which was sitting either on top of or adjacent to iPhone 1) was disclaimed by all, Agent Cruce seized both. Based on his extensive experience as an ATF agent (11 years) and his training, Agent Cruce knew that cell phones are often used by drug dealers. He also knew that Darden had been indicted in a wide-ranging conspiracy to distribute drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Application of Law\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Darden seeks to suppress both iPhones as being unlawfully seized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also seeks to suppress the statements he made admitting to ownership of iPhone 1 and, consequently, both phones under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine. The Court considers the arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a)\n     <em>\n      Seizure of the Phones\n     </em>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Government first argues Darden lacks standing as to iPhone 2. It also argues the iPhones were lawfully seized, either as a search incident to arrest or under the plain view doctrine. The Court finds it unnecessary to address the standing issue because the Court agrees with the last argument advanced by the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Government's assertion that the phones were lawfully seized under the search incident to arrest exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is a nonstarter. The Supreme Court has described the exception as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   When an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer's safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee's person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.... There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee's person and the area 'within his immediate control'-construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Chimel v.

But, being cuffed and surrounded, there was no possibility that Darden could have retrieved the phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Turning to the plain view exception, the relevant four factors were identified earlier in this opinion. Only the one of those factors - the object's incriminating nature must be immediately apparent - is at issue regarding Darden's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Supreme Court's requirement in\n   <em>\n    Coolidge\n   </em>\n   that the incriminating nature of seized items be immediately apparent was \"very likely an unhappy choice of words, since it can be taken to imply that an unduly high degree of certainty as to the incriminatory character of evidence is necessary for an application of the 'plain view' doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas v.

While acknowledging that \"[g]enerally, the government has a privilege not to disclose the identity of confidential informants,\" Darden pont out that \"[i]t must yield where disclosure of the informer's identity or the content of his communication is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused or is essential to a fair determination of a cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). Such is the case here, Darden submits, because he and the informant \"(if the allegations are true) were the sole participants in the transaction. This means that the informant is truly the only person who can either amplify or contradict the testimony of any government agents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Darden's argument appears to be based upon a faulty premise. Leaving aside for the moment the Government's representation that recently intercepted jail calls between Darden and co-Defendant Burks make clear that Darden already knows the identity of the informant who purchased the drugs, the Government states that ATF Reports of Investigation (\"ROIs\") were provided in discovery on July 28,\n   2017. Those ROIs detail the controlled buys. Additionally, on that same date, Darden was provided with all of the recordings surrounding the buys, including recorded phone calls, undercover recordings, and surveillance videos. Thus, it does not appear that Darden and the informant are the only individuals who can \"amplify or contradict the testimony of any Government agents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Given that the transactions were either audio or video recorded, it may be that the Government will not even need to call the informant as a witness at trial. If it does, only then will the informant be a witness and subject to the disclosure requirements set forth in\n   <em>\n    Giglio v.
