INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the court is a Renewed Motion for Discovery filed by Juan Perez (\"Defendant\"), in which he seeks an order directing the government to provide unredacted copies of affidavits filed in support of applications for warrants under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (\"Title III\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2522. The government previously\n   provided Defendant with the Title III applications and orders but, following a series of discovery skirmishes, Defendant learned that these materials were redacted to remove certain attachments to the affidavits discussing a confidential informant. The weighty legal issue presented here is whether the government may withhold disclosure of information contained in Title III warrant applications pursuant to the informant's privilege,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roviaro v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n    353 U.S. 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n    77 S.Ct. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n    1 L.Ed.2d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957), despite the requirement set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) that the government provide the defendant with a copy of the Title III application and court order before introducing any evidence derived from the warrant at trial or in any proceeding. The court concludes that if\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   were the only standard applicable the result would be different, but here Congress has made clear in a comprehensive statutory scheme that the entire application must be provided to the defendant. Accordingly, the court will grant Defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   II. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant has been charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin and to possess heroin with intent to distribute. (Dkt. No. 464.) He is one of nineteen co-defendants charged in the second superseding indictment with crimes related to drug trafficking. As part of the investigation into the drug trafficking organization, the government applied for and was granted a series of Title III wiretap warrants. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 16-93014-MGM, 16-93015-MGM, 16-93016-MGM, and 16-93019-MGM.) The affidavits filed in support of the warrant applications describe in detail the investigation, what the government expected to learn through the wiretaps, and why traditional investigative techniques were insufficient, among other things.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following a discovery request submitted by Defendant and the government's declination to provide all the requested information, Defendant filed a Motion to Compel Discovery. (Dkt. No. 341.) Defendant sought, among other items, disclosure of the identity of a target of a wiretap warrant on the theory that this individual was actually a confidential informant, the government had not disclosed this fact to the court in the wiretap applications, and, as a result, the government had not satisfied the \"necessity\" requirement for Title III warrant applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(c) (\"Each application shall include ... a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As the parties litigated this issue before Magistrate Judge Katherine A. Robertson, the government maintained-while being careful not to confirm or deny the target's status as a confidential informant-that the court had not been misled in approving the wiretap applications. In one of its public filings, the government cited, in a footnote, certain pages in the underlying Title III applications to support its assertion \"that the issuing Judge was not misled.\" (Dkt. No. 426 at 7 &amp; n.4.) Immediately following the citation of the Title III applications, the government stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   These documents were filed under seal and remain under seal per order of the Court. The documents have been provided to the defendants in the government's automatic disclosures, but these particular pages were provided in a completely redacted form. At the time, the defendants were also provided notice of the government's declination to provide un-redacted versions of these pages pursuant to LR 7.2 and LR 116.6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Dkt. No. 426 at 7 n.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After Judge Robertson denied Defendant's motion, Defendant appealed that\n   ruling to the undersigned. (Dkt Nos. 433, 445.) This court affirmed Judge Robertson's order on this issue, explaining that she \"did not clearly err, abuse her discretion, or rule contrary to law in finding that Defendant failed to make an adequate showing of materiality\" under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16 based on Defendant's \"necessity\" argument. (Dkt. No. 492.) This court additionally explained that it had reviewed the underlying Title III applications and orders (which it had originally issued) and found that it was not misled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In light of the revelation that the government had provided redacted copies of the Title III applications (purportedly in compliance with Local Rule 116.6), however, this court explained that its \"ruling is without prejudice to Defendant's ability to seek, pursuant to Local Rule 116.6, unredacted copies of the Title III applications and affidavits already provided by the Government.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, Defendant filed his pending Renewed Motion for Discovery. (Dkt. No. 517.) Defendant asserted that, in providing him with a discovery letter and the Title III materials, the government had not apprised him it \"was declining to provide any portion of the Title III materials.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Instead, he explained: \"As a result of a series of hearings on his requests the Defendant has now learned that the Government's Application contained an [Attachment] 'A' that was not provided to Defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this new information, Defendant moved for production of the redacted attachment under the framework provided by Local Rule 116.6(a), but substantively relying on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9). In response, the government asserted the \"informant's privilege\" recognized in\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but did not address\n   Defendant's argument that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) controlled over\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, at a status conference, the court explained that to the extent Defendant's Renewed Motion for Discovery was governed by a pure\n   <em>\n    Roviaro\n   </em>\n   analysis, his motion would be denied. (Dkt. No. 566.) However, the court directed the government to file a supplemental brief addressing Defendant's statutory argument and provided Defendant an opportunity to respond. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With the issue now fully briefed, Defendant's motion is ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   IV. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant argues the plain meaning of 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 2518(9) requires the government to furnish to a defendant the entire Title III application (including affidavits filed in support without redaction) before evidence derived from a Title III warrant may be introduced in court. This construction is especially evident, Defendant contends, when comparing section 2518(9) to other provisions in Title III which limit disclosure of the application in separate contexts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Arreguin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096939\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/277/1057/#p1061\">\n    277 F.Supp.2d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1061-62 (E.D.

Therefore, the court is amenable to a government proposal for a strong protective order prohibiting disclosure of the redacted information to third persons, among other limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Applications of Kansas City Star\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468344\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/666/1168/#p1171\">\n    666 F.2d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1171, 1176 (8th Cir. 1981) (approving the district court's order prohibiting the defendant and his attorneys from disclosing the contents of Title III applications and affidavits provided under section 2518(9) ). In the end, however, the court recognizes that a strong protective order may not be sufficient. As the court explained in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Manuszak\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3961307\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/438/613/#p625\">\n    438 F.Supp. 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (E.D. Pa. 1977) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   I recognize that where the wiretap application and order contain sensitive information the disclosure of which could prejudice an ongoing investigation, the government may be put to the hard choice of either foregoing its proceeding against the defendant or risking frustration of its investigation. But this is a choice which Congress has in plain language decreed the government must make when it seeks to deprive a person of his liberty on the basis of wiretap evidence. In truth it is not much different than a number of other difficult decisions which the government must make in pursuing a criminal prosecution ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   V. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court ALLOWS Plaintiff's Renewed Motion for Discovery, provided that the government may request a protective order before disclosing the redacted information.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Local Rule 116.6(a) provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    If in the judgment of a party it would be detrimental to the interests of justice to make any of the disclosures required by these rules, such disclosures may be declined, before or at the time that disclosure is due, and the opposing party advised in writing, with a copy filed with the clerk, of the specific matters on which disclosure is declined and the reasons for declining. If the opposing party seeks to challenge the declination, that party shall file a motion to compel that states the reasons why disclosure is sought. Upon the filing of such motion, except to the extent otherwise provided by law, the burden shall be on the party declining disclosure to demonstrate, by affidavit and supporting memorandum citing legal authority, why such disclosure should not be made.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In this case, the government apparently did not advise Defendant in a separate writing, as contemplated by Local Rule 116.6(a), that it was declining to produce the entirety of the Title III application but, rather, included the written declinations on the last pages of the affidavits, where the redacted \"Attachment A\" otherwise would have been located. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 536 at 2.) In the court's view, Local Rule 116.6(a) does not envision that the advising \"in writing\" would take the form of placing the written declination within lengthy discovery material; such gamesmanship conflicts with the clear purpose of the rule. In the future, the government would be well advised to provide defendants with declinations in a more transparent manner, in keeping with the letter and spirit of Local Rule 116.6(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Roviaro\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court recognized a government \"privilege to withhold from disclosure the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of law to officers charged with enforcement of that law.\"\n    <em>\n     Roviaro\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n     353 U.S. at 59\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"The privilege recognizes the obligation of citizens to communicate their knowledge of the commission of crimes to law-enforcement officials and, by preserving their anonymity, encourages them to perform that obligation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    However, the Court explained, \"[w]here the disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n     at 60-61\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6159521\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/53/\">\n     77 S.Ct. 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The court in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

This conclusion, however, makes little sense \"because the two sections do not operate in the same context.
