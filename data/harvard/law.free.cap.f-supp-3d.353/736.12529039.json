On June 1, 2018, Plaintiffs, Tashianne Wilburn and Quanan Wilburn, the natural parents and guardians of Z.W., a minor child, filed a motion to strike Defendants' fourth and sixth affirmative defenses pursuant to Rule 12(f). On June 6, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Defendants' jury demand. On June 13, 2018, Defendants, Cynthia Nelson, in her official capacity as the Executive Director of the St. Joseph County Juvenile Justice Center (\"JJC\"), the Board of County Commissioners of St. Joseph County, and the St. Joseph County Council, filed their responses to both motions. Both motions are now ripe and for the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Wilburns' motion to strike affirmative defenses and Defendants' jury demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Wilburns argue that the defense of Eleventh Amendment Immunity should be stricken because the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to actions against a county or political subdivision. [DE 21 at 4]. The Defendants do not contest this assertion concerning the Board of County Commissioners of St. Joseph County or the St. Joseph County Council, upon which multiple defendants sit. However, Defendants argue that Eleventh Amendment Immunity could potentially apply to Defendant Nelson in her official capacity as Executive Director of the JJC because they argue it is uncertain whether the Executive Director of the JJC is an employee of the St. Joseph County Probate Court or of St. Joseph County.

Yet Defendants argue a dispute exists as to whether Nelson, in her official capacity as the Executive Director of the JJC, is empowered by the county or the St. Joseph County Probate Court. [DE 24 at 4]. More specifically, the parties dispute whether the St. Joseph County Probate Court is an \"arm of the state.\" The Defendants claim that whether Eleventh Amendment Immunity applies to Nelson depends on whether the county or the probate court empowers the JJC [DE 24 at 4]. Meanwhile, the Wilburns claim the JJC is not a state agency but refer parenthetically to the probate court as a state entity. [DE 26 at 9]. Defendants note that the probate court has the authority to appoint the staff of the JJC. [DE 24 at 2];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ind. Code. \u00a7 31-31-8-3(c). However, in\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   , the Lottery Commission of Indiana was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity even though the governor appointed the commission's members and director.\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   , 546 F.3d at 422 (citing\n   <em>\n    Takle v.

Thus, even if a state entity appointed the Executive Director of the JJC, that does not automatically make the JJC a state entity.

The Seventh Circuit has held that a jury demand filed with a responsive pleading that was 29 days late was timely when no objection to the responsive pleading was filed and the party was not entirely to blame for the delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dasho v.

In this case, Defendants' jury demand comes absent the obvious \"foot-dragging\" present in\n   <em>\n    Communications Maintenance\n   </em>\n   . As a result, the Court must examine whether Defendants waived their right to a jury trial completely by failing to file a jury demand in a timely manner during the original pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   It has long been recognized that \"supplemental pleadings do not extend the jury demand time, except as to any new issues which are raised for the first time by the supplemental pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Huff v.

Thus, in order to determine whether the right to a jury was waived as to the Wilburns' amended class action complaint, this Court must decide whether the class action complaint raised \"new factual issues\" or simply alleged \"new legal theories or particularized facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Commc'ns Maint.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29351\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/1202/\">\n    761 F.2d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Here, both the original complaint and the amended class action complaint primarily arise because of the Wilburns' concern that the JJC allegedly has a policy and practice of placing juvenile detainees in solitary confinement. [DE 1 at 10; DE 12 at 5]. Despite Defendants' assertion to the contrary, the original complaint did not refer solely to the treatment of Z.W. while at the JJC, but to the policies governing juveniles at the JJC more generally. Specifically, the original complaint alleged that \"confinement to a room [is] a method of 'Value Based Behavior Management' for even minor infractions of JJC rules.\" [DE 1 at 9]. It also alleged that the JJC had and continues to have \"policies, customs, and practices that sanctioned the imposition of punitive solitary confinement of children, including Z.W.\" [DE 1 at 10]. Moreover, the original complaint claimed that solitary confinement is harming juveniles at the JJC. [DE 1 at 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   These same factual assertions are included in the First Amended Class Action Complaint using slightly different language. For example, the amended complaint alleges the \"JJC's use of solitary confinement is part of the JJC's 'Value Based Behavior Management' of juvenile detainees.\" [DE 12 at 6]. Furthermore, the amended complaint claims that the \"JJC has had and still has a policy, practice, and custom of subjecting juvenile detainees to solitary confinement.\" [DE 12 at 5]. Notably, the amended complaint also claims that Z.W. was placed in solitary confinement and that \"[s]olitary confinement of juveniles causes them harm.\" [DE 12 at 10]. Instead of using the phrase \"confinement to a room,\" the amended complaint references \"Room Confinement\" and \"Holding,\" among others. [DE 12 at 5]. Even if these differences were deemed to represent new allegations of facts, new particularized facts do not qualify as a new issue for purposes of a jury demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commc'ns Maint.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"29351\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/761/1202/\">\n    761 F.2d at 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the original complaint requested relief for \"similarly situated children\" under the United States Constitution and the Individuals with Disabilities Act.

LEXIS 49792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10-11. Nor is this case like\n   <em>\n    Ford v. Breier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7854884\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/71/195/#p197\">\n    71 F.R.D. 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197 (E.D. Wis. 1976), cited by Defendants, in which a jury demand was brought by new counsel unopposed and without delay. In their reply, the Wilburns appropriately note that the cases cited by Defendants contain excuses that do not apply in this case. [DE 28 at 5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, Defendants have failed to provide a good reason for their untimely jury demand as required under Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendants failed to file a timely jury demand pursuant to Rule 38(b) in response to the original complaint. Thus, Defendants waived their right to a jury pursuant to Rule 38(d). Defendants also failed to give a good reason for their untimely jury demand. Accordingly, the Court declines to grant Defendants a jury trial pursuant to Rule 39(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   both the Wilburns' motion to strike affirmative defenses [DE 20] and their motion to strike jury demand [DE 22]. The Court\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' fourth and sixth affirmative defenses as pleaded in their answer. [DE 19 at 30]. Additionally, the Court\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' jury demand. [DE 19 at 32].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 1st day of November 2018.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
