(\"Overaa\") made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.Pro. 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6). (Doc. 12). The motion argues that the complaint, which plaintiff Carbonite Filter Corporation (\"Carbonite\") filed, should be dismissed for lack of general and specific personal jurisdiction over Overaa, a California company. The motion also argues that plaintiff's complaint fails to state any cognizable claims against Overaa. Because the court does not have general or specific personal jurisdiction over Overaa, the motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   under Rule 12(b)(2), and Carbon's complaint against Overaa will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carbonite is a Pennsylvania company which is located in Schuylkill County, and it processes, packages and sells Pennsylvania anthracite coal for use as filter media in water treatment plants. Overaa is a California construction company which uses coal in water treatment plant construction\n   projects. The City of Sacramento, California, owned a water treatment plant and it contracted Overaa to rehabilitate the plant by installing filters to wash and clean the water for the City, i.e., the Sacramento water treatment plant construction project (the \"Project\"). Carbonfilt, LLC, (\"Carbonfilt\"), is a Florida company that Overaa used to supply anthracite coal for the Project. Carbonite alleges that even though Carbonfilt was not an acceptable supplier for the anthracite coal according to the specifications for the Project, Overaa decided to use Carbonfilt to obtain 629 tons of anthracite coal for the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Carbonite was directed by Carbonfilt to provide a sample of its manufactured filter anthracite coal to Overaa to determine if it was acceptable for use in the Project. Carbonite then sent the sample to Overaa and Overaa advised that the sample was acceptable. On July 29, 2015, Carbonite sent another anthracite coal sample (Lot 2) for Overaa to test, and subsequently, Overaa advised Carbonfilt that the Lot 2 sample met the filter media requirements for the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August of 2015, Sacramento retained Kleinfelder, a media testing company, to test the bulk filter media sand and anthracite coal that Carbonite had supplied. Carbonite alleges that Kleinfelder was not a credentialed testing laboratory and that it used improper testing protocols to test the sand and anthracite. Kleinfelder determined that the sand and anthracite filter media products contained deviations from the Project's specifications. Thereafter, the products were tested by six other testing laboratories which yielded inconsistent results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Carbonfilt then advised Overaa that it was turning over the quality issues to the media manufactures, including Carbonite. Overaa then began communicating with Carbonite, either directly or via carbon copy, regarding its anthracite coal and the Project's requirements. It was finally decided that Carbonite's anthracite coal was in compliance with the Project's requirements and Overaa accepted and used all 629 tons of Carbonite's coal and, installed the coal in the water treatment plant filter system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 19, 2018, Carbonite filed a complaint, (Doc. 1), which essentially alleged that it had performed work as a sub-contractor for the construction of the water treatment facility in Sacramento, i.e., the Project, for which Overaa was the general contractor. Carbonite alleges that Overaa owes it money for the anthracite coal it supplied and was used for the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 24, 2018, Overaa filed its motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (Doc. 12). Overaa's motion has been fully briefed and exhibits were filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Overaa does not have any substantial, systematic and/or continuous contacts with Pennsylvania or any of its residents. Overaa has never had a construction project in Pennsylvania and has never provided any goods or services in Pennsylvania. Overaa does not advertise in Pennsylvania, and it does not solicit business in Pennsylvania. No Overaa employee has ever made any sales or marketing trips to Pennsylvania. Overaa has never directed its services to any Pennsylvania residents. Overaa has never availed itself of business opportunities in, or the protections of the laws of, Pennsylvania. Overaa has never consented to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania, and [its] standard Purchase Order [ ], provides that disputes shall be resolved according to California law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In his Affidavit, Manning explains the nature of its relationship with Carbonfilt regarding the Project and states that Overaa has no affiliation with Carbonfilt and that in April 2013, Overaa contracted with Carbonfilt, a Florida company, to arrange for the supply of coal and sand for the Project. Manning states that \"Carbonfilt is not, and never has been, an agent or representative of Overaa, and Carbonfilt does not have, and has never had, any authority to enter into any contracts on behalf of Overaa, or to bind Overaa to any contractual or other obligations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, Manning states that Overaa had no role in Carbonfilt's decision to then purchase the coal needed for the Project from Carbonite and, that Overaa was not a party to the June 2015 Purchase Order between Carbonite and Carbonfilt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Manning states that after Carbonfilt bought the coal from Carbonite, Carbonfilt in turn sold the coal to Overaa under a separate contract between Carbonfilt and Overaa. He states that Overaa had no contract with Carbonite regarding the Project, and that Overaa did not order the coal from Carbonite and did not agree to pay Carbonite for the coal. Additionally, Carbonite never billed Overaa for the coal it sold to Carbonfilt. Thus, no privity of contract existed between Overaa and Carbonite. Manning also points out that Overaa had no involvement with the payment terms of the contract between Carbonfilt and Carbonite, and it had no involvement Carbonfilt's decision not to pay Carbonite in full for the coal. Manning also avers that before the coal was delivered to the Project, Overaa had no contact at all with Carbonite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of its contention that Overaa has actively availed itself of the laws and protections of Pennsylvania, Carbonite argues that \"Overaa was required to used 'acceptable media suppliers' from Pennsylvania who manufactured Pennsylvania anthracite coal pursuant to the City of Sacramento spec sheet\", and that \"Overaa knew it could only procure anthracite coal from Pennsylvania because that is the only location where anthracite coal is found in the United States and the acceptable Pennsylvania anthracite coal suppliers were specifically\n   identified by the City of Sacramento in the spec sheet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus, Carbonite states that both Overaa and the City of Sacramento knew that they would have to obtain anthracite coal for the Project from Pennsylvania and that the City identified it as one of the four \"acceptable media suppliers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Carbonite also contends that even though Overaa's contract negotiations with Carbonfilt did not occur in Pennsylvania, and even though Overaa did not have any contract with a Pennsylvania company, Overaa has purposely availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Pennsylvania since Carbonite's contract with Carbonfilt required it to ship the coal for the Project from Pennsylvania to California. Thus, Carbonite states that \"Pennsylvania performance is essential because the anthracite coal Overaa wanted is primarily found in Pennsylvania and was manufactured in and shipped from Pennsylvania\", the state which contains all of the country's anthracite coal reserves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Moreover, Carbonite states that jurisdictional discovery in this case has revealed that Overaa has done over $8 million worth of business with 59 different Pennsylvania companies over the last 8 years. (Doc. 19, Ex. 8). As stated, Manning avers that \"[t]he amounts of Overaa's purchases of goods and services from Pennsylvania companies from 2010 to the present total less then one-half of one percent of the amount of Overaa's overall goods and services purchases.\" In this case, while Overaa contends that it does not do significant business in Pennsylvania and it does not target Pennsylvania for its services, the fact that Overaa has conducted $8 million of business with several Pennsylvania companies over the last 8 years sufficiently shows that Overaa has purposeful availed itself of conducting activities within Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O'Connor v.

Further, while Carbonite attempts to address Overaa's forum related activities which give rise to its causes of action, Overaa's dealings with\n   other Pennsylvania companies and its conduct in Pennsylvania over 8 years unrelated to Carbonite's instant claims and the Project are not sufficient to subject Overaa to this court's jurisdiction in Pennsylvania with respect to the relatedness requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gorton,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524579\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/303/278/#p291\">\n    303 F.Supp.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plaintiff must show that its alleged injuries in its case were caused by the defendant's \"activities that were directed at the state of Pennsylvania.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the court finds that Carbonite's claims do not \"arise out of or relate to\" Overaa's forum contacts. Further, simply because \"Overaa needed Pennsylvania mined and manufactured anthracite coal to install in a series of water filters at the City of Sacramento water treatment plant\", as Carbonite alleges, does not change the fact that Overaa did not contact any company in Pennsylvania to get the coal and sand it needed for the Project and, it did not perform any activities for the Project in Pennsylvania. In addition, as Overaa points out, the specifications for the Project also identified two companies that were not from Pennsylvania who were authorized to supply the coal for the Project. Thus, as Overaa states, \"[j]urisdiction cannot be based solely on the geographical source of materials used in a construction project.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Regardless of Carbonite's claim that Overaa attempted to circumvent the City of Sacramento's spec sheet for the Project regarding the required coal and that Carbonfilt was not qualified to bid on the job, the fact remains that Overaa did not seek to obtain the coal from any Pennsylvania company and did not enter into any contract for the purchase of the coal from any Pennsylvania company. Rather, Overaa chose to deal with Carbonfilt, a Florida company, to arrange for the supply of both the sand and the coal it needed for the Project, and Overaa had no involvement with Carbonfilt's decision to then contract with Carbonite to get the coal. As Overaa states in its reply brief, (Doc. 22 at 3-4), \"the mere fact that Pennsylvania coal was required for the Project cannot alone subject Overaa to jurisdiction in the Pennsylvania Courts. If this were the case, the logical extension of this argument would create absurd results[ ], such as, \"each and every person and entity, including the City of Sacramento, who was involved in the Project and benefitted from [Carbonite's] supply of coal, could be subject to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania simply because the coal came from Pennsylvania.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nor does the court find that Carbonite's claims that it was not fully paid for the coal it provided for the Project arise out of or relate to any contacts Overaa had with Pennsylvania. \"[A] defendant's knowledge of a plaintiff's existence in the forum State or knowledge that its conduct may cause a plaintiff to experience harm in the forum State are insufficient justifications for establishing specific jurisdiction.\" Miller v.

Although Carbonite manufactured the anthracite in Pennsylvania and delivered the coal to Overaa in California, there was no contract between Overaa and Carbonite for Overaa to buy the coal. Rather, Carbonite sold the coal to Carbonfilt, not Overaa. Certainly any claims that Carbonite may have against Carbonfilt for breach of contract and nonpayment for its coal would seem to arise from Carbonfilt's contacts with Pennsylvania, but there is no causal connection between Carbonite's claims and any Pennsylvania contacts by Overaa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As such, it cannot be said that Overaa availed itself of the benefits and protections of Pennsylvania law when it contracted with Carbonfilt to arrange for the supply of coal it needed for the Project in California. Thus, Carbonite's instant claims do not arise out of or relate to any of Overaa's activities in Pennsylvania. Thus, it was not reasonably foreseeable that Overaa would have to litigate the instant claims regarding the nonpayment for Carbonite's coal in Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, specific personal jurisdiction over Overaa does not exist in Pennsylvania because both of the aforementioned requirements are not satisfied. Since the court finds that the \"relatedness\" requirement is not met, the court does not have to consider whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction over Overaa comports with \"fair play and substantial justice.\" Plumbers' Local Union,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203129147\">\n    2017 WL 3129147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (quoting Burger King,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p476\">\n    471 U.S. at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205101\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/462/#p476\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gorton,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524579\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/303/278/#p291\">\n    303 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   292 (citing O'Connor,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704677\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/312/#p317\">\n    496 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   317 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
