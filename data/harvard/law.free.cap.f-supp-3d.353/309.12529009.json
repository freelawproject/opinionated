Immediately relevant to the present motion: this case concerns alleged interference with an effort to stage an electronic dance music event at the 2011 New Jersey State Fair. Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (\"Live Nation\") tortiously interfered with their contract and business relationship with State Fair Event Management, which was handling the State Fair in 2011. Live Nation moved for summary judgment, and on May 23, 2018, the Court entered an Opinion and Order which granted the motion as to Count 1, but denied it as to Counts 2 and 3.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10.

As this Court stated in its earlier Opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The new-business rule operates here to bar Plaintiffs from recovering lost profits. New Jersey courts have applied the new-business rule in analogous cases.... While Plaintiffs may have successfully promoted and produced smaller shows, the Event was of a much larger scale, and Plaintiffs' sole foray into large-scale outdoor-event production resulted in losses, not profits.\n   <em>\n    Lost-profits damages are thus 'too remote and speculative to meet the legal standard of reasonable certainty.'\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Juice Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202357748\">\n    2018 WL 2357748\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    RSB Lab.
