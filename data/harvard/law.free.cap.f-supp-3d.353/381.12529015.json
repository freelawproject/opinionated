HAZEL, United States District Judge\n   This case arises out of the Census Bureau's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Plaintiffs, seven individuals and twenty-six immigrant advocacy organizations, claim that asking about respondents' citizenship status will dramatically depress response rates in Plaintiffs' communities, compromising the survey's accuracy, disproportionately diluting political power, and leading to a malapportionment of federal funding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these allegations, Plaintiffs assert claims pursuant to the Census Clause of the United States Constitution (Counts I and IV), the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Count II),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count III), and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (Count V); and seek to enjoin the Census Bureau from including the citizenship question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 54, and Plaintiffs' Motion for Discovery, ECF No. 70 are presently pending before this Court.

I, \u00a7 2, cl. 3 (\"Enumeration Clause\"). \"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state.\" U.S. Const. Am. XIV \u00a7 2 (\"Apportionment Clause\"). The Court refers to the Enumeration Clause and the Apportionment Clause together as the \"Census Clause.\" The population count is used to apportion representation as well as to allocate more than $675 billion in federal funding for over 130 different federal programs and to collect demographic data. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 138-39. Congress delegates the duty of conducting the decennial census to the Secretary of Commerce.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Within two and three years of the census, the Secretary must submit \"a report containing the Secretary's determination of the subjects proposed to be included, and the types of information to be compiled, in such census\" to Congress.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20141\">\n    13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the lead up to the 2020 Census on March 28, 2017, the Secretary submitted such a report to Congress; this initial report did not include citizenship as a proposed subject.

Around the time when Defendant Ross was appointed Secretary of Commerce, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach spoke with President Trump about adding a citizenship question because, in Kobach's view, states like California have had \"congressional seats inflated by counting illegal aliens.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 241.

Specifically, Mr. Gore drafted a letter claiming that the addition of the citizenship question was necessary to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204005229\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    On November 3, 2017, Mr. Gore sent the draft letter to a Department of Justice Management Division official, Arthur Gary, and asked that the official pass it along to the Census Bureau under Mr. Gary's name.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 178. Mr. Gary did so.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 180. Notably, the Department of Justice has filed only four Section 2 Voting Rights Act enforcement actions since 2010,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 183, and in testimony before Congress, Mr. Gore could not identify a single case brought under the Voting Rights Act that failed due to a lack of citizenship data.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 184.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    On March 26, 2018, Secretary Ross directed the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question. ECF No. 42-1 \u00b6 186.

ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 375-76.

These aren't people, these are animals ...,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 250; and (3) he asserted that Democrats \"want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 253.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    According to Plaintiffs, the citizenship question will harm the individual Plaintiffs and the organizational Plaintiffs' clients, members, and constituents because Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Non-U.S. Citizens (collectively, \"Undercount Groups\") will be disproportionately undercounted in the 2020 Census. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 260.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Undercount Groups are already recognized as \"hard-to-count populations,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 261, and they are more likely to be suspicious about the purpose of the decennial census and the government's use of census data than other population groups, a suspicion allegedly exacerbated by the current political environment.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 213, 215, 268, 271.

The \"pattern\" is the disparate impact itself, not a showing of multiple bad acts by Defendants. As previously discussed, Plaintiffs allege that a citizenship question will disparately impact \"sensitive minority communities\" in which the question will \"inevitably trigger hostility, resentment and refusal to cooperate.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 213. These minority communities are already recognized as \"hard-to-count populations.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 261. Even if the burden of lower response rates is limited, Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the \"limited burden\" will be disparately born by their particular, protected communities.

The Administrative Record supports these allegations. That record, which the Court may take judicial notice of, \"shows, for example, that Secretary Ross overruled Census Bureau career staff, who had concluded that reinstating the citizenship question would be 'very costly' and 'harm[ ] the quality of the census count.' \"\n    <em>\n     State v.

Allegations that Defendants' explanation here is \"unworthy of credence\" include the fact that since 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was enacted, neither the Department of Justice nor civil rights groups have ever suggested that citizenship data would be helpful or necessary to enforce the law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 42 \u00b6 181, 184, 385. In this context, it is suspect that around the same time administration officials urged adding a citizenship question to address \"the flow of illegal entries and visa overstays,\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 239, the voting-rights-act rationale suddenly materialized. At the same time, John Gore, who allegedly ghost-wrote the Department of Justice's letter, could not identify any instance when the Department had failed to enforce the Voting Rights Act because it lacked citizenship data. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 184.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Moreover, the Secretary indicated incorrectly that the Department of Justice's letter triggered consideration of a Census citizenship question. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 188 n. 53. The Amended Complaint alleges that this version events is inaccurate. The administration first considered adding a citizenship question months before the Department of Justice's letter-a letter that was not written independently by the Department of Justice but because Secretary Ross and his staff asked the Department of Justice if it \"would support, and if so would request, inclusion of a citizenship question.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 190. Additionally, in January 2017, a draft executive order instructing the Director of the Census Bureau to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census leaked through press reports. The draft was entitled \"Executive Order on Protecting American Jobs and Workers by Strengthening the Integrity of Foreign Worker Visa Programs,\" did not mention Voting Rights Act enforcement, and instead described the citizenship question addition as a tool to \"fulfill several campaign promises.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 239.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Plaintiffs have also identified \"contemporary statements\" by President Trump and members of his administration that further support their claim that intentional discrimination motivated Defendants, at least in part, to add a citizenship question.

By successfully pleading their Equal Protection Clause claim, Plaintiffs have also pled most of these elements; however a dispute remains over whether Plaintiffs plausibly allege the conspiracy element. It is not enough for a plaintiff to plead \"allegations of parallel conduct\" by individuals because the plaintiff \"must show an agreement or a meeting of the minds by defendants to violate the [plaintiff's] constitutional rights.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413863\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1370/#p1376\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413863\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/1370/#p1376\">\n     at 1377\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Plaintiffs plausibly allege that such a \"meeting of the minds\" existed to violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Although Defendants characterize the Complaint as including only allegations \"that public officials received recommendations on issues,\" in reality it includes facts from which the Court can reasonably infer an agreement to violate constitutional rights. To be sure, allegations that public officials merely received recommendations on issues would not be sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1985. One of the key narrowing principles that the Supreme Court has used to try to avoid the \"constitutional shoals that would lie in the path of interpreting \u00a7 1985(3) as a general federal tort law\" is requiring that the agreement between co-conspirators be motivated by invidious discrimination.\n    <em>\n     Bray v.

Thus, unless a plaintiff pleads facts alleging a \"meeting of the minds\" where all minds were motivated by invidious discrimination, then a \u00a7 1985 claim cannot proceed. Plaintiffs have alleged as much here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Assuming the facts in the Complaint are true, in January 2017, the Trump Administration drafted an Executive Order directing the Census Bureau to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census-not to ensure that the Census would be conducted in a manner that would reasonably accomplish actual enumeration or the Census's other constitutional purposes, but to advance the President's anti-immigration political agenda, which, as alleged, is motivated by racial animus. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 238-39. The draft order leaked to the press shortly after Mr. Kobach allegedly pitched the idea of adding a citizenship question to the President, ECF No. 42 \u00b6 241, and around the time when Secretary Ross says he began considering the citizenship question, ECF No. 42 \u00b6 190 n. 55. The draft order\n    did not mention the Voting Rights Act justification. ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 238-40. According to the Complaint, Mr. Kobach's interest in a citizenship question stemmed from his view that states like California have had \"congressional seats inflated by counting illegal aliens.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 241. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, this allegation suggests Mr. Kobach was motivated to reduce immigrant response rates to the Census to achieve an unconstitutional goal. As alleged, over a period of months, Mr. Kobach spoke with Steve Bannon, President Trump, and Secretary Ross to persuade them to add a citizenship question for the express purpose of reducing the number of immigrant respondents. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 241, 176, 174-75. Mr. Kobach explained to Secretary Ross that the lack of a citizenship question \"leads to the problem that aliens who do not actually 'reside' in the United States are still counted for congressional apportionment purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 174.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Rather than base the question on the motive articulated by Mr. Kobach, it is alleged that Secretary Ross asked Mr. Gore to send him a letter from the Department of Justice requesting that the Census Bureau add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. ECF No. 42 \u00b6 190 n. 55. Mr. Gore agreed to do so.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Mr. Gore drafted a letter on the Department of Justice's behalf requesting the addition of the citizenship question and supporting the request with the allegedly false voting-rights rationale.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 178, 180. The allegations indicate that Mr. Gore took this action based on an agreement with Secretary Ross rather than based on a real concern about enforcing the Voting Rights Act because the Department of Justice has filed only four Section 2 Voting Rights Act enforcement actions since 2010,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 183, and in testimony before Congress, Mr. Gore could not identify a single case brought under the Voting Rights Act that failed due to a lack of citizenship data.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 184. These facts must also be considered in the context of Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants knew that a citizenship question would \"inevitably jeopardize the overall accuracy of the population count,\" particularly \"in minority communities\" where the question would \"trigger, hostility, resentment and refusal to cooperate.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 213. Despite knowing that response rates would certainly drop in Plaintiffs' communities, and, indeed, as alleged, because of it, Secretary Ross chose to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, using as pretext the Department of Justice letter,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 186 &amp;190, and concluding without citing evidence that the benefits of collecting citizenship data outweighed its adverse effects.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    While discovery may very well show that administration officials did not agree to Mr. Kobach's citizenship question plan for discriminatory purposes such that Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985 claim cannot survive a motion for summary judgment or trial, Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to survive the motion to dismiss stage.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim will be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     E.

For the same reasons described in\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    and the New York cases, Plaintiffs here have made a strong preliminary showing that Defendants have acted in bad faith, meaning some limited discovery outside of the existing Administrative Record is warranted.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527588\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/336/545/#p552\">\n     336 F.Supp.3d at 569-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204005229\">\n     2018 WL 4005229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *16-17.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Since the Court granted the\n    <em>\n     Kravitiz\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs' motion for additional discovery,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527588\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/336/545/#p552\">\n     336 F.Supp.3d at 569-71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204005229\">\n     2018 WL 4005229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *16-17, Judge Furman has ruled in the New York cases that Secretary Ross and the Department of Justice's John Gore must sit for depositions but denied the New York plaintiffs' request to depose Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach. Case No. 18-Civ.-2921, ECF Nos. 303, 345.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    However, unlike the litigants in\n    <em>\n     Kravitz\n    </em>\n    or the New York cases, the Plaintiffs here allege a\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (3) conspiracy claim. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants conspired with Mr. Kobach and Mr. Bannon to violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights. Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Kobach and Mr. Bannon's testimony is thus plainly \"relevant\" to whether an agreement existed between Defendants and these third parties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Although it is true that the Plaintiffs here plead a meeting of the minds existed between Defendants, Mr. Kobach, Mr. Bannon, and others, Plaintiffs have had the opportunity to sufficiently test this theory by eliciting testimony from Secretary Ross and Mr. Gore about the source and intent of the citizenship question plan. Additionally, the main focus of the APA claim will be Secretary Ross's decision. Given that the depositions of Secretary Ross and Mr. Gore will have already expanded the generally limited scope of judicial review of APA challenges and to avoid allowing Plaintiffs to get around this limitation through the addition of more claims, the Court will not grant Plaintiffs' request for leave to depose Mr. Kobach or Mr. Bannon.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    As Judge Furman noted, \"Mr. Bannon is a former White House adviser and that implicates a whole set of separate and rather more significant issues, namely separation of powers issues, and executive privilege issues, and so forth.\" ECF No. 71-2 at 64. Further, the Complaint and the existing Administrative Record provide only one limited reason to believe Mr. Bannon has information relevant to the Plaintiffs' claims. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that on one occasion when Mr. Kobach spoke to Secretary Ross about the citizenship question he did so at \"the direction of Steve Bannon.\" ECF No. 42 \u00b6 175. Even if Mr. Bannon was involved in high-level discussions regarding adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the content of such communications is likely protected by the presidential communications privilege and/or the deliberative process privilege.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.
