Thomas Marten, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a wrongful death action, alleging that the decedent died as the result of a nursing home fall. Defendant operator of the home has moved for summary judgment, contending that the plaintiffs' failure to designate any medical expert to testify to causation is fatal to their claims for negligence. The motion raises two issues. Can plaintiffs establish causation through the testimony of two nurses? And can they do so by relying on the coroner's death certificate? The court answers these questions, respectively, \"no\" and \"yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Clearwater is a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility. From September 29 to\n   December 1, 2014, Funk resided at Clearwater, except for four days in October when she was at Via Christi St. Francis Hospital. Prior to her death, Funk had multiple health issues, including muscle weakness, edema, depression, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, congestive heart failure, history of seizures, TIAs, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs assert that the 85-year-old Funk fell from her wheelchair and broke her hip on December 1, 2014. She was treated at Via Christi, where on December 2, 2018 Drs. Bradley Dart operated on Funk performing an open reduction of the fracture of her femur with internal fixation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Funk was discharged and transferred to Life Care Center of Andover. Two weeks later, on December 15, Funk again fell, this time apparently from her bed, and was found on the floor at Life Care Center. Funk died January 7, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pinnacle claims that the surgery was successful, but the effects were reversed after Funk suffered the second separate fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By prior order, the court dismissed plaintiffs' survival claims against Clearwater. Only the wrongful death claim against the nursing home remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs have identified two experts, Betty Pankratz (a Registered Nurse), and Judy Diggs (a Licensed Practical Nurse). Pankratz has a bachelor's degree in education and nursing. Diggs earned her nursing degree through a one-year vocational-technical program, and has worked for some 28 years in providing care to the elderly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Amended Certificate of Death completed by Sedgwick County Deputy Medical Examiner Scott Kipper identifies the cause of death as \"complications of a left hip fracture\" due to a December 1, 2014 fall at the Clearwater nursing home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pinnacle argues that plaintiffs have failed to present acceptable medical testimony of causation because Nurses Pankratz and Diggs are simply not qualified to give evidence as to Dorothy Funk's cause of death. In support of its argument, Pinnacle cites numerous cases determining that nurses were not qualified to give expert opinions as to medical causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cunningham v.

Rather, the cited decisions have simply allowed nurses to testify as to other issues. Overwhelmingly, as indeed in\n   <em>\n    Mellies\n   </em>\n   , the decisions have centered on the ability of nurses to testify as to bedsores.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To a certain extent, the plaintiffs' argument confuses the ability of a nurse to testify as to a standard of care and as to causation. Thus, citing\n   <em>\n    Mellies\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs argue that, \"Like bedsores, the testimony of the nurses should be permitted because falls in nursing homes are 'primarily a nursing problem,' and the duty for the prevent care, and treatment of falls primarily rests with nursing home, not physicians.\" (Dkt. 105, at 28). But while preventing falls in nursing homes is a nursing problem, Pinnacle's motion raises the issue not whether it may have violated the standard of care, but the separate issue of whether the fall caused Dorothy Funk's death. In the present case, this determination includes consideration of the fall, but also the effects of the surgery, and a second fall after that surgery on an elderly patient with numerous ailments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiffs' citations to two federal decisions are also of little help. In\n   <em>\n    Wooten\n   </em>\n   , the court again addressed the ability of a nurse to testify as to the standard of care, not causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3612221\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/574/200/\">\n    574 F.Supp. at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding registered nurse was qualified to give expert testimony that \"the care given by VA personnel in this case did not meet the standard of care which is acceptable among professionals in the medical field, specifically nursing care\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nor, in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Surgical Corp. v.

Kan. 1997), did this court approve the ability of a nurse to give testimony as to medical causation. The plaintiffs' statement (Dkt. 105, at 23) that in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Surgical\n   </em>\n   the court \"f[ou]nd a nurse qualified to testify as an expert in a products liability action\" is inaccurate. The case was not a typical products liability action, but a trademark infringement case, in which the plaintiff manufacturer of disposable medical supplies alleged defendant companies were improperly recycling those supplies for reuse. The case did not directly involve any claims of death or personal injury, and the court did not suggest a nurse would be qualified to address such issues. Instead, the court addressed the separate issue of the design of medical instruments;\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the proffered evidence relates to Ms. Reichert's opinion that disposable medical instruments cannot be adequately recleaned and resterilized.

The plaintiffs have failed to show that the determination of a cause of death falls within their experience, education, or training.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mellies\n   </em>\n   , 636 Kan.App.2d at 920,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"390947\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/6/910/\">\n    636 P.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (approving expert nurse testimony as to bedsores, because \"their prevention, treatment and cure are largely nursing duties\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The plaintiffs stress the years of experience and training by Registered Nurse Pankratz and Licensed Practical Nurse Diggs. (Dkt. 105, \u00b6\u00b6 28-41; 42-61). The cited evidence shows that the witness could provide reliable evidence as to the need to prevent falls in nursing homes, and that a fall may result in a fracture. Otherwise, the cited evidence merely reflects blanket assertions of causation based on reviews of the medical record. Nothing in the cited evidence shows that either Pankratz or Diggs has any prior experience in sorting out the cause of death of an elderly patient with significant existing ailments and an intervening surgery and additional injury in the form of a second fall. Nothing in the cited evidence shows that RNs and LPNs in Kansas are ordinarily or even occasionally tasked with making such complex medical diagnoses. The court accordingly excludes any opinion testimony by Pankratz or Diggs as to causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pinnacle also argues that the amended certificate of death cited by plaintiffs is insufficient, noting that proof of causation ordinarily requires expert medical testimony. And it is true many Kansas decisions so held - \"Except where the lack of reasonable care or the existence of proximate cause is apparent to the average layman from common knowledge or experience, expert testimony is required in medical malpractice cases to establish the accepted standard of care and to prove causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bacon v.

And there are indications to the contrary. In one of the cases in the\n   <em>\n    Bacon\n   </em>\n   line of authority,\n   <em>\n    Karrigan v. Nazareth Convent &amp; Academy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41175\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/212/44/\">\n    212 Kan. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41175\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/212/44/\">\n    510 P.2d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195 (1973), the court repeated the general rule and stressed that the plaintiff had \"introduced no expert testimony\" on the subject of the standard of care, but had \"introduc[ed] portions of three medical texts identified by a physician witness as reliable authorities.\" The court summarized the contents of those texts, and concluded that in fact \"[n]one of these tended to show that Dr. Stone was negligent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"41175\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/212/44/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But if the defendant's theory were true - that only live witness testimony counts - it would not have needed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   More importantly, Kansas courts have given weight to the medical opinions contained in death certificates issued under statutory authority. In Kansas, coroners are public officials licensed to practice medicine and surgery. K.S.A. 22a-226.

The court ultimately held that, once defendants challenged this conclusion, the plaintiffs could properly designate additional rebuttal experts. But the court also indicated it had no problem with the initial reliance on the coroner's report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   While plaintiffs could have interviewed [coroner] Dr. Mitchell and designated him as a non-retained witness in their case-in-chief, they weren't required to do so. And plaintiffs weren't unreasonable for relying on what was listed in Hammers's death certificate-an official document filed with the State of Kansas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court concludes that, beyond the standard of care, Pankratz and Diggs have not been shown to offer reliable medical expert evidence as to the cause of death of Dorothy Funk.

But in its present motion, Pinnacle does not challenge Pankratz or Diggs' testimony as to the standard of care, or whether negligence may have caused the first fall. (Dkt. 113, at 13).
