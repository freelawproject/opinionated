Plaintiffs Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement (CCI), Bailing Out Benji, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. (PETA), and Center for Food Safety (CFS) (collectively, Plaintiffs), filed the first motion, ECF No. 49, which Defendants resist. Defendants Kimberly Reynolds, Tom Miller, and Bruce Swanson (collectively, Defendants), filed the second motion, ECF No. 57, which Plaintiffs resist. The parties agree that this matter is appropriate for resolution by summary judgment with each contending they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. No party requested a hearing, and the Court finds a hearing unnecessary. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Iowa created the crime of \"agricultural production facility fraud,\" Iowa Code \u00a7 717A.3A, in 2012, on the heels of several industrial farm investigations that brought critical national attention to Iowa's agricultural industry. For example, in 2011, an undercover investigation at Iowa Select Farms produced reports of workers hurling small piglets onto a concrete floor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another investigation at Iowa's Sparboe Farms, documented reported mistreatment\n   of hens and chicks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   And yet another, conducted by PETA, exposed workers at a Hormel Foods supplier in Iowa \"beating pigs with metal rods,\" \"sticking clothespins into pigs' eyes and faces, and a supervisor kicking a young pig in the face, abdomen, and genitals to make her move while telling the investigator, 'You gotta beat on the bitch. Make her cry.' \" Jeffrey S. Kerr Aff. \u00b6 14, Pls.' App. 14, ECF No. 49-2. PETA's investigation, if not also the others, was an undercover, employment-based investigation in which the investigator also performed tasks assigned by the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   While the results of these investigations were being circulated by news media, the Iowa legislature considered H.F. 589, \u00a7 2 (Iowa 2012), which would eventually become \u00a7 717A.3A. Lawmakers described the bill as being responsive to two primary concerns of the agricultural industry: facility security (both in terms of biosecurity and security of private property) and harms that accompany investigative reporting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, as to security, then-Representative Annette Sweeney provided: \"With this bill we want to make sure everybody involved in our livestock facilities and working within in those facilities is forthright, and want to make sure our livestock is being kept safe,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then-Senate President John \"Jack\" Kibbie supported an early draft of the bill because \"[t]here's viruses that can put these producers out of business, whether it's cattle, hogs or poultry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to reputational harms, former Senator Tom Rielly commented on a draft version of the bill: \"What we're aiming at is stopping these groups that go out and gin up campaigns that they use to raise money by trying to give the agriculture industry a bad name.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The bill, signed into law on March 2, 2012, amended chapter 717A of the Iowa Code, which already prohibited disrupting, destroying, or damaging property at an animal facility,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.2 (2003), or on crop operation property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.3\n   (2001), and also the use of pathogens to threaten animals and crops,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.4 (2004). The new addition provides that a person commits \"agricultural production facility fraud\" if the person willfully:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. Obtains access to an agricultural production facility by false pretenses[, or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. Makes a false statement or representation as part of an application or agreement to be employed at an agricultural production facility, if the person knows the statement to be false, and makes the statement with an intent to commit an act not authorized by the owner of the agricultural production facility, knowing that the act is not authorized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Iowa Code \u00a7 717A.3A (2012). A first conviction under \u00a7 717A.3A is a serious misdemeanor, and a second or subsequent conviction is an aggravated misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.3A(2). A person can also be held criminally liable for conspiring to violate this statute, aiding and abetting a violation, or harboring, aiding, or concealing the person committing the violation, \"with the intent to prevent the apprehension of the person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 717A.3A(3)(a). The law has the effect of criminalizing undercover investigations of certain agricultural facilities, including those mentioned above, and those of interest to the general public, such as puppy mills.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Iowa Code \u00a7 717A.3A is similar, and in parts identical, to other states' laws that prohibit conduct and speech related to agricultural operations. In fact, Iowa is one of many states that have passed or attempted to pass such legislation in the last decade.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def. Fund v.

The\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   describe an American public eager to consume news about the food they eat, and a responsive group of defenders\n   of the agricultural industry, understandably eager to have the news about them be positive, who have worked \"to suppress any unflattering coverage of inhumane slaughterhouse practices, unsanitary factory conditions and worker abuses\" through legislation such as \u00a7 717A.3A.\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   Br. 3, ECF No. 73.

They state they would like to conduct undercover investigations, or use the results of others' investigations, but have not done so given the threat \u00a7 717A.3A would be enforced against them. Plaintiffs challenge \u00a7 717A.3A, arguing it impermissibly restricts their free speech under the First Amendment. Defendants are the Governor of Iowa, the Attorney General of Iowa, and the County Attorney for Montgomery County, who are sued in their official capacities and defend the constitutionality of \u00a7 717A.3A, arguing there is no First Amendment right to engage in the conduct prohibited by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on October 10, 2017, alleging that \u00a7 717A.3A is facially unconstitutional as a content-based, viewpoint-based, and overbroad regulation. Plaintiffs asserted claims under the First Amendment, and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss on December 8, 2017, under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), arguing the Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their claims, and alternatively, that the Plaintiffs failed to state claims under either the First or the Fourteenth Amendments. On February 27, 2018, this Court ruled on the motion, finding the Plaintiffs had standing, dismissed their Equal Protection claim, and denied the motion in all other respects.\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def.

Speech is necessarily implicated by \u00a7 717A.3A because \"one cannot violate \u00a7 717A.3A\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   engaging in speech,\"\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524088\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/297/901/#p907\">\n    297 F.Supp.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The speech implicated is false statements and misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   To some degree, the concept of constitutional protection for speech that is false may be disquieting.
