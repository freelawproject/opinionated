(See ECF 12, Pg ID 965-66). This amended petition was later superseded by a second amended petition filed by S. Allen Early, who replaced Mr. Bunting as counsel. This second amended petition contained the same claim. (ECF 19, Pg ID 1016-19). Although petitioner originally raised this claim as a newly discovered evidence claim and not as a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, he nonetheless raised a claim pertaining to Lieutenant Davis' corruption in his first and second amended petitions. The Court declined to address this claim at the time because it granted petitioner habeas relief on his claim that counsel's inaccurate advice concerning petitioner's sentencing guidelines caused petitioner to reject a plea bargain.

When this Court conditionally granted petitioner habeas relief on his claim that counsel was ineffective with respect to the plea negotiations, the Court declined to address petitioner's remaining claims, including any claims involving Lieutenant\n   Davis. By entering a conditional writ, which was a final order, and not ruling on petitioner's remaining claims, this Court essentially dismissed that claim without prejudice because it was not ripe.

July 20, 2017), where Judge David M. Lawson of this district granted a new trial based on a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation despite the fact that the prosecutor was unaware of the police officer's misconduct. In that prosecution for being a felon in possession of a firearm, a Detroit Police officer testified that he saw the defendant toss a gun during a pursuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 882. The day after this officer testified, the Detroit Police Department suspended the officer during the course of an investigation into claims that the officer falsified police reports in weapons cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officer was subsequently criminally charged, but acquitted. This officer was not the only law-enforcement witness who testified to seeing the defendant with a gun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 883. Despite the fact that the government was unaware of the investigation,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 884, the court found a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation because the officer knew of his own suspension and the pending investigation into his misconduct and that information undermining his credibility would damage the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 885.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Evidence that Lieutenant Davis had embezzled drugs, money, and property from drug suspects could have been used to impeach his credibility. Moreover, evidence that Lieutenant Davis had stolen drugs, money, and property belonging to drug suspects could have been used by the defense counsel to explain why he was unable to obtain the jacket that petitioner had been wearing on the day of the arrest, in order to establish that petitioner was tased in a manner inconsistent with him reaching for a weapon, as the police had suggested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Evidence that Lieutenant Davis was engaged in illegal activities at the time of petitioner's arrest and trial would also have been material to the case. Lieutenant Davis was the key witness against petitioner as well as the officer in charge of the case. This case was not compelling against petitioner and the facts were in dispute. Although Lieutenant Davis claimed to have seized three and one half ounces from petitioner, some of the police paperwork in this case indicated that only 3\u00bd grams of cocaine was seized from petitioner. (ECF 7-5, Tr. 12/11/06, pp. 115-116, 124). No scale was recovered from the informant Corrina Pierson's apartment or from petitioner, even though Pierson claimed that petitioner was going to divide up the 3\u00bd ounces into smaller quantities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 110). Pierson did not actually see petitioner, the cocaine, or gun because she remained in the bathroom until officers left with petitioner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 193). Pierson only saw a chunk of cocaine which she described as about the size of a fist on the table when she came out of the bathroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 220). While it is true that Officer Sharon McDonald claimed that Lieutenant Davis seized the cocaine from petitioner, (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   , p. 101), she herself indicated that she seized a gun from petitioner at the same time (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ), suggesting that she may have been more focused on the gun than the quantity of cocaine seized from petitioner. McDonald's credibility is itself was suspect because Lieutenant Davis was her supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 96). McDonald admitted that some of the reports prepared in this case indicated that only 3\u00bd grams of cocaine were taken from petitioner. Although several additional police officers were involved with the arrest, none of them actually witnessed the cocaine being seized from petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 172-73, 224, 233). Petitioner, as mentioned in the statement of facts, denied being in possession of 3 and a half ounces of cocaine with the intent to deliver the cocaine, claiming instead that he only had 3\u00bd grams for personal use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Evidence of Lieutenant Davis's corruption, embezzlement, and racketeering would clearly be material to the outcome of this case, either as exculpatory evidence or impeachment evidence.

The prosecutor objected based on relevancy grounds. A discussion was held outside the presence of the jury. In the discussion, defense counsel alleged that the police officers did not hear the conversation setting up the drug transaction, contrary to the trial testimony. He asserted that the informant set up a transaction for sex rather than drugs. Defense counsel also indicated that he wanted to question the informant regarding what she was wearing because, upon information and belief, she was dressed as a \"call girl.\" The trial court excluded the testimony based on relevancy grounds. The trial court also held that the informant was not provided with immunity and had a right to be free from self-incrimination. The trial court further stated that defendant's purpose for visiting the informant's residence, whether to engage in sexual acts or to watch football, was irrelevant with regard\n   to his intent or the reason for having drugs on his person.

The ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Petitioner next claims that trial counsel was ineffective in regards to how he handled testimony from Lieutenant Davis concerning petitioner's drug usage and that petitioner was possibly carrying a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Lt. Davis testified that Det. Cook advised him that petitioner had been investigated for drugs. (Tr. 12/11/06, p. 144). Defense counsel objected to this testimony and the trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the last statement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Lt. Davis also testified that he was told McGowan \"was possibly carrying a gun.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 145). There was no objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Petitioner argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial or for failing to request a stronger curative instruction regarding the testimony concerning his drug usage. Petitioner also claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object or move for a mistrial after Lieutenant Davis testified that petitioner might be carrying a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected petitioner's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendant's ineffective assistance claims of his trial counsel's failures with regard to the evidence of past drug investigations of defendant and the OMNI members' preparation for the possibility that defendant would carry a gun are without merit. Although trial counsel admitted at the\n   <em>\n    Ginther\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   hearing that he was tired and focused on another case, defendant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different but for his trial counsel's distractions. The comment regarding past drug investigations was stricken from the record after defense counsel objected. Moreover, in context, the testimony regarding preparing for the possibility that defendant may be carrying a gun was not improper. Rather, the testimony at this trial was seemingly admitted as part of police procedure and to explain why defendant was \"tasered\" when he reached into his pocket. In the presence of police, the informant made a telephone call for three and one-half ounces of cocaine, and the drugs were presented at trial. Defendant telephoned when he was on his way to the informant's apartment with the drugs. When taken into custody at the apartment, drugs and a gun were found on defendant. For the reasons stated above, there was substantial evidence of defendant's guilt presented at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

The judge sustained\n   the objection and advised the jurors to disregard the testimony. The judge later instructed the jurors in his final instructions that he had stricken certain testimony and they were not to consider this excluded evidence in reaching a decision. (Tr. 12/11/06, p. 314).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably reject petitioner's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a mistrial or request a stronger curative instruction in response to Lieutenant Davis' testimony concerning his drug use, as the state court reasonably concluded that the trial court's instruction to disregard that testimony was adequate to cure any error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

Federal habeas courts \" 'must defer to a state court's interpretation of its own rules of evidence and procedure' when assessing a habeas petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Miskel v.

Because the Michigan Court of Appeals determined that Lieutenant Davis' testimony that he had been warned that petitioner might be in possession of a firearm was admissible under Michigan law, this Court must defer to that determination in resolving petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brooks v.

Mich. 2003). In the present case, the Michigan Court of Appeals' determination that petitioner was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel because of counsel's failure to object to the admission of this \"bad acts\" evidence was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, and thus did not warrant federal habeas relief, in light of the Michigan Court of Appeals' finding that this \"bad acts\" evidence was admissible under Michigan law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearl v.
