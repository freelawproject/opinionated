To counter that epidemic, New York has taken proactive measures to treat existing opioid addiction, to prevent future addiction, and to educate New Yorkers about the dangers of opioid dependence. The centerpiece of these efforts is the Opioid Stewardship Act (the \"OSA\" or the \"Act\"), effective July 1, 2018, which established a $600 million \"stewardship fund\" to further these goals. The plaintiffs in these three related cases do not contest the existence of the epidemic or the wisdom of countermeasures, but instead take issue with the particular means that New York has chosen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Healthcare Distribution Alliance (\"HDA\") initiated the first action on July 6, 2018, seeking (i) a declaratory judgment that the Act was unconstitutional and (ii) a permanent injunction prohibiting its implementation. On September 12, 2018, HDA moved for summary judgment on its claims. Two other plaintiffs, the Association for Accessible Medicines (\"AAM\") and SpecGx LLC (\"SpecGx\"), have presented a more surgical approach, challenging provisions of the OSA that forbid opioid distributors and manufacturers from passing on the costs of the OSA to downstream purchasers (the \"pass-through prohibition\") as unconstitutional and moving for injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   New York\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   has moved to dismiss all three cases on jurisdictional and prudential grounds. Proceeding from the foundational premise that assessments for OSA's stewardship fund constitute a tax, New York argues that the Court is foreclosed from hearing Plaintiffs' challenges pursuant to the Tax Injunction Act (the \"TIA\"), or, in the alternative, that the Court should abstain from so hearing under principles of comity or\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention. As further fallback positions, New York asks the Court to find the OSA constitutional, either in its current state or, if need be, after the excision of the pass-through prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A review of the record in these cases\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   confirms that while the animating concerns of the OSA are plainly valid, the method by which the Act extracts payments from opioid manufactures and distributors to redress those concerns violates the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The OSA is not a tax, but is rather a regulatory penalty on opioid manufacturers and distributors. And as currently structured, it improperly burdens interstate commerce. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that New York did not intend the OSA to survive absent the pass-through prohibition. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed in the remainder of this Opinion, HDA's motion for summary judgment is granted, as are AAM's and SpecGx's motions for preliminary injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs in the three lawsuits occupy different links within the opioid distribution\n   chain. Plaintiff HDA is the national trade association for pharmaceutical wholesale distributors. Its members do not manufacture, produce, or prescribe opioids. Instead, they are responsible for coordinating receipt and delivery between and among manufacturers and pharmacies, hospitals, and other dispensers of pharmaceuticals to consumers. (HDA Compl. \u00b6 9). By contrast, Plaintiff AAM is an association representing the leading manufacturers and distributors of generic and biosimilar medicines, manufacturers and distributors of bulk active pharmaceutical ingredients, and suppliers of other goods and services to the generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical industry. (AAM Compl. \u00b6 9). Plaintiff SpecGx is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, which develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceutical products and therapies, including generic opioid medications. (SpecGx Compl. \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HDA represents distributors of opioids, while SpecGx and members of AAM are manufacturers of generic opioids. None of the Plaintiffs is a manufacturer of brand-name opioids. As explained by SpecGx:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [G]eneric prescription drugs are sold by two primary paths: (i) the manufacturer sells the products to wholesale distributors under terms of a negotiated contract, after which the wholesale distributor then resells the product to retail pharmacies or other providers; and (ii) the manufacturer may also sell to national or regional pharmacy chains, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (SpecGx Compl. \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. New York's Opioid Stewardship Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties' submissions present divergent views of the OSA's legislative history. Ultimately, the Court's decision rests on the text of the OSA itself; the legislative history is largely irrelevant to the constitutional problems the Court has identified. However, given the parties' arguments concerning severability, the Court provides a brief discussion of the legislative history in order to illuminate the intentions of OSA's sponsors and supporters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The OSA's Introduction and Passage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As deaths continued to mount from abuse of opioids,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that the crisis would be\n   a priority in his State of the State Address before the New York State Legislature. (HDA 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). To that end, on January 16, 2018, the Governor introduced his proposed budget, which included the proposal that would eventually become the OSA: \"Opioid manufacturers have created an epidemic. We would have an opioid surcharge, 2 cents per milligram will be paid by the manufacture[rs] and would go to offset the costs that we're spending to fight opioid abuse [,] which are multiples of the $170 million.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the New York State Assembly debated the bill, Assemblywoman Helene Weinstein, the Chair of the Ways and Means Committee, stated that the OSA's cost would be borne by distributors and manufacturers of opioid medications. (Declaration of Seth Farber dated October 17, 2018 (\"Farber Decl.\" (6168, Dkt. # 42) ), Ex. K at 21). In response to concerns that the cost would ultimately be borne by downstream pharmacies (and, by extension, their customers), Member Weinstein further declared that it was \"certainly not the [drafter's] intention [to have pharmacies pay the OSA's surcharge].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). In subsequent discussion with Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, who was and remains Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, Defendant Commissioner Howard Zucker confirmed that the OSA was structured to ensure that payment would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"get filtered down to the end-user[.]\" (Declaration of Andrew Kratenstein dated September 12, 2018 (\"Kratenstein Decl.\" (6168, Dkt. # 37) ), Ex. K at 174-76). In the OSA's final form, this payment was given a name: the \"opioid stewardship payment.\" (HDA. 56.1 \u00b6 6). On April 12, 2018, the Governor signed the legislation into law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20N.Y.%20Sess.%20Laws%2057\">\n    2018 N.Y. Sess. Laws 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , S.7507-C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). The OSA was codified in two places, at New York Public Health Law \u00a7 3323 and New York State Finance Law \u00a7 97 -aaaaa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The OSA's Text and Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The OSA creates a $600 million fund (the \"Opioid Stewardship Fund\" or the \"Fund\") that is derived from annual assessments on pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesale distributors that are licensed to sell or distribute opioid products in New York (collectively, the \"Licensees\"). (HDA Compl. \u00b6 13). The assessment will be spread out over six years, with $100 million paid annually from 2019 through 2024; each year's assessment is calculated based on sales made the previous year and is payable the following year. (HDA 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 11-12). The assessment for each Licensee is expressed in terms of a \"ratable share\" and is calculated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) The total amount of [Morphine Milligram Equivalents (\"MMEs\") ] sold or distributed in the state of New York by the licensee for the preceding calendar year, as reported by the licensee pursuant to subdivision four of this section, shall be divided by the total amount of MME sold in the state of New York by all licensees pursuant to this article to determine the licensee payment percentage. The licensee payment percentage shall be multiplied by the total opioid stewardship payment. The product of such calculation shall be the licensee's ratable share. The department shall have the authority to adjust the total number of a licensee's MMEs to account for the nature and use of the product, as well as the type of entity purchasing the product from the licensee, when making such determination and adjust the ratable share accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (b) The licensee's total amount of MME sold or distributed, as well as the total amount of MME sold or distributed by all licensees under this article, used in the calculation of the ratable share\n   shall not include the MME of those opioids which are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) manufactured in New York state, but whose final point of delivery or sale is outside of New York state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) sold or distributed to entities certified to operate pursuant to article thirty-two of the mental hygiene law, or article forty of the public health law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (c) The department shall provide to the licensee, in writing, on or before October fifteenth, two thousand eighteen, the licensee's ratable share for the two thousand seventeen calendar year. Thereafter, the department shall notify the licensee in writing annually on or before October fifteenth of each year based on the opioids sold or distributed for the prior calendar year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n    N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). The New York State Department of Health (\"DOH\") is both calculator and payee of each Licensee's ratable share.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The pass-through prohibition that is at the heart of many of Plaintiffs' challenges is contained in two sections of the OSA. In the provision defining stewardship payments, the OSA states, \"No licensee shall pass the cost of their ratable share amount to a purchaser, including the ultimate user of the opioid, or such licensee shall be subject to penalties pursuant to subdivision ten of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n    N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Later, in the penalties provision, the Act notes that \"[w]here the ratable share, or any portion thereof, has been passed on to a purchaser by a licensee, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed one million dollars per incident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3323(10)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The ratable share payments are directed to the Opioid Stewardship Fund.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n    N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Of potential significance to the instant motions, the Fund is separate and not comingled with New York State's general fund.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2097\">\n    N.Y. State Fin. Law \u00a7 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -aaaaa(2). The OSA provides for the use of the Fund as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Moneys of the opioid stewardship fund, when allocated, shall be available, subject to the approval of the director of the budget, to support programs operated by the New York state office of alcoholism and substance abuse services or agencies certified, authorized, approved or otherwise funded by the New York state office of alcoholism and substance abuse services to provide opioid treatment, recovery and prevention and education services; and to provide support for the prescription monitoring program registry as established pursuant to section thirty-three hundred forty-three-a of the public health law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   At the request of the budget director, the state comptroller shall transfer moneys to support the costs of opioid treatment, recovery, prevention, education services, and other related programs, from the opioid stewardship fund to any other fund of the state to support this purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20State%20Fin.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2097\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 97-aaaaa(4)-(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also of potential significance, the OSA includes a severability provision that states in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, or section of this act shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair, or invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, or section directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the intent of the legislature that this act would have been enacted even if such\n   invalid provisions had not been included herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   N.Y. Sess. Laws ch. 57, pt. NN, \u00a7 4 (McKinney).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The DOH Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 15, 2018, DOH issued its guidance concerning interpretation of certain provisions of the OSA (the \"Guidance\"). (HDA 56.1 \u00b6 9; NY 56.1 Response \u00b6 9). The Guidance provided that the stewardship payments would be assessed on the \"initial transaction in the distribution chain when opioids are first sold or distributed within, or into, New York.\" (HDA 56.1 \u00b6 21; NY 56.1 Response \u00b6 21). The Guidance further explained that the pass-through prohibition was \"not intended to apply to price increases that are attributable to other ordinary changes in manufacture or distribution costs.\" (HDA 56.1 \u00b6 25; NY 56.1 Response \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The 2018 Assessments and the Industry's Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   DOH has already issued the ratable share assessments for 2018 - which, as noted, are based on 2017 sales and are payable to DOH on January 1, 2019. (SpecGx Br. 9). SpecGx relates that its ratable share payment is \"$1,256,326.33 ... based on 115,037,682 MMEs first sold and distributed by SpecGx into New York.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). SpecGx further relates, and New York does not dispute, that the ratable share payment per qualifying MME exceeds the average manufacturer price (or \"AMP\") of several generic opioids covered by the OSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11). In other words, on several of the opioids it manufactures, SpecGx has to pay more in assessments to the Fund than it makes in margins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The record also contains evidence that distributors are dealing with the OSA's pass-through prohibition by passing the costs of their ratable shares back up the supply chain to manufacturers. SpecGx reports, again without dispute, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   AmerisourceBergen Corp., one of the three national distributors of prescription medications, advised SpecGx on October 10, 2018, that it would, effective October 12, 2018, \"no longer accept opioid product shipments at the National Distribution Center in Columbus, Ohio intended for redistribution to AmerisourceBergen distribution centers\" in New York..... The letter further stated that \"[i]f you would like to continue shipping opioid products to the [National Distribution Center] to New York ... you agree to pay any tax, duty, levy, fee, assessment, tariff or any other charge of any nature imposed by any government authority on the sale or transfer of those opioid products\" - e.g., the OSA's Ratable Share.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (SpecGx Br. 12). At oral argument, Plaintiffs each declared that the economic consequence of the OSA could force them to abandon the generic opioid market in New York entirely. (Dec. 10 Tr. 33:9-13, 56:11-16, 92:1-93:24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   HDA filed its complaint on July 6, 2018, asking the Court to strike down the OSA as unconstitutional on eight grounds, arguing that it was: (i) an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder; (ii) unconstitutionally retroactive; (iii) a violation of the Takings Clause; (iv) a violation of Substantive Due Process; (v) a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause based on its extraterritorial effects; (vi) a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause based on its creation of an undue burden on interstate commerce; (vii) unconstitutionally vague as to the calculation of the surcharge; and (viii) unconstitutionally vague as to the calculation of the pass-through prohibition. (6168, Dkt. # 1). On September 12, 2018,\n   HDA filed its motion for summary judgment on substantially the same grounds. (6168, Dkt. # 27, 28). On October 17, 2018, New York filed its opposition to the motion for summary judgment, and a cross-motion to dismiss HDA's complaint on five grounds: (i) the TIA barred this Court from hearing the case; (ii) principles of comity warranted abstention in this case; (iii) the\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine warranted abstention in this case; (iv) the dispute lacked ripeness; and (v) HDA's complaint lacked plausibility. (6168, Dkt. # 41,44, 45). On November 7, 2018, HDA filed its joint opposition to the motion to dismiss and reply in support of summary judgment. (6168, Dkt. # 49). On November 16, 2018, New York filed its reply in support of the motion to dismiss. (6168, Dkt. # 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On September 7, 2018, AAM filed its complaint challenging the OSA along with a motion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the OSA's pass-through prohibition violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. (8180, Dkt. # 1, 8, 9). Unlike HDA, AAM did not ask the Court to strike down the entirety of the OSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On September 18, 2018, this Court accepted this case as related to HDA's challenge, and on September 20, 2018, it ordered the parties to follow the same briefing schedule. (8180, Dkt # 15). On October 17, 2018, New York filed its opposition to AAM's motion for a preliminary injunction, and a cross-motion to dismiss the complaint that echoed the motion filed in the HDA matter but added an argument that AAM lacked standing. (8180, Dkt. # 22, 25, 26). On November 7, 2018, AAM filed its opposition to the motion to dismiss and its reply in support of a preliminary injunction. (8180, Dkt. # 29, 30). On November 16, 2018, New York filed its reply in support of the motion to dismiss. (8180, Dkt. # 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On October 14, 2018, SpecGx filed a complaint and a motion for a preliminary injunction. In addition to the Dormant Commerce Clause issues that had been raised by others, SpecGx further argued that the OSA was preempted by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, Pub. Law No. 98-417,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%201585\">\n    98 Stat. 1585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments (\"Hatch-Waxman\"). (9830, Dkt. # 1, 7, 8). On November 5, 2018, this Court accepted this case as related to the prior two OSA challenges and set a briefing schedule. (9830, Dkt. # 25). On November 7, 2018, New York filed its opposition to the motion, and a cross-motion to dismiss the complaint on substantially the same grounds as the previous cases. (9830, Dkt. # 27, 30). On November 15, 2018, SpecGx filed its joint opposition to the motion to dismiss and reply in support of a preliminary injunction. (9830, Dkt. # 32). On November 27, 2018, New York filed its reply in support of the motion to dismiss. (9830, Dkt. # 34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court held oral argument on December 10, 2018, and informed the parties thereafter that a decision from the Court would issue before payments were due at the start of 2019, leaving the parties with time to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Yet, in doing so, they have analyzed the legal issues in similar ways. They have sketched a spectrum with a paradigmatic tax at one end and a paradigmatic fee at the other. The classic \"tax\" is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all, citizens. It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent for the benefit of the entire community.... The classic \"regulatory fee\" is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation.... It may serve regulatory purposes directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by making it more expensive.... Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly by, for example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's regulation-related expenses[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Courts facing cases that lie near the middle of this spectrum have tended (sometimes with minor differences reflecting the different statutes at issue) to emphasize the revenue's ultimate use, asking whether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a general tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or defrays the agency's costs of regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/#p685\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).

Examining the population subject to the charge provides the State a slightly better argument, as\n   <em>\n    Entergy\n   </em>\n   suggested that an exaction on one entity could remain a tax, and in this case there are many entities subject to the tax. However, the Second Circuit also suggested that \"[t]he category of persons or entities subject to such taxes ... be defined by general and open-ended criteria, even if only a few entities, or one entity alone, are subject to the tax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732297\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/228/#p231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732297\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/228/#p231\">\n    at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, at least as regards the 2018 ratable share assessments due on January 1, 2019, the class of entities is not general, but rather is a specific and defined group that can do nothing to change a preexisting (and, it bears noting, retroactively imposed) liability.

The OSA studiously avoids the use of the word \"tax\" throughout its provisions, referring exclusively to \"ratable shares,\" \"stewardship payments,\" and \"penalties.\" While the use of the word \"tax\" is certainly not dispositive, the language of the OSA is another factor that weighs against the State. If the line between taxes and fees is \"a spectrum with a paradigmatic tax at one end and a paradigmatic fee at the other,\"\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/#p685\">\n    967 F.2d at 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the OSA is indisputably closer to the fee end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even if OSA's stewardship payments were to be considered a tax, its pass-through prohibition, on which AAM and SpecGx focus their attacks, would not be. New York acknowledged during oral argument the weakness of the TIA arguments when applied to the pass-through prohibition. (Dec. 10 Tr. 18:20-19:6). It did so with good reason, as the Second Circuit has previously determined that a pass-through prohibition engrafted upon a revenue-raising measure is not a tax for TIA purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   As we have indicated the tax purpose of the legislation was to raise funds for the mass transit system. However, the purpose of the anti-pass through provision was not to raise taxes but \"to do nothing that will contribute to further increases in the price of petroleum products to (New York) consumers\" and \"to prevent such gross receipts tax from fueling inflation by prohibiting the pass through of such tax to the consumers of this state.\" N.Y. Act, ch. 272, s. 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   This objective is certainly not an exercise of a taxing power but a police power affecting the price structure of petroleum products. We agree that the State has the right to place the legal incidence of the tax upon the oil companies; it has selected its target. But in barring the targets of the tax from recovering their costs from the consumer directly or indirectly, the State has gone beyond its taxing powers and has employed its police powers\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    Mobil Oil Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tully\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361750\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/639/912/#p918\">\n    639 F.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 918 (2d Cir. 1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   New York proffers a distinction based on its role as a purchaser of opioids through Medicaid and, somewhat curiously, suggests that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Mobil Oil\n   </em>\n   rested at least in part on the statute's goal of fighting inflation. (NY-HDA Br. 8). In point of fact, the Circuit made clear that its decision rested on the nature of pass-through prohibitions themselves: \"No one questions the right of the State of New York to place the legal incidence of the tax upon the oil companies but it is an entirely different matter for the legislature to instruct the person taxed that he cannot raise the resources to pay the tax by increasing the price of his product.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361750\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/639/912/#p918\">\n    639 F.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, a challenge to the pass-through prohibition is clearly not barred by the TIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Comity Is Not Relevant to Consideration of the OSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As this Court does not consider either the OSA stewardship payments or its pass-through prohibition to be a tax, its analysis of tax comity is brief. While it is true that comity sweeps more broadly than the TIA, it does not encompass regulatory fees or penalties. Comity merely provides expanded grounds for federal courts to stand down in the tax context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   New York points to comity to argue that even if portions of the Act were classified as penalties rather than taxes, this Court must still refrain from hearing the case as it could disrupt the administration of state taxes. (NY-HDA Br. 23:22-24:4). For this proposition, it relies on the Second Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Abuzaid\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mattox\n   </em>\n   , where comity was invoked to bar a challenge to the penalty provision of New York's cigarette tax: \"Regardless of whether assessments made under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Tax%20Law%20%C2%A7%20481\">\n    N.Y.

Even then, the comity doctrine would not counsel this Court from abstaining from consideration of the pass-through prohibition. As noted,\n   <em>\n    Abuzaid\n   </em>\n   , on which New York principally relies, rested on a challenge to the enforcement of New York's criminal tax law, which makes it a felony to \" 'willfully attempt[ ] in any manner to evade or defeat ...

As AAM correctly points out, a taxpayer challenging the enforcement by the taxing authority of a criminal provision of the state tax code clearly poses a threat to state taxing power, in a way that a challenge to the pass-through prohibition does not. (AAM Br. 13 (\"[T]his case does not involve 'state taxing authorities,' does not involve taxpayer-plaintiffs, does not involve criminal tax violators, and does not pose a threat to the state's taxing apparatus.\") ). Striking down the OSA's pass-through prohibition would allow New York to collect the exact same amount of money from the exact same parties through the exact same means; all that would change is those bearing the cost of the tax. The tax comity doctrine is designed to protect a state's taxing apparatus, not the state's contemplation (or hopes) as to how market forces will respond to that apparatus. As such, even if the OSA stewardship payments were a tax, comity would not bar a challenge to the pass-through prohibition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Pullman\n    </em>\n    Abstention Is Not Appropriate to Consideration of the OSA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention is not appropriate in this case, as no construction of the OSA would render it constitutional. As with the question of comity, New York's\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   claim is largely focused on the pass-through prohibition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NY-HDA Br. 12-15).

Any plausible reading of these provisions prohibits the seller from passing\n   <em>\n    \"any portion\"\n   </em>\n   of the costs of the OSA downstream to New York opioid purchasers. But it is na\u00efvet\u00e9 to believe that the Licensees will simply absorb the additional costs, particularly given the record evidence of economic turmoil faced by manufacturers of generic opioids if they were to do so. If companies cannot pass the costs to consumers anywhere, the OSA raises issues of extraterritoriality. If companies cannot pass the costs on to New York consumers of opioids, but can pass them on to non-New York opioid purchasers, the OSA raises issues of interstate discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   New York's predicament is placed in sharp relief in its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss the case brought by AAM, which case only raised Commerce Clause arguments, though of two types. In relevant part, New York argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention is also appropriate because a state court could moot plaintiff's First Cause of Action by interpreting the pass-through provision to apply solely to opioid sales or distributions occurring in New York. Similarly, plaintiff's Second Cause of Action could be mooted by a broader interpretation that applies the provision to all sales and distributions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   (NY-AAM Br. 13-14). Fatal to New York's argument is its inability to offer a plausible reading of the OSA that would moot\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   challenges, and indeed there is no reading that would moot all Dormant Commerce Clause problems. New York's attempt to find some reading of the pass-through prohibition that could eliminate the effect on interstate commerce is akin to a search for a chemical reaction that destroys energy; costs in a single market, like energy in a closed system, do not simply disappear, but must be absorbed elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   New York also attempts to argue around this problem by pointing to the undefined term \"incident\" for what violates the pass-through provision, suggesting that \"incident\" may be defined narrowly to minimize problems. However, no matter how broadly or narrowly New York defines an incident, so long as the monetary penalty exists, it would raise questions under the Commerce Clause. Any minor ambiguity \"cannot avoid the necessity for constitutional adjudication.' \"\n   <em>\n    Naprstek\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Norwich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1014973\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/545/815/#p818\">\n    545 F.2d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818 (2d Cir. 1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The Challenges to the OSA Are Ripe for Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As noted, New York's arguments include those that posit inadequacies of the Court and those that posit inadequacies of the litigants. The first argument in the latter category, New York's ripeness challenge, is undercut by the payment requests it has already sent to the Licensees. Claims are not ripe if they depend upon \"contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Union Carbide\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203715\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/568/#p580\">\n    473 U.S. at 580-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203715\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/568/#p580\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The stewardship payment is certainly not a contingent future event, as the payments are due in a\n   few short weeks. Therefore, a challenge with respect to the stewardship payments is certainly ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Here as well, New York's argument is targeted primarily at the challenges to the pass-through prohibition. It argues that since \"the Act's pass-through prohibition cannot be applied until at least next year, Plaintiff[s] can hardly claim that any potential harm is imminent.\" (NY-AAM Br. 16). However, \"[a]n allegation of future injury may suffice if the threatened injury is 'certainly impending,' or there is a 'substantial risk' that the harm will occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Susan B.

Such is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Beginning January 1, 2019, Plaintiffs face a substantial risk that on each opioid sale they make, New York will impose a penalty of $1 million. Counsel for New York did not disavow an intention to enforce the pass-through prohibition at oral argument. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dec. 10 Tr. 64:5-13). And there are further financial consequences: AmerisourceBergen Corp. has informed the manufacturers with which it deals that they will be required to take on the full cost of the stewardship payments if they intend to continue making sales to New York, and SpecGx has announced its plans to exit the New York market. (SpecGx Reply 19). As with other aspects of its case, New York is not just arguing against Plaintiffs, but is also arguing against fundamental precepts of economics. Once the pass-through prohibition goes into effect on January 1, 2019, if not sooner, the harm is already present and no longer imminent. Therefore, the challenge is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    e. AAM and SpecGx Have Standing to Bring Their Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   New York does not challenge HDA's standing, but does challenge AAM's and SpecGx's standing to bring Dormant Commerce Clause claims on several bases.

New York relies on\n   <em>\n    Coalition for Competitive Electricity, Dynergy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zibelman\n   </em>\n   , which held that \"[t]o show standing for their dormant Commerce Clause claim, plaintiffs must demonstrate that their alleged injuries are traceable to (the 'result of,' or 'a consequence of') discrimination against interstate commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518904\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/906/41/#p58\">\n    906 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (2d Cir. 2018).

SpecGx has placed uncontested evidence into the record that the pass-through prohibition will make its sales to the New York market economically infeasible. (SpecGx Reply 17). In this litigation, New York seeks to shift the blame for this consequence onto third parties, such as AmerisourceBergen, that choose to charge back the costs, but the New York legislature clearly intended this precise result when it included the pass-through prohibition.

More specifically, the Court begins with a discussion of the Dormant Commerce Clause, as all three Plaintiffs allege that the pass-through prohibition violates the Dormant Commerce Clause. The Court agrees and holds the pass-through prohibition unconstitutional. The Court then discusses severability, as an examination of the OSA absent the pass-through prohibition is unnecessary, if the prohibition is not severable.

The Pass-Through Prohibition Violates the Dormant Commerce Clause Under Any Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Plainest Reading of the Pass-Through Prohibition Would Require the Extraterritorial Application of State Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   New York does not seriously dispute that the most natural reading of the OSA's pass-through provisions violates the Commerce Clause's prohibition on extraterritorial state legislation. Instead, it argues that it does not intend to apply the OSA to penalize wholly out-of-state transactions: \"[T]here is nothing in the record suggesting that DOH intends to take that expansive an approach to the Act. Notably, the Legislative History reflects a concern that New York impose the surcharge only to the extent that it can be done so constitutionally.\" (NY-AAM Opp. 10). However, New York's position is seriously, if not mortally, wounded by the fact that the text of the OSA places no such limitation on the pass-through prohibition, stating merely: \"Where the ratable share, or any portion thereof, has been passed on to a purchaser by a licensee, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed one million dollars per incident.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n    N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(c). Indeed, at other points, the OSA specifically references sales made within New York State.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3323(4) (\"Each manufacturer and distributor licensed under this article that sells or distributes opioids in the state of New York shall provide to the commissioner a report detailing all opioids sold or distributed by such manufacturer or distributor in the state of New York.\"). As AAM points out, New York nowhere concedes that it will never charge the penalty for out-of-state sales, only that it has displayed no current intention to do so. (AAM Reply 4 (\"Defendants could obviate AAM's First Cause of Action simply by agreeing that an out-of-state transaction is not subject to the Act's anti-pass-through provisions and accepting a consent decree to that effect.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   If OSA's provisions are given their clearest meaning, the Dormant Commerce Clause violation is clear. An opioid manufacturer based in Maine that wished to pass on the surcharge it paid on New York transactions by selling opioids at a markup to a pharmacy in New Mexico could face a million-dollar penalty from New York State. While the statute \"may not in explicit terms seek to regulate interstate commerce,\" that it does so \"nonetheless by its practical effect and design\" is abundantly clear.\n   <em>\n    C &amp; A Carbone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p394\">\n    511 U.S. at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147591\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/383/#p394\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court turns to an examination of the OSA under the Dormant Commerce Clause, where the penalty provision is assumed to apply only in-state, and where the text is understood to mean, \"Where the ratable share, or any portion thereof, has been passed on to a\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   purchaser by a licensee, the commissioner may impose a penalty not to exceed one million dollars per incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.

New York opioid customers would be protected from any price increases in their purchases, and New York would receive a source of funding subsidized by the out-of-state purchasers of opioids. New York could completely avoid the political consequences of its action, as no New York-based business or taxpayer would face a higher cost. Rather, out-of-state drug purchasers, with no representation in New York's legislature or executive, would bear the cost of New York's policy program. This shifting of burdens and benefits is antithetical to the idea of intra-national free trade and demonstrates why the Dormant Commerce Cause exists, i.e., to prohibit discrimination as to \"any part of the stream of commerce - from wholesaler to retailer to consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/#p193\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/#p193\">\n    at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/#p193\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   New York attempts to argue around this clear problem by proffering alternative constructions of the OSA. It suggests that the pass-through prohibition could be limited to cases where the cost would otherwise be filtered back through the state through Medicaid, or to situations where a company \"contractually offloads the surcharge onto customers or expressly imposes the surcharge as a component of the price for opioid product\"; alternatively, it suggests that companies \"could distribute their ratable shares amongst all other drug purchasers (i.e., non-opioid sales), both in and outside New York, thereby minimizing if not rendering insignificant any purported economic harm or conflict with federal law.\" (NY-AAM Opp. 8-10; NY-SG Opp. 17). The first and most obvious problem with these arguments is that the text of the Act offers no support for any of these interpretations. Indeed, the legislature specifically included the term \"\n   <em>\n    any portion thereof\n   </em>\n   \" in the statutory text.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Health%20Law%20%C2%A7%203323\">\n    N.Y. Pub. Health Law \u00a7 3323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10)(c). New York essentially asks the Licensees, including Plaintiffs, to trust that DOH will not enforce the statute as written. The Court will not force these entities to serve as test subjects in New York's evolving effort to address constitutional issues that could easily have been remedied at the drafting stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   What is more, no matter what construction New York provides, the Act would still have the effect of discriminating between the purchasers of opioids in New York and those outside it. If the penalty is limited to situations where New York would pay through Medicaid, New York Medicaid would gain a discount that other states' Medicaid programs would not. If the charge could be passed contractually outside New York but not within, New York customers would gain an advantage unavailable to their out-of-state counterparts. Even if New York purchasers of non-opioid pharmaceuticals could be forced to pay a percentage of the surcharge, this would still not remedy the problem, inasmuch\n   as the Act still treats New York customers of opioids differently than out-of-state customers of the same product. New York's problem remains the same throughout: the Supreme Court has expressly held that the Constitution prohibits \"legislation that has the practical effect of establishing 'a scale of prices for use in other states.' \"\n   <em>\n    Healy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n    491 U.S. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213752\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/324/#p336\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The cases that New York cites in its defense only underscore the problem.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   This case exemplifies the second line of Judge Cardozo's admonition; \"saving\" the OSA absent the pass-through prohibition would clearly \"pervert\" it. As HDA points out,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   Governor Cuomo assured legislators that \"[l]anguage in the budget ensures the costs are borne by industry, not by consumers.\"... [I]n a legislative hearing, after an assemblyman expressed that \"a lot of us are concerned on how this surcharge could go to the consumer,\" Commissioner Zucker promised that the Surcharge will not \"get filtered down to the end-user.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   (HDA Br. 25). Assembly Member Weinstein, who presented and defended the law before the Assembly, declared similarly that it was \"certainly not the [drafter's] intention [to have pharmacies pay the OSA's surcharge].\" (Farber Decl., Ex. K at 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   New York's response is not to debate the legislative history, which makes clear the State's desire to place the surcharge directly on distributors and manufacturers. Instead, New York points to the revenue-raising goals of the law. Its discussion of severability strikes the Court as half-hearted, if not defeatist:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   [E]ven if the pass-through provision were struck down judicially, the remainder of the Act could potentially remain in force. Though the Act's revenue-raising purpose would be seriously impaired, conceivably alternative funding for the programs at issue could be supplied through subsequent legislation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   (NY-HDA Opp. 22). When New York suggests that subsequent legislation would be necessary to ensure the OSA achieves its goals absent the prohibition, it is not fairly grappling with a standard that requires examination of whether severance \"would leave a regulatory scheme that the legislature never intended.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Advert.

The Court understands that New York prefers to have $100 million in anticipated stewardship charges in its budget, but the Governor, Commissioner, and legislators explicitly pledged that the costs of the bill would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   flow to end-users and pharmacies. This clearly suggests that a bill that merely imposed a surcharge, without any mechanism for preventing the costs of that surcharge from flowing to the consumer, was \"never intended.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   To be sure, the OSA contains a severability clause.

Here, AAM and SpecGx have presented credible evidence that the OSA, and in particular its pass-through prohibition, will cause them to alter dramatically, if not eliminate altogether, their sales of opioid medications in New York.
