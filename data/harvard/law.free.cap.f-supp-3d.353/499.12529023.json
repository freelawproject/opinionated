(\"Audubon\"). Plaintiff asserted claims against Audubon for its failure to comply with the building requirements of Title III of the ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., at the facility known as Audubon Zoo. Record Doc. No. 1. Plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief, attorney's fees, costs and expenses. Record Doc. No. 1, p. 6. The substantive claims were resolved by the court's entry of a consent decree that was agreed upon by the parties. Record Doc. Nos. 29; 31. The consent decree provides in pertinent part that \"[p]laintiff is the prevailing party to this action.\" Record Doc. No. 31, at p. 9, \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As prevailing party, plaintiff filed his motion for attorney's fees and costs, seeking $70,380.00 in attorney's fees and $9,104.57 in costs. Record Doc. Nos. 39; 42-3; 45. Defendant filed a timely opposition memorandum, in which it concedes that plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees. Record Doc. 40, at p. 3. Defendant argues, however, that the amount of costs and fees sought by plaintiff is unreasonable. Record Doc. No. 40, at p. 3. Plaintiff was permitted to file a reply memorandum, in which he attempted to explain in greater detail the reasons for the amount of hours billed and fees and costs sought, while supplementing his motion for attorney's fees with contemporaneous time sheets. Record Doc. No. 42-3; 45. Defendant then submitted a six-page sur-reply memorandum. Record Doc. No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Having considered the written submissions of the parties, the record, and the applicable law, I find that plaintiff's motion should be GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. While an award of attorney's fees and costs is warranted, the amount of plaintiff's requested attorney's fees and costs must be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Audubon \"does not dispute the fact that Plaintiff is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees; its opposition is instead based on the truly exorbitant amount of the request.\" Record Doc. No. 40, at p. 3. As noted above, the consent decree, to which defendant agreed, expressly identifies plaintiff as the \"prevailing party.\" Under the ADA, an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party is directed to the court's discretion. \"In any action ... commenced pursuant to this chapter, the court ...,\n   <em>\n    in its discretion\n   </em>\n   , may allow the prevailing party, ... a\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   attorney's fee, including litigation expenses, and costs ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012205\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Contrary to this admonition, plaintiff's motion was initially supported by a lengthy 23-page memorandum; the joint declaration of his two attorneys who recorded work on this matter; expert reports with their resumes and qualifications; an affidavit of attorney William Most attesting to what constitutes a reasonable hourly rate in New Orleans; contemporaneous time sheets describing the work done by plaintiff's attorneys; interrogatories and requests for production of documents from plaintiff's counsel to defendant's counsel; emails between plaintiff's counsel and defendant's counsel concerning settlement; resumes of plaintiff's attorneys; travel receipts of plaintiff's counsel and experts; and invoices reflecting the costs expended on this litigation. Record Doc. Nos. 39-1 through 39-18. Defendant's opposition memorandum consisted of 17 pages, with attached suggested reductions to plaintiff's counsel's computation of billed time. Record Doc. Nos. 40 through 40-2. Plaintiff subsequently submitted a 10-page reply memorandum, to which he again attached a joint declaration of plaintiff's attorneys and contemporaneous time sheets describing the work done by plaintiff's attorneys. Record Doc. Nos. 42-2; 42-3; 45. Defendant then submitted a six-page sur-reply memorandum. Record Doc. No. 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Both sides agree that calculation of recoverable attorney's fees begins with the familiar lodestar evaluation, which involves multiplying the reasonable hourly rates of plaintiff's lawyers by the reasonable number of hours expended. Plaintiff seeks to recover $70,380.00 in fees, including 203.9 hours for one attorney billing at $300 per hour, and 30.7 hours for a second attorney billing at $300 per hour. Record Doc. No. 42-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Audubon argues that the requested time should be reduced because plaintiff's counsel spent excessive time on the matter. Record Doc. No. 40, at pp. 6-9. It also contends that plaintiff unreasonably incurred the higher billing rate of two senior attorneys, when the lower rate of a more junior attorney or paralegal was sufficient to handle such a routine, largely uncontested lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 5-6. It also notes that a substantial sum of what is sought relates to the drafting of a motion for summary judgment, when the motion was never ruled on by the court and became unnecessary after the substantive claims were resolved by consent decree.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 9-10.

In addition, these are all Title III claims, and the law in each is the same.

Defendant argues that Magistrate Judge Knowles's analysis is equally applicable to the instant matter. Finally, in response to plaintiff's assertion that defendant's opposition was \"riddled with math errors,\" Record Doc. No. 45, at pp. 8-9, defendant revised its total reasonable amount of expenses calculation to $6,920.00 and total reasonable attorney's fees calculation to $13,242.50, arguing that the total reasonable amount should be $20,162.50. Record Doc.

Under the lodestar method,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [t]he determination of a fees award is a two-step process.

The court should exclude all time that is excessive, duplicative, or inadequately documented.

Most states that he has been practicing law for only seven years and represents plaintiffs in civil rights and ADA cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1-2. He swears that his hourly rate is $325 per hour, and that $300 per hour is a reasonable rate for both attorneys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiff also notes that three years ago, Mussman was awarded an hourly rate of $275 per hour by Magistrate Judge Knowles of this court in one of Mussman's other, substantially similar ADA cases in which he represented the same plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elmwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201245770\">\n    2015 WL 1245770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 ; Record Doc. No. 39-1, at p. 22. Magistrate Judge Knowles concluded at that time that \"[c]onsidering the prevailing market rates in the Greater New Orleans area, and the reasonable fees set by the courts in this district, the Court finds that $275.00 per hour is a reasonable rate for the services of Mussman.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel argues that because Mussman has three more years of experience\n   than he possessed when\n   <em>\n    Elmwood\n   </em>\n   was decided, and based on Most's affidavit, his reasonable hourly rate has increased to $300 per hour. Record Doc. No. 39-1, at pp. 22-23. I disagree with plaintiff's counsel and find that increasing his awardable hourly rate to $300 per hour on these grounds is unreasonable at this time. Instead, an hourly rate of $275 per hour, as has recently and consistently been found to be reasonable for lawyers with similar expertise and experience in ADA cases in this market, is reasonable. Only a little more than a year has lapsed since the most recent of these $275-per-hour awards in this district.\n   <em>\n    Herbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203216583\">\n    2017 WL 3216583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9. The future attainment of some milestone number of years of practice experience-such as 20 years-might justify an increase in plaintiff's counsel's awardable rate to $300 per hour at that time. For now, however, I find that $275 per hour is reasonable. Ku's comparable 16 years of experience qualifies her for the same reasonable hourly rate of $275 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to the cases awarding $275 per hour, I find that $275 per hour also represents a reasonable blending of various other hourly rates awarded in other cases, some higher and some lower than $275 per hour.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mr. Mudbug, Inc. v.

Nos. 42-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I find that the attorneys' time is generally well-documented; however, the exercise of billing judgment concerning the invoices is inadequate. For the reasons discussed below, I find that the time expended by plaintiff's attorneys must be divided into two distinct components and evaluated separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Time Incurred Until Entry of Order Granting Joint Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The first component of time incurred consists of the hours expended from the outset of the litigation through the order granting the parties' joint motion to dismiss the matter with prejudice on May 10, 2018, Record Doc. No. 33. These are the hours spent on the substantive portion of the case, including client consultation, investigation, pleading, disclosures, settlement negotiations and settlement consummation. This time is reflected in plaintiff's submissions at Record Doc. No. 42-3, pp. 1-8. I find that some efforts have been made to exercise billing judgment in this portion of the case, but those efforts are inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff's counsel's time and task reports indicate that they wrote off only some duplicative and excessive time entries. Record Doc. Nos. 39-12; 42-3. Based on my review of plaintiff's supplemental time records, a percentage reduction is warranted because plaintiff exercised inadequate billing judgment. As an initial matter, I reduce to zero (0) all hours billed by plaintiff's counsel for attorney travel and for time spent on Mussman's\n   <em>\n    pro hac vice\n   </em>\n   application. Plaintiff is a resident of Louisiana. I see no reason why this case required out-of-state counsel, with the added travel and other costs that the hiring of such counsel requires. Numerous local lawyers known to this court have ADA expertise. Plaintiff has employed local counsel in prosecuting exactly this kind of case in other lawsuits he has pursued in this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v.

Accordingly, I find that a 40% reduction in plaintiff's fees sought for the substantive portion of the case is appropriate. These reductions reduce the time for which compensation is sought for these tasks from 142.4 hours for Mussman to 85.44 hours, and from 23.1 hours for Ku to 13.86 hours for the substantive portion of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on the foregoing findings, I conclude that the following reasonably expended time multiplied by the reasonable hourly rates set out above yields the following awardable amounts:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-65\"><strong><em>Reasonable</em></strong> <strong><em>Reasonable</em></strong> <strong><em>Total:</em></strong> <strong><em>Professional</em></strong> <strong><em>Hours</em></strong> <strong><em>Hourly</em></strong> <strong><em>Time (\u00d7) Rate</em></strong> (<strong><em>Minus Reduction</em></strong>) <strong><em>Rate</em></strong> <strong>L.

The total time spent by plaintiff's counsel in litigating their fee request, reflected at Record Doc. No. 42-3 at pp. 8-12, is 69.1 hours. Plaintiff's counsel seeks compensation for 165.5\n   hours for the substantive portion of the case. 165.5 plus 69.1 is 234.6 hours. The amount sought for the fee request is almost 30% of the total sought. To grant compensation for a fee request that reflects such a high percentage of the total time sought would elevate the fee contest to precisely the kind of second major litigation that must be avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this case, preparation of a motion for attorney's fees should have been a straightforward matter based upon the same kinds of papers counsel have filed in other cases. Awardable rates for the lawyers of plaintiff's counsel's firm in this case have been the recent subject of evaluation by this court. Preparation of a motion for attorney's fees should not constitute nearly a third of the total time expended in this matter, particularly as this case was resolved by consent decree and without much court activity. Plaintiff's counsel's contemporaneous time sheets contain entries that illustrate lack of billing judgment in the fee application, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 1.7 hours on July 16, 2018, to \"conduct legal research regarding lodestar and Johnson factors for motion for fees\" (excessive);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 0.2 hours on August 1, 2018, to \"review defendant's counter-offer on fees; discuss w/client and [Ku]; draft email MD responding to same\" (vague, block billing);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 2.2 hours on August 17, 2018, to \"assist William Most to prepare declaration in support of motion for fees; correspondence w/William Most as fee expert re: same\" (excessive);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 2.5 hours on August 21, 2018, to \"edit/revise memo of law for grammar/spelling errors\" (excessive);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 2.7 hours on August 21, 2018, to \"check all citations for errors\" (excessive);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 3.3 hours on August 22, 2018, to\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   \"review ... motion for fees, memo and decl. w/all attachments, edit as necessary\" (duplicative, excessive in light of hours already expended); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 2.0 hours on September 10, 2018, on \"initial draft of hypothetical junior associates section of reply\" (excessive).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Under these circumstances, I find that a 65% reduction is appropriate, to remedy plaintiff's counsel's failure to exercise billing judgment in this second component of the case. These reductions reduce the time for which compensation is sought for these tasks from 61.5 hours for Mussman to 21.525 hours, and from 7.6 hours for Ku to 2.66 hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based on the foregoing findings, I conclude that the following time reasonably expended multiplied by the reasonable hourly rates set out above yields the following awardable amounts:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-78\"><strong><em>Reasonable</em></strong> <strong><em>Reasonable</em></strong> <strong><em>Total:</em></strong> <strong><em>Professional</em></strong> <strong><em>Hours</em></strong> <strong><em>Hourly</em></strong> <strong><em>Time (\u00d7) Rate</em></strong> (<strong><em>Minus Reduction</em></strong>) <strong><em>Rate</em></strong> <strong>L.

The customary fees have already been evaluated above in establishing reasonable hourly rates. There is no indication that the requested fee reflects the professional relationship between plaintiff and his counsel. The case was not undesirable. Awards in similar cases have already been taken into account above in establishing the hourly rates.
