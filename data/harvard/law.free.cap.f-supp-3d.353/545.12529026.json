(\"Infinite\"), asks the Court to dismiss Plaintiff Seven Seas Technologies, Inc.'s (\"Seven Seas\") Complaint against it. Mot. to Dismiss [9]. For the reasons that follow, Infinite's motion is granted in part but otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Facts and Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case centers on the contractual relationship between Plaintiff Seven Seas and Conduent Incorporated (\"Conduent\"), a non-party to this suit. Conduent provides \"broad and comprehensive services in support of the administration of Mississippi Medicaid funds paid to Mississippi healthcare providers and entities who serve the residents and citizens covered by the Mississippi Medicaid Program.\" Compl. [1] \u00b6 10. Under their contract, Seven Seas\n   \"performed contract IT services ... to support ... Conduent's services to Mississippi residents and providers pursuant to ... Conduent's contract with the Mississippi [Division of Medicaid.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Infinite also \"maintained a contract relationship with Conduent to support Conduent's contract services in various locations ..., and Infinite at some time became interested in the work [Seven Seas] was performing on behalf of the Mississippi Medicaid program through the Conduent contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Seven Seas alleges that, beginning in the spring of 2017, \"Infinite began to implement a strategy and execute plans aimed at disruption and destruction of the [Seven Seas/]Conduent business and contractual relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. In particular, Infinite \"undertook repeated, consistent, orchestrated attempts to hire away ... employees from [Seven Seas],\" even though the Seven Seas employees had signed non-compete and non-disclosure agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Seven Seas claims Infinite \"targeted [its] employees ... who had proprietary knowledge as to[ ] the Mississippi Medicaid Management Information System.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Seven Seas, Infinite informed the employees it targeted that the Seven Seas contract with Conduent \"was terminating at a time when, in fact, it was not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. As a result of Infinite's efforts, some Seven Seas \"employees working on Mississippi Medicaid projects have departed,\" and whereas Conduent previously renewed its contract with Seven Seas on an annual basis, \"toward the end of 2017,\" those \"contract renewals began to occur only on a month-to-month basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 25. Conduent ultimately terminated its contract with Seven Seas effective March 19, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Seven Seas filed this lawsuit against Infinite on March 2, 2018. It asserts state-law claims for intentional interference with a business relationship, intentional interference with a contractual relationship, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition, unjust enrichment, negligence, and willful misconduct. Infinite moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The Court has both personal and subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.

Yet Infinite frequently faults Seven Seas for failing to connect every dot or aver direct evidence of every essential element. For example, Infinite argues that Seven Seas\n   has not stated a case for interference with a contract because it did not allege that Infinite discussed Seven Seas' contract with Conduent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply [16] at 6. Similarly, Infinite says Seven Seas-which lost a decade-old contract-failed to show Infinite caused any damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite such arguments, Seven Seas is not required to plead a complete case on the first day of litigation and will never be required to establish each element with direct evidence-circumstantial evidence will suffice. At this stage, Seven Seas is required merely to plead a claim that is facially plausible.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[10] at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Starting with intent, Seven Seas notes that under Rule 9(b), \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a [party's] mind may be alleged generally.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). And as noted in the standards section of this Order, Seven Seas need not plead direct evidence supporting every essential element. Indeed the intent component of a tortious-interference claim \"may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    AmSouth Bank v. Gupta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365276\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/205/#p214\">\n    838 So.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 (Miss. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Infinite does not address these arguments in its reply, and the Court concludes that the factual averments are sufficient to infer intent. For example, Seven Seas pleads specific instances in which Infinite allegedly recruited Seven Seas employees, telling them that Infinite \"would be taking over the Mississippi projects within the next couple or few months.\" Compl. [1] \u00b6 22(c). Such averments plausibly suggest an intent to damage Seven Seas' business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Turning to causation, Infinite says Seven Seas has pleaded no facts to support its contention that the loss of employees Infinite allegedly caused \"impaired its ability to perform its contract with Conduent.\" Def.'s Mem. [10] at 7. Yet Seven Seas did just that. Seven Seas alleged that Conduent had always been satisfied with its work, but Infinite caused Seven Seas employees to depart and that this \"materially affected [Seven Seas'] ability to perform the contract,\" leading to Conduent's decision not to renew. Compl. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 12, 27. Seven Seas also pleaded temporal proximity. Conduent had renewed the Seven Seas contract each year for about ten years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 25. That changed to a month-to-month renewal in 2017 during the time Infinite was allegedly interfering with Seven Seas' business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. Seven Seas then lost the contract. These allegations \"raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of\" a causal connection between Infinite's alleged actions and Conduent's termination of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, as to whether Infinite's conduct was unjustified, Infinite argues that its \"alleged conduct was [no]thing more than fair, competitive recruiting.\" Def.'s Mem. [10] at 5. But the Complaint contains allegations that Infinite engaged in \"overt efforts to induce [Seven Seas] employees to breach their non-compete agreements and disclose confidential and proprietary information.\" Compl. [1] \u00b6 22. More specifically, Seven Seas avers Infinite's efforts included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) contacting a Seven Seas employee about an available opportunity with Infinite for a \"COBOI Developer experienced in Medicaid applications ... at a time when [Seven Seas] was performing its Mississippi contract obligations through this employee,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) telling seven Seven Seas employees that Seven Seas' \"Mississippi contract with Conduent would not be renewed and would last only a few more weeks (a fact that either was not true, was not known to or communicated to [Seven Seas], and/or should not have been known to Infinite)\" and offering those employees jobs, \"after which all o[r] some of the [Seven Seas] employees mentioned the non-compete agreements and were told that this was not a problem,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) in October 2017, informing a Seven Seas employee \"that an opportunity for employment existed with Infinite because\n   it would be taking over the Mississippi projects within the next couple or few months\" and further telling that employee \"that complete legal support would be provided should the ... employee make the transition\n   <em>\n    and breach\n   </em>\n   the non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreement existing with\" Seven Seas,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (4) recruiting one Seven Seas employee for \"a Programmer Analyst position [that] was available in Ridgeland, MS because Infinite was transitioning into that project,\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (5) informing a Seven Seas employee \"that Infinite was actively pursuing the Mississippi project which they anticipated taking over\" and assuring that employee \"that any legal issues [with the non-compete and non-disclosure agreements] would be handled by Infinite's legal team,\" and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (6) in October 2017, calling a Seven Seas employee three times and leaving a voice message \"stating that Infinite was transitioning to take over the Mississippi project and asking if the employee would have interest in a Programmer Analyst position to assist Conduent in Ridgeland, Mississippi.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, Seven Seas has pleaded something other than what Infinite describes as fair competition. Instead, it says Infinite poached Seven Seas employees by misleading them and offering \"complete legal support\" should they \"make the transition\n   <em>\n    and breach\n   </em>\n   \" the non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreements. Compl. [1] \u00b6 22(c) (emphasis added). Seven Seas likewise avers that Infinite did so because it lacked knowledge of the \"unique and specific claims processing capabilities\" that Seven Seas developed for the Conduent contract,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23, and that Infinite \"enhance[ed] its own capabilities while simultaneously undermining [Seven Seas'] capabilities,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Infinite has not made a sufficient legal argument that these activities-if true-would be considered nothing more than \"fair competitive recruiting.\" Def.'s Mem. [10] at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Infinite also argues that Seven Seas failed to plead that it actually lost employees to Infinite, Def.'s Mem. [10] at 5, and even if it did, Seven Seas has not attached their employment contracts or shown that the former employees breached them, Def.'s Reply [16] at 3. To begin, Seven Seas adequately pleaded that it lost employees to Infinite.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30. And as for the alleged breach, that argument would go to the merits, not plausibility. The facts alleged state a plausible claim that Infinite coaxed the employees to leave, offering legal aid even if they breached their contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Infinite makes other arguments as to Count I, but they fail to fully account for what Seven Seas pleaded and demand more than Rule 8 requires. Viewed in the light most favorable to Seven Seas, it has pleaded a plausible claim for tortious interference with a business relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B. Count II: Tortious Interference with Contract\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition to establishing the four elements of a tortious-interference-with-a-business-relationship claim, the plaintiff in a tortious-interference-with-contract claim \"must prove that an enforceable obligation existed between the plaintiff and another\n   party\" and \"that the contract would have been performed but for the alleged interference.\"\n   <em>\n    Par Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11836478\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/708/44/#p48\">\n    708 So.2d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the first four elements are the same as Count I, the Court's ruling on those elements applies to this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the fifth element, Infinite makes what seems like a simple argument-you cannot state a claim for tortious interference with a contract without a breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. [10] at 7. It then asserts that \"Plaintiff cites no authority supporting a claim for interference with contract when the contract was not breached, but instead simply expired on its own terms and was not renewed.\" Def.'s Reply [16] at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Not so. In its response, Seven Seas cites three Mississippi cases suggesting that this tort can exist when there is no actual breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. [14] at 14-15. For example, Seven Seas cites\n   <em>\n    Black v.

Here, Seven Seas alleges that it has developed \"unique and specific claims processing capabilities specific to the Mississippi Medicaid Management Information System.\" Compl. [1] \u00b6 23. At this stage, the Court finds these allegations sufficient to plausibly state the existence of a trade secret under the MUTSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Precision Spine, Inc. v. Zavation, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:15-CV-681-LG-RHW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20866965\">\n    2016 WL 866965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.

Mar. 2, 2016) (finding allegation that information \"concerning the design and manufacture of [the plaintiff's] products\" constituted trade secret sufficient to state a claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The closer question is whether Seven Seas adequately pleaded that Infinite induced anyone to disclose a trade secret. In its Complaint, Seven Seas avers that (1) its employees had knowledge of its secrets, Compl. [1] \u00b6 19; (2) Infinite desired that knowledge and needed it to perform the Mississippi Medicaid contract it hoped to take from Seven Seas,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20866965\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; (3) it therefore induced Seven Seas' employees to leave,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 30, by informing them that even if they breached the non-disclosure agreements Infinite would take care of it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22(b), (c), (e), and (g); and (5) Infinite \"attempted to convert this proprietary information and know-how to its own use and business advantage[, b]y enhancing its own capabilities ...

In this case, the averments regarding Infinite's alleged use of the information sounds conclusory. But only Infinite and its employees know whether any secrets were divulged. The Complaint therefore\n   paints a circumstantial case, observing Infinite's efforts to acquire employees with knowledge of the Mississippi Medicaid services and the resulting work Infinite acquired from Conduent to perform those services. While there is no direct evidence at this point, the averments must be viewed in the light most favorable to Seven Seas, and in that light they \"raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary claims or elements.\"\n   <em>\n    In re S. Scrap Material Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751810\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/541/584/#p587\">\n    541 F.3d at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, as in other sections of its briefs, Infinite argues that Seven Seas has not pleaded various facts. For example, it says Seven Seas \"failed to support the economic value of the purported secret(s)\"; whether they were \"readily ascertainable by proper means\"; and whether they were \"subject to reasonable efforts to maintain secrecy.\" Def.'s Mem. [10] at 9. But Seven Seas did allege\n   <em>\n    facts\n   </em>\n   suggesting that the information was subject to non-disclosure agreements and that Infinite must have placed some value on the information given its efforts to obtain it. Again, the case is at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. Perhaps the arguments will have more teeth later, but they are denied for now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   D.
