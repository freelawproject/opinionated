More specifically, plaintiffs assert deprivations of their constitutional rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion under the First Amendment and their right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment as a result of defendant city of New Bern and defendant Todd Conway's (\"Conway\") alleged interference with plaintiffs' religious picketing activities at the New Bern Mumfest (\"Mumfest\") in both 2015 and 2017.

Defendants filed response in opposition on August 7, 2018, including affidavits in support from Brenda Blanco, city clerk for the city of New Bern; Marc Stephens, city manager for the city of New Bern; Toussaint Summers, Jr., chief of the New Bern police department; and defendant Conway, officer of the city of New Bern police department. Defendants additionally submit a current copy of Chapter 66, Article III of the Code, as adopted by the city council of the city of New Bern and thereafter amended.

Plaintiffs' Activities at Mumfest in 2015\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   According to defendants, MumFest is an annual fall festival that has been held for the past 37 years in the historic downtown of the city of New Bern. (DE 22 at 2). The public is invited to enjoy a wide variety of entertainment, attractions, exhibitors, and food, all locations of which are held open to the public free of charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Around 100,000 people attended MumFest in 2015 and 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs allege, and defendants dispute, that the city issues permits to allow organizers to conduct Mumfest. (Compl. (DE 1) \u00b6\u00b6 22-26; DE 22 at 10 (\"MumFest is not an event which requires a permit, and it is open to the general public\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in 2015, plaintiffs were peacefully sharing their religious, political, and social message on the city's sidewalks and streets near the festival areas, during the festival, (Compl. (DE 1) \u00b6 32),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the city enforced the Code\n   regarding picketing by informing plaintiffs they were not allowed to speak to or distribute literature to festival attendees during the festival and by not allowing plaintiffs to carry a replica of a cross, while other individuals were allowed to carry five-foot-tall \"windmills\" on the city's sidewalks and streets, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-44).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   More specifically, plaintiffs allege that plaintiff Crowley entered the festival areas in 2015, but defendant Conway banned him from distributing literature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33). Defendant Conway also banned plaintiff O'Connell from entering the festival unless he agreed to leave his cross outside the festival area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff O'Connell attempted to stand in one location on the city's sidewalks and streets near the festival areas to hold his cross, but defendant Conway instructed two festival workers to park their trash utility cart in front of plaintiff O'Connell and directed them to place the cart in reverse so that the \"beep\" warning would drown out plaintiff O'Connell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). Defendant Conway and the event workers then laughed together while the constant \"beep\" sound emanated from the cart, and defendant Conway returned with another utility cart later in the day and engaged in the same activity again. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   C. Plaintiffs' Activities at Mumfest in 2017\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that in 2017, plaintiff O'Connell was again peacefully sharing his religious, political, and social message on the city's sidewalks and streets in and around the festival areas, during the festival. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55). Thereafter, a city representative ordered plaintiff O'Connell to cease and desist expressing his messages on the city's sidewalks and streets in and around the festival areas, or face arrest and incarceration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56). Plaintiffs allege that a city officer \"enforced the Code\" and \"admitted that the City was subjectively enforcing the Code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57). Plaintiffs allege the city enforced the Code by informing plaintiff O'Connell that he was not allowed to carry a replica of a cross on the city's sidewalks and streets in and around the festival areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   D. Plaintiffs' Planned Future Activities\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that on \"upcoming days - including but not limited to days in May 2018 through December 2022 - Plaintiffs have concrete plans to engage in their constitutionally protected activities by peacefully expressing religious, political,\n   and social speech within the City's Public Spaces, including during festivals and other events.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.

Defendants additionally assert that notwithstanding, the police department sought to protect plaintiffs' rights, and in 2015 intervened in an altercation wherein a Mumfest attendee attempted to use physical force in response to plaintiffs' behavior, causing the police department to arrest the Mumfest attendee and to allow plaintiffs to continue picketing.
