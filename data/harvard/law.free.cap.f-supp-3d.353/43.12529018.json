No. 6). Specifically, Plaintiffs seek to notify \"all similarly situated FedEx delivery drivers around the country\" concerning their right to opt into the suit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). After consideration of the parties' submissions and hearing on October 2, 2018, the court grants Plaintiffs' motion for conditional certification in part, and denies it in part for the reasons that follow.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The background facts are stated in the court's earlier decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   FedEx Ground, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a business engaged in business and residential ground package delivery services. FedEx Ground provides ground service to 100% of the continental United States population. In 2016, FedEx Ground had revenues in excess of $16 billion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs Roy and Trumbull are both residents of Massachusetts .... FedEx Ground employed Plaintiffs as full-time delivery drivers through intermediary entities that FedEx Ground calls \"independent service providers,\" or \"ISPs.\" Roy worked for FedEx Ground from February 2015 to January 2017. Trumbull worked for FedEx Ground from late 2015 to February 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs were eligible to receive overtime and regularly worked over forty hours per week delivering packages for FedEx Ground. Yet, Plaintiffs were not paid time-and-a-half their regular rate for those hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Dkt. No. 41) (footnote omitted). Additional details will be provided in the analysis of the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that they are entitled to conditional certification because all drivers to whom they seek to issue notice are similarly situated (Dkt. No. 6). FedEx Ground opposes the motion on two grounds: (1) the court lacks personal jurisdiction over non-Massachusetts drivers; and (2) only Roy, Trumbull, and other drivers employed by the same ISP are similarly situated. Each of Defendant's objections will be addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

No. 55 at 2, 4). Plaintiffs, on the other hand, ask the court to adopt the reasoning of the \"majority of its sister courts around the country\" that have rejected the application of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   to class or collective actions (Dkt. No. 57 at 3). Plaintiffs' argument is two-pronged. First, they rely on the language in the Court's majority opinion stating that it left \"open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court\" as apply to a state court.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1784.

No. 57 at 2-8). Notwithstanding these distinctions, the court concludes that \"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   applies to FLSA claims, in that it divests courts of specific jurisdiction over the FLSA claims of non-[Massachusetts employed] plaintiffs against [FedEx Ground].\"\n   <em>\n    Maclin v.

No. 1). Under FedEx Ground's operational structure, drivers reported to one local terminal to pick-up the packages that they were responsible for delivering that day (Dkt. No. 6-5).

Under the lenient standard applied to a motion for conditional certification, Plaintiffs have made the required showing that they are similarly situated to the members of the putative class of delivery drivers hired and paid by ISPs in Massachusetts. The evidence before the court is sufficient at this stage of the litigation to demonstrate the possibility that delivery drivers were subjected to FedEx Ground's policy of contracting with ISPs to provide delivery services while maintaining control of the drivers' work schedules and employment conditions and failing to pay overtime compensation to drivers who worked in excess of forty hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1.

FedEx Ground package handlers set out the packages each driver was responsible for delivering each day (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6 9; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 9). At times, Roy, Trumbull, and the other drivers they observed had to wait up to two hours for the FedEx package handlers to finish unloading tractor-trailers, sorting packages, and assigning them to delivery drivers (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6 10; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 10). FedEx Ground managers oversaw the drivers' loading of their vehicles (Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 19). Trumbull witnessed an ISP employee fire a driver \"on the spot\" after a FedEx Ground manager observed the driver throw a package (Dkt.

When the drivers finished loading their assigned packages into their vehicles, they were required to \"close out\" the scanners to confirm that they had loaded all their assigned packages (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6 12; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 12). If a driver had not loaded an assigned package, he was required to report the missing package to the FedEx Ground manager and wait until the manager either located the package or approved the driver's departure from the terminal without it (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 13; Dkt.

No. 6-8 \u00b6 14; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 14). When a driver delivered a package, he scanned it with the FedEx Ground-issued scanner and entered a code in order to track the delivery time and the type of delivery (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6 15; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 15). The scanner indicated whether a signature was required for delivery of the package (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b6 16; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 16).

No. 1 \u00b6 30; Dkt. No. 6 at 3). Plaintiffs argue that they have satisfied the lenient standard required for the court to authorize issuance of notice to potential opt-in plaintiffs. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that notwithstanding the terms of the contracts between FedEx Ground and the ISPs making the ISPs responsible for the delivery drivers' compensation including overtime, FedEx Ground was an actual employer of the named Plaintiffs and other drivers who were paid by ISPs and FedEx Ground violated the FLSA by failing to compensate eligible drivers who worked more than forty hours a week (Dkt.

FedEx Ground contends that it was not the drivers' employer. Instead, it asserts, it contracted with the ISPs to deliver its packages, the various ISPs employed the drivers, were responsible for the payment of their wages, including overtime, and are liable for evading the FLSA to the extent the drivers were not lawfully compensated (Dkt.

FedEx Ground next contends that there is no evidence to establish that it jointly employed the delivery drivers, and, to the extent it was a joint employer with each ISP, joint employment, alone, does not violate the FLSA. Finally, because each ISP allegedly made individualized decisions regarding employment conditions such as truck size and compensation structure, FedEx Ground maintains that Plaintiffs cannot establish that other drivers were governed by a single unlawful policy or plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, FedEx Ground's arguments involve fact-intensive inquiries that should not be addressed on this undeveloped record and are more appropriate for consideration at stage two of the collective action certification process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roberts,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201217114\">\n    2017 WL 1217114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (\"A more searching assessment of the evidence is appropriate at the second stage of certification based on the putative plaintiffs who have actually opted in.\").

According to the evidence submitted by Plaintiffs, they and the drivers they encountered at the Springfield Terminal picked up packages and delivered them to customers in vehicles bearing FedEx Ground's colors and logo, while wearing FedEx Ground's uniforms, and utilizing FedEx Ground's scanners to verify deliveries. FedEx Ground's practices dictated the hours the drivers worked each day: FedEx Ground employees assigned packages to the drivers; the drivers had to wait at the terminal until the FedEx Ground employees finished setting out the packages; if an assigned package was missing from the driver's truck, the driver was required to report it to a FedEx Ground manager and had to wait until the manager located the package or allowed the driver to leave without it; FedEx Ground employees often changed delivery instructions or asked drivers to return to the terminal to retrieve more packages; and drivers were required to deliver all the packages they were assigned each day irrespective of the number of hours they worked. FedEx Ground managers ensured that drivers complied with FedEx Ground's appearance and loading standards. According to Roy and Trumbull, all the delivery drivers at the Springfield Terminal were paid through ISPs (Dkt. No. 6-8 \u00b67; Dkt. No. 6-10 \u00b6 6). The drivers generally worked more than forty hours a week and were either paid a flat daily rate or a flat per-stop rate.
