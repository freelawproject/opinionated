Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, ECF No. 1 (\"Notice\"). Although Mr. Flinn's complaint raised only state law claims, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 83-233, the Insurers timely removed the case to this Court based on federal question jurisdiction. Notice \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8. The Insurers insisted that federal question jurisdiction obtained because Mr. Flinn's \"claims ar[o]se out of an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of, subject to and regulated by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), 29.

Mrs. Flinn passed away intestate on April 13, 2009. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. Unbeknownst to Mr. Flinn, Mrs. Flinn had purchased a life insurance plan (the \"Plan\") through her employer, Fidelity Investments, in the amount of $250,000, which was administered by the Insurers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Mrs. Flinn passed away, Mr. Flinn and Mrs. Flinn's sister, Joan Oliveira (\"Oliveira\"), had several conversations about Mrs. Flinn's affairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21. Oliveira, an attorney, caused Mr. Flinn to (falsely) believe that Mrs. Flinn had died with a valid last will and testament, which named Oliveira as its sole beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While Mrs. Flinn had not named a beneficiary to the Plan, per the Plan's undisputed terms, Mr. Flinn was the preference beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. About six months after Mrs. Flinn's passing, Oliveira contacted the Insurers and directed them to deal directly with her instead of Mr. Flinn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Oliveira presented a forged power of attorney for Mr. Flinn to the Insurers and claimed to be his attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41. Mr. Flinn, however, had no knowledge of and did not authorize the power of attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Oliveira repeatedly -- but unsuccessfully -- attempted to convince the Insurers to pay the Plan's benefits to someone other than Mr. Flinn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46-49. After her second attempt, Minnesota requested that Oliveira provide them with a \"letter of authority from the probate court as well as the tax ID for the estate, to demonstrate her authority to act on the estate's behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50. Oliveira never produced any such proof to the Insurers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Subsequently, in 2011, Oliveira informed Minnesota that Mr. Flinn did want to claim the Plan's benefits and requested documentation to begin the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. Ultimately, Minnesota sent a check payable to Mr. Flinn in the amount of $275,277.77 -- for the face value of the plan plus interest -- to Oliveira's business address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-59. Up to this point, the\n   Insurers had discussed this matter only with Oliveira and had never contacted Mr. Flinn directly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mrs. Flinn's probate proceeding commenced on April 22, 2015, at which time the probate court appointed Mr. Flinn as the personal representative of Mrs. Flinn's estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 35. Over the following months, Mr. Flinn discovered a number of assets -- including the Plan -- that were designated to pass to him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. To Mr. Flinn's dismay, Oliveira had already diverted them from the estate for her use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Flinn thus filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court to recover the pilfered assets from Oliveira.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. Oliveira then filed for bankruptcy, which stayed Mr. Flinn's Superior Court suit. Chapter 7 Voluntary Pet.,\n   <em>\n    In re Oliveira\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-11599 (Bankr. D.N.H. Oct. 13, 2015), ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Flinn sent a demand letter to the Insurers on February 23, 2018 requesting the Plan's benefit amount, plus interest, and attorney's fees as damages for \"wrongfully release[ing]\" the benefits to Oliveira. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78 &amp; Ex. A. The Insurers declined to offer to settle with Mr. Flinn, and, on March 29, 2018, he commenced this action in Massachusetts Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Flinn filed this complaint alleging that the Insurers violated Massachusetts law by mishandling the ministerial task of transferring to him the funds to which he was undisputedly due. Specifically, Mr. Flinn alleged that the Insurers were liable for negligence; constructive trust/breach of fiduciary duty; and violating Massachusetts General Laws chapter 106, section 4-401, chapter 176D, and chapter 93A.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 83-233. The Insurers removed the case to this Court on the basis of federal question jurisdiction on May 3, 2018. Notice \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8. A week later, the Insurers moved to dismiss Mr. Flinn's complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that ERISA preempted his claims. Defs.'s Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 8. In June 2018, Mr. Flinn not only opposed the Insurers' motion to dismiss, but also filed a cross motion to remand the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Pl.'s Opp'n Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 14; Pl.'s Mot. Remand, ECF No. 16. After the parties filed reply briefs, this Court held a hearing on both motions in September and took the matter under advisement. Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No. 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Insurers contend that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Flinn's complaint and that ERISA preempts it. While this Court does have diversity jurisdiction over this action, ERISA neither provides the true basis of Mr. Flinn's claims nor does it preempt his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because Mr. Flinn questions this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, this Court begins with his motion to remand. The Insurers argue that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case because ERISA completely preempts the complaint's causes of action. Defs.'s Mem. 6. Although the Court concludes that Mr. Flinn correctly points out that this Court lacks federal question jurisdiction, his complaint alleges facts sufficient for this Court to determine that it has diversity jurisdiction over this action. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3-8, 199. For those reasons, further discussed below, this Court DENIES Mr. Flinn's motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 1441(a) of chapter 28 of the United States Code allows defendants\n   to remove a case from state court to federal district court so long as the federal district court has original jurisdiction over the action. Where a plaintiff moves to remand a case back to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the defendant must \"make a 'colorable' showing that a basis for federal jurisdiction exists[ ] ... from the face of the state court complaint\" for the case to remain in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danca\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Private Health Care Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11582855\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/185/1/#p4\">\n    185 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\n   <em>\n    BIW Deceived\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Local S6, Indus.

Accordingly, courts apply the \"well-pleaded complaint\" rule, which requires defendants who base removal on federal question jurisdiction to demonstrate that the plaintiff's \"well-pleaded complaint\" relies on a federal right to relief, even if federal law may preempt the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Franchise Tax Bd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Construction Laborers Vacation Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p10\">\n    463 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p10\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190266\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/1/#p10\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   An exception to this rule exists where the defendant contends that Congress has completely preempted the complaint's state law claims such that the plaintiff's claims are \"necessarily federal in character.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Life Ins.

There, the plaintiff purchased a pension plan for her small business based on the defendants' alleged representations that she would receive hefty spousal benefits if her husband passed away.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932684\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932684\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/20/\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Among other things, the Court observed that \"[b]enefits law [was] not involved\" in resolving the case; the damages analysis did not depend on analyzing an ERISA plan; the plaintiff did not seek benefits, to enforce, or to clarify her rights under an ERISA plan; and the Court did not need \"to evaluate or interpret the terms of the plan or [the plaintiff's] rights under the plan\" to decide the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932684\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8932684\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/379/20/\">\n    at 65-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   These same factors militate in favor of holding that Mr. Flinn's state law claims fall outside of the ERISA private right of action's ambit. Mr. Flinn does not seek benefits under his wife's life insurance policy -- and the Insurers apparently do not dispute that he was owed benefits as they wrote a check for the exact amount that all parties agree were ultimately due to him.

In contrast, the state law duties invoked by Mr. Flinn here do not implicate benefits determinations and thus do not relate to an ERISA plan. Mrs. Flinn's ERISA plan is orthogonal to Mr. Flinn's claims regarding allegedly mislaid funds. Had the Insurers left Mr. Flinn's benefits check on the hood of a car, the fact that Mr. Flinn was to receive the check as an ERISA plan beneficiary would be irrelevant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
