Plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on the spandrel glass claim only. Because I conclude that the insurance policy excludes coverage for\n   both claims, I grant Defendant's motion and deny Plaintiffs' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   GED was the developer of \"The Indigo @ Twelve West\" (\"The Indigo\"). First Am. Compl. \u00b6 10, ECF 41. 12W is The Indigo's current owner and is landlord to The Indigo's residential and commercial tenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Defendant issued a series of first-party property insurance policies to 12W under which GED is also a named insured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the allegations in the First Amended Complaint, The Indigo's hot and cold water plumbing systems were constructed with various materials composed of or containing ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (\"EPDM\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The EPDM components, made by Victaulic Company, included valves, pipe couplings, gaskets, and fittings for piping systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The EPDM materials failed by decomposing, disintegrating, and in some instances dissolving into sludge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. According to Plaintiffs' investigation, the EPDM materials had an \"unanticipated chemical reaction\" with Portland's water supply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Chloramine compounds, which Portland adds to its domestic water, caused the EPDM materials to \"decompose, disintegrate, and/or dissolve.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This disintegration and dissolution of the EPDM materials resulted in damage to The Indigo's potable water supply, to the domestic water plumbing system, and to other property at The Indigo including damage to both residential and commercial units.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. After investigating, Plaintiffs concluded that the only viable repair option was to entirely replace The Indigo's plumbing system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. As a result, Plaintiffs have incurred total repair costs of not less than $4,826,584.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. On or about June 18, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted the EPDM claim to Defendant and requested coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. On or about December 22, 2016, Defendant denied the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to the spandrel window glass, Plaintiffs allege that \"opacifier film,\" which was adhered to spandrel glass units installed at The Indigo, is separating and peeling away from the spandrel glass units, resulting in property damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. At the time the First Amended Complaint was filed in November 2017, the investigation into the spandrel glass issue was ongoing, with estimated repair costs to exceed $6 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-42. On or about June 18, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted a separate claim to Defendant regarding The Indigo's spandrel glass units and opacifier film, requesting coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.

Further, Defendant argues that the EPDM and the spandrel glass claims are untimely because (1) the damage commenced before Defendant issued its first policy to Plaintiffs; and (2) the damage commenced more than two years before Plaintiffs filed suit and the untimely claims are not saved by the parties' tolling agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In response to Defendant's motion as to the EPDM claim, Plaintiffs argue that the plumbing system was damaged by concurrent, multiple causes and because one of those is a covered loss, the loss is not excluded. Plaintiffs further argue that even if the loss is excluded, it is nonetheless covered under the ensuing/resulting loss provision. Plaintiffs contend that the loss did not commence as to the EPDM material until the entire plumbing system failed which was within a policy period and that at a minimum, certain replacement plumbing parts were damaged within the two-year suit limitations period. In response to Defendant's motion on the spandrel glass claim, as well as in support of their own motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiffs make similar concurrent cause and ensuing loss arguments. As to the timeliness arguments, they contend that damage to the spandrel glass units commenced within the policy period and that each unit of spandrel glass should be treated separately and thus, the lawsuit was timely filed as to many of the spandrel glass units, some of which have not yet suffered damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After setting forth the relevant policy provisions, I discuss the EPDM coverage arguments, followed by the spandrel glass coverage arguments.

Thus, the issues in Defendant's motion as to the EPDM claim are whether an exclusion applies to deny coverage, and if so, whether the ensuing loss provision creates an exception to the exclusion so that coverage is ultimately available to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Defendant's Asserted Design Defect Exclusions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that the following design defect exclusions preclude coverage: latent defect, faulty design, materials defects, and faulty workmanship/construction. Jones Decl., Ex. 22 at 6 (Group II, Exclusion Nos. 1, 2). In their Response Memorandum, Plaintiffs state that the \"EPDM plumbing fittings ... were defective, a fact Plaintiffs do not ... dispute[.]\" Pls.' Resp. 9, ECF 63. They also later note the variety of what they call \"defect-oriented\" exclusions asserted by Defendant: \"latent defect, faulty design, defective materials, faulty workmanship, and deterioration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Plaintiffs concede that they have pressed \"certain of these theories\" against the manufacturer and contractors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But, they argue that they stand by those arguments because in the end, their loss is still covered under a concurrent/multiple loss theory or under the ensuing loss provision as an exception to the exclusions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The parties' positions establish that there is no dispute regarding the application of at least the faulty design exclusion and possibly other design or product defect exclusions. Thus, at this point, it is undisputed that there is initial coverage which is then excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B. Plaintiff's Concurrent/Multiple Loss Theory\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that when \"a force external to the design defect comes to operate on the material and physically damages it, the coverage question changes: did a non-excluded peril contribute to the loss or damage?\" Pls.' Resp. 10. Plaintiffs argue that when a covered cause and excluded cause of loss converge to cause damage, the loss or damage is covered in the first instance. They argue that here, for example, the EPDM would not have\n   decomposed and the plumbing system would not have been lost but for the chloramine-treated water. Because chloramine-treated water is not an excluded cause of loss, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant's design-defect exclusion arguments are incomplete. They assert that three non-excluded/covered perils contributed to the loss: (1) the \"unanticipated chemical reaction between EPDM and chloramine-treated water\"; (2) the wholesale decomposition of the EPDM which is not a \"case of mere deterioration\"; and (3) Victaulic's failure to warn.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument is unpersuasive.

July 19, 2013), the most relevant cases Plaintiffs rely on, the courts made clear that a concurrent or multiple loss theory depends on proof that the non-excluded cause or peril is the \"proximate efficient cause\" of the damage. In\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit considered an insurance claim where the insured had flushed a fungicidal liquid into her aluminum irrigation pipes only to have those pipes become damaged a year or two later.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/387/\">\n    87 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The insurer denied the claim based on a \"deterioration\" exclusion. On appeal, the insured argued that \"deterioration\" was not the sole cause of damage to her pipes, but that the fungicide manufacturer's negligent failure to warn her that its products would cause the insured's aluminum pipes to disintegrate was a second, independent cause without which there would have been no damage. The insured argued that the court was required to examine which cause was the \"proximate efficient cause\" of the damage and determine whether that cause was covered or excluded by the policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/387/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/387/\">\n    at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Ninth Circuit explained that under California law, use of the \"proximate efficient cause\" analysis is \"limited to situations where there exists a causal or dependent relationship between covered and excluded perils.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/87/387/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

As Judge Stewart explained in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Konnell\n   </em>\n   , a policy exclusion will not preclude coverage if, when there are multiple causes of a loss, a covered peril is the \"efficient proximate cause\" of the loss/damage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4 (\"the efficient proximate cause is a rule of law that applies only when two or more perils combine in sequence to cause a loss and a\n   <em>\n    covered peril\n   </em>\n   is the predominant or efficient cause of the loss. In such a situation, the efficient proximate cause rule mandates coverage, even if an excluded event appears in the chain of causation that ultimately produces the loss.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, if there are multiple causes of a\n   loss and a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause, then even though another cause is an excluded cause of the loss/damage, the loss/damage is nonetheless covered.\n   <em>\n    Naumes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436854\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/119/79/\">\n    119 Or.

Thus, here, for example, Plaintiffs contend that even if a design defect or deterioration, which are excluded perils, caused the loss or damage to the plumbing system, because the damage would not have occurred absent the failure to warn, the failure to warn allows coverage. Plaintiffs, however, fail to even mention the \"efficient proximate cause\" test. Thus, they offer an incomplete analysis and proof of this theory. Plaintiffs must prove, or at least create an issue of fact regarding, that the failure to warn, chloramine \"chemical attack,\" or decomposition meets the \"efficient proximate cause\" standard as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Naumes\n   </em>\n   , meaning that any one of these was \"the active and efficient cause that sets in motion a train of events which bring about a result without the intervention of any force, starting and working actively and efficiently from a new and independent source.\"\n   <em>\n    Naumes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4436854\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/119/79/\">\n    119 Or.

But Plaintiffs fail to do so and it is not the Court's burden to make Plaintiff's argument as to whether one of these other causes is the efficient proximate cause. Because Plaintiffs do not support their argument under the proper legal standard, they fail to create an issue of fact as to the concurrent/multiple cause theory. Thus, even assuming that any one of the three alleged concurrent causes is a non-excluded covered peril, they cannot defeat Defendant's motion with this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.

Plaintiffs agree with Defendant that because \"deterioration\" is not defined in the policies, this Court should apply the plain meaning of the word.

Or. 2018) (absent explicit definition of term in insurance policy, court looked to dictionary definitions to interpret meaning).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, Defendant relies on cases, some of which in turn relied on a dictionary, setting forth a plain meaning of \"deteriorate\" or \"deterioration\" as the gradual, progressive, breakdown of material, or the slow-moving disintegration or corrosion of material. Plaintiffs rely on a dictionary to assert that the word means to make inferior in quality or value or to impair in quality, state, or condition. I do not find these to be competing, differing definitions. However, assuming they are, and accepting Plaintiffs' definition, the damage that occurred here is deterioration as defined. The \"wholesale decomposition\" of the EPDM materials that Plaintiffs assert occurred here is easily described as the EPDM materials becoming impaired in quality, state, or condition. That the materials ultimately fell apart in chunks does not mean they did not deteriorate. Thus, based on the dictionary plain meaning definition of \"deterioration\" as asserted by Plaintiffs, the EPDM materials deteriorated because they became impaired in quality, state, or condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I also do not find Plaintiffs' attempt to distance themselves from their expert's change in language from \"deterioration\" to \"decomposition\" persuasive. First, I reject a distinction based on \"coverage-relevant facts\" versus \"third-party liability facts.\" Second, the\n   <em>\n    Victaulic\n   </em>\n   case, as Plaintiffs note, was not an insurance coverage case. Thus, presumably, Bekooy used words that carried no particular insurance policy meaning. In essence, then, he used words that carried an ordinary, plain meaning. That is, divorced from any insurance policy implications, Bekooy described the damage as \"deterioration\" because the damage was what he likely understood to be the plain meaning of that term. With the parties agreeing here that the plain meaning of deterioration controls, Bekooy's prior use of the term indicates that the damage was indeed deterioration as that word is commonly understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Even accepting Plaintiff's proposed definition of deterioration, the failure of the EPDM components comes within that definition. Thus, I agree with Defendant that this exclusion applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   2.

Based on the policy language, the argument is that the deteriorated EPDM particles, residue, and sludge was a material that can cause or threaten damage to human health or that can cause or threaten damage or loss of use of property, and that the deteriorated pieces are properly understood to be a\n   foreign substance or an impurity.

The investigation into repair options was at least in part motivated by 12W's legal obligations to provide safe drinking water as well as an operable plumbing system. The repairs undertaken were designed to address both the water supply and the plumbing system. The two went hand-in-hand. Thus, the damages sought for the EPDM claim are indeed for harm caused by contaminated water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the potential health issues caused by the EPDM in the water are not at issue here. Instead, they assert that it was the risk of catastrophic leaks that required replacement of the entire plumbing system. But, the First Amended Complaint is devoid of any such allegation. The word \"leak\" does not appear anywhere in that pleading. This suggests that at least at the time Plaintiffs brought the claim, they were not relying on the risk of leaks theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Additionally, even if the risk of leaks was the only reason Plaintiffs replaced the plumbing system, the repairs are still not covered. The policy defines contamination to include the \"actual or suspected presence of any material ... that can cause or threaten damage, deterioration ..., or loss of use of property.\" Jones Decl., Ex. 22 at 12. The risk of leaks was caused either by the disintegrated EPDM components themselves which, because they were disintegrated, no longer worked to contain the water as intended, or, by pieces of disintegrated EPDM in the water which threatened to plug or clog pipes. The former alternative is excluded by the deterioration exclusion. The latter alternative is excluded because the sloughed off pieces or sludge was foreign material that caused or threatened damage or loss of use of property. Because the deteriorating plumbing parts could cause or threaten catastrophic leaks, there was contamination. Accordingly, even if a threat to human health did not trigger the repair work, the cost of the work is not covered under the policy because the ensuing loss is itself excluded under the deterioration and/or contamination exclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   D. Summary re: EPDM Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The loss/damage is initially covered but is then excluded by several exclusions. At a minimum, there are design-defect exclusions which Plaintiffs do not dispute. Plaintiffs fail to create an issue of fact as to their concurrent/multiple cause theory. The loss or damage is not restored under the ensuing loss provision because the ensuing loss is excluded under the deterioration and/or contamination exclusions. Thus,\n   I grant Defendant's motion as to the EPDM claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   III. Spandrel Glass Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   A.

In some locations, the problem has caused the glass to have a mottled appearance. Jones Decl., Ex. 13 at 3, 5, 6 (RDH Orig. Report). Some damage appears as black spots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Other observed damage includes \"bubbles\" of the film, blisters, \"tenting,\" and \"scratch marks.\" Jones Decl., Ex. 14 at 2, 7 (MEIC Report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   B. Initial Coverage &amp; Exclusions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Like the EPDM claim, there is no dispute that the loss/damage to the spandrel glass units is initially covered under the broad coverage grant in the all-risk policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   And, like the EPDM claim, there is no dispute that an exclusion applies. In this claim, it is undisputed that the cause of the harm is an improperly cured adhesive layer in the opacifier film portion of the spandrel glass units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Decl., Ex. 1 at 15 (RDH Orig. Report noting that the glue between laminations appears to have not correctly copolymerized; further explaining that the glue is \"failing cohesively\" and that the \"failed adhesive cannot resist the differential stress between the laminations of the PET assembly resulting in delamination of PET laminate within the lamination glue plane\"); Kolta July 26, 2018 Decl., Ex. 2 at 18 (Thornton Tomasetti Report noting that the \"root cause\" of the failure is improper curing of the copolyester adhesives between the PET layers of film). Young Decl., Ex. 2 at 1 (RDH Rebuttal Report noting that Defendant's expert \"appears in agreement ... with respect to the root cause failure of the glue[.]\"). A manufacturing defect or a materials defect is the agreed-upon cause of the problem. The policy excludes such defects. Jones Decl., Ex. 22 at 6 (Group II, Exclusion No. 2) (excluding \"[d]efects in materials [and] faulty workmanship\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   C. Concurrent/Multiple Cause Theory\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As they did with the EPDM claim, Plaintiffs contend that coverage for the defective spandrel glass units is available under a concurrent/multiple loss theory. This argument fails for two reasons. First, as with the EPDM claim, Plaintiffs fail to even mention the \"efficient proximate cause\" standard. Thus, they offer an incomplete analysis and proof of this theory. Because Plaintiffs do not support their argument under the proper legal standard, they fail to create an issue of fact as to the concurrent/multiple cause theory. Thus, even assuming the existence of a another non-excluded cause, they cannot defeat Defendant's motion with this argument. For the same reason, they cannot prevail on their own motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs rely on their expert's opinion that \"prolonged exposure to extreme heat\" is the concurrent cause of the damage to the spandrel glass units. Because \"extreme heat\" is not an excluded peril, it is a covered peril and because, according to Plaintiffs, the opacifier adhesive would not have failed absent \"extreme heat,\" the damage to the spandrel glass units is covered under a concurrent/multiple cause theory. I agree with Plaintiffs that \"extreme heat\" is not an excluded peril. The fact that \"heat\" was deleted from later policies indicates an intent to omit it from the list of exclusions. Moreover, as Plaintiffs note, Defendant knew how to write a policy including the term \"extremes of temperature\" and Defendant's failure to include that term in the list of exclusions indicates the intent to limit the exclusion to \"changes of temperature.\" Kolta July 26, 2018 Decl., Ex. 1 at 38 (separate policy provision defining \"boiler and machinery,\" and providing that coverage is conditioned on \"direct physical loss or damage ... [c]aused by, resulting from, or consisting of ... [e]xtremes or changes of temperature.\"). While Defendant correctly notes that Plaintiffs' policy did not include boiler and machinery coverage and that the language is in a coverage provision, not an exclusion provision, this provision still shows that Defendant knew how to insert \"extremes of temperature\" into a policy when it wanted to and it did not include that language in the exclusions applicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Nonetheless, Plaintiffs fail to establish that \"extremes of temperature\" occurred here. Plaintiffs rely on Young's opinion that the presence of \"excessive temperatures\" over time resulted in the glue failing. Young Decl., Ex. 1 at 15. In his Original Report he wrote: \"it is our opinion that\n   the delamination of the opacifier film has resulted from the improper copolymerization of the laminate adhesive. This improper polymerization has altered the properties of the PET assembly, such that\n   <em>\n    high heat from solar gain\n   </em>\n   results in the mottled aluminum particle migration and delamination failures observed in the field.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (the \"extent of damage is related to excessive heat associated with solar gain\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\"[i]n the presence of excessive heat over time, the glue is failing cohesively\"; \"... at excessive temperatures the lamination glue cannot restrain the stressed induced by the excessive heat loads to keep the laminations together\"; and \"[a]t excessive temperature, the black PET shrinks and pulls away from the top and the sides of the glass\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In response to Defendant's evidence that the climate and ambient air temperatures in Portland are moderate compared to other cities, Young explains in his Rebuttal Report that the exterior ambient temperature does not consider the effect of surface heating of different materials or glazing units as a result of solar exposure. Young Decl., Ex. 2 at 1 (RDH Reb. Report). The focus of Young's Rebuttal Report appears to be \"solar exposure\" rather than ambient air temperature. But, nonetheless, his opinion remains that the temperature in the spandrel glass units was \"excessive\" or \"extreme\" and that this caused the defective product to fail.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2 (\"in the absence of exposure and excessive heat within the spandrel glass units, we would expect to see no damage\"; indicating that the defective copolymerizing of the glue resulted \"in a failure of the film laminate to perform in the excessive heat conditions of the insulated spandrel panel in conjunction with high solar exposure in Portland, OR\"; the \"opacifier film would not have failed in the absence of solar exposure.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Absent from Young's reports, however, is an explanation or definition of \"prolonged,\" \"over time\" or \"excessive\" or \"extreme.\" And, Plaintiffs offer no evidence of the actual temperatures inside the spandrel glass units that they contend are \"excessive\" or \"extreme.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Decl., Ex. 14 at 8 (MEIC report stating that \"no thermal measurement data was available[,] [ ] the study's scope was limited[,] and only the external conditions to the site of window installment were considered\"). Instead, the summary judgment record is capable of only one inference: the temperatures inside the spandrel glass units were consistent with industry standards. Dannettel explains that there was no \"environmental event which led to the failure of the films.\" Kolta July 26, 2018 Decl., Ex. 2 at 20 (Thornton Tomasetti Report). Rather, the film failed at normal operating temperatures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While spandrel glass units are subject to high temperatures, they are designed to perform at these temperatures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (indicating that spandrel glass units typically experience temperatures in the range of 160 to 175 degrees Fahrenheit). Even when considered in a light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the evidence shows that Plaintiffs only surmise that the internal temperature in the spandrel glass units reached 170-175 degrees Fahrenheit and then, Plaintiffs declare that this is an \"extreme\" temperature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The issue is what is an \"excessive\" or \"extreme\" temperature in the context of the insurance policy. \"Excessive heat\" or \"extreme heat\" are not defined in the policy. Thus, I rely on the plain meaning of the term. The parties do not cite to an Oregon, District of Oregon, or Ninth Circuit case construing this term in a similar policy. Dictionary definitions include \"existing in the highest or the greatest possible degree,\" and \"exceeding the ordinary, usual, or expected.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   807 (unabridged ed. 2002);\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   www.ahdictionary.com (American Heritage online dictionary defining \"extreme\" in the context of synonyms for \"excessive\" as \"[b]eing far beyond the norm\"). A 1982 Texas case suggests, as do the dictionary definitions, that an \"excessive heat\" or \"extreme heat\" exclusion in an insurance policy embodies a relative concept, not an objective one.\n   <em>\n    Blaylock v. Am. Guar. Bank Liab. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9951940\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/632/719/\">\n    632 S.W.2d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. 1982). There, damage to property located in Dallas occurred on a day when the outside temperature was about twenty-three degrees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9951940\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/632/719/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9951940\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/632/719/\">\n    at 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence established that twenty-three degrees was within the normal recurring range of temperatures for Dallas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9951940\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/632/719/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court interpreted the exclusion language \"extremes of temperature\" to mean an unexpected or unusual temperature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9951940\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/632/719/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"We agree that a temperature must be unexpected or unusual in order to be extreme.\"). Thus, the court held that because the temperatures on the day in question were not unusual or unexpected, the exclusion for \"extremes of temperatures\" did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under the plain meaning of the term, an excessive or extreme heat exclusion would apply only when the heat at issue is unusual, unexpected, or \"beyond the norm.\" Here, the evidence in the record shows nothing more than that the temperatures inside the spandrel glass units may have reached 175 degrees Fahrenheit. While that is a high temperature, it is not unusual, unexpected, or beyond the norm for that environment. Because the industry standard for the spandrel glass units is an internal temperature of 165-175 degrees Fahrenheit, the contention that 170 degrees Fahrenheit is extreme is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the term. Thus, the product failed under its intended use and Plaintiffs fail to establish that \"prolonged exposure to extreme heat\" was a concurrent cause entitling them to coverage under their concurrent/multiple cause theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   D. Ensuring/Resulting Loss Provision\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In addition to the concurrent/multiple cause theory, Plaintiffs also rely on the ensuing loss provision policy language to contend that the damage to the spandrel glass units is a covered loss. Plaintiffs' argument is again premised on \"prolonged exposure to extreme heat\" as a cause of the damage. Plaintiffs are correct that because the policy does not exclude loss or damage caused by \"extreme\" or \"excessive\" temperatures, such loss or damage could potentially be covered. In an attempt to cement this contention, Plaintiffs spend time distinguishing \"extremes of temperature\" from \"changes of temperature\" which is a listed exclusion. Jones Decl., Ex. 22 at 7 (Group II, Exclusion No. 4). Defendant, in response, argues that the spandrel glass unit failures are as a result of changes of temperature and thus, damage is excluded, even under the ensuing loss provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In my opinion, the correct result here does not depend on whether there was extreme heat or changes of temperature. Instead, because the damage is to the spandrel glass unit, and there is no dispute that the opacifier film portion of that unit was defective, there is no ensuing loss to consider. The spandrel glass units are a defective product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \"[A]n ensuing loss provision does not cover loss caused by the excluded peril, but rather covers loss caused to\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   property wholly separate from the defective property itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%2031495830\">\n    2002 WL 31495830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (internal quotation marks omitted) (further explaining that an ensuing or resulting loss clause \"does not reinsert coverage for excluded losses, but reaffirms coverage for secondary losses ultimately caused by excluded\n   perils\" ( (internal quotation narks omitted) ).

She went on to explain that the mold damage at issue in the case before her which occurred when faulty workmanship allowed water to leak, was not covered under the ensuing loss provision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because, in her opinion, mold was a \"natural and expected, as opposed to a separate and independent, result of water damage, it cannot be an ensuing loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (further stating that an \"ensuing loss requires an unexpected loss due to an intervening or contributing cause other than the mere passage of time\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In a case where the concrete floor in the plaintiff's distribution center suffered damage, Judge Ashmanskas followed Judge Stewart's\n   <em>\n    Prudential\n   </em>\n   reasoning.\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.
