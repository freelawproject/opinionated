T. 261-62, 264-66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the CI stated that he \"want[s] to cop the 5th and not say nothing[.]\" T. 275-76. Shortly thereafter, the CI abruptly changed his mind, however, and agreed to answer questions if he felt they would not incriminate him. T. 284.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court offered to appoint counsel for the CI, T. 279-80, 284-85, but he repeatedly declined the offer, T. 280-81, 284. Eventually, the jury was recalled and the CI was placed under oath. T. 285-86. The CI testified that he knew Detective Pratt, the officer in charge of the controlled buy, and agreed to participate in a buy for him. T. 287-88, 293-94. However, the CI could not remember where he was on the date of the controlled buy. T. 291-92. Further, the CI was unable to read, so he could not review his grand jury testimony to refresh his recollection or account for where exactly he made the controlled buys because he could not read the street signs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12307908\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/146/1086/#p1086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The CI confirmed that he knew Torres, but testified that he had never purchased drugs from him. T. 299, 301-302. The CI specifically recounted that the person he bought the drugs from was \"not in th[e] courtroom, that's for sure,\" and that he \"d[i]dn't know his name ... [he] just went up to him, and [the CI] bought the drugs.\" T. 294-96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The People then questioned Detective Pratt. T. 302-376. Pratt stated that all\n   controlled buys began with confidential informants undergoing a strip search \"to make sure [the CI had] no illegal narcotics on him or money of his own[.]\" T. 306-07. This buy was no different, and after the CI was searched, Pratt provided him with marked money for the controlled buy and an audio transmitter to record the CI's conversations. T.324-25. Pratt drove the CI to Voorhees Street (\"Voorhees\"), parked the car, and watched as the CI exited the car, walked down Voorhees, and then turned right onto East Main Street (\"East Main\"). T. 328. While Pratt could no longer see the CI after he turned down East Main, he could hear him speaking to people as he walked. T. 364. Pratt commented that the CI \"knows everybody [in that area] in passing.\" T. 364-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When the CI turned onto East Main, his surveillance was taken over by Detective DiCaprio, who was located on East Main between Voorhees and John Street (\"John\"). T. 519. DiCaprio heard Pratt drive the CI to Voorhees and then saw the CI walk from the corner of Voorhees, across East Main, and then turn and proceed down John. T. 522-23. DiCaprio noted that the CI \"didn't stop ... to talk to anyone that [he] saw. [The CI] may have passed people, but [DiCaprio] d[id]n't believe he stopped to talk to anybody.\" T. 526. However, DiCaprio did see the CI talking on his phone as he was walking to the controlled buy location. T. 527.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As the CI proceeded down John, Detective Spaulding took over the surveillance. T. 430. Spaulding was sitting in a car, parked on John, and watched as a man stopped behind her car to meet with the CI. T. 435-36, 39-40. During the trial, Spaulding identified Torres as the man who stopped behind her car to meet with the CI. T. 436. Spaulding observed that it was just the two of them interacting with one another on the street. T. 440. She could also hear their conversation over the audio device and watched \"them ... exchange hands ... [as i]f I'm handing you something and you take it from my hand.\" T. 441-42. After this quick exchange, petitioner retreated to a house on John and the CI beg an walking back towards the direction from which he initially came. T. 442-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The CI then returned into the view of Detective DiCaprio, who watched the CI walk back up John, turn left onto East Main, continue back toward Voorhees, and eventually turn left onto Voorhees. T. 527-28 (\"In other words, [the CI] came up [Voorhees], went across [East Main], went down [John], came back up [John], across [East Main] and back down [Voorhees] again.\"). DiCaprio noted that he had continuous sight of the CI during that time, and the CI never stopped to speak or interact with anyone. T. 529. As the CI began to leave DiCaprio's view, DiCaprio radioed to Pratt that the CI was now on Voorhees within Pratt's eyesight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12307908\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/146/1086/#p1086\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pratt testified the CI returned to his car and handed him two glassine bags and the audio transmitter.

T. 365-66. All the detectives commented that the CI was speaking to people, either as he passed them on the street or during the course of a phone call, while he was walking to and from the location of the controlled buy. T. 367-68, 447-48, 526-27.

SCR 105-07. There was no citation to federal cases, reliance on state cases utilizing a constitutional analysis, or assertion of the claim or pattern of facts in a way to call to mind a federal right. Instead, petitioner relied upon eight state cases, advancing propositions all grounded in New York state case law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the claims remain unexhausted because the state courts were never alerted to the constitutional nature of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Furthermore, because Torres is \"entitled to one (and only one) appeal to the Appellate Division and one request for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals,\" he cannot return to the state courts in an attempt to exhaust his claim.\n   <em>\n    Aparicio v.
