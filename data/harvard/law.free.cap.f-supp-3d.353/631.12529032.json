Russell, Senior Judge\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant Cimco Refrigeration, Inc.'s (\"CIMCO\") Motion for Summary Judgment. [R. 38.] Plaintiff Dippin' Dots responded and CIMCO replied. [R. 47; R. 48.] Fully briefed, this matter is ripe for adjudication. For the reasons stated herein, CIMCO's Motion for Summary Judgment, [R. 38], is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case revolves around a contract between CIMCO Refrigeration, Inc. and Dippin' Dots, in which CIMCO agreed to \"design, construct and install a carbon dioxide and ammonia-based refrigeration system at Dippin' Dots' plant in Paducah, Kentucky\" (the \"Contract\"). [R. 38-2 at 1 (Russell Affidavit);\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 38-3 (the Contract).]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dippin' Dots manufactures \"beads of cryogenically frozen ice cream\" that must be stored at temperatures below negative forty degrees Fahrenheit. [R. 26 at 2 (Amended Complaint).] CIMCO designed and installed a refrigeration system to cool the space where Dippin' Dots' products are stored. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The refrigeration system was installed at the Dippin' Dots plant in early 2014. [R. 38-2 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 21, 2015, Dippin' Dots filed suit against CIMCO and the manufacturer of a \"plate and shell\" heat exchanger, a specific part of the refrigeration system installed by CIMCO. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] That claim asserted that the failure of the heat exchange system caused the refrigeration system to not function properly and become \"contaminated.\" [R. 38-5 at 2-3 (First Amended Complaint of Previous Suit).] As subrogee of Dippin' Dots, Travelers Property Casualty Company of America brought the following claims against CIMCO: (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, (3) breach of express warranty, and (4) negligence. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-8.] On either November 4 or November 11, 2016, the parties mediated the case and reached a tentative agreement for settlement. [R. 38-1 at 3; R. 47 at 7 (Dippin' Dots Response).] The Settlement Agreement was executed in December of 2016, and the Court dismissed the case on December 6, 2016. [R. 47-3 (Order of Dismissal); R. 38-1 at 5; R. 47 at 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During this period of time, Dippin' Dots experienced yet another issue with its refrigeration system. At this point, further explanation of the refrigeration system and its importance to Dippin' Dots' business is necessary in order to fully understand the claim. This refrigeration system requires two compressors to function, one that operates on carbon dioxide and the other on ammonia. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.] As a precaution, CIMCO included an extra compressor of each type to ensure that if there was a problem with either compressor, the system could still operate on the back-up, or \"redundant,\" compressor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.] All four compressors are run by a computer called a programmable logic controller (\"PLC\") that ultimately decides which two compressors are running at any given time. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Dippin' Dots states that CIMCO designed and installed the PLC, and that the PLC was programmed and tested by CIMCO at the time of installation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or around Saturday, November 5, 2016, a circuit breaker associated with one of the compressors was tripped and that\n   compressor ceased operating. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Dippin' Dots explains that, although each compressor has its own circuit breaker, \"the PLC did not alert the redundant compressor to begin running when this occurred, causing the refrigeration system not to function.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] According to Dippin' Dots' Vice President of Administration and Human Resources, Steve Heisner, this caused the temperature to rise in the refrigerated warehouse and the ultimate spoliation of approximately $750,000.00 worth of product. [R. 16-1 at 2 (Heisner Declaration).] Heisner states that Dippin' Dots learned of this loss on Monday, November 7, 2016, and subsequently filed a claim for insurance coverage with its carrier, Travelers Property Casualty Company (\"Travelers\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.] Dippin' Dots allegedly has systems in place designed to alert personnel of rising temperatures, however, personnel were never alerted on the day of the incident. [R. 26 at 4.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Travelers subsequently employed an engineer firm, SEA, Ltd., to investigate the loss. After an inconclusive report on January 12, 2017, [R. 47-5 at 3 (First SEA Report) ], SEA concluded in a second report, dated February 13, 2017, that a squirrel on the power line caused Dippin' Dots to experience \"a brief interruption in electrical service\" of \"no more than a few seconds\" on November 5, 2016. [R. 47-6 at 2-3 (Second SEA Report).] Two days later, on February 15, 2017, Travelers sent Dippin' Dots a letter informing them that the \"Spoilage Coverage Extension\" limited Dippin' Dots' recovery to $100,00.00 for its loss of product. [R. 16-6 at 1-2 (Travelers Letter).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 18, 2017, Dippin' Dots filed a complaint against Travelers for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith. [R. 1 at 4-5.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 18, 2017, an on-site investigation by engineers, retained by Dippin' Dots' counsel, led Dippin' Dots to believe that CIMCO \"may be a cause of its loss.\" [R. 47-7 at 1 (Avery Declaration); R. 47 at 9.] On November 1, 2017, Dippin' Dots filed the Amended Complaint, which added CIMCO as a defendant. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 26.] Dippin' Dots brings four claims against CIMCO: (1) Breach of Contract, (2) Negligence, (3) Breach of Implied Warranties of Merchantability and Fitness for a Particular Purpose, and (4) Breach of Express Warranty. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.] Currently before the Court is CIMCO's Motion for Summary Judgment, in which it argues that all four claims should be dismissed. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   R. 38-1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, reveals \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

[R. 47 at 21.] Dippin' Dots does not describe this specific defect or explain why it was not discoverable, but it insists that there is \"at a minimum, a fact question\" that requires the Court to deny summary judgment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In support of its argument, Dippin' Dots cites to two cases without any explanation as to how the case law relates to the situation at hand.

In fact, Cox sent the seeds to Washington State University for analysis where it was revealed that the germination rate of the seed was far below the eighty-five percent required for certification and there was \"extensive seed damage to the seed coat which adversely affected germination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=936%20P.2d%201191\">\n    936 P.2d 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , in which a farming company, Gooch, sued an herbicide manufacturer, Du Pont, over damage to the company's corn crop alleging strict liability, negligence, and breach of express and implied warranty. The label of the herbicide contained a \"Limitation of Warranty and Liability\" which stated: \"IN NO EVENT SHALL DUPONT OR SELLER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OR HANDLING OF THIS PRODUCT.\"\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626625\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/40/863/#p870\">\n    40 F.Supp.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Like the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   , CIMCO argues that Dippin' Dots should be held to the disclaimer of warranties in the Contract. [R. 48 at 17-18.] Furthermore, CIMCO emphasizes that Dippin' Dots has not developed its argument that the one-year warranty failed of its essential purpose or presented any affirmative\n   evidence in support of such an argument. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court finds that \u00a7 7 of the Contract excludes consequential damages, as permitted under Kentucky law. According to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, \"the construction and interpretation of a contract, including questions regarding ambiguity, are questions of law to be decided by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Frear v.

CIMCO satisfied its burden of production at the summary judgment stage by providing evidence that it limited damages and liability to a one-year warranty for repair or replacement of parts, as permitted under Kentucky law. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 38-1 at 12-13; R. 48 at 6-7 (citing \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7 of the Contract).] In addition, CIMCO highlighted the fact that Dippin' Dots failed to present evidence that there was a latent defect present that could not have been discovered and repaired within the one-year warranty period. [R. 48 at 18.] As this district stated in\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   , \"the 'failure of essential purpose' exception best applies to situations where the contract limits liability to repair or replacement of a product and that product is in a condition where the defect cannot be fully corrected by the repair or replacement of the defective part or product.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626625\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/40/863/#p870\">\n    40 F.Supp.2d at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Dippin' Dots and CIMCO entered a contract that limited CIMCO's liability to repair or replacement of the refrigeration system. After CIMCO satisfied its burden of production concerning the limitations within the Contract, Dippin' Dots failed to present evidence showing a defect in the compressors or explaining why the defect could not be fully corrected by repair or replacement of a part or the product itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240597\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/714/#p726\">\n    746 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   726 (citing\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 324,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p324\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, the Court finds that the matter at hand is not an appropriate situation for applying the failure of essential purpose exception. Although the Court understands that Dippin' Dots suffered a loss of its frozen ice cream, \"[a] remedy does not 'fail of its essential purpose' simply because it limits the recovery of a particular relief sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Gooch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626625\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/40/863/#p870\">\n    40 F.Supp.2d at 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dippin' Dots also argues that the exclusion of consequential damages in the Contract \"does not bar the recovery of consequential damages for claims of negligence\" because the limitation in \u00a7 7 of the\n   Contract does not \"expressly reference exculpation for damages suffered as a result of negligence.\" [R. 47 at 19-20.] Dippin' Dots cites to case law from the Tennessee Court of Appeals and Kansas Appellate Court for support-neither of which is applicable law in this matter. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.] Moreover, Dippin' Dots offers no argument or explanation as to why these cases should be applied to the situation at hand. In contrast, CIMCO cites to the Eastern District of Kentucky, applying Kentucky law, which held in\n   <em>\n    United States Achievement Academy, LLC v. Pitney Bowes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   that the plaintiff was precluded from seeking consequential, incidental, or punitive damages on fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims pursuant to the warranty in the lease agreement between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445359\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/458/389/#p399\">\n    458 F.Supp.2d 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 399 (E.D.

Like \u00a7 7 of the Contract, the agreement in\n   <em>\n    United States Achievement Academy\n   </em>\n   did not contain an express reference to damages suffered as a result of negligence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445359\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/458/389/#p399\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Western District of Kentucky has previously stated: \"Under Kentucky law, a plaintiff must elect whether to proceed in contract or in tort for claims arising from the same factual circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Ronald A.
