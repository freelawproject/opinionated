(\"Omniguide\") moves to transfer this litigation to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1404(a) (\" section 1404\"). (Docket No. 13.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Omniguide's motion to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action stems from the distribution agreement between Omniguide and plaintiff Vitalife, Inc. (\"Vitalife\"). Omniguide is organized pursuant to the laws of Delaware, and maintains its principal place of business in Lexington, Massachusetts. (Docket No. 47 at pp. 12-13.) The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is Vitalife's place of incorporation and principal place of business. (Docket No. 19, Ex. 1 at p. 3.) Omniguide manufactures and develops surgical devices. (Docket No. 47 at p. 12.) Vitalife markets and distributes medical equipment in Puerto Rico and in the Virgin Islands. (Docket No. 13, Ex. 5 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Distribution Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2013, Vitalife agreed \"to use its best efforts to market and sell [Omniguide's] Products in the Territory of Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 13, Ex. 2. at p. 3.) Omniguide and Vitalife stipulated that \"[e]ither party [could] terminate the agreement\n   at any time, for any reason, or for no reason, upon thirty (30) days written notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The distribution agreement set forth a choice of law and forum selection clause, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [The] terms and conditions shall be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ... Omniguide and [Vitalife] acknowledge and agree that the state and federal courts in Boston, Massachusetts shall be the exclusive venue for all actions arising in connection with this transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2. On July 17, 2017, Omniguide provided Vitalife with written notice of its intention to terminate the distribution agreement. (Docket No. 13, Ex. 4 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Litigation in Puerto Rico and Massachusetts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Vitalife asserted that Omniguide's actions violated the laws of Puerto Rico and Massachusetts. (Docket No. 13, Ex. 5 at p. 4.) According to Omniguide, Vitalife \"implicitly threatened to seek preliminary injunctive relief in Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 13 at p. 2.) On May 22, 2018, Omniguide filed suit against Vitalife in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (\"District of Massachusetts litigation\"). Docket No. 10 at p. 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Omniguide, Inc. v. Vitalife, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case 18-11073). In the District of Massachusetts litigation, Omniguide requested a declaratory judgment confirming that \"Omniguide has a valid right to sell its products directly to customers in Puerto Rico.\" (Docket No. 10, Ex. 1 at p. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The day after Omniguide commenced the District of Massachusetts litigation, Vitalife filed suit against Omniguide in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan Superior Division (\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico litigation\"). Docket No. 19, Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vitalife, Inc. v. Omniguide, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. SJ2018-CV-3440. Vitalife amended its complaint on May 24, 2018, setting forth two causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   First, Vitalife alleged that Omniguide terminated the distribution agreement in contravention of Puerto Rico Law 75, P.R. Laws. Ann. tit. 10, sections 278\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Law 75\"). (Docket No. 19, Ex. 1. at p. 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Vitalife avers that Omniguide failed to perform the distribution agreement in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2010%2C%20%C2%A7%203375\">\n    P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 3375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 5, 2018, Omniguide removed the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico litigation to this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. section 1446 (Docket No. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omniguide requested that the Court transfer this action to the District of Massachusetts pursuant to the forum selection clause. (Docket No. 13 at p. 2.) The Court denied Omniguide's request without prejudice. (Docket No. 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Courts have recognized two forms of forum selection clauses: permissive and mandatory. Permissive forum selection clauses are \"often described as 'consent to jurisdiction' clauses, [and] authorize\n   jurisdiction and venue in a designated forum, but do not prohibit litigation elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera v. Centro M\u00e9dico de Turabo, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p17\">\n    575 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). In contrast, mandatory forum selection clauses \"contain clear language indicating that jurisdiction and venue are appropriately and exclusively in the designated forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034498\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/10/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The forum selection clause set forth in the distribution agreement is mandatory. Preclusive language, such as \"shall\" and \"must,\" suggests that a clause is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    Claudio-de Le\u00f3n v. Sistema Universitario Ana G. M\u00e9ndez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341183\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/41/#p46\">\n    775 F.3d 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that contractual language stating litigation \"shall be submitted to the jurisdiction and competence of the Court of First Instance of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, San Juan Part\" constitutes a mandatory forum selection clause). Omniguide and Vitalife included preclusive language, stating that the \"state and federal courts in Boston, Massachusetts\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be the\n   <strong>\n    exclusive\n   </strong>\n   venue for all actions arising in connection with this transaction.\" (Docket No. 13, Ex. 2. at p. 3) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Vitalife disregarded the mandatory forum selection clause by commencing this action in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Omniguide filed a petition for a writ of mandamus regarding enforcement of the forum selection clause. (Docket No. 47 at p. 11.) The First Circuit Court of Appeals denied Omniguide's petition\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   without prejudice to the re-filing should the relief sought by petitioner not be attained through the pending litigation between the same parties in the [District of Massachusetts], or through reconsideration by [this Court] of its denial of the transfer motion 'without prejudice.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    In re Omniguide\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1770 (1st Cir. Oct. 17, 2018). At the initial scheduling conference, Omniguide and Vitalife expressed a willingness to settle this action. (Docket No. 48.) Accordingly, the Court granted the parties' request for a 30-day continuance to \"finalize the terms of [a nascent settlement agreement] and [to] inform the Court.\" (Docket No. 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Settlement negotiations, however, proved unsuccessful. Vitalife moved to enforce a purported settlement agreement that would result in the concurrent dismissal of the actions filed in the District of Puerto Rico and the District of Massachusetts. (Docket No. 51.) The Court denied Vitalife's motion, finding that \"although the parties stood on the precipice of a settlement agreement, they failed to achieve a meeting of the minds.\"\n   <em>\n    Vitalife, Inc. v.
