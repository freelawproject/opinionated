Plaintiff asserts (1)\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   removed any distinction between application of the statutory damages cap to wrongful-death claims and personal-injury claims, (2) the application of the statutory-damages cap is \"highly case-specific\" and cannot be applied as a matter of law, and (3) a determination as to whether the statutory cap is applicable cannot be made until evidence of Plaintiff's noneconomic damages is presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Greist v.

In addition to economic damages, the jury awarded $1,500,000 to the plaintiff for noneconomic damages. Pursuant to the statutory-damages cap, the trial court reduced the noneconomic damages to $500,000. On the plaintiff's appeal the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2359053\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/128/390/\">\n    128 Or.

The Oregon Supreme Court, however, affirmed the trial court's decision and held a wrongful-death claim is a statutory creation that did not exist at common law, that the statutory cap on noneconomic damages does not violate either state or federal constitutional provisions, and that the statutory-damages cap does not violate the remedies provision (Article I, section 10) of the Oregon Constitution \"when the legislature alters (or even abolishes) a cause of action, so long as the party injured is not left entirely without a remedy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    322 Or. at 290, 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    906 P.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Hale v.

The court also noted\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [t]he remedy for wrongful death is substantial, not only because 100 percent of economic damages plus up to $500,000 in noneconomic damages is a substantial amount, but also because the statutory wrongful death action in Oregon has had a low limit on recovery for 113 years of its 133-year history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    322 Or. at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    906 P.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the court concluded the statutory-damages cap does not violate the privileges and immunities provision (Article I, section 20) of the Oregon Constitution because \"[n]othing in the wording of [the constitutional provision] restricts the legislature's authority to set a substantive limitation on a purely statutory remedy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    322 Or. at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n    906 P.2d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As to the alleged violation of federal due-process rights, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The Oregon legislature did not act in a \"demonstrably arbitrary or irrational\" way when it enacted ORS 18.560(1)....

Finally, the court concluded the statutory-damages cap does not violate federal equal-protection rights on the grounds that the statute \"does not categorize the plaintiff on the basis of an inherently suspect characteristic\" and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   does not jeopardize the exercise of a recognized fundamental right in this case, because the right to collect damages for wrongful death is a statutory right only, which has incorporated a dollar limit on recovery for most of its existence ...

The defendants admitted liability, and the issue of plaintiff's damages was tried to a jury. The jury awarded the plaintiff over $6 million\n   in economic damages and $6 million in noneconomic damages. The trial court granted the university's motion to reduce the verdict to $3,000,000 under the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA), Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 30.265.

Defendant, therefore, contends neither\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   nor its progeny diminished the holding in\n   <em>\n    Greist.\n   </em>\n   This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff brought a person-injury action. The court noted the remedy clause \"does not protect only those causes of action that pre-existed 1857 [when the Oregon Constitution was adopted], nor does it preclude the legislature from altering either common-law duties or the remedies available for breach of those duties.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n    359 Or. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n    376 P.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court, however, then set out three analyses to use to determine when the remedy clause limits legislative determination of damage awards:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   In determining the limits that the remedy clause places on the legislature, our cases have considered three general categories of legislation. First, when the legislature has not altered a duty but has denied a person injured as a result of a breach of that duty any remedy, our cases have held that the complete denial of a remedy violates the remedy clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noonan [v.

Similarly, our cases have held that providing an insubstantial remedy for a breach of a recognized duty also violates the remedy clause.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clarke [v.

For example, when the legislature has sought to adjust a person's rights and remedies as part of a larger statutory scheme that extends benefits to some while limiting benefits to others, we have considered that\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   in determining whether the reduced benefit that the legislature has provided an individual plaintiff is \"substantial\" in light of the overall statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    Hale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202458\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/308/508/#p523\">\n    308 Or. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2202458\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/308/508/#p523\">\n    783 P.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, the legislature has modified common-law duties and, on occasion, has eliminated common-law causes of action when the premises underlying those duties and causes of action have changed. In those instances, what has mattered in determining the constitutionality of the legislature's action is the reason for the legislative change measured against the extent to which the\n   legislature has departed from the common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perozzi [v.

That is, we have considered, among other things, whether the common-law cause of action that was modified continues to protect core interests against injury to persons, property, or reputation or whether, in light of changed conditions, the legislature permissibly could conclude that those interests no longer require the protection formerly afforded them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norwest[, By and Through Crain v.

This Court notes this analysis did not eliminate the distinction between common-law personal-injury cases and statute-based wrongful-death cases. Instead the court recognized the need to look to the common law when analyzing the adequacy of a remedy and stated \"common-law causes of action and remedies provide a baseline for measuring the extent to which subsequent legislation conforms to the basic principles\" of the remedy clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n    at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n    376 P.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This Court also notes Plaintiff's case here does not fall within any of the three categories announced in\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   that form the basis to find a violation of the remedy clause.

Instead the wrongful-death statute created a cause of action where none existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

The noneconomic statutory-damages cap similarly does not deny a remedy that existed at common law, but merely limits the liability for the statutorily-created cause of action. The court in\n   <em>\n    Greist\n   </em>\n   noted there was not a statutory limit on noneconomic damages until the Oregon Legislature enacted the damages cap, and, \"[a]lthough that remedy is not precisely of the same extent as that to which plaintiff was entitled before the enactment [of the cap], that remedy is substantial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5537147\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/344/142/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5537147\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/344/142/\">\n    at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n    376 P.3d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In addition, this case does not meet the requirements of the second\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   category that applies a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   analysis to determine whether \"the legislature has sought to adjust a person's rights and remedies as part of a larger statutory scheme that extends benefits to some while limiting benefits to others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12165897\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/359/168/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Horton\n   </em>\n   the court concluded the Legislature's enactment of the OTCA did not alter the duty that doctors owed their patients, but instead limited a plaintiff's remedy for a breach of that duty. The Legislature also did not limit or take away a plaintiff's existing remedy when it enacted the wrongful-death statute, but instead created both a right and a remedy that did not previously exist. Although the Oregon Court of Appeals ultimately concluded in\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   that the statutory-damages cap was unconstitutional, the court noted the statute \"is not part of a\n   <em>\n    quid pro quo\n   </em>\n   statutory scheme as understood in remedy clause of the Oregon constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Or.%20App.%20503\">\n    288 Or.

Pursuant to the wrongful-death statute, Plaintiff has a claim and a potential recovery of all her economic damages and up to $500,000 in noneconomic damages. As the court held in\n   <em>\n    Greist\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's remedy here (application of the statutory-damages\n   cap) does not offend the remedy clause of the Oregon Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that Plaintiff's damages are capped.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff contends even if the cap on noneconomic damages applies, the Court cannot make that determination until evidence of such damages is presented at trial, the amount of damages is determined by the fact-finder, and the actual award is then compared to the reduced damages under the statute to determine whether recovery is \"substantial.\" Plaintiff, however, does not cite to any authority to support this argument and neither does Defendant address this issue in its Reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although Plaintiff has not pled a specific amount of noneconomic damages, it is undisputed that Plaintiff seeks recovery of $8,000,000 in damages for her husband's alleged wrongful-death. Viewing this fact in the light most favorable to Plaintiff without speculating as to the extent of damages that Plaintiff may or may not have suffered or the ultimate application of the statute, the Court concludes as a matter of the law that the $500,000 statutory-damages cap applies to Plaintiff's recovery of noneconomic damages. Thus, the Court finds Defendant is entitled to prevail as a matter of law on this issue at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For these reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion (# 27) for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    This statute was originally enacted in 1987 as Oregon Revised Statutes \u00a7 18.560(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Although the court also found the statutory-damages cap does not violate the right to a jury trial (Article I, section 17 and Article VII (Amended), \u00a7 3) of the Oregon Constitution (\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n     322 Or. at 295\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747437\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/322/281/\">\n     906 P.2d 789\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), that issue is irrelevant here because Plaintiff's action is brought pursuant to the FTCA and a jury trial is \"impermissible\" as a matter of federal law.\n    <em>\n     Nurse v.
