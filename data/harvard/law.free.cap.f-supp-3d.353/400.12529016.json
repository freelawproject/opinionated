In the span of barely ten minutes, the attacker unleashed hundreds of rounds of ammunition, killing 58 people and injuring more than 850. It was the deadliest mass shooting in the modern era. (Brief of Amicus Curiae Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in Support of Def. at 2, ECF No. 13-1.) The shooter used semiautomatic rifles modified with devices known as \"bump stocks,\" which enabled rapid fire approaching the rate of a fully automatic machine gun. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) According to the Department of Justice,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   [o]rdinarily, to operate a semiautomatic firearm, the shooter must repeatedly pull and release the trigger to allow it to reset, so that only one shot is fired with each pull of the trigger. When a bump-stock-type-device is affixed to a semiautomatic firearm, however, the device harnesses the recoil energy to slide the firearm back and forth so that the trigger automatically re-engages by\n   'bumping' the shooter's stationary trigger finger without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter. The bump-stock-type device functions as a self-acting and self-regulating force that channels the firearm's recoil energy in a continuous back-and-forth cycle that allows the shooter to attain continuous firing after a single pull of the trigger ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, &amp; Explosives (ATF), Bump-Stock-Type Devices,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2013442\">\n    83 Fed.

SB-707, sec. 2, \u00a7 4-305.1(a). Violation of the Act is a criminal misdemeanor subject to a term of imprisonment up to three years, a fine of up to $5,000, or both. SB-707, sec. 1, \u00a7 4-306(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Act defines a \"rapid fire trigger activator\" to be \"any device, including a removable manual or power-driven activating device, constructed so that, when installed in or attached to a firearm the rate at which the trigger is activated increases; or the rate of fire increases.\" SB-707, sec. 1, \u00a7 4-301(M)(1). The term is defined to include \"a bump stock, trigger crank, hellfire trigger, binary trigger system, burst trigger system, or a copy or a similar device, regardless of the producer or manufacturer.\" \u00a7 4-301(M)(2).

(Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 11, 17-18.) This only suggests that legislatures may have been persuaded, for political or policy-based reasons, that narrower laws were warranted under past circumstances. In this case, the Maryland General Assembly concluded otherwise. Plaintiffs point to no authority holding such prior legislative concessions to be constitutionally mandated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also make much of the fact that, prior to the passage of SB-707, rapid fire trigger activators were \"lawful property\" in Maryland, \"not contraband.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Although true, this point is irrelevant. Practically all products later defined as contraband were not contraband before the enactment of the law that named them\n   as such. Rapid fire trigger activators used to be lawful in Maryland, but SB-707 makes them unlawful. This is a predictable and uncontroversial consequence of new criminal laws: they criminalize things that would not have been criminal but for the law. Ignoring this basic truth about the nature of criminal legislation, Plaintiffs suggest that states can pass and enforce contraband laws only with respect to items that were already defined as contraband (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), a circular argument leading to absurd results-nothing could be contraband unless it was already contraband.

Abrogation of Vested Rights (Counts II and V)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a separate per se theory under the Maryland Constitution. Plaintiffs argue that SB-707 \"abrogate[es] a vested property right\" in violation of Article 24's protection against \"retrospective statutes,\" and that an Article 24 violation, in turn, constitutes a taking under Article III, \u00a7 40. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68-73;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) Under Maryland law, \"retrospective statutes are those that 'would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Muskin v.

According to Plaintiffs, SB-707 violates this rule because Plaintiffs have a \"vested property interest in the possession of their devices,\" a right that was abrogated when SB-707 made future possession of those devices unlawful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The first problem with this theory is that it is not at all clear how SB-707's provisions can be understood to operate retrospectively. It is not as if SB-707 rendered Plaintiffs' past lawful purchases of rapid fire trigger activators to have been unlawful as of the date of purchase; nor did it retroactively impose the exception clause's authorization requirements. Such effects would have \"increas[ed] ... liability for past conduct,\" or \"impair[ed] rights\" and \"impos[ed] new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\"\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/\">\n    30 A.3d at 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By its terms, SB-707 operates on a purely prospective basis: passed in April 2018, it bans in-state possession after October 1, 2018, with the exception of authorization requirements that go into effect gradually, first in October 2018 and then in October 2019. SB-707, sec. 4. This statutory structure is not retrospective, as Plaintiffs define the term under Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is a second, even more fundamental flaw in Plaintiffs' theory. Plaintiffs provide no authority for the proposition that Maryland law recognizes, under Article 24, \"vested\" rights to possess tangible personal property like rapid fire trigger activators in perpetuity. The cases cited by Plaintiffs concern vested rights to real property, contract rights, and previously accrued causes of actions-none pertains to personal property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/\">\n    30 A.3d at 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversionary rights in ground rent leaseholds);\n   <em>\n    Dua v.

Even if so, that does not necessarily mean that Maryland's \"vested rights\" jurisprudence equally encompasses all property rights without regard for the nature of the property in question. To the contrary, the Maryland Court of Appeals, in discussing the scope of Article 24's protection of \"vested\" rights, made explicit that some categories of property-namely contract rights and real property-are more strongly protected than others.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Muskin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702148\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/544/\">\n    30 A.3d at 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]n the spectrum of vested rights recognized previously by this Court, [vested causes of action] are not as important as the vested real property and contractual rights which have almost been sacrosanct in our history.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 974 (similarly emphasizing the central importance of \"[r]eal property and contractual rights\" as \"the basis of economic stability\").

According to Plaintiffs, this definition can be read to encompass any number of firearm accessories that \"allow for faster, controlled follow-up shots\" and, therefore, might \"increase, by some small measure, the effective 'rate of fire.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.) Plaintiffs cite muzzle weights, fore grips, recoil-reducing devices, and devices that redirect flash as items that could be covered by this reading of SB-707. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, because the Act does not by its terms limit its scope to devices that operate on semiautomatic weapons, Plaintiffs further claim that accessories that \"permit a user to more rapidly reload a revolver\" could also be interpreted as minimally increasing the \"rate of fire.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63.) For these reasons, Plaintiffs argue that the Act fails to provide \"fair notice of the conduct [it] proscribes\" and risks \"arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement,\" in violation of due process.

The substantive provision at issue imposed a \"zero discharge\" standard for rain water runoff on JMS, unless the discharge was made in accordance with the terms of a permit issued under EPA authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n    at 1524-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In JMS's case, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) would have had to issue such a permit, because the EPA had previously designated EPD as the exclusive authority to administer the program within Georgia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n    at 1525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time JMS was in operation, JMS could not obtain a federal permit because of the grant of exclusive authority to EPD, but EPD permits were not yet available.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n    at 1525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the permit's unavailability, on its own, did not render compliance impossible. In addition, the evidence was \"uncontroverted\" that compliance with a zero-discharge standard for rain water was factually impossible under any circumstance, because \"whenever it rained[,] ... some discharge was going to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94195\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/1523/#p1530\">\n    at 1530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was the combination of a legally unavailable permit alongside the factual impossibility of achieving substantive compliance through any other means, including halting operations entirely. The contrast to this case is plain: while it may be impossible for Plaintiffs to access the exception, substantive compliance remains fully within Plaintiffs' control. To comply, all they need to do is move the banned devices out of state or get rid of them altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In other cases cited by Plaintiffs, the unavailability of an exception itself created a constitutional problem.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Broderick v.

None of the Court's conclusions in dismissing those constitutional claims predicated the constitutionality of SB-707 on the existence of an accessible exception clause. In short, the factual impossibility of obtaining authorization for continued lawful ownership in Maryland presents no constitutional problem in this case; nor have Plaintiffs alleged that the exception clause is itself dependent on any constitutionally suspect classification.

Here, Plaintiffs seek to invalidate SB-707's statutory scheme\n    <em>\n     in toto.\n    </em>\n    Although the Tenth Circuit reversed the convictions, nothing in\n    <em>\n     Dalton\n    </em>\n    even remotely suggests that the underlying prohibition on possession was invalid or that the defendant therefore retained a right to possess the firearm in question-which is ultimately what Plaintiffs seek here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Although the Court need not reach the severability question, there are a few aspects of Plaintiffs' argument that warrant comment. Plaintiffs seem to read SB-707's exception clause as evidence of a clear intent on the part of the Maryland Legislature to exempt an entire class of existing owners-or at least some of them-from the prohibition on possession of rapid fire trigger activators. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36-37.) However, the design of the statute's exception clause does not support that conclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Had the Legislature intended to guarantee a path to continued lawful possession, it could have followed the example of past Maryland firearms regulations and crafted either a straightforward grandfather clause excepting all lawful purchases prior to a certain date,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Crim.%20Law%20%C2%A7%204-303\">\n     Md.

Instead, the exception scheme as enacted made continued lawful possession contingent on the independent legal and policy decisions of a federal agency over which Maryland has no control. Furthermore, at the time SB-707 was enacted, the very federal agency it placed in charge of authorization was actively reconsidering the status of bump stocks and similar devices under federal law, including a proposal to redefine them as machine guns subject to stringent, existing regulations. DOJ Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 83 Fed. Reg. at 13442. Because the status of such devices was, at best, unsettled at the time SB-707 was passed, it seems reasonably foreseeable that ATF might have decided to deny every single application received as a matter of federal policy or of binding federal law. The Court fails to see how such a result-with the same practical effect for Maryland device-owners as the current ATF position-would be inconsistent with the statute. Contrary to Plaintiffs' argument, it is not at all clear from the structure of the exception procedure that SB-707 embodied a clear legislative intent that any existing owner be entitled to continued lawful possession of rapid fire trigger activators in Maryland.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Finally, even assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that there might be an independent ground for objection based on the formal distinction between ATF processing but denying each and every application and ATF refusing to process any applications at all, a suit against the State of Maryland is not the proper vehicle for relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
