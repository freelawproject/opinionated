CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the Court is Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Momenta\") and Sandoz Inc.'s (\"Sandoz\") (collectively \"Defendants\") Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) (Lack of Personal Jurisdiction), Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) (Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction), and Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (Doc. Nos. 195, 195, 197.) Nashville General Hospital (\"NGH\") and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees District Council 37 Health &amp; Security Plan (\"DC 37\") (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") have filed responses to Defendants' motions (Doc. Nos. 208, 209, 210), to which Defendants have replied (Doc. Nos. 213, 214, 215). For the reasons below, the Court will (1) grant Defendants' Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss; (2) deny Defendants' Rule 12(b)(2) motion; and (3) grant in part and deny in part Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 14, 2015, NGH filed its initial complaint against the Defendants, alleging four separate counts under the Sherman Antitrust Act (\"Sherman Act\"). (Doc. No. 1.) NGH sought damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) NGH brought its claims on behalf of itself and a nationwide class of persons and entities, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\"CAFA\") and Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 21.) As explained in more detail in Section B\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the alleged Sherman Act violations centered on the role that Defendants played in a conspiracy to monopolize the production and distribution of enoxaparin, a generic version of the drug Lovenox\u00ae. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to the complaint, Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the District of Massachusetts and a motion to dismiss. (Doc. Nos. 65, 68.) Momenta additionally filed a separate motion to dismiss or transfer for improper venue. (Doc. No. 62.) On September 29, 2016, Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes entered a Report and Recommendation recommending that the motions be denied. (Doc. No. 114.) Defendants filed joint and separate objections to the Report and Recommendation. (Doc. Nos. 117, 119.) On March 21, 2017, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion that adopted in part and declined to adopt in part the Report and Recommendation. (Doc. No. 134.) The Court dismissed NGH's Sherman Act claims, to the extent that NGH sought damages in connection with those claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-14.) The Court found that NGH did not have standing to seek damages for its Sherman Act claims under the \"indirect purchaser rule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, NGH's Sherman Act claims were permitted to proceed on declaratory and injunctive theories of relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, NGH filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint. (Doc. No. 140.) The amended complaint contained three primary changes: (1) the addition of DC 37 as a new representative plaintiff; (2) the addition of various state antitrust and consumer protection claims; and (3) the addition of new substantive allegations pertaining to Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct. (Doc. No. 141 at 5.) Defendants filed a response in opposition. (Doc. No. 148.) Ultimately, Magistrate Judge Holmes granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint, and Plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on December 21, 2017. (Doc. No. 191.) Defendants then filed the instant motions to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   NGH is a metropolitan charity hospital that purchases certain drugs it administers, including the generic anticoagulant enoxaparin. (Doc. No. 191 at 6-7.) DC 37 is a non-profit health and welfare benefit plan covering public sector employees, retirees and their families. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that they have, and will continue to, indirectly purchase and/or provide reimbursement for Lovenox\u00ae and enoxaparin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The drug at issue, enoxaparin, is used in the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and in the treatment of heart attacks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Sanofi-Aventis (\"Aventis\"), a non-party to this lawsuit, brought enoxaparin to market in the United States under the brand name Lovenox\u00ae and held a patent on the drug, which was subsequently held to be unenforceable in 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, Momenta is the assignee of a patent (the \"886 Patent\") for a chemical process used to test the quality of enoxaparin (\"Method &lt; 207&gt;\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) In 2003, Momenta entered into a collaboration\n   agreement (the \"Collaboration Agreement\") with Sandoz, whereby Sandoz eventually began manufacturing and selling generic enoxaparin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-14.) The Collaboration Agreement provided for profit-sharing between Momenta and Sandoz, with regard to Sandoz's sales of its generic enoxaparin, so long as Defendants remained the sole source of generic enoxaparin in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Further, the Collaboration Agreement provided for Momenta to receive \"milestone payments\" if Sandoz remained the sole supplier of generic enoxaparin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Essentially, the Collaboration Agreement provided Momenta with a powerful incentive to use whatever rights it had to prevent other parties from entering the generic enoxaparin market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By 2007, Aventis had requested that the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (\"USP\") adopt criteria for enoxaparin that included a standardized test to assure that enoxaparin produced by drug companies in the United States met chemical criteria approved by the FDA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) Aventis's proposed method for testing enoxaparin was Method &lt; 207&gt;. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At that time, Aventis had a pending patent application for Method &lt; 207&gt;. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Defendants, who participated in the relevant USP review panel, objected to Aventis having a patent that covered a standardized USP test, contending that the test, once adopted, should be free for anyone to use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After discussions with USP, Aventis agreed to abandon its patent application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) However, unbeknownst to the USP panel, Momenta had its own patent application pending-the 886 Patent-that, when granted, would give Momenta patent rights that could be asserted against third parties that used Method &lt; 207&gt;. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19.) In December 2009, the USP approved and adopted Method &lt; 207&gt; as the standardized test to assure enoxaparin quality, and the 886 Patent was issued shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 19.) Plaintiffs allege that, had Defendants disclosed their own application for the 886 Patent, the USP would have either required Momenta to abandon its patent rights, as it did with Aventis, or chosen an alternative test that would not have been subject to patent protection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants became the first entities authorized by the FDA to produce generic enoxaparin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Thereafter, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Amphastar\"), a non-party to this case, received FDA approval to sell generic enoxaparin on September 19, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Upon approval, the FDA instructed Amphastar to use the USP compendium for enoxaparin, including Method &lt; 207&gt;. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Two days later, Defendants sued Amphastar in the District of Massachusetts, contending that it was essentially illegal for Amphastar to comply with Method &lt; 207&gt; and produce generic enoxaparin because it could not do so without infringing on the 886 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After filing their complaint, Defendants obtained a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing Amphastar from selling enoxaparin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction in January 2012 and vacated it in August 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In July 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts granted Amphastar's motion for summary judgment,\n   finding that Amphastar did not infringe on the asserted claims of the 886 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.) Defendants appealed the district court's order, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the district court's grant of summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) In July 2017, a jury found that Momenta's 886 Patent was invalid for lack of enablement and lack of written description.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Momenta Pharm., Inc. v. Amphastar Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:11-cv-11681-NMG, Doc. No. 1081 (D. Mass. July 21, 2017) (jury verdict in favor of defendants).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court accepted post-trial briefing and, on February 7, 2018, issued its post-trial orders, upholding the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. Nos. 1134, 1135, 1136, 1137, 1138, 1139, 1149. Defendants have sought an appeal of this order before the Federal Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Momenta Pharm., Inc. v. Amphastar Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-740, Doc. No. 1 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 29, 2018) (notice of appeal).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs, in their Amended Complaint, assert four counts under the Sherman Act, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. (Doc. No. 191 at 30-35.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' anticompetitive conduct \"is continuing and will continue unless enjoined by the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs also claim, on behalf of themselves and members of the putative class, a host of state violations, pursuant to those states' antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants first filed a Motion to Dismiss Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) (Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction). (Doc. No. 193.) Defendants' primary argument is that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to pursue their Sherman Act claims for injunctive and declaratory relief. (Doc. No. 196 at 10-13.) Defendants contend that Plaintiffs sole sought-after relief-permanent enjoinment of Defendants from asserting their rights in the 886 Patent against other potential entrants in the generic enoxaparin marketplace-would require this Court to prohibit future, hypothetical conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Moreover, Defendants maintain that (1) it has been more than six years since they have sought to use the 886 Patent to bar others from entering the generic enoxaparin market; and (2) even if they wished to assert their 886 Patent rights to engage in anticompetitive conduct, the litigation in the District of Massachusetts prevents them from doing so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13.) Accordingly, Defendants argue that the Amended Complaint does not allege facts showing a concrete threat of imminent harm, and, therefore, Plaintiffs fail to present the Court with a justiciable Article III case or controversy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1.

(Doc. No. 198 at 13.) As a result, Defendants contend that the statute of limitations began running on January 26, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because NGH sought leave to amend its complaint on June 9, 2017 (and filed the Amended Complaint on December 21, 2017), over five years passed after expiration of the preliminary injunction.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants also assert that the continuing violation doctrine, fraudulent concealment doctrine, and the discovery rule did not toll the various state statutes of limitations periods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-19.) Plaintiffs respond that each of these doctrines independently applies to extend the state statutes of limitations, making their state law claims timely.

(Doc. No. 191 at 24-28.) The Amended Complaint alleges that the wholesale price of generic enoxaparin did not begin to decline until May 2012 and subsequently began plummeting in 2014, until which time Plaintiffs allegedly suffered hundreds of millions dollars in overcharges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As noted in Magistrate Judge Holmes's previous order allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint, the Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Klehr v. A.O.

(Doc. No. 198 at 15.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' allegations focus on \"discrete past actions involving the enforcement of a patent to the exclusion of a competitor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court finds this characterization of the allegations unpersuasive. Plaintiffs' allegations detail a price-fixing conspiracy between Sandoz and Momenta, based on enforcement of the 886 Patent, in order to (1) prevent new entrants from entering the generic enoxaparin market; thereby (2) keeping prices artificially inflated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191 at 24-28.) Thus, under\n   <em>\n    Klehr\n   </em>\n   , each time Defendants sold enoxaparin to Plaintiffs at supracompetitive prices, which, as alleged in the Amended Complaint, extended well past May 2012, the statutory period started again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915904\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/179/#p189\">\n    521 U.S. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915904\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/179/#p189\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, because Plaintiffs allege that Defendants wrongfully sold them enoxaparin at supracompetitive prices until at least 2014, and each sale restarted the five year statute of limitations, the continuing violation doctrine extended the statute of limitations period. Plaintiffs' state law claims are timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   2. Standing for State Law Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing to bring claims under the laws of the states where they do not reside and where they did not purchase generic enoxaparin. (Doc. No. 198 at 19-20.) Plaintiffs respond that Defendants confuse the issue of standing with the adequacy of class representation and argue that, in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Fallick v.

(Doc.

State Law Pleading Requirements\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendants next argue that the Amended Complaint fails to adequately plead the state law claims. (Doc. No. 198 at 22-27.) Defendants' primary argument is that Plaintiffs fail to establish a sufficient nexus to numerous states for purposes of the antitrust and consumer protection statutes of those states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   i. Intrastate Nexus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The parties are in agreement that the antitrust statutes of certain jurisdictions require a plaintiff to allege a nexus between a defendant's conduct and intrastate commerce; boilerplate allegations are insufficient. (Doc. Nos. 198 at 22-23, 210 at 22-25.) The parties disagree as to whether the allegations in the Amended Complaint satisfy the pleading requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Those jurisdictions at issue include Arizona, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. (Doc. No. 198 at 22-23.) Defendants also maintain that the consumer protection statutes for California, Nebraska, New York, and North Carolina require the same intrastate nexus, and, therefore, for these same reasons, Plaintiffs fail to adequately plead their state law consumer protection claims for those states. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, in each aforementioned jurisdiction, Defendants' anticompetitive conduct reduced competition and increased prices, causing a substantial effect on commerce within the jurisdiction. (Doc. No. 191 at 35-57.) The \"intrastate effects\" requirement is met at the pleading stage by a plaintiff's allegations, like those in the instant case, claiming that the anticompetitive conduct caused supracompetitive price effects in the relevant jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Automotive Parts Antirust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320211\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/29/982/#p1010\">\n    29 F.Supp.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010 (E.D.

Defendants also assert that, under the consumer protection laws of Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and Vermont only consumers that purchase a product for personal or household use may bring consumer protection claims. (Doc. No. 198 24-25.) Further, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' Montana consumer protection claim fails because Montana law does not allow consumer protection class actions.

(Doc. No. 210 at 26-27.) Further, Plaintiffs argue that Vermont's consumer protection statute expressly contemplates suits involving individuals who purchase goods for use or benefit in their business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Finally, Plaintiffs maintain the Missouri's consumer protection statute permits suit, even where the product is not purchased for personal or household use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties accurately note that only citizens or residents of Utah may recover under its antitrust law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code \u00a7 76-10-3109(1)(a). However, Plaintiffs assert allegations on behalf of a putative class that presumably includes Utah citizens and residents. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 191 at 27-30, 54-55.) Allegations that members of the putative class presumably include Utah citizens and residents are sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Liquid Aluminum Sulfate Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV-16-MD-2687-JLL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203131977\">\n    2017 WL 3131977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *28 (D.

Mass. July 20, 2016) ). Further, Defendants essentially raise the issue of whether Plaintiffs have standing to pursue the Utah antitrust claim, and, as noted above, this issue is better decided at the class certification state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fallick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11800535\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/410/#p423\">\n    162 F.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For this same reason, the Court will also not decide the statutory standing issue with regard to Plaintiffs' Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and Vermont consumer protection claims, as Defendants' argument again centers on whether Plaintiffs' have standing to pursue those claims. Accordingly, the Court will not dismiss said claims at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   iii. Unjust Enrichment Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims fail for almost half of the state jurisdictions (14 of 31) on the ground that Plaintiffs failed to to allege that they provided a direct benefit to Defendants. (Doc. No. 198 at 26.) Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims, under the laws of Arizona, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Tennessee, fail because Plaintiffs do not plead absence of a legal remedy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Finally, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs' California unjust enrichment claim fails because California does not recognize a cause for unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs respond that (1) the Amended Complaint adequately pleads a direct benefit to Defendants and absence of a legal remedy; and (2) California recognizes unjust enrichment claims where the claim arises out of rights based on other laws. (Doc. No. 210 at 32-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims, indirect purchasers confer a benefit only on others in the chain of distribution from whom they purchase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-C-4883,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201416259\">\n    2010 WL 1416259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 1, 2010) (\"Only the direct purchasers have conferred a direct benefit on defendants.\") However, courts considering indirect consumer price-fixing claims have denied dismissal of unjust enrichment claims where the claims arise out of the alleged antitrust violations that resulted in overpayment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Automotive Parts Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320211\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/29/982/#p1010\">\n    29 F.Supp.3d at 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs allege that they conferred a benefit\n   on Defendants in the form of overpayments, resulting in Defendants enjoying profits flowing from the anti-competitive conduct. (Doc. No. 191 at 71.) The Court finds these allegations sufficient to state an unjust enrichment claim under those states' laws. However, because Plaintiffs did not plead absence of a legal remedy, their unjust enrichment claims under the laws of Arizona, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Tennessee will be dismissed. Moreover, with regard to Plaintiffs' California unjust enrichment claim, California does not recognize unjust enrichment, and, therefore, this claim is also dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v.
