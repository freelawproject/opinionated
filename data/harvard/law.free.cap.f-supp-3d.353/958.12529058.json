Christensen, Chief Judge\n   United States Magistrate Judge Jeremiah C. Lynch entered his Findings and Recommendation in this case on May 3, 2018, recommending that Defendant Andrew Anglin's Motion to Dismiss be denied to the extent it seeks dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (Doc. 85 at 30.) Anglin filed his objections on May 13, 2018, and the Court deems his objections timely filed. (Doc. 91.) Consequently, Anglin is entitled to de novo review of those findings and recommendations to which he has specifically objected.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

Accordingly, it adopts the Findings and Recommendation in full and denies Anglin's motion to dismiss except as to the constitutionality of the Anti-Intimidation Act, an issue that was not addressed in the Findings and Recommendation and accordingly is not reached in this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Andrew Anglin publishes an alt-right website, the\n   <em>\n    Daily Stormer\n   </em>\n   , which derives its name from\n   <em>\n    Der St\u00fcrmer\n   </em>\n   , an unofficial pro-Nazi propaganda tabloid. On December 16, 2016, following a string of lead-up articles, Anglin wrote and published on his website an article calling his readers to action: \"Let's Hit Em Up[.] Are y'all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm? Because AYO-it's that time, fam.\" (Doc. 1 at 2.) The so-called troll storm was targeted at Plaintiff Tanya Gersh, and Anglin published Gersh's phone numbers, email addresses, and social media profiles, as well as those of her husband, twelve-year-old son, friends, and colleagues. Anglin asked readers to \"Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda to attack and harm the mother of someone whom they disagree with.\" (Doc. 1 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Daily Stormer\n   </em>\n   's articles centered on Gersh's interactions with Sherry Spencer, Whitefish resident and mother of prominent neo-Nazi Richard Spencer. At some\n   point, Gersh, a realtor, discussed the potential sale of a business property with Sherry Spencer, who owned the building and was facing boycotts related to her son's notoriety. In the articles, Anglin described Gersh's behavior as extortion, and Anglin drew heavily on crude ethnic stereotypes, painting Gersh as acting in furtherance of a perceived Jewish agenda and using Holocaust imagery and rhetoric. He called for \"confrontation\" and \"action,\" (Doc. 1 at 18 &amp; 41), but he also told readers to avoid illegal activity, drawing a line between what Anglin believed to be constitutionally protected speech-e.g., \"photoshop[ping] pictures of your face and that of your scamming spammer rat son onto Nazi propaganda posters from the 1930s,\" (Doc. 1 at 41)-and speech for which he and his followers might face liability-e.g., \"threats of violence, suggestions of violence or acts of violence,\" (Doc. 1 at 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The messages received by Gersh and her family, including her son, were filled with ethnic slurs and misogynistic rants. Many messages referenced the Holocaust, and some threatened violence. When Gersh filed her Complaint in the spring of 2017, she and her family had received more than 700 disparaging and/or threatening messages over phone calls, voicemails, text messages, emails, letters, social media comments, and Christmas cards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Withholding judgment on the constitutionality of Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Lynch recommended denying Anglin's motion to dismiss on every other theory raised. Anglin's objections fall along three lines: (1) the First Amendment broadly protects Anglin's own speech; (2) Anglin cannot be held liable for others' speech consistent with the First Amendment; and (3) Gersh failed to state a legally cognizable claim under each of the three legal theories raised in her complaint: invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, or violation of Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. First Amendment Protection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Judge Lynch recommended rejecting Anglin's argument that the challenged speech is protected by the First Amendment and accordingly immune from a state tort suit. Anglin contends that his motion to dismiss should be granted because the speech giving rise to Gersh's claim enjoys First Amendment protection. He argues that: (1) the speech does not fall within an unprotected category; and (2) the speech involved both a matter of public concern-neo-Nazi Richard Spencer's relationship with the town of Whitefish, Montana-and a public figure-Gersh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court agrees that the speech does not fall into a de facto unprotected category. And in fact Gersh does not contend that Anglin's speech falls within one of the few \"historic and traditional categories of expression long familiar to the bar\" for which content-based restrictions on speech are clearly permitted.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    567 U.S. 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407413\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/709/#p717\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).

The Ninth Circuit's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Shoemaker\n   </em>\n   was limited by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. The Court addressed only whether \"the Supreme Court has ... clearly established that images morphed to depict children engaged in sexual activity are protected by the First Amendment\" when the Supreme Court had in fact expressly reserved the question of whether morphed images fell within a clearly established category of unprotected speech, child pornography.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702910\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/778/#p787\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702910\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/778/#p787\">\n    at 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, there is no question that Gersh is not a general public figure; of the cast of characters in this matter, only Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin have reached \"pervasive fame or notoriety.\" Rather, Anglin argues that Gersh became a limited purpose public figure when Sherry Spencer published an article in an online forum criticizing Gersh.

Again, the relevant question is whether the speech regards a matter of public concern. And, as discussed above, there is, at minimum, a plausible allegation that the speech does not. If Anglin's speech in calling for a troll storm is not entitled to First Amendment protection, then it stands to reason he can be\n   equally subject to tort liability under various theories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Anglin's argument to the contrary is based primarily in\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, as Judge Lynch found,\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   is specific to the issue of incitement, a theory that Gersh has not pursued in this litigation. (Doc. 85 at 21). Reviewing de novo, the Court agrees with Judge Lynch's analysis of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   involved a boycott of white merchants in Mississippi, instigated and organized in part by a local branch of the NAACP.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. 886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lower courts determined that an NAACP spokesperson could be held liable to the merchants for lost earnings because he had delivered speeches advocating-perhaps rhetorically, perhaps not-for the use of force against black citizens who continued to patronize the white merchants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    at 894-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Supreme Court disagreed, holding that the spokesperson was insulated from liability because he had not himself \"authorized, ratified, or directly threatened\" unlawful activity, i.e., violence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court further concluded that the spokesperson did not have an affirmative duty to \"repudiate\" unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   is inapposite for at least two reasons. First and most importantly, the case is legally distinguishable. Here, unlike the speaker in\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   , Anglin was not speaking on a matter of public concern. The First Amendment is considerably more concerned with a concerted action to address racial discrimination than it is with the ethnic background and contact information of a realtor who was arguably involved in a real estate dispute with the mother of Richard Spencer. Thus, while the NAACP spokesperson's speech, absent a finding of incitement, falls within the core of the First Amendment, Anglin's speech does not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pages 963-67. Second,\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable. To the degree that the NAACP spokesperson called on his supporters to engage in unlawful conduct, that conduct did not actually occur.\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, on the other hand, the harm alleged by Gersh is precisely the type of harm not only anticipated but requested by Anglin in his\n   <em>\n    Daily Stormer\n   </em>\n   posts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If [the] language had been followed by acts of violence, a substantial question would be presented whether [the spokesperson] could be held liable for the consequences of that unlawful conduct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Indeed, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   provides guidance, it advances Gersh's theory. The Court held that \"[f]or liability to be imposed by reason of association alone, it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held a specific intent to further those illegal aims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    at 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The standard is met when the individual \"authorized, directed, or ratified specific tortious activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The test does not require, as Anglin ostensibly posits, that the \"specific tortious activity\" be physically violent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   standard finds a mirror in Montana's substantial assistance test. Under Montana law, the substantial assistance test enables a plaintiff to seek damages from a defendant for the tortious conduct of another when the defendant \"knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.\"\n   <em>\n    Sloan v. Fauque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5312545\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/239/383/\">\n    239 Mont. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5312545\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/239/383/\">\n    784 P.2d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 896 (1989) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 876 (1979) ). In other words, liability may follow when an individual \"authorized\" or \"directed\" \"specific tortious activity,\"\n   <em>\n    Claiborne Hardware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    458 U.S. at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636531\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/886/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -the \"breach of duty\" required to satisfy the substantial assistance test under Montana law,\n   <em>\n    Sloan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5312545\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/239/383/\">\n    784 P.2d at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Turning to the facts alleged in this case, Anglin contends that the substantial assistance test cannot be satisfied by Gersh's allegations because Gersh \"fail[ed] to plead the requisite knowledge element.\" (Doc. 91 at 14.) The Court disagrees. Gersh alleged that Anglin expressly summoned a troll storm, publishing personal and professional contact information for the Gersh family, and offering samples of the types of anti-Semitic and misogynistic messages his readers should leave. He oversaw a discussion board on his website, in which he interacted with readers who posted comments about their trolling tactics. It is not unreasonable to conclude from these facts that Anglin knew what his readers were doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"No first amendment defense need be permitted when words are more than mere advocacy, so close in time and purpose to a substantive evil as to become part of the [tort] itself\"-\"an integral and essential part of ongoing [tortious] activity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mendelsohn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539063\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/896/1183/#p1186\">\n    896 F.2d 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1186 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Construing the Complaint in the light most favorable to Gersh, Anglin's posts and his readers' messages are part of the same \"ongoing activity\" with the same ultimate aim. Thus, the Court agrees with Judge Lynch that Gersh presented a cognizable theory by which the messages left by\n   <em>\n    Daily Stormer\n   </em>\n   readers may form a basis for damages against Anglin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Sufficiency of Gersh's Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Regarding Anglin's third challenge to this lawsuit's continued survival, Judge Lynch concluded that \"Gersh has adequately stated claims under Montana law for invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of the Anti-Intimidation Act.\" (Doc. 85 at 30). Anglin challenges Judge Lynch's Findings and Recommendation as to each cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, under Montana law, a plaintiff may bring a claim for invasion of privacy under the subtheory of intrusion upon seclusion-\"a wrongful intrusion into one's private activities in such a manner as to outrage or cause mental suffering, shame, or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Mont. Bd. of Dentistry v. Kandarian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4558875\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/408/\">\n    268 Mont. 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4558875\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/408/\">\n    886 P.2d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957 (1994). Judge Lynch found that the allegations of the Complaint, if true, could satisfy the applicable test because the series of harassing and threatening communications-sent first- and secondhand to Gersh via nearly every potential line of communication-could be seen as a \"wrongful intrusion\" into Gersh's private life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Anglin's objections as to this issue are inextricable from his First Amendment objections, and they fail for the same reasons. He contends that Gersh did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy because her discussions with Sherry Spencer\n   should be read as welcoming public engagement. (Doc. 91 at 18-20.) However, as discussed above, Gersh's allegations do not give rise to such a finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pages 966-67;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Diego\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5909984\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/77/#p83\">\n    543 U.S. at 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5909984\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/543/77/#p83\">\n    125 S.Ct. 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he standard for determining whether expression is of public concern is the same standard used to determine whether a common-law action for invasion of privacy is present.\"). Anglin also argues that his conduct was not intrusive, even if his followers' conduct was. Again, the Court concludes that at least some of Anglin's followers' conduct can be considered as a basis for liability under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pages 967-69. And, at this stage of litigation, Anglin cannot avoid liability on the grounds that he merely posted publicly available information, such as Gersh's social media accounts, as Gersh alleges that Anglin posted this information in order to further his goal of \"outrag[ing] or caus[ing] mental suffering, shame, or humiliation\" to Gersh.\n   <em>\n    Kandarian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4558875\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/408/\">\n    886 P.2d at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress \"arise[s] under circumstances where serious or severe emotional distress to the plaintiff was the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's ... intentional act.\"\n   <em>\n    Sacco v. High Country Ind. Press\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4546480\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/271/209/\">\n    271 Mont. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4546480\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/271/209/\">\n    896 P.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429 (1995). Responding to Anglin's argument that Gersh's damages were not \"reasonably foreseeable\" to Anglin, Judge Lynch determined that Gersh presented a cognizable claim by \"alleg[ing] that Anglin assisted, encouraged, and ratified a vicious campaign of anti-Semitic harassment against her and her family.\" (Doc. 85 at 27.) Anglin objects, again, on First Amendment grounds, arguing that he cannot be held liable for the conduct of his readers and that Judge Lynch's findings constitute viewpoint-based discrimination. (Doc. 91 at 21-22.) However, Anglin presents no authority for his position that the Court should conduct an additional layer of First Amendment review in analyzing the elements of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.5. The Court has thoroughly considered his free speech arguments and finds that a decision for Anglin at this stage would, at minimum, be premature. Accordingly, the Court agrees with Judge Lynch as to the adequacy of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third and finally, Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act creates a cause of action for \"[a]n individual or organization who is attempting to exercise a legally protected right and who is injured, harassed, or aggrieved by a threat or intimidation ... against the person engaging in the threatening or intimidating behavior.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mont.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-1-1503\">\n    Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 27-1-1503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2). Setting aside the question of the constitutionality of the Act,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.2, Judge Lynch determined that \"Gersh has alleged facts showing that she was attempting to exercise her legally protected rights to privacy and to freely practice her religion at the time of Anglin's allegedly wrongful conduct.\" (Doc. 85 at 28.) Anglin argues that the Complaint does not give rise to such a determination, as Gersh alleged only that Anglin interfered with her speech rights, rather than her privacy and free exercise rights. However, the Court cannot take such a parsimonious approach to the pleadings; the Complaint includes allegations that Gersh practices Judaism\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, as discussed above, Gersh presented a cognizable\n   claim for invasion of privacy. No magic words were needed in the Complaint when the allegations of the Complaint, as a whole, could support a finding that Anglin's conduct interfered with Gersh's privacy and ability to freely practice her religion. The Court agrees with Judge Lynch that Gersh's claim may proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Reviewing the remaining portions of Judge Lynch's Findings and Recommendation for clear error and finding none,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Judge Lynch's Findings and Recommendation (Doc. 85) are ADOPTED in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Anglin's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED to the extent it seeks dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Because the Findings and Recommendation include a more thorough factual background, and because the parties are familiar with the allegations of the Complaint, the Court presents only a brief background summary within this Order.

Rather, because the Constitution is implicated only to the degree that Anglin's speech is entitled to protection, the Court need not, at least at this stage of the litigation, be overly concerned with\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n    Anglin may be held liable under Montana law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Anglin further argues that he did not interfere with Gersh's free exercise rights because \"[a]lthough the speech addressed Ms. Gersh's status as a Jew, it did so in the context of ethnic background, rather than any attention to the practice of her faith.\" (Doc. 91 at 24.) Anglin's argument is too clever by half. The focus is on whether Anglin's intimidating and harassing speech interfered with Gersh's free exercise rights.
