HILLMAN, DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Ryan Flynn (\"Defendant\") moves this Court to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the interception of wire communications and the search of Defendant's home. For the reasons stated below, Defendant's\n   motion (Docket No. 56) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      denied\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2016 and early 2017, Police believed Vito Nuzzolilo was involved in dealing large quantities of heroin and cocaine in and around Worcester, Massachusetts. Before obtaining a wiretap from this Court, the Government had investigated Nuzzolilo for almost a year. (Docket No. 61-2 \u00b6 20) (\"Wiretap Aff.\"). During this period, the Government utilized a variety of investigative methods including: physical surveillance, audio and video surveillance, telephone toll records, pen register and trap-and-trace information, telephone subscriber information, GPS tracking, statements of confidential sources, monitored and/or recorded phone calls, and queries of law enforcement records and intelligence databases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Investigators learned that Nuzzolilo primarily distributed drugs from his top-floor apartment on Grafton Street in Worcester (\"Grafton Apartment\"). (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7) (\"Apt. Aff.\"). Further, Nuzzolilo and his associates accessed the Grafton Apartment from a rear entrance via a parking lot. Wiretap Aff. \u00b6 65. This parking lot was fenced and/or walled on all sides, and Nuzzolilo maintained video surveillance of the area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Apt. Aff. \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The confidential informant was able to learn that Nuzzolilo had sources in New York and Boston. Wiretap Aff. \u00b6 61. In addition, the informant made a number of controlled purchases. For instance, on July 20, 2016, the informant met with Nuzzolilo at the Grafton Apartment and purchased 10 grams of heroin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. On August 5, 2016, the informant made another purchase of 30 grams of heroin from Nuzzolilo's partner, Kristin Little.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30-33. On December 6, 2016, the informant again purchased 20 grams of heroin from Nuzzolilo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37-39. Finally, on January 30, 2017, the informant purchased another 20 grams of heroin from Nuzzolilo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2017, because investigators lacked detailed knowledge of Nuzzolilo's sources of supply, the Government sought and obtained a wiretap authorized by this Court on Nuzzolilo's cell phone to learn more about how and from whom he acquired drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government alleged that the cooperation of the informant alone, or in conjunction with other investigative means short of the interception of electronic and wire communications, would not be sufficient to meet the goals of the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. The Government noted that although the informant bought drugs from Nuzzolilo, the informant was unlikely to fully infiltrate or understand the operations of the wider drug trafficking organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For instance, the informant was \"not privy to information such as the actual identify of NUZZOLILO's sources of supply, the distribution network of the Target DTO, or the organization structure of the Target DTO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition to the inability of the informant to provide more information about Nuzzolilo's supply chain, the affiant noted difficulties conducting physical surveillance and related investigative techniques at the Grafton Apartment. Wiretap Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 65-71; 92-93. According to the Government, the layout of the Grafton Apartment and its enclosed parking lot-coupled with Nuzzolilo's video surveillance of the area-meant that efforts to conduct surveillance of those accessing the parking lot would have likely led to detection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Government argued, however, that \"continued surveillance done in conjunction with electronic surveillance\" would \"lead to the development of evidence sufficient to prosecute\n   multiple members\" of the enterprise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Communications intercepted pursuant to the wiretap revealed that Nuzzolilo communicated with drug customers, often using coded language to refer to drugs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Apt. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, 41. Further, Nuzzolilo communicated with drug suppliers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26, 28, 29, 33-35, 43. Interceptions revealed that the Defendant was one of these suppliers.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 61-3 (\"Flynn Aff.\"). Defendant used a phone subscribed in the name Reid Marinelli.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Agents confirmed that the communications were in fact from Defendant when \"Marinelli\" stated that he wanted to see Nuzzolilo on April 14, 2017 and updated Nuzzolilo on his whereabouts. Agents shortly thereafter observed the Defendant meeting with Nuzzolilo in a car outside of the Grafton Apartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government developed a substantial amount of evidence from the wiretap demonstrating that Defendant supplied drugs to Nuzzolilo including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 In April 2017, Nuzzolilo owed a substantial drug debt to Defendant, and Defendant made plans to collect the money from Nuzzolilo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 On April 14, 2017, Defendant traveled to the Grafton Apartment, presumably in order to collect a portion of the money Nuzzolilo owed him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 On April 22, 2017, Nuzzolilo informed Defendant that he was in the process of collecting outstanding drug debts and would soon have money to pay Defendant. Two days later, however Nuzzolilo informed Defendant that he needed more time to collect the money that he owed Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 On April 27, 2017, Nuzzolilo told Defendant that he had a lot of money (\"paperwork\") and drugs (\"stuff\"). Nuzzolilo told Defendant that he was trying to sell the drugs in order to generate more money to pay Defendant. Defendant replied, \"I just got people breathing down my neck buddy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 On April 30, 2017, Nuzzolilo informed Defendant that he was \"almost finished\" and that he needed to see Defendant the next day. In addition, Nuzzolilo asked Defendant to \"be ready for me\"-presumably asking Defendant to be prepared to re-supply Nuzzolilo. Defendant replied, \"Ready when you are.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 The next day, Nuzzolilo called Defendant to discuss an \"issue\" regarding \"Thommy Walker,\" a \"kid that works with me ... up in Maine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Nuzzolilo was apparently referring to Thomas Walker, who had been arrested on April 27, 2017 after leaving the Grafton Apartment and stopped with approximately 1.9 ounces of cocaine in his car. Apt. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 15-18. During an intercepted call before this stop, Nuzzolilo agreed to provide two ounces of cocaine (\"two onions\") to Walker and directed Kristin Little to distribute the cocaine to Walker.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. On May 1, 2017, when Nuzzolilo called Defendant, he explained that he had given Walker \"two onions\" and was unable to collect $4,000 that he expected to receive from Walker due to Walker's arrest. Flynn Aff. \u00b6 20. Defendant replied, \"I need some paperwork from you so what are we gonna do\", and Nuzzolilo replied that Walker's arrest was \"Fucking up my timetable.\" Nuzzolilo further stated, \"I got plenty: I got 50 racks I been sitting on, I just gotta go burn them off. Fire. I'm all out of the whi-I got\n   plenty of one but nothing of the other. That's my issue.\" According to the Government, Nuzzolilo was indicating that he had $50,000 worth of heroin (\"50 racks\" of \"fire\") that he could sell to generate money to pay Defendant, but he was seeking to acquire additional cocaine (\"the whi\" and \"the other\"). Defendant responded, \"it's been so long that my people been up my ass. I'm actually even giving them some of my own paperwork and you know I got bills due today.\" Apparently, Defendant's suppliers were applying pressure and he had been using his own money (\"paperwork\") to cover Nuzzolilo's debts. Defendant further directed Nuzzolilo to \"give me what you can for today and then we'll see what we can do. I'll see if I can make something happen for you but at this point, it may or may not happen.\" Defendant was presumably telling Nuzzolilo to pay him today and that Defendant would attempt to secure additional cocaine for Nuzzolilo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Later the same day, Nuzzolilo informed Defendant that he had $6,000 (\"6 racks\") and was in the process of collecting more to be paid to Defendant that night.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Around the same time, Nuzzolili was telling certain customers that he had run out of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. For instance, Nuzzolilo replied to one apparent customer, \"I'm only with Carlos at the moment. I will not see the lady until later.\" Presumably, Nuzzolilo was indicating that he only had heroin (\"Carlos\") and would not have cocaine until later that day (\"I will not see the lady until later\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 n.8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Later on May 1, 2017, GPS data showed that Nuzzolilo traveled to almost the exact location of Defendant's home. After leaving Defendant's home, Nuzzolilo traveled to his studio at 75 Webster St. in Worcester, Massachusetts (the \"Band Room\"). That evening, Nuzzolilo indicated that he now had a supply of cocaine at the Band Room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Also on May 1, 2017, as well as the following day, Nuzzolilo complained to Defendant about the quality of the cocaine that he obtained from Defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Accordingly, Nuzzolilo and Defendant discussed the return of the product and Defendant agreed to supply Nuzzolilo with new product. Defendant ensured that his source would \"prepare right in front of me and show me there's nothing wrong with it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 On May 4, 2017, GPS data indicated that Nuzzolilo again traveled within 1,000 feet of Defendant's home in Leicester, Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 After this trip, Nuzzolilo sent a text to Kristin Little that referenced Defendant's nickname (\"Big Boy\") and informed her that he was \"all set nice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Finally, during this time, Defendant made cash deposits into a bank account. For instance, on April 4, 2017, Defendant made a $1,000 cash deposit. On April 6, he made a $2,900 cash deposit. On April 12, 2017, he made a $2,760 cash deposit. On April 21, 2017, he made a $1,450 cash deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 23, 2017, Magistrate Judge Hennessy signed search warrants authorizing the search of Defendant's residence and his person. The warrants were based on applications that attested there was probable cause to believe that Nuzzolilo and others violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by\n   conspiring to distribute controlled substances and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) by distributing controlled substances, and to believe that evidence and other material items would be found at Defendant's residence and on his person.

Aff. \u00b6 22(a). On April 27, 2017, Nuzzolilo told Kristin Little to give Tommy Walker two onions. Shortly thereafter, Walker was found with 1.9 ounces of cocaine. Apt. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 16-18. Thus, when Nuzzolilo called Defendant on May 1, 2017, and told him that he had given Tommy Walker \"2 onions,\" it was clear that Nuzzolilo was referencing two ounces of cocaine.
