For reasons discussed below, Defendant Progressive Northern Insurance Company's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim for Breach of Contract (Doc. 9) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   ; Defendant Progressive Northern Insurance Company's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim for Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Doc. 10) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; Plaintiff Joseph Vickers's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 12) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate Trial (Doc. 76) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 10, 2015, Plaintiff Joseph Vickers (\"Plaintiff\") was involved in an automobile accident (\"accident\") with Jordan Rahman (\"Rahman\"), in which he sustained bodily injuries. Plaintiff was not negligent in causing the accident. At the time of the accident, Rahman had a liability automobile insurance policy with limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of the accident, Plaintiff was driving a 2005 GMC Sierra (\"Sierra\") owned by Rick G. or Vicki Vickers. The Sierra was identified on the declarations page of, and insured under, Rick Vickers' business automobile insurance policy by Allmerica Financial Benefit Insurance (of the Hanover Group of Insurance Companies) to Mosquito Man, LLC (\"the Hanover Policy\") (Doc. 10, Exh. 17, pg. 179). The Hanover Policy had liability coverage on the Sierra, but no uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage (\"UM coverage\"). Rick Vickers also owned two personal vehicles, which he insured under a policy with Progressive Northern Insurance Company (\"the Progressive policy\"). Rick Vickers was the named insured of the Progressive policy, while Blake Vickers and Joseph Vickers were listed as \"Drivers and household residents.\" (Doc. 10, Exh. 17, pg. 182.) The Progressive Policy had UM coverage with limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident, and was in effect at the time of the accident. However, the Sierra was not listed on the declarations page of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Additionally, at the time of the accident, Plaintiff resided with Rick Vickers, Plaintiff's father. The Progressive Policy's UM coverage pays for damages sustained by an \"insured person,\" a category that includes resident relatives such as Plaintiff. (Doc. 9, Exh. 7, pg. 105.) However, the Progressive Policy also contains an exclusion (\"Exclusion 1(b)\"), which states that its UM coverage will not apply to bodily injury sustained by any person while using or occupying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   b. a motor vehicle that is owned by or available for regular use of\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   or a\n   <strong>\n    relative\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This exclusion does not apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (i.) to a\n   <strong>\n    covered auto\n   </strong>\n   that is insured under this Part III; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (ii.) to a\n   <strong>\n    relative\n   </strong>\n   who is insured for uninsured motorist coverage under any other motor vehicle insurance policy he or she has obtained\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early 2015, Progressive Northern Insurance Company (\"Defendant\" or \"PNIC\") implemented a process for evaluating UM coverage claims that fell within Exclusion 1(b), and developed and implemented guidelines based on the advice of Defendant's counsel, Dawn M. Goeres. These guidelines are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a.) When the person seeking UM coverage is using or occupying a motor vehicle which does not fall within the definition of a \"\n   <strong>\n    covered auto\n   </strong>\n   ,\" but is owned by or available for the regular use of a person who falls within the definition of \"\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   \" or a \"\n   <strong>\n    relative\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and that motor vehicle is covered by another policy of automobile insurance which provides both liability coverage and UM coverage, PNIC's coverage determination is that the full limit of UM coverage on the PNIC policy of insurance at issue is portable and available to the person seeking UM coverage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (b.) When the person seeking UM coverage is using or occupying a motor vehicle which does not fall within the definition of a \"\n   <strong>\n    covered auto\n   </strong>\n   ,\" but is owned by or available for the regular use of a person who falls within the definition of \"\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   \" or a \"\n   <strong>\n    relative\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and that motor vehicle is covered by another policy of automobile insurance which provides only liability coverage but does not provide UM coverage, PNIC's coverage determination is that Exclusion 1(b) applies to bar coverage, but UM coverage in an amount equal to the statutory mandatory minimum limits of liability coverage will be imputed onto the PNIC policy at issue, and that amount will be portable and available to the person seeking UM coverage; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (c.) When the person seeking UM coverage is using or occupying a motor vehicle which does not fall within the definition of a \"\n   <strong>\n    covered auto\n   </strong>\n   ,\" but is owned by or available for the regular use of a person who falls within the definition of \"\n   <strong>\n    you\n   </strong>\n   \" or a \"\n   <strong>\n    relative\n   </strong>\n   ,\" and that motor vehicle is not covered by any other policy of automobile insurance, PNIC's coverage determination is that Exclusion 1(b) applies to bar all UM coverage under the PNIC policy at issue, and no UM coverage will be portable or available to the person seeking UM coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc. 9, Exh. 9, pg. 134).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Progressive policy also contains the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    TERMS OF POLICY CONFORMED TO STATUTES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If any provision of this policy fails to conform to the statutes of the state listed on your application as\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   residence, the provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such statutes.

Any disputes as to the coverages provided or the provisions of this policy shall be governed by the law of the state listed on\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   application as\n   <strong>\n    your\n   </strong>\n   residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (Doc. 9, Exh. 7, pg. 24)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 26, 2015, Plaintiff's attorney sent a letter to Defendant, claiming UM benefits under the Progressive policy. After sending this letter, Plaintiff gave a recorded statement for Defendant on December 16, 2015 (Doc. 9, Exh. 4, pg.55), and the parties began to correspond regularly, approximately once a month. (Doc. 10, Exhs. 11-18, pgs. 148-191; Doc. 14, Exh. 11, pg. 159). During this correspondence, in addition to its initial document requests, Defendant requested any policy of insurance in force for the Sierra at the time of the accident-in this case, the Hanover policy-at least twice. (Doc. 10, Exh. 13, pg. 157.) On February 29, 2016, Defendant issued a conditional denial of coverage, as its investigation found no policy of insurance in effect on the Sierra at the time of the accident. (Doc. 10, Exh. 14, pg. 169.) Subsequently, on April 4, 2016, Plaintiff's counsel emailed Defendant the Hanover policy. (Doc. 10, Exh. 13, pg. 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, on May 5, 2016, Defendant sent Plaintiff's counsel a letter indicating that, pursuant to Exclusion 1(b), no coverage existed under the Progressive Policy, but that it had made the business decision to afford $25,000 of UM coverage to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When it informed Plaintiff of this decision, Defendant stated that \"the decision to afford this amount of coverage is not in any way an admission that coverage exists under the Policy.\" (Doc. 11, Exh. D, pg. 58.) Plaintiff accepted this offer on May 17, 2016 (Doc. 14, Exh. 11, pg. 160), and Defendant tendered $25,000 on July 1, 2016 (Doc. 9, Exh. 14, pg. 159). Defendant also confirmed that accepting the $25,000 would not waive Plaintiff's right to pursue any claims he believed he had against Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff filed suit against Rahman and Progressive Direct Insurance Company on March 7, 2017. On May 11, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Amended Petition against Rahman and Defendant, who issued the Progressive Policy. After Plaintiff settled his claims against Rahman, Defendant removed this case to this Court on January 22, 2018. (Doc. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim for Breach of Contract (Doc. 9)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant argues that it appropriately denied UM coverage pursuant to Exclusion 1(b), and that Exclusion 1(b) does not violate Oklahoma public policy. Plaintiff, by contrast, argues both that Exclusion 1(b) does not apply to the accident, as the Sierra was not available for Plaintiff's regular use and that Exclusion 1(b) violates Oklahoma public policy, and is therefore void. Accordingly, the Court must first determine whether Exclusion 1(b) violates Oklahoma public policy, and then, if it does not, determine whether it applies to the accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Exclusion 1(b) is either void, or does not apply to the accident, then the terms of the Progressive policy apply to the accident. In that case, Plaintiff may introduce evidence that he is entitled to coverage under the Progressive policy, and Defendant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court first addresses whether Exclusion 1(b) violates Oklahoma public policy. Because this case is before the Court pursuant to the Court's diversity jurisdiction, Plaintiff's claims are governed by Oklahoma law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    May v.

STAT. tit. 36 sec. 3636(A) and (B) (\" \u00a7 3636\"). Section 3636 does not distinguish between uninsured and underinsured vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burch v. Allstate Ins.

The plaintiff was also a resident insured under his mother's automobile insurance policy. Because he was separately covered, his mother's insurance company could not exclude UM coverage from the plaintiff as a resident insured simply because the specific vehicle he was driving was not insured under a policy that included UM coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991009\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/661/\">\n    240 P.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant correctly notes that\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   is factually distinguishable from the instant case, as the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   was the owner of the two personal vehicles for which he purchased both liability and UM coverage, and because it was undisputed that the plaintiff was covered for UM coverage under his personal policy. However, Defendant appears to rely on the holding in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , adopted in\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , in which the Court of Civil Appeals of Oklahoma upheld\n   a policy exclusion to UM coverage that is similar to Exclusion 1(b), to argue that Exclusion 1(b) cannot violate Oklahoma public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Defendant is correct that the policy exclusion upheld in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   is very close to Exclusion 1(b), Defendant is incorrect that this Court can merely import these holdings onto the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   addressed an insurance company's ability to exclude from coverage resident insureds who own their own vehicles and have purchased their own, separate, insurance policies to cover those vehicles. Oklahoma courts have long permitted insurance companies to exclude resident insureds from UM coverage when those insureds owned their own vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995183\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/717/\">\n    221 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   730 ;\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10416362\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/678/250/\">\n    678 P.2d at 252-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These decisions turn not on the resident insured's status as a resident insured, but rather on the resident insured's opportunity to purchase his or her own UM coverage. Because a resident insured who owns his or her own vehicle has the opportunity to purchase UM coverage for that vehicle, a policy exclusion does not run afoul of \u00a7 3636 if it excludes a resident insured from UM coverage while that resident insured is driving his or her own separately insured vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995183\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/717/\">\n    221 P.3d at 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] review of our extant UM jurisprudence reveals ... a willingness to uphold UM exclusions which by their express terms are limited to individuals who own a vehicle and who have thus had the opportunity to purchase their own UM coverage.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Accordingly, the facts in this case are distinguishable from those in\n   <em>\n    Conner.\n   </em>\n   While both the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and the Plaintiff in this case are resident insureds, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   owned and insured the vehicle in which he got into an accident with an allegedly underinsured motorist. When the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   insured that vehicle, he was offered, and declined, the opportunity to insure that vehicle for UM coverage. Unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , in the present case, Plaintiff did not own the Sierra. In fact, Plaintiff did not own any vehicle. Accordingly, Plaintiff did not have the opportunity to purchase his own UM coverage. Instead, he relied on his status as a resident insured under the Progressive policy when he drove automobiles that were owned and insured by his father, the named insured on both the Progressive policy and the Hanover policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Though Exclusion 1(b) may be acceptable in other factual contexts, including those described in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , in the context of this case, Exclusion 1(b) purports to exclude resident insureds who do not own their own vehicle from UM coverage whenever they are driving vehicles available for their regular use that are not insured under the Progressive policy. This policy exclusion violates the line of cases holding that UM coverage follows the person, not the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991009\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/661/\">\n    240 P.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff did not have, and then decline, the opportunity to purchase UM coverage on this vehicle. In this case, Plaintiff was simply a resident relative, insured under the Progressive policy, who had no other opportunity to purchase UM coverage and was entitled to rely on past Oklahoma holdings that UM coverage follows the person, not the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the same reasoning that justified the policy exclusion in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   now requires the conclusion that Exclusion 1(b) is void against Plaintiff under this particular set of facts: without an opportunity to purchase his own UM coverage of the vehicle that was involved in an accident with an underinsured motorist, excluding Plaintiff from coverage as a resident insured under the Progressive policy runs counter to \u00a7 3636's description of UM coverage as being coverage \"for the protection\n   of persons insured thereunder.\" OKLA. STAT. tit. 36 sec. 3636(B). Moreover, Defendant's argument that only the statutory minimum UM coverage is required is unavailing, as Defendant relies on a line of cases that address an insurer's obligation when they failed to offer UM coverage, not cases where an exclusion to UM coverage is found void.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boerstler v.

Accordingly, Exclusion 1(b) is void as applied against Plaintiff in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, Defendant appears to argue that when Plaintiff's father purchased the Progressive policy, he purchased a policy that contained Exclusion 1(b), and allowing Plaintiff to recover under the Progressive policy's UM coverage would allow Plaintiff to receive coverage which his father had not purchased. Additionally, Defendant argues that insurance policies are contracts that may contain bargained-for exclusions. (Doc. 13 at pg. 14, incorporated by reference into Doc. 14 at pg. 8.) However, while insurance contracts are generally subject to freedom of contract principles, they are also construed in accordance with statutes. If a policy exclusion conflicts with the public policy of Oklahoma, that policy exclusion will be void against public policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995183\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/221/717/\">\n    221 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   730 ;\n   <em>\n    London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9371337\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/63/552/\">\n    63 P.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Exclusion 1(b) does conflict with a statute-Oklahoma courts have held for years that UM coverage follows the person, not the vehicle. Despite that, Exclusion 1(b) appears to limit UM coverage to specific vehicles for resident insureds who do not own their own vehicles. Accordingly, Exclusion 1(b) is void as applied against Plaintiff for violating Oklahoma public policy, and summary judgment is not appropriate. Because Exclusion 1(b) is void as applied against Plaintiff, the Court does not reach whether Exclusion 1(b) applies to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, because Exclusion 1(b) is void against Plaintiff, should Plaintiff prove the necessary preconditions of loss under the Progressive policy's UM coverage, Plaintiff will be entitled to recover the full extent of his damages, up to the policy limit. The Progressive policy states \"if any provision of this policy fails to conform to the statutes of\" Oklahoma, \"the provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such statutes. All other provisions shall be given full force and effect.\" (\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   , I.) Further, Oklahoma law also requires that Exclusion 1(b) be \"construed and applied in accordance with such conditions and provisions as would have applied had such policy ... been in full compliance with [the Oklahoma Insurance Code].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OKLA.

As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , IV, \u00a7 3636(E) has been interpreted twice by Oklahoma courts, in the two cases relied upon by the parties,\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris.\n   </em>\n   However, both\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   address fact patterns where the resident insureds also owned the vehicle that they were driving when they were in an accident with an uninsured or underinsured motorist. Both of those plaintiffs had therefore insured the vehicle they were driving for liability coverage, and had been offered the opportunity to purchase UM coverage, which they both rejected. Accordingly, though both cases interpret \u00a7 3636(E), neither case required the outcome reached by those courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, though this Court has ultimately determined that both\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   support the finding that Exclusion 1(b) violates public policy as applied to Plaintiff in this case, Defendant presented a reasonable argument supporting its claim that, under\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3636(E) does not require UM coverage in this case. Defendant argued that Exclusion 1(b) did not violate Oklahoma public policy under \u00a7 3636(E), interpreted by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , and the Court of Civil Appeals of Oklahoma's holding in\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , upholding an exclusion similar to Exclusion 1(b). Though the Court ultimately held to the contrary under the facts of this case, the Court cannot find that Defendant's reliance on this argument to deny coverage, or to sell a policy containing Exclusion 1(b) is conduct that rises above simple negligence, or that Defendant's conduct may be reasonably perceived as tortious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, though Defendant may not rely on patent legal mistakes made by an attorney, Defendant may rely on reasonable advice of counsel in denying coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes v.

In this case, Defendant behaved in accordance with the guidelines for the application\n   of Exclusion 1(b) that it developed based on the advice of its counsel when it offered Plaintiff $25,000, the statutory mandatory minimum of UM coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OKLA. STAT. tit. 38 sec 3636; OKLA STAT. tit. 47 sec 7-204 ; OKLA STAT. tit. 47 sec 7-324. The guidelines which Defendant used to determine coverage in the instant case demonstrate a reasonable and accurate understanding of\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   , and its construction of \u00a7 3636(E) to apply not to all \"motor vehicle insurance polic[ies],\" but rather to UM coverage. Further, the guidelines demonstrate a reliance on and reasonable understanding of\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   , which upheld an exclusion similar to Exclusion 1(b) under similar, but not identical, circumstances, and which was apparently adopted by\n   <em>\n    Morris.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 10, Exh. 10.) Though the Court has ultimately determined, after detailed analysis, that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   does not require the same outcome in the instant case, it cannot be said that Defendant's contention that\n   <em>\n    Conner\n   </em>\n   is binding is unreasonable or based on a patent legal mistake. Accordingly, Defendant's argument, in the absence of conclusive, precedential legal authority requiring coverage, was reasonable. Construing the facts most favorably for Plaintiff, Defendant's conduct may not reasonably be perceived as tortious, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant acted in bad faith by \"misrepresenting available coverage to an insured, fraudulently concealing available policy provisions, [and] failing to assist an insured process a claim for benefits.\" (Doc. 2-9 \u00b6 28.)

The knowledge and belief of the insurer during the time period the claim is being reviewed is the focus of a bad-faith claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Badillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8906582\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/121/1080/\">\n    121 P.3d at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Buzzard v.

After Defendant first received notice of Plaintiff's claim, Plaintiff's counsel and Defendant exchanged productive, professional letters approximately once a month. (Doc. 10, Exhs. 11-18, pgs. 148-191; Doc. 14, Exh. 11, pg. 159). Indeed, it appears that, except for Defendant's initial request for documents, virtually Defendant's only request for evidence was the repeated request for any policy of insurance in force for the Sierra at the time of the accident-the Hanover policy. (Doc. 10, Exh. 12-13, pg. 152-163.) Plaintiff did not produce the Hanover policy, however, until April 4, 2016, approximately one month after Defendant conditionally denied coverage because its investigation found no insurance policy in effect on the Sierra at the time of the accident. (Doc. 10, Exh. 14 and 15, pgs. 169-174.) Defendant also informed Plaintiff that it denied that coverage existed under the Progressive policy, but had made the business decision to afford $25,000 of UM coverage on May 5, 2016, only a month after Plaintiff produced the Hanover policy. Plaintiff accepted this offer on May 17, 2016, and Defendant tendered the $25,000 on July 1, 2016, approximately six weeks later. Moreover, there are no undisputed facts or documentary evidence that suggest that Defendant's investigation was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff has failed to meet the burden placed on him after Defendant made its prima facie case, to put forward specific, admissible facts which could support a claim of bad faith. In this case, Plaintiff has not pled any specific facts indicating that Defendant's investigation was not reasonable. Moreover, all documentary evidence indicates that the pace and scope of Defendant's investigation was reasonable. Because it was reasonable, Defendant's investigation cannot support a claim of breach of the duty of good faith and bad dealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims that Defendant breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing \"by compelling their insured to employ legal counsel in order to obtain benefits.\" However, it is not bad faith for an insurer to seek a judicial resolution to a legitimate dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. Oklahoma Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11176541\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/11/162/#p174\">\n    2000 OK 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11176541\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/11/162/#p174\">\n    11 P.3d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (Okla. 2000). Accordingly, the simple fact that Plaintiff was required to employ counsel in this case does not demonstrate bad faith. In this case, the parties had a reasonable dispute about whether Exclusion 1(b) violated public policy, and as such, whether Plaintiff was entitled to coverage under the Progressive policy. Accordingly, Plaintiff's decision to initiate this lawsuit does not demonstrate that Defendant acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate Trial (Doc. 76)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant has requested that the Court bifurcate this trial into two stages, and limit consideration of the amount of punitive damages to be awarded, if any, to the second stage. However, the Court has\n   granted Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's claim of breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Because the minimum level of culpability necessary for a bad faith claim is less than the reckless conduct necessary to justify punitive damages, in granting Defendant's motion, the Court has determined Defendant's culpability to be less than the level of culpability necessary to justify punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Badillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8906582\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/121/1080/\">\n    121 P.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, punitive damages are not available in this case, and Defendant's Motion to Bifurcate is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Plaintiff has presented evidence of only $7,494.72 in damages. (Doc. 2-19.) Defendant, in its response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, presented evidence of $24,965.12 in damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of these exceed Rahman's liability limit of $25,000. Accordingly, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Rahman was underinsured. Similarly, Plaintiff has provided no evidence and no undisputed facts indicating that Rahman was at fault. Because there is a genuine dispute of material facts as to whether Plaintiff's UM coverage claim is valid, summary judgment for Plaintiff is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.

Accordingly, summary judgment for either party as to breach of contract is inappropriate. However, the Court finds no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Progressive has breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing.

(Doc. 13 pg.8, incorporated by reference into Doc. 14 pg. 7.) Because the Court finds,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    IV., that Exclusion 1(b) is void as applied against Plaintiff, it does not address this issue of contract construction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff styled this claim as a claim for \"Bad Faith and Unfair Dealings.\" (Doc. 2-9 at pg. 5.)
