Br. at 16-25. Defendant argues that Commerce's determination is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence because Deacero withheld information, submitted untimely responses to Commerce and, as a result, significantly impeded Commerce's review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Mot. J. Agency R. at 13-26, Apr. 13, 2018, ECF No. 32 (\"Def.'s Resp. Br.\"). For the following reasons, Commerce's decision is in accordance with law and is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under certain circumstances, Commerce may use facts otherwise available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a). Commerce shall use facts otherwise available to reach its final determination when \"necessary information is not available on the record,\" a party \"withholds information that has been requested by [Commerce],\" fails to provide the information timely or in the manner requested, \"significantly impedes a proceeding,\" or provides information Commerce is unable to verify. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(1)-(2). However, prior to resorting to facts otherwise available, Commerce must explain why the information it has is insufficient and provide, where practicable, the non-complying party with an opportunity to comply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d). If a party is provided with an opportunity to comply and does so, Commerce may nevertheless \"disregard all or part of the original and subsequent responses\" if it determines that the information provided is not satisfactory or untimely, subject to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e), Commerce \"shall not decline to consider\" information that is \"necessary to the determination but does not meet all the applicable requirements,\" if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (1) the information is submitted by the deadline established for its submission,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2) the information can be verified,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (3) the information is not so incomplete that it cannot serve as a reliable basis for reaching the applicable determination,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (4) the interested party has demonstrated that it acted to the best of its ability in providing the information and meeting the requirements established by [Commerce] with respect to the information, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (5) the information can be used without undue difficulties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e).

Commerce contends that as a result of Deacero's revisions, the costs associated with production of a billet control-number (\"CONNUM\") that accounts for a large portion of Deacero's sales to the United States decreased and, for the first time, revealed that Deacero's initial submission reported costs on a \"planned production\" basis, despite Commerce's directive to provide all costs on an actual costs basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [Initial ADD] Questionnaire at D-2, PD 5, bar code 3422658-02 (Dec. 4, 2015). In effect, Commerce contends that Deacero's revisions resulted in \"an entirely new section D dataset[.]\" Final Decision Memo at 6. Given that Deacero was always in control of its cost of production information, Commerce determined that it impeded Commerce's review by withholding information responsive to Commerce's requests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Further, Commerce contends that it provided Deacero with an opportunity to explain the revisions made, as required by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d), but that Deacero's response was \"not satisfactory\" because it invoked an allocation methodology not mentioned in Deacero's initial or supplemental questionnaire responses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce explains that it disregarded all of Deacero's information pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e) because Deacero's explanations were incomplete and unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce reasonably determined that Deacero's responses impeded the review process and that its revised section D dataset should be disregarded as unreliable. In providing the revised section D dataset, Deacero did not fully explain why the revisions were necessary, what record evidence substantiated the changes it made to the billet grades and the associated reallocation of costs, and/or what effect, if any, the changes had on the actual costs reported by Deacero.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Deacero only generally explained that it \"corrected the assignment of steel scrap costs to each grade of billet produced during the POR[,]\" and attached the revised section D dataset for costs of production and a revised factor calculation worksheet to its response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deacero's First Suppl. Resp. at 31, Exs. Supp. D-6-7.

Specifically, Commerce explains that the documents Deacero used to reconcile the initial and revised datasets make no reference to planned or actual production of billets and do not indicate how Deacero's accounting system tracks reallocation of costs based on reclassification of billets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 7. Further, Deacero did not identify where it had previously explained to Commerce that if a produced billet does not meet the grade specifications for which it was intended, costs may be reallocated. Deacero also did not explain how the initial section D dataset was constructed and what record evidence supports the allocation of costs in it, or identify what record evidence supports the cost reallocations in the revised section D dataset. Commerce has the discretion to accept, reject, or disregard corrective information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Timken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931950\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/1345/#p1353\">\n    434 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1353 ; 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d).

In its response, Deacero only stated that the costs reported in the initial section D dataset had to be corrected because they were based on planned, and not actual, production of billets.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Deacero's Post-Prelim. Resp. at 3-4. Deacero did not produce or cite to any supporting record evidence that would demonstrate how the planned costs were recorded and how those costs were reallocated after billets' grades were reclassified in the revised section D dataset.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Plaintiffs challenge Commerce's determination that Deacero's responses were untimely as a basis for applying total facts otherwise available.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

Here, Commerce did not reject Deacero's information, but instead disregarded the submission as unreliable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Final Decision Memo at 8. Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d), Commerce can disregard information submitted by a party, in response to a request from Commerce to explain or remedy an identified deficiency, if the information does not meet the requirements set out in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e). The data submitted to clarify or remedy has to be reliable, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e)(3), and here, for the reasons provided above, Commerce reasonably determined that Deacero's was not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In the final determination, Commerce also discusses the untimeliness of Deacero's responses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Final Decision Memo at 7-8. However, it is reasonably discernable that Commerce's ultimate basis for applying total facts otherwise available was its determination that Deacero impeded the review process by withholding information necessary to verify the reliability of the revised section D dataset.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.302\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The issue, therefore, is not Deacero's timeliness, but the adequacy of Deacero's explanation and evidence for the revisions made. Deacero made the error and it was its burden to explain the reallocation methodology and substantiate the costs associated with billet reclassification. Instead, Deacero merely asserted that the initial section D dataset did not account for billet reclassification following quality control and, as a result, the billet costs needed to be reallocated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Deacero's Post-Prelim. Resp. at 2-4. Deacero does not explain or support with record evidence how or where Deacero recorded such changes.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The parties also disagree whether, as a result of the reallocation, the total costs reported by Deacero changed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.'

Whether the total actual costs changed, however, is not dispositive as to whether Commerce's determination is supported by substantial evidence.

Br. at 19-20. Even if Plaintiffs are correct and Deacero did disclose its methodology and merely made a reporting error in its original section D dataset, Deacero failed to fully explain and reconcile the revisions made. Deacero made the error, and to ensure that Commerce was aware of and understood the revisions made, Deacero should have been more forthcoming in providing supporting evidence and explanations that would not lead to further confusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
