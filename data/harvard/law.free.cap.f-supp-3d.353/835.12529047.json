Three family members died as a result of the accident. One of those family members was a minor, who the Court will call P.B. The Trustee for P.B.'s Estate, Defendant Phillip Merrill (\"Merrill\"), contends that Plaintiff State Farm Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") owes the Estate $100,000 in Underinsured Motorist Insurance (\"UIM\"). State Farm disagrees. Accordingly, State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration from this Court that Merrill's UIM claim is barred by Minnesota's No-Fault Act. Merrill answered and filed counterclaims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment. State Farm now moves for judgment on the pleadings. It also moves to dismiss Merrill's breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After carefully reviewing the record and applicable case law, the Court grants State Farm's motions in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In describing the background of this case, the Court assumes as true the factual allegations in the complaint (and counterclaim) and construes all reasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Gas Transmission Ltd. P'ship v. Essar Steel Minnesota, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843161\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/871/843/#p851\">\n    871 F.Supp.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (D. Minn. 2012) (noting that the same standard applies to motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) and motions for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) ). Further, while the Court may consider \"materials that are necessarily embraced by the pleadings\" in describing the facts of a case in this procedural posture, such as exhibits to a complaint, it \"generally must ignore materials outside the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843161\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/871/843/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, for instance, though the Court does consider the exhibits attached to the complaint and counterclaim, it does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   consider the affidavit submitted by Merrill's counsel alongside his brief in opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorog v.

The Parties and Their Insurance Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although this insurance dispute technically revolves around only two parties - the deceased minor P.B. (through his trustee Merrill) and State Farm - the Court also discusses P.B.'s mother (Dylan Bailey), P.B.'s grandmother (Dawn Chiodo), and the driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident (Patrick Hayes). These three persons, and their respective automobile insurance policies, are central to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dylan Bailey was the mother and sole legal guardian of P.B. (Answer &amp; Countercl. [Doc. No. 29] \u00b6 30-31.) Ms. Bailey was the \"only named insured\" under a State Farm auto policy covering her 2010 Toyota Prius, which was not involved in the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Although P.B. was insured as a \"resident relative\" under this policy, P.B. was not named anywhere on the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-50.) This policy carried UIM limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. (Compl. [Doc. No. 1], Ex. 1 [Doc. No. 1-1] (\"Bailey Policy\") at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dawn Chiodo was Dylan Bailey's mother and P.B.'s grandmother. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6 32.) Ms. Chiodo and Ms. Bailey co-leased a residence in Bloomington, Minnesota, where P.B. also resided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 33-34; Compl. \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl. Ex. A (Bailey &amp; Chiodo Lease) at 1).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Chiodo owned and operated a 1998 Jeep Cherokee at the time of the accident. (Compl. \u00b6 19.) Further, Ms. Chiodo was a named insured on a policy issued by Geico Insurance Company covering the Jeep (\"Chiodo Policy\"). The Chiodo Policy provided less generous coverage than her daughter's policy, with UIM limits of only $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Patrick Hayes was the owner and operator of the other vehicle involved in the collision. At the time of the accident, Mr. Hayes was insured under an automobile liability policy through State Farm with bodily injury limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident (\"Hayes Policy\"). (Compl. \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The salient facts of this case are generally undisputed. On December 2, 2016, Patrick Hayes drove his Chevrolet Malibu eastbound in the westbound lanes of Interstate 494 near Bloomington, Minnesota - \"the wrong way and against traffic.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Dawn Chiodo, carrying a car full of friends and family, approached and then merged her Jeep Cherokee onto westbound I-494. As she did so, Mr. Hayes struck her vehicle \"head-on.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Tragically, Ms. Chiodo, Ms. Bailey, and P.B. died as a result of the collision. Jennifer and Olivia Nord, the two other passengers in Ms. Chiodo's Jeep, suffered serious injuries (collectively, \"Claimants\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the accident, State Farm notified Claimants that it would tender the\n   Hayes Policy liability limit of $300,000 in exchange for the release of Mr. Hayes from all wrongful death and personal injury claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) By a\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   notice dated August 8, 2017, attorneys representing the trustees for the estates of Ms. Bailey and P.B. notified State Farm of an internal agreement amongst the Claimants regarding the allocation of the $300,000 Hayes Policy limit, as well as the $100,000 Chiodo Policy UIM limit. (Compl., Ex. 2 [Doc. No. 1-2] at 2, 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Merrill gave notice of his intent to seek $100,000 in excess UIM coverage from State Farm under the Bailey Policy. (Compl., Ex. 2 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the agreed-upon internal settlement, which the parties attached to the\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   notice, available funds would be distributed among the Claimants as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-22\">Claimants State Farm Geico Chiodo Excess UIM Claimants' (<em>decedents</em> Hayes Policy Policy (Primary Coverage Expected <em>italicized</em>) UIM) Coverage <em>Dawn Chiodo</em> $87,500.00 $50,000.00 $0.00 $137,500.00 <em>P.B.</em> $37,500.00 $0.00 $100,000.00 $137,500.00 (Bailey State Farm Policy) <em>Dylan Bailey</em> $37,500.00 $0.00 $100,000.00 $137,500.00 (Bailey State Farm Policy) Jennifer Nord $37,500.00 $0.00 $100,000.00 $137,500.00 (personal policy) Olivia Nord $100,000.00 $50,000.00 $50,000.00 $200,000.00 (personal policy)</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Answer &amp; Countercl., Ex. C [Doc. No. 29-1] (\"Claim Settlement\") at 31.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this agreement, Olivia Nord and the estate of Dawn Chiodo would each recover $50,000 from Chiodo's Policy. The estates of P.B. and Dylan Bailey would each receive $100,000 in excess UIM coverage as insureds under the Bailey Policy. Finally, Jennifer and Olivia Nord would each recover excess UIM under personal policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By letter dated August 21, 2017, \"State Farm, on behalf of Mr. Hayes, agreed to [the] Claimants' [ ] agreed-upon allocation of the [Hayes] Policy in exchange for a release of Mr. Hayes.\" (Compl. \u00b6 30; Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6 16 (admitting this allegation).) On August 25, 2017, Merrill's counsel advised State Farm that he would only accept the $37,500 allocation under the Hayes Policy if State Farm tendered $100,000 under the Bailey Policy for Merrill's UIM claim. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) State Farm declined this demand, contending that Merrill was not entitled to such UIM coverage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As evident from this account, State Farm's denial of UIM coverage to Merrill under the Bailey Policy was not anticipated by the Claimants' internal settlement agreement. By letter dated December 13, 2017, counsel for Ms. Bailey's Estate joined Merrill's demand that State Farm provide UIM coverage to Merrill under the Bailey Policy, stating that \"State Farm's position is holding up the proposed global settlement.\" (Compl., Ex. 3 at 3.) In response, State Farm maintained that its denial of UIM coverage was legally proper. (Compl. \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nonetheless, following these events, State Farm and Geico distributed the Hayes Policy and Chiodo Policy funds pursuant to the Claim Settlement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-58.) Further, State Farm distributed excess UIM benefits to Ms. Bailey's Estate under the Bailey Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 23.) However, because State Farm did not believe Merrill was entitled to excess UIM coverage under the Bailey Policy, Merrill was left with only the $37,500 allocation from the Hayes Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   State Farm filed the instant declaratory action on February 14, 2018 to determine its rights, obligations, and liability under the Bailey Policy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) In its complaint, State Farm asserted diversity jurisdiction, and maintained that, according to the plain language of the Minnesota No-Fault Insurance Act, Minn. Stat. \u00a7 65B.49, subd. 3a(5), Merrill was not entitled to excess UIM coverage under the Bailey Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 27.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 17, 2018, Merrill answered and filed counterclaims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment. (Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.) On May 21, State Farm moved for judgment on the pleadings on the UIM coverage issue. (Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of its Mot. to Dismiss Countercl. &amp; for J. on the Pleadings (\"State Farm's Br.\") [Doc. No. 45].) In the same motion, State Farm moved to dismiss Merrill's\n   breach of contract and unjust enrichment counterclaims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 25, Merrill filed an opposition to State Farm's motion to dismiss, as well as its own request for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the UIM coverage issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Opp'n &amp; for J. on the Pleadings (\"Merrill's Br.\") [Doc. No. 53].) State Farm followed up with a reply brief on July 10 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   State Farm's Reply Br. [Doc. No. 54] ), and the Court entertained oral argument on July 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Further, it is not disputed that, because P.B. resided with Ms. Chiodo (his grandmother) and Ms. Bailey (his custodial parent), and because P.B. was not \"identified\n   <em>\n    by name\n   </em>\n   in any other\" auto insurance policy, P.B. was statutorily \"insured\" under the Chiodo Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, State Farm argues that Merrill's claim begins and ends with the plain language of the No-Fault Act. State Farm maintains that, where an injured occupant falls within the Act's definition of \"insured,\" their UIM coverage is \"statutorily tied to the amount of coverage specified for the occupied motor vehicle.\" (State Farm's Br. at 10.) Thus, because P.B. is an \"insured\" of the Chiodo Policy under the Act, and because that was the vehicle involved in the accident, State Farm contends that Merrill may not look beyond the Chiodo Policy for excess UIM benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the face of State Farm's straightforward statutory argument, Merrill argues that (1) P.B. is entitled to excess UIM coverage under the Bailey Policy because he was in the \"legal custody\" of Ms. Bailey, and (2) the policy goals articulated in the Minnesota Supreme Court decision\n   <em>\n    Carlson v.

That is, that P.B.'s \"insured\" status under the Bailey Policy has any bearing on whether P.B. is entitled to UIM benefits beyond those offered in the Chiodo Policy. It does not. State Farm does not dispute that P.B. is insured under the Bailey Policy as Ms. Bailey's \"minor in custody.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Farm's Reply Br. at 4-5.) Rather, State Farm notes, because \"[i]t is undisputed P.B. was [also] an insured under Chiodo's policy,\" as a resident relative not identified by name on any other insurance policy, P.B.'s UIM coverage is limited to that policy, regardless of his \"insured\" status under the Bailey Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The one case Merrill relies on in support of this first argument,\n   <em>\n    Jirik ex rel. Jirik v. Auto-Owners Ins.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Merrill's Br. at 4-5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jirik\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that P.B.'s access to his\n   mother's UIM benefits turns on custodial status).)

In particular, that the \"goal\" of the relevant provision of the No-Fault Act was \"to give owners the ability to select and purchase the amount of coverage they desire in excess of the mandatory minimum and then to access that coverage if they are injured in a vehicle owned by someone with minimum coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8236175\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/749/41/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 47 (citing\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511278\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/611/7/#p11\">\n    611 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   13 ) ). Here, Merrill argues, Ms. Bailey purchased more extensive UIM coverage \"to protect herself and her son P.B.\" from Ms. Chiodo's \"minimum coverage.\" (Merrill's Br. at 9.) Surely, Merrill contends, it would contravene legislative intent for P.B. to not have access to his mother's coverage \"in excess of the mandatory minimum,\" \"just because he happened to reside with [his] grandmother and was riding in [her] vehicle at the time of the crash.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) This is especially so because, at the age of two, P.B. \"could not have been named in any\n   policy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) If Ms. Bailey is not \"insured\" under the Chiodo Policy because she is \"named\" under the Bailey Policy, Merrill's argument implies, why doesn't her young son fall under that exception, too?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Although this argument is quite sensible at first blush, it, unfortunately, clashes with the No-Fault Act's plain text and the relevant precedent.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jirik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20N.W.2d%20219\">\n    595 N.W.2d at 222-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying a \"logical\" claim for excess UIM coverage because doing so would \"invite\" courts \"to ignore ... the language of\" the statute). In addition to the statutory text detailed above, the Minnesota Supreme Court has been clear that, under the No-Fault Act, a party is only a \"named insured\" if they are specifically named in a policy. This holds true even if a person was \"the obvious object\" of the insurance policy, like P.B. here.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11511278\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/611/7/#p11\">\n    611 N.W.2d at 12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that, even though an injured employee was \"the obvious object of her employer's policy on the truck she was driving,\" the employee was not statutorily \"insured\" under that policy because she was not \"the named insured\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West Bend\n   </em>\n   , 776 N.W.2d at 703 (denying excess UIM claim under same reasoning).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under the unique circumstances of this case, Merrill's only source for UIM coverage was the Chiodo Policy.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-25.)

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To prevail on a claim for breach of contract, a party must prove the following elements: (1) formation of a contract; (2) performance by plaintiff of conditions precedent; and (3) breach of the contract by defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lyon Fin.

Even accepting Merrill's allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, Merrill fails to state a plausible breach claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Most importantly, Merrill fails to allege facts showing that he and State Farm ever entered into a contract for $100,000 in UIM benefits. Merrill simply alleges that State Farm \"considered the terms of the [Claim] Settlement,\" attached to the aforementioned August 8, 2017 letter, \"as binding.\" (Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6 57.) State Farm, however, was plainly not a party to the Claim Settlement. The Claim Settlement is only signed by the Claimants' attorneys, and the letter accompanying the signed settlement is merely a\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   notice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer &amp; Countercl., Ex.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (Claim Settlement) (\"To the extent any ... insurer reviews this agreement, the undersigned [Claimant attorneys]\n   <em>\n    urge it to consider it\n   </em>\n   a fair and reasonable resolution of the parties' respective claims.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35 (\n   <em>\n    Schmidt\n   </em>\n   Notice) (stating that the Estate of P.B. \"will seek\" excess UIM benefits through the Bailey Policy);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3843161\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/871/843/#p851\">\n    871 F.Supp.2d at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that courts may consider \"exhibits attached to the complaint\" when evaluating a motion to dismiss).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, even if this letter did somehow constitute an offer on the issue of excess UIM benefits under the Bailey Policy, Merrill never alleges facts suggesting that State Farm accepted that offer. Rather, the facts alleged demonstrate that State Farm repeatedly declined to make any promises about excess UIM benefits under the Bailey Policy, even as it agreed to the Claimants' allocation with respect to the\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   Policy. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 64-67 (only alleging that, on August 8, \"State Farm employees informed Merrill's attorney they were\n   <em>\n    unable to discuss\n   </em>\n   the [UIM] until the liability claims against Mr. Hayes were settled\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at n.5.)

This is so, Merrill argues, because State Farm allegedly \"failed to raise any issue regarding lack of [UIM] coverage for more than three months after State Farm received notice of the potential settlement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)

This would have better informed the Claimants' internal settlement discussions. However, failure to exhibit best business practices does not amount to unjust enrichment. Simply put, Merrill cannot state a claim for unjust enrichment because he does not allege that State Farm retained the $100,000 in UIM benefits \"in a manner that is illegal or unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Caldas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7073248\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/820/826/#p838\">\n    820 N.W.2d at 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The bold lettering indicates the disputed UIM coverage at issue in this motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The exact time and manner of State Farm's denial of UIM coverage to Merrill under the Bailey Policy is a point of contention between the parties. (\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 32 (not stating when this denial occurred)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6\u00b6 67-69 (stating that this denial first occurred on November 14, 2017, following numerous \"unreturned voice mails\").) The affidavit submitted by Merrill's counsel in opposition to State Farm's motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the Court may not consider in ruling on this motion, provides further detail on this point. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Affidavit of Jonathan J. Fischer (\"Fischer Affidavit\") [Doc. No. 53-1].)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    However, this factual dispute does not bear on the threshold legal question of whether Merrill is even entitled to UIM benefits under the Bailey policy. To the extent this factual dispute bears on the equities of State Farm's conduct, the Court notes that Merrill never alleges that, in agreeing to the Claimants' proposed allocation of the\n    <em>\n     Hayes Policy\n    </em>\n    in return for a liability release, State Farm ever affirmatively promised or suggested that it would pay P.B.'s UIM claim from the\n    <em>\n     Bailey Policy\n    </em>\n    as part of that release. To the contrary, Merrill's affidavit shows that State Farm, while perhaps dilatory in its responses, repeatedly declined to make any promises about excess UIM benefits. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fischer Affidavit \u00b6\u00b6 4-15.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    State Farm also paid Merrill $20,000 in \"no-fault\" benefits under the Bailey Policy, for hospital treatment P.B. received after the crash. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Answer &amp; Countercl. \u00b6 52, Ex. B.) Although Merrill implies that this payment has some bearing on the excess UIM question before the Court, it does not. UIM coverage and no-fault coverage are separate and distinct coverages with different statutory schemes.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Minn.
