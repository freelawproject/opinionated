(DE 1; DE 144 at 6). Today, the Court considers the defendants' motions for summary judgment and motion to dismiss, for which K.D. has submitted one consolidated response. (DE 143; DE 163; DE 164; DE 165; DE 167). The Court also considers K.D.'s motion to sanction Defendant Mark Gannon. (DE 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   While there is no doubt that the plaintiff suffered a tragic injury, the law does not permit her to seek a remedy from the Pike County Board of Education, Reed Adkins, or Mark Gannon. Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, the Pike County Board of Education's, Reed Adkins', and Mark Gannon's motions for summary judgment are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . (DE 164; DE 163; DE 143). Jerry Swafford's motion to dismiss/for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . (DE 165). And K.D.'s motion for sanctions is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . (DE 148).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Swafford was employed by the Pike County Board of Education as a janitor at Belfry High School, where K.D. was a student. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 167 at 1). On Saturday, October 15, 2016, Swafford threw himself a birthday party at his residence, to which Belfry High School students were invited. (DE 163-1 at 2). At the party, Swafford served K.D. an alcoholic beverage, and she passed out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Swafford then sexually assaulted K.D. in a bedroom. As a result, Swafford pleaded guilty to criminal sexual assault charges and is now serving a prison sentence in West Virginia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 144 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cindy Andersen, a Belfry High School parent, attempted to stop Swafford's party before it began. Andersen became aware of the party plans on Friday, October 14, 2016, by reading text messages on her daughters' phones and through information shared by two male classmates\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   of her daughters'.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Concerned about Swafford's behavior, Andersen telephoned the Pike County School Board, Belfry High School, and a policeman.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Andersen first spoke with Principal Gannon of Belfry High School, who scheduled a meeting with Anderson for the morning of October 17, 2016, the Monday after the party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gannon did nothing, however, to prevent the party from occurring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Although Andersen never spoke with Superintendent Adkins, she did speak with Nee Jackson, a member of the Pike County Board of Education, that same Friday afternoon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Jackson counselled Andersen to meet with Gannon and to contact the police. Jackson, too, took no measures to stop the party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following night, on Saturday, October 15, 2018, Swafford sexually assaulted K.D.

Here, K.D. relies on contradictory testimony provided by Jerry Roberts, a bus driver and former janitor at Belfry High School, who alleges that he observed Swafford masturbating on school property. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 135 at 33-34). In an unsworn recording taken by Ryan Donovan, plaintiff's counsel, prior to the initiation of this litigation, Roberts claimed that he reported the masturbation incident to then-Principal Varney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 168 at 9-10). At both of his depositions, under oath, however, Roberts withdrew this claim as a lie having been\n   made when he was drunk. (DE 135 at 7, 10-12 (Roberts characterizes the statement that he reported the masturbation incident to then-Principal Varney as \"drunk man bragging\"), 36 (Roberts identifies his statement that he told former principal Varney as \"a lie, I did not [tell Varney].\"), 44 (Roberts characterizes his statement that he told former principal Varney \"a total black lie.\"); DE 168 at 11 (Q: \"Is it still your testimony under oath here today that you did not tell Rod Varney about this incident?\" A: \"It still is.\") ). Roberts claims he may have told \"several people,\" but he does not identify with any certainty the people he told. (DE 135 at 34-36). In recanting his initial, unsworn statement, Roberts-under oath-is very clear that he never reported the masturbation incident to then-principal Varney:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q: And your testimony to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, us that you didn't tell anybody in charge of the school that he had done that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A: I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q: The person ... you had caught in this compromising position, and you didn't tell on him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A: I did not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q: Why?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A: I didn't. Just didn't. Didn't have a chance, really.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (DE 135 at 46). At another point, Roberts testified:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q: You didn't tell anybody that was in charge of the school?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Former Principal Varney attests that he was not aware of any information that would indicate that Swafford might pose a risk of sexual assault to students. Specifically, Varney attests that \"[n]o one ever reported to me that Mr. Swafford was seen masturbating in his office.\" (DE 143-3; DE 170-11; DE 175-9). Principal Gannon was also deposed about this event. (DE 132 at 129). Gannon confirmed that if the incident had occurred, it would have been investigated on a District level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129-130. He is certain that former Principal Varney would have initiated the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is clear, however, that the event was never reported.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129-130. The Board documents each incident of sexual misconduct in its personnel records. (DE 164-1 at 14). There is no record of the masturbation incident in any of the 6,500 files reviewed by fifteen (15) employees over the course of 600 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   164-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As disgusting as this alleged event may be, the evidence of Record-even when viewed in a light most favorable to K.D.-is not enough to establish actual or constructive notice of a risk posed by Swafford as to the Pike County Board of Education. There is no evidence that then-Principal Varney knew about the event. (DE 143-3; DE 170-11; DE 175-9). There is no evidence that Principal Gannon knew about the event. (DE 132 at 129-130). There is also no record, other than Jerry Robert's unsworn statement, of this event ever even having occurred. (DE 135 at 33-34; DE 168 at 9-10; DE 164-1 at 14; DE 164-24).

As discussed, the facts of this case in no way demonstrate that either Adkins or Gannon knew of any unusual behavior by Swafford prior to Friday, October 14, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 132; DE 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Gannon first became aware of potentially suspicious activity by Swafford on the afternoon of Friday, October 14, 2016, when he spoke with Andersen about her concerns with regard to Swafford's hosting a party with underage high school students present. (DE 163-1 at 4-5). Gannon may have been negligent in failing to immediately contact Swafford about Andersen's allegations. Gannon did not, however, intentionally act in a clearly unreasonable manner toward a known act of sexual harassment such that his actions could be construed as deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

The undisputed evidence in this case shows that, at the time, Gannon was not aware of any\n   <em>\n    confirmed\n   </em>\n   act of\n   <em>\n    sexual harassment by Swafford.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Gannon actively planned to investigate Andersen's by organizing a meeting with her on the following Monday, October 17, 2016. (DE 163-1 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Adkins cannot be said to have acted with deliberate indifference, for all of the same reasons previously discussed. Like Gannon, the uncontested facts show that Adkins was in no way aware of a risk of sexual harassment posed by Swafford prior to K.D.'s assault. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 158). Further, Adkins took action to ensure that Swafford would be questioned about Andersen's concerns before he even knew of K.D.'s assault.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 119. Thus, Adkins' actions cannot be characterized as deliberately indifferent.\n   <em>\n    Vance v. Spencer Cnty. Pub. Sch.

(DE 163-1 at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 162 at 16). During this conversation, Andersen told Jackson of Swafford's planned party, and Jackson told Andersen\n   to contact the police and Principal Gannon, who was Swafford's direct supervisor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11176095\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/253/#p262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is not evidence of deliberate indifference by the Board to a threat of sexual assault posed by Swafford. Rather, even when viewed in a light most favorable to K.D., a Board member's recommendation that Andersen report her unsubstantiated allegations to the police cannot be characterized as deliberate indifference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11176095\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/231/253/#p262\">\n    231 F.3d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While Swafford's conduct is inexcusable, the law does not permit K.D. to recover from the Board under Title IX on these facts. As explained above, and in the analysis of her Section 1983 claim, K.D. cannot show that the Board acted with deliberate indifference toward a known risk of sexual assault.

ANALYSIS OF MOTION TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   To the extent all other defendants are dismissed from this case, Swafford has filed a motion to dismiss all claims against him due to lack of personal jurisdiction or, in the alternative,\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   (DE 165). To the extent Swafford filed his motion arguing the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over him, he is incorrect. K.D. has filed two claims against Swafford: (1) a Section 1983 claim and (2) a common law battery claim for sexual assault. (DE 1 at 6, 13). Swafford has not challenged the merits of these claims. In addition, the Court has federal question jurisdiction over the Section 1983 claim, and the Court has personal jurisdiction over Swafford due to his many contacts in the Eastern District of Kentucky. The Court also declines to transfer venue pursuant to\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   Many factors, including the location and availability of witnesses, weigh in favor of holding this matter in the Eastern District of Kentucky. As such, Swafford's motion to dismiss, (DE 165), is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted, Swafford does not allege a substantive basis to dismiss the claims against him. (DE 165). The Court, however, cannot permit the Section 1983 claim against Swafford to proceed. \"To successfully state a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a plaintiff must identify a right secured by the United States Constitution and the deprivation of that right by a person\n   <em>\n    acting under color of state law.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Russo v.

Here, it is undisputed that\n   Swafford sexually assaulted K.D. at a private party at his residence. Swafford was a Board employee, but he was not acting within that capacity or under color of law when he sexually assaulted K.D. off school property. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   DE 1).

Accordingly, K.D.'s Section 1983 claim against Swafford is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    V. ANALYSIS OF MOTION FOR SANCTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   K.D. has moved to sanction Defendant Gannon for his alleged inclusion of false affidavits in support of his motion for summary judgment. K.D. believes that these affidavits portray her counsel and support staff as having engaged in unethical behavior under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Kentucky's Supreme Court Rules. The Court has fully reviewed the filings, affidavits, and motions. The Court, however, finds that K.D. has provided inadequate reasons and proof to support sanctioning Gannon as having included false affidavits under the federal rules. As such, K.D.'s motion for sanctions, (DE 148), is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court has great sympathy for the suffering of K.D. The Court, however, is obliged to follow the law and permit recovery exclusively from and against legally culpable parties. Here, K.D. has not demonstrated factual or legal bases to hold the Pike County Board of Education, Superintendent Reed Adkins, or Principal Mark Gannon liable for the criminal acts of Jerry Swafford.
