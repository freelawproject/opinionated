She sued WMATA for unlawful retaliation and her supervisor, Judy Mewborn, for defamation. The Court dismissed Ms. Slack's retaliation claims under the False Claims Act and the District of Columbia Protection Act because sovereign immunity barred those claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slack v.

So Ms. Mewborn issued Ms. Slack a revised memorandum without reference to Ms. Slack's alleged use of confidential information. \"Unsatisfactory Performance,\" ECF No. 51-11.

Once in federal court, Ms. Slack amended her complaint to add her ARRA and NDAA claims. Ms. Slack has never argued that WMATA waived its immunity by removing this case to federal court. \"Unlike the defense of sovereign immunity, which is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time, the claim that WMATA waived its immunity is an argument that must be raised in a timely fashion.\"\n    <em>\n     Watters v.
