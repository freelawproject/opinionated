Mart\u00ednez, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of a 2017 data breach of Defendant Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.'s (\"Chipotle\") computer system and point of service terminals which resulted in the theft of customers' credit card and debit card data. Plaintiffs Bellwether Community Credit Union (\"Bellwether) and Alcoa Community Federal Credit Union (\"Alcoa\") (together, \"Plaintiffs\") are financial institutions whose members patronized Chipotle during that period and whose data were compromised, forcing Plaintiffs to cancel and replace members' credit and debit cards and refund any fraudulent payment resulting from the data breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit against Chipotle on behalf of themselves and those similarly situated alleging eleven causes of action: negligence, negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , misappropriation of trade secrets, a claim for declaratory judgment, and violation of the unfair competition laws of Arkansas, California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont. (ECF No. 44.) Before the Court is Chipotle's Motion to Dismiss (\"Motion\") all of Plaintiffs' claims. (ECF No. 57.) Also before the Court is Plaintiffs' \"Motion to Strike Exhibits A-C Attached to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss\" (\"Motion to Strike\"). (ECF No. 59.) For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike is denied, and Defendant's Motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court accepts the following facts as true for purposes of the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between March 24 and April 18, 2017, a hacker accessed Chipotle's computer system and installed malware that impacted point of service (\"POS\") terminals at more than 2,200 Chipotle restaurants in the United States (the \"Data Breach\"). (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A POS system manages cash and credit card and debit card (\"payment card\") transactions. Approximately 70% of Chipotle's sales are made by payment cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) When a payment card is used, data are passed from the card through a variety of systems and networks before reaching the retailer's payment processor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) \"Before transmitting customer data ... POS systems typical, and very briefly, store the data in plain text within the system's memory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This information can be valuable to hackers who can sell payment card data on the black market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Malware installed on the POS systems allegedly permitted the hacker to access the names, payment card numbers, card expiration dates, card verification values (\"CVVs\"), service codes, and other information (\"payment card data\") of customers who paid for their purchases at Chipotle by payment card during the breach period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Understanding Plaintiffs' claims requires understanding the mechanics of payment card transactions. To process a single transaction, payment card data flows through multiple systems and parties in four major steps.

Though not explicit in the complaint's description of a payment card transaction, payment card networks (such as Visa or MasterCard) maintain relationships with both issuing banks (such as Plaintiffs), acquiring banks (here, Chipotle's bank), and merchants (here, Chipotle).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schnuck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516602\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/803/#p808\">\n    887 F.3d at 808-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Issuing banks, acquiring banks, and merchants join payment card networks to facilitate transactions between merchants and consumers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516602\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/803/#p808\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 57-1; 57-2.) Payment card networks govern how transactions occur though a series of contracts and agreements. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 96;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 57-1 (Visa rules); 57-2 (MasterCard rules).) Credit card companies and financial institutions also issue \"rules and standards governing the basic measure that merchants must take to ensure consumers' valuable data are protected.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The payment card data, which are encoded on the magnetic strip or chip of a payment card, are the means of authenticating the cardholder and authorizing the transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) Data are at risk both pre-authorization, when the merchant has captured the data and they are being sent (or waiting to be sent) to the acquirer/processor, as well as post-authorization, when data are sent back to the merchant with authorization and are stored in merchant's environment for analytics and back-office processes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.) When payment card data are sent to the issuer during the authorization step, the issuer uses the data \"to locate the computer data on the financial institution's computer for the payment card's specific record.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.) Thus, Plaintiffs contend, when payment card data are compromised, the corresponding computer database records become susceptible to fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When payment card data are compromised, the financial institution must issue a replacement card with new payment card data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-23.) Financial institutions are required by federal law to maintain various safeguards to protect the confidentiality of payment card data and protect them against from unauthorized use or disclosure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.) Federal law also makes financial institutions financially responsible from fraudulent card activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.) Thus, financial institutions, the alleged owners of the payment card data, have multiple safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of payment card data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 117, 133.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Organizations issue rules and guidance for securing payment card data. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council promulgated the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\"PCI DSS\"), twelve requirements which requires organization to protect payment card data and maintain adequate security measures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 97-98.) PCI DSS 3.2 \"sets forth detailed and comprehensive requirements that must be followed to meet each of the 12 mandates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99.) \"Chipotle's business operations and payment systems are governed by PCI DSS.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.) Federal agencies and other organizations have also issued guidance on how to adequately secure data. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 101-07.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that they rely on merchants, including Chipotle, to \"keep that sensitive information secure from would-be data thieves in accordance with at least the PCI DSS requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Chipotle ignored known risks to data security, disregarded warnings that its POS was incompatible with antivirus software, refused to upgrade its POS system when the manufacturer stopped providing security and technical updates, lacked adequate firewall protection and segmentation, refused to implement protocols that could have prevented malware from being installed on its systems, failed to adequately track network access and unusual activity, and did not implement EMV chip-based technology for its POS systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39, 55-56, 63, 66, 76, 78, 81, 87-88, 90-92.) In addition, Plaintiffs claim that Chipotles senior management was aware of the outdated nature of the POS systems but did not implement changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40, 58, 68, 89, 93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that there are numerous measures Chipotle could have taken to prevent or limit unauthorized persons from accessing the POS systems, including end-to-end encryption of data, tokenization, and use of EMV chip-based payment cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22, 84.) Encryption \"mitigates security weaknesses that exist when [Payment Card Data] has been capture but not yet authorized.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) Tokenization protects data by replacing payment card numbers with a series of letters and numbers as a placeholder for payment card data after a transaction is authorized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 84.) EMV technology, which uses computer chips instead of the magnetic stripe to store data, uses dynamic data, meaning that each time the EMV chip is used, it creates a unique transaction code that cannot be reused. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) Thus, the switch from magnetic strips to chip technology increases payment card data security. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The payment card industry (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express) set a deadline of October 1, 2015 for business to transition their POS systems to EVM technology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) Notably, Chipotle did not comply with the deadline, claiming that the chip technology would slow down its customer lines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90, 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the breach, they have suffered a variety of damages, including monetary and property damages. They allege that they were forced to replace computer data rendered useless by the Data Breach, cancel or reissue payment cards, close accounts impacted by the Data Breach, refund cardholders for any unauthorized transactions, respond to cardholder complaints, and increase fraud monitoring efforts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Bellwether filed a complaint on May 4, 2017 in this District. Bellwether alleged that venue is proper in this District in part because \"a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action arose in this District.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 13.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 1, 2017, the undersigned granted Bellwether and Chipotle's motion to consolidate this action with\n   <em>\n    Alcoa Community Federal Credit Union v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17-cv-1283-RM-STV (D. Colo. filed May 26, 2017). (ECF No. 34.) Thereafter, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. (ECF No. 44 (redacted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42 (unredacted).) Bellwether and Alcoa both allege claims of negligence, negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , misappropriation of trade secrets, and a claim under the Declaratory Judgment Act. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 149-81, 275-79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs jointly assert their misappropriation and Declaratory Judgment Act\n   claims on behalf of a putative nationwide class of financial institutions, and their negligence claims on behalf of a putative statewide class in each of Arkansas, California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 140-41.) Bellwether asserts violations of state unfair competition laws on behalf of itself and putative state-wide classes in California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141, 195-274.) Alcoa asserts a similar putative class claim under Arkansas's unfair competition law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 182-94.) Each proposed statewide class is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   All Financial Institutions-including, but not limited to, banks and credit unions-that either (a) are located in Arkansas, California, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, ...[and] Vermont ... that issue payment cards, including credit and debit cards, or perform, facilitate, or support card-issuing services, whose customers made purchases from Chipotle stores from March 1, 2017 to the present, or (b) have customers located in Arkansas, California, Florida, Main, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, ...

Preliminary Matter of Documents Outside the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Chipotle attaches to its Motion three additional documents for the Court's consideration, namely, excerpts of Visa and MasterCard's payment card network rules. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 57-1; 57-2; 57-3.) The Court may consider these documents if they are (1) \"mentioned in the complaint,\" (2) \"central to [the] claims [at issue],\" and (3) not challenged as inauthentic.\n   <em>\n    Toone v.

(ECF No. 57 at 8-10.) However, Plaintiffs never allege the existence of any contracts directly in the complaint, and artfully plead their claims without stating the role of that payment card networks play in a payment card transaction. Plaintiffs seek to exclude these network agreement exhibits as outside the four corners of the complaint, inauthentic, and an \"incomplete representation of the scope of the contractual relationship that exists among all the relevant actors in the payment card transaction process.\" (ECF No. 59 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court will consider these exhibits. Plaintiffs' claims with regard to transactions are rooted in the payment card network contracts which govern the mechanics of payment card transactions. Plaintiffs allege the mechanics of payment card transactions without making explicit the role of the payment card networks. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 116.) The communication between customers, merchants, acquiring banks, and issuing banks alleged by Plaintiffs is facilitated by the payment card networks. Moreover, the existence of a relationship between the parties depends entirely on the use of payment cards, and thus documents which may govern that relationship are central to Plaintiffs' negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenge to the authenticity of the documents does not impact the Court's decision to consider the contracts. Chipotle explains the genesis of the documents. (ECF No. 67 at 5.) One of the attachments was produced by MasterCard in responses to plaintiffs' subpoenas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 57-3.) The other documents are or were publicly available. Moreover, Plaintiffs, as signatories to the agreements, should be able to determine whether the documents are accurate or whether they are inauthentic, and have asserted nothing that would make the Court doubt the authenticity of the agreements. The Court will consider the documents as evidence of the existence of a network of contracts that govern the payment card system, and thus denies Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Negligence (Claim One)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Chipotle contends that Plaintiffs' negligence claim is barred by the economic loss rule because Chipotle's relationship to Plaintiffs arises out of a series of contractual agreements.

As in those two cases, Plaintiffs have failed to establish that Chipotle owed a duty to them independent of the interrelated contracts. Although Plaintiffs argue that the PCI DSS establish only a minimum standard of care, and thus the duty in tort law differs from that under the contracts, Plaintiffs entered into the contract and therefore agreed to the PCI DSS security measures. Plaintiffs cite no support for the existence of specific common law or statutory duties of care related to data security.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noodles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266743\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/267/1288/#p1294\">\n    267 F.Supp.3d at 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the contracts govern the data security standards and impose duties on the parties to protect data security in a specific way. Thus, the source of any duty regarding data security arises under the contract. Because the source of the duty is contained in the contract and there is no basis in Colorado statutory or common law for imposing a duty of care related to data security, Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs creatively argue that they suffered property damage to their computer data in order to attempt to remove the dispute from the realm of the economic loss rule. (ECF No. 60 20-21.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Alma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228040\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/10/1256/#p1264\">\n    10 P.3d at 1264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While the court acknowledged that such data could\n   have value and could be lost, it concluded that \"the loss here is not a result of physical destruction of property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4237745\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/564/489/#p498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs' alleged loss to the value of electronic data did not result from any physical injury to property from the Data Breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that a number of potential factual circumstances would result in Plaintiffs' losses not being covered by the contracts. (ECF No. 60 at 8.) Plaintiffs also acknowledge that \"all the facts are not before the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notice pleading does not require a complaint to cover all possible factual scenarios. However, at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court must consider whether the facts before it state a plausible claim for relief. The Court finds that, on the facts before it, Plaintiffs have not stated a plausible negligence tort claim because the parties' relationship arises out of a network of contracts, and is thus barred by the economic loss doctrine. If there is a plausible factual basis for asserting a negligence tort claim not barred by the economic loss doctrine, Plaintiffs have failed to present it in their complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Simply because a particular loss is not covered by the interrelated contracts, does not necessarily mean that a plaintiff may state a claim where a network of interrelated contracts imposes contractual obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schnuck Markets, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516602\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/803/#p808\">\n    887 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That court thus affirmed dismissal with prejudice of financial institutions' negligence claims against a merchant stating that \"[t]he plaintiff banks seek additional recovery because they are disappointed by the reimbursement they received through the contractual card payment systems they joined voluntarily.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516602\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/887/803/#p808\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds the Seventh Circuit's reasoning persuasive. No amount of amendment of the complaint would change the essential fact that the payment card network agreements impose the relevant duties at issue here and also govern the relief available to the allegedly aggrieved parties. The Court will thus dismiss the negligence claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(ECF No. 44 at 58 \u00b6\u00b6 161-67; ECF No. 60 at 12-14.)

Like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Noodles\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here are financial institutions who are neither consumers nor competitors of Chipotle. Nor have Plaintiffs alleged that they were otherwise harmed by destruction of competition resulting from Chipotle's acts. Instead, Plaintiffs merely allege that they are \"within the class of persons\" protected by Section 5 because they are \"engaged in trade and commerce and bear primary responsibility for directly reimbursing customers for fraud losses and maintaining the confidentiality of Payment Card Data.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 165.) Absent a showing of harm resulting from any restriction or destruction of competition, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that they are within the scope of intended beneficiaries of Section 5. As such, under Colorado law, Plaintiffs cannot recover under a theory of negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   based on violations of the FTC Act. The Court therefore dismisses Claim 2 of Plaintiffs' complaint.

Like the passwords and usernames at issue in\n   <em>\n    North Star Media\n   </em>\n   , payment card data merely provides access to an individual's line of credit with a financial institution or money in an account with a financial institution. Absent a connection to either a line of credit or a bank account, payment card data are simply a string of alpha or numeric (or indeed other typographical) symbols. Thus, the Court concludes that payment card data have no independent economic value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The case cited by Plaintiffs does not support its argument.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   suggests that credit cards have no lawful market value, even if they have some illegitimate value on the black market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court tied the black market value of a physical payment card directly to the users ability to access the connected line of credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   can be read to support Defendant's theory that the payment card data have no independent value, but rather have value derived from their connection to an underlying financial account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition to not having independent economic value, payment card data do not derive their value from their nondisclosure. Plaintiff argues that disclosure of payment card data to a third party renders \"computer data for the specific payment card ... susceptible to fraud\" and therefore the data loses its integrity. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 119.) This is partially correct. While disclosure to\n   <em>\n    unauthorized\n   </em>\n   third parties may make the underlying data susceptible to fraud, disclosure to\n   <em>\n    authorized\n   </em>\n   third parties (such as merchants) is the\n   <em>\n    raison d'\u00eatre\n   </em>\n   of payment cards. In other words, disclosure to authorized parties is what makes the payment card valuable because\n   it provides access to a line of credit or money in an account. Thus, because it derives value solely from their authorized disclosure, payment card data are not a trade secret.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because the Court has determined that there is no trade secret to implicate the application of the DTSA in the first instance, it does not need to assess whether the payment card data were misappropriated.

Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    CCPS Transportation\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs do not request a declaration merely as relief sought in connection with another claim; rather Plaintiffs make a separate claim under the Declaratory Relief Act. Second, in\n   <em>\n    Savant Homes v.

In response, Bellwether states that Chipotle's \"lax data security extended to its Florida restaurants where the inadequately protected POS systems were located,\" the allegedly breached data \"belonged to Florida consumers,\" and \"Florida-based financial institutions suffered damages [in Florida] when they reimbursed consumers ... and incurred additional operational costs.\" (ECF No. 60 at 23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44 \u00b6 221.)

This is particularly so in light of Bellwether's competing and indeed conflicting allegation-for purposes of establishing venue in the District of Colorado in the first instance-that the events at issue in this litigation substantially occurred in Colorado.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amjad Ltd. v.

Notably, Bellwether does not allege\n   that it made a purchase from Chipotle \"primarily for personal, family or household purposes.\" Indeed, such a claim would be inconsistent with Bellwether's theory of the case.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a factual matter, Chipotle somewhat overstates Bellwether's pleadings: Bellwether did not allege that Chipotle's conduct occurred in Colorado. Instead, Bellwether states that Chipotle \"conducts substantial business\" in the District of Colorado, has an executive office in Denver, Colorado, and that a \"substantial part of the events giving rise to this action arose in\" the District of Colorado.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In response, Bellwether states that its complaint alleges that its claim \"occurred primarily and substantially\" in Massachusetts because Chipotle's unlawful conduct was intended to and did impact transactions at its Massachusetts-based stores, cards used by Massachusetts consumers were stolen in Massachusetts and used to commit fraud there, and Chipotle's unlawful conduct interfered with trade or commerce in Massachusetts. (ECF No. 60 at 27; ECF No. 44 \u00b6\u00b6 246-47.)

Such a failure could \"raise an eyebrow,\" as required by New Hampshire's rascality test. Thus, the Court finds that Bellwether has stated a claim under NHCPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   8. Vermont Consumer Fraud Act (Claim 10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Vermont's Consumer Fraud Act (\"VCFA\") provides a private right of action to \"any consumer\" who either contracts for goods or services in reliance on, or who sustains damages or injury as a result of, fraudulent statements, unfair competition, or deceptive trade practices may sue for equitable relief and may recover damages from the \"seller, solicitor, or other violator.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%209%2C%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    Vt.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Elkins v.

In\n   <em>\n    Meissier\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the plaintiff had no VCPA claim because he was not a \"consumer\" where he \"did not purchase anything ... he did not lease, contract, or otherwise agree to pay consideration ... for goods or services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20VT%2093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Bellwether alleges that it is a \"consumer\" within the meaning of the statute because it agreed \"to pay for services in connection with the operation of [its]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   business to enable [its] members to purchase goods from Chipotle with [ ] payment cards.\" (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 264.) Chipotle disputes this conclusion and contends that the VCFA applies only to actual purchasers. (ECF No. 57 at 28.) In response, Bellwether asserts that it falls within the portion of the definition of \"a person who ... agrees to pay consideration for goods or services ... in connection with the operation of his or her business.\" (ECF No. 60 at 24-25 (quoting Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7 2451a ).)

Bellwether alleges that it \"agree[d] to pay for services\" but does not assert that it paid Chipotle for those services. (ECF No. 44 \u00b6 264.) Instead, it appears that Bellwether agreed to pay an unidentified entity (likely, Visa or MasterCard) for the benefit of its own members to allow them to make purchases from merchants (such as Chipotle). Bellwether does not state that it is suing the parties that it paid for services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Vt.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20tit.%209%2C%20%C2%A7%202461\">\n    Vt.

Moreover, unlike\n   <em>\n    Elkins\n   </em>\n   , Bellwether does not suggest that Chipotle is merely a company further up the supply chain, or that Bellwether's members were a mere intermediary in the purchase of a good or service that flowed from Chipotle to Bellwether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Bellwether also claims that it is an \"active participant in the payment card transaction process,\" and thus is a consumer within the meaning of the VCTA, citing\n   <em>\n    Ascension.\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 60 at 25.)\n   <em>\n    Ascension\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9211736\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/271/#p276\">\n    327 F.Supp.2d at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Ascension\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff sued its brokerage firm which had allegedly provided bad advice on investments, which the plaintiff intended to use in its own business.

The unfair competition laws in Florida and Massachusetts each require that a substantial action occur within the state. While these claim may be pled in the alternative at the pleadings state, as a factual matter it simply cannot be that the claims occurred \"predominantly or entirely\" in Florida and also \"primarily and substantially\" in Massachusetts. Even if this issue is not predominant at the pleadings stage, it would arise either at the Rule 23 or Rule 56 stages of these proceedings. Specifically, at the Rule 23 stage, a single plaintiff would have difficulty establishing him or herself as a typical or adequate representative of both the Florida and Massachusetts classes: a named plaintiff must personally have standing to be an adequate representative, and a single plaintiff would likely not have standing under both Florida and Massachusetts unfair competition laws.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed R.

(ECF No. 23-24;\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 60 at 20.) This is not so. New Hampshire courts use the rascality test to determine whether a violation is of the \"same type\" of act as the enumerated provision in the NHCPA.

The Court expects that sophisticated parties, represented by sophisticated (and no doubt, expensive) counsel to make reasonable, developed arguments based on correct statements of law. Both parties, but most notably counsel for the Defendant, have repeatedly failed to do so. For instance, Defendant argued that Bellwether failed to meet a notice requirement under Chapter 93A Section 9 even though Bellwether pled a claim under Section 11, which does not have a notice requirement; Defendant cited an ADTPA statute that was recently amended and did not apply retroactively, and thus was inapplicable to the present dispute; and it also argued that Bellwether was required to allege the \"same type\" of act under the NHCPA and meet the rascality test, when it is clear from the caselaw that New Hampshire uses the rascality test to determine whether an act qualifies as the \"same type\" as those enumerated under the NHCPA. Both parties also briefed certain issues on a very cursory or superficial level, requiring the Court to undertake a large part of the heavy lifting in regards to the necessary legal research needed to resolve the large multitude of issues raised by the Defendant's sprawling Motion. Counsel are on notice that the Court will not further tolerate such sloppy lawyering, and that it will not hesitate to summarily reject out of hand inadequately developed arguments, especially in the context of anticipated future Rule 23 and Rule 56 briefing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
