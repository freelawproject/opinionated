For the following reasons, the court finds that Commerce properly adjusted both Motech's and SAS-Solartech's costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Commerce's Cost Adjustments for Motech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pursuant to the Tariff Act, Commerce has the authority to conduct antidumping duty investigations to determine if a class or kind of foreign merchandise is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than its fair value, and to impose antidumping duties if appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1673. In order to calculate the dumping duty, Commerce compares the foreign market value (the normal value) of the product to the United States price (the export price or constructed export price).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the United States price is greater than the normal value, dumping has occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In determining both the normal value and the United States price of a product, Commerce makes adjustments to the costs that go into the calculation of those prices to obtain comparable prices for goods sold in the foreign market and for export to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1677a(c), 1677b(a)(6). The Tariff Act provides that \"[c]osts shall normally be calculated based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the exporting country ... and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677b(f)(1)(A). Commerce's practice in evaluating costs for non-prime merchandise is to determine if that merchandise can be used in the same applications as prime merchandise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   SolarWorld argues that Commerce's adjustments of Motech's reported\n   per-unit costs are not supported by substantial evidence because Commerce relied on Motech's assignment of grades to its crystalline silicon photovoltaic products, but Motech failed to provide a complete and accurate description of these grades. SolarWorld's Br. 12. The court disagrees. In its Supplemental Section D Questionnaire Response, Motech explained the difference between its prime grade A merchandise, and grade B merchandise, stating that \"Grade B cells have full efficiency and electrical function. They are distinguished from Grade A cells by certain cosmetic defects,\" and \"[b]ecause of these defects, Grade B cells are often sold to module producers that do not care about these defects, generally in non-prime markets.\" Motech Supplemental Section D Questionnaire Response at 4, PD 241, bar code 3537552-01 (Jan. 18, 2017). Motech reported that its grade B crystalline silicon photovoltaic products had the same use as prime merchandise \"\n   <em>\n    in addition\n   </em>\n   [to being] used in street lights, small modules or calculators.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Because both grades of crystalline silicon photovoltaic products can be used in the same applications, Commerce adjusted Motech's grade B merchandise to reflect the full value of prime merchandise. The court concludes that Commerce's adjustment is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   SolarWorld argues that Commerce's reliance on Motech's assignments of grades to its merchandise is unreasonable and unsupported by substantial evidence because Motech identified a number of product grades in its Initial Section B Questionnaire Response that were not in its Initial or Supplemental Section D Questionnaire Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Br. 12-15. Commerce found in its\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   that Motech's reporting was consistent because \"[a]lthough additional grades are noted in [Motech's Initial Section B Questionnaire Response], these grades relate to the same below top-grade products (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , products with either cosmetic or electrical defects).\" Final IDM at 36. The additional grades outlined in Motech's Initial Section B Questionnaire Response list defective crystalline silicon photovoltaic products by type of defect such as cosmetic, whereas the grades in Motech's Initial Section D Questionnaire Response combine merchandise with these types of defects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 36 (citing Motech Sections B and C Questionnaire Response at Exhibit B-11, PD 134, bar code 3485696-02 (July 8, 2016), Motech Section D Questionnaire Response at D-25, PD 141, bar code 3487335-01 (July 14, 2016) ). The difference in type of defect would not change the cost adjustments, which are based on the merchandise's end-use, and Commerce's reliance on Motech's grade reporting is therefore reasonable and supported by substantial evidence on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Commerce's Cost Adjustments for SAS-Solartech\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   SolarWorld argues that Commerce erred in reallocating SAS-Solartech's reported costs for certain non-prime merchandise in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   because Commerce applied a flawed calculation of the total costs to assign to grade 4 crystalline silicon photovoltaic products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Reply 8. Specifically, SolarWorld contends that Commerce based the costs for grade 4 merchandise on the control numbers for which \"no power output\" was reported in the cost file and there is not a one-to-one correlation between code \"04\" and \"no power output.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld agrees that an adjustment needed to be made to SAS-Solartech's costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 22. The fact that there is not a \"one-to-one correlation\" between grade 4 merchandise and crystalline silicon photovoltaic products that had no power output is not enough to conclude that Commerce's reallocation is unreasonable. Even though\n   merchandise with no power output can be found under multiple codes and not just under code \"04,\" Commerce's reallocation of the costs of grade 4 crystalline silicon photovoltaic products based on control numbers is reasonable because Commerce's analysis of grade 4 merchandise demonstrated that their market prices were \"considerably less than the full production costs that the company assigns to them in the normal course of business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When Commerce can independently fill in gaps in the record, adverse inferences are not appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhejiang DunAn Hetian Metal Co. v.

Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   SolarWorld argues that Commerce should have applied partial AFA to Motech because Motech failed to provide a complete and accurate description of the grades it assigned to its cells, and therefore failed to cooperate with Commerce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Br. 2, 12. SolarWorld contends that \"Motech clearly maintained clear and extensive information and data on its products by grade, which it did not provide to the agency, thus failing to cooperate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Because Commerce did not have this data, SolarWorld argues that Commerce's failure to apply partial AFA is \"unsupported by substantial evidence, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. In this case, Commerce was able to fill in the gaps regarding the different grades Motech reported in its Initial Section B and Section D Questionnaire Responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 36. Because Commerce found that the record data provided by Motech allowed Commerce to reallocate costs, adverse inferences are not warranted. The court concludes that substantial evidence supports the Department's decision not to apply partial AFA to Motech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   SolarWorld argues that AFA should have been applied to SAS-Solartech's reported costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SolarWorld's Br. 2-3. As with Motech, Commerce determined in the review that SAS-Solartech was \"fully responsive to [Commerce's] supplemental questions with regard to non-prime merchandise\" and explained any \"anomalies\" in its reporting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 25. Because SAS-Solartech complied\n   with Commerce's requests, Commerce declined to apply AFA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concludes that substantial evidence supports the Department's decision not to apply AFA because SAS-Solartech complied fully with Commerce's requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SAS-Solartech's Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Consolidated Plaintiff SAS-Solartech's Rule 56.2 motion for judgment on the agency record contests Commerce's decision to include in its margin calculations certain sales made by SAS because the sales were destined for Mexico via transit through United States FTZs. For the following reasons, the court finds that Commerce's inclusion of certain SAS sales as destined for the United States in its antidumping duty calculation is unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Commerce's Inclusion of the Sales at Issue in its Dumping Calculation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The court shall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).

Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   SAS-Solartech argues that Commerce unreasonably ignored evidence establishing that SAS knew at the time of sale that its merchandise entered United States FTZs in transit, but was destined for sale in Mexico. SAS-Solartech's Br. 3. SAS-Solartech alleges that Commerce unreasonably included the sales to Mexico in its United States price calculations, despite no evidence on the record demonstrating that the merchandise actually entered the United States for consumption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. SAS-Solartech claims also that Commerce's determination to base export price on sales to a third country directly violated Commerce's statutory mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   SAS-Solartech argues that sufficient evidence demonstrates that SAS knew at the time of sale that its merchandise was ultimately shipped to Mexico, including: (1) verbal instruction from its customers that the final destination of the merchandise was Mexico; (2) SAS' knowledge that its customers had manufacturing facilities in Mexico; (3) the sales documentation generated at the time of sale listed \"Mexico as the ultimate 'ship to' destination and a Mexican entity as the 'notify' party, meaning that a Mexican entity was the intended recipient of the merchandise;\" and (4) the United States addresses on the sales documentation were of \"consignee freight forwarders that operated within approved\" United States FTZs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAS-Solartech Br. 10; SAS-Solartech's Reply 5. Defendant contends that Commerce need not take this evidence into consideration because it is neither physical evidence nor contemporaneous, and SAS obtained the sales documentation \"after the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 18. Commerce argues also that the sales documentation only \"relat[es] to a few of the sales at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court notes that the four documents cited by SAS-Solartech are evidence on the record. In its Supplemental Section A Response, SAS writes that during the sales process its \"customers verbally advised SAS that the sales were ultimately destined\n   for Mexico.\" SAS' Supplemental Section A Response at SA-3, PD 166, bar code 3497125-01 (Aug. 11, 2016). SAS states that it \"knows that both customers had factories\" in a non-United States country and that its customers did not intend for the merchandise to enter into the United States customs territory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at SA-4. Commerce acknowledged that \"[t]he sales and shipping documentation\n   <em>\n    at the time of the sales\n   </em>\n   indicate the names of Mexican entities to be notified.\" Final IDM at 10-11 (emphasis added). Commerce acknowledged also that the \"shipping addresses are FTZ-designated addresses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. SAS is not able to provide all sales information because one of its customers filed for bankruptcy. SAS' Supplemental Section A Response at SA-3-SA-4, PD 166, bar code 3497125-01 (Aug. 11, 2016). Because evidence on the record establishes sales to customers in Mexico and demonstrates that the merchandise was shipped to United States FTZ addresses, with no actual United States customers identified and no evidence showing that merchandise entered the United States customs territory for sale, the court concludes that it is unreasonable for Commerce to have ignored the record evidence regarding SAS sales shipped through United States FTZs destined for sale in Mexico. The court concludes that Commerce's decision to include certain SAS sales as sales to United States customers is unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   1. Commerce's adjustments of Motech's and SAS-Solartech's costs are proper;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   2.

Commerce's decision to include certain SAS sales as sales to United States customers is unreasonable and not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court remands the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   for redetermination on the issue of United States sales consistent with this opinion.
