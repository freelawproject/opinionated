WOODLOCK, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   All the relevant dimensions of this case, except the residence of the defendant, are grounded outside Massachusetts, indeed outside the United States. Yet, the plaintiff, Sn\u00f6frost AB, a Swedish company, filed the complaint in this action in this court to enforce an alleged agreement negotiated in Sweden to buy shares in a Swedish company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a curious inversion of the reflexive effort by most parties to obtain some perceived, if illusory, \"home court\" advantage, the defendant, Susanne H\u00e5kansson (the only party with Massachusetts contacts) has moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   . Ms. H\u00e5kansson argues that Sn\u00f6frost's claim should be addressed not by this court in Massachusetts, but by the Malm\u00f6 District Court in the Kingdom of Sweden. For its part, the Swedish party, Sn\u00f6frost, opposes change of venue to Sweden, and says it wants to litigate in Massachusetts, despite\n   its contention that the parties agreed to a Swedish forum for arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Prescinding from the parties' anomalous positions regarding preferred forum, I will grant Ms. H\u00e5kansson's motion to dismiss on grounds of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , leaving pursuit of this dispute to Swedish legal process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The genesis of this case is the death of Ms. H\u00e5kansson's father, Bo H\u00e5kansson, a prominent Swedish businessman. At the time of his death, Mr. H\u00e5kansson owned, among other business holdings, all the shares of Farstorps Gard AB (\"FGAB\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After her father's passing, Ms. H\u00e5kansson, a United States citizen, followed advice from various professional advisors and pursued a strategy to minimize the tax burden associated with the sale of the FGAB shares. This strategy involved several steps: first, the liquidation of the real estate assets of FGAB; second, assignment by Mr. H\u00e5kansson's other heirs of inherited FGAB shares to Ms. H\u00e5kansson resulting in her becoming the sole shareholder; and third, sale of the FGAB shares by Ms. H\u00e5kansson as an American resident, taking advantage of the step-up basis approach under the United States tax regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After acquiring all of the FGAB shares on or about December 20, 2017, Ms. H\u00e5kansson and her representatives - in particular her chief advisor Mr. Thomas Str\u00e4ng, a Swedish tax consultant - sought potential buyers for the shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One potential buyer was Jean-Daniel Cohen, described in the complaint as \"an overseas financial investor,\" represented by a Dutch tax consultant, Harry Rietveld. Beginning in January 2018, Ms. H\u00e5kansson's representatives entered into exclusive negotiations with Mr. Cohen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After preliminary discussions, the parties held an in-person meeting on January 15, 2018, in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. On behalf of Ms. H\u00e5kansson, Mr. Str\u00e4ng and Par Toms (another Swedish tax consultant) attended the meeting. On the other side of the negotiation table were Mr. Cohen and Mr. Rietveld. At this meeting, Mr. Str\u00e4ng circulated a written share purchase agreement (\"SPA\"), drafted by Ms. H\u00e5kansson's retained counsel. Notably, the SPA contained both a choice of law clause stating that the agreement \"shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Sweden without regard to its principles of conflict of law\" and an arbitration clause stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the \"SCC\"). The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply, unless the SCC in its discretion determines, taking into account the complexity of the case, the amount in dispute and other circumstances, that\n   the Arbitration Rules shall apply. In the latter case, the SCC shall also decide whether the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of one or three arbitrators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the January 15, 2018 meeting, the parties discussed various terms, including: the purchase price; balance sheet guarantees; a target closing date; and that a special purpose company would be formed by Mr. Cohen within the Hoch Partners Privates Private Equity Investors group to purchase the shares. That special purpose company became the plaintiff in this matter, Sn\u00f6frost. Ms. H\u00e5kansson's counsel, Johan Jacobsson, was given the task of refining the SPA to reflect the agreements reached at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the January 15, 2018 meeting, Sn\u00f6frost readied itself for closing; in doing so, it paid particular attention to ensuring that the financial terms of the sale would not violate Swedish banking laws. The parties anticipated a closing date of February 16, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A few days prior to February 16, 2018, the parties communicated, and Mr. Str\u00e4ng, on behalf of Ms. H\u00e5kansson, expressed concerns that a review of the transaction was still being conducted by Ms. H\u00e5kansson's banking institution. Sn\u00f6frost forwarded confirmation of funding from its financial institution and caused loan documents to be sent to Ms. H\u00e5kansson. Sn\u00f6frost's loan was funded on February 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 14, Mr. Str\u00e4ng called Mr. Toms and told him that Ms. H\u00e5kansson had chosen not to complete the sale. Later that day, Ms. H\u00e5kansson's counsel communicated the same message to Sn\u00f6frost's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In a subsequent letter, Ms. H\u00e5kansson raised financing issues, alleging that these issues would not allow Ms. H\u00e5kansson to proceed with the sale on February 16, 2018. Asserting uncertainties regarding the legality of the financing of the transaction under Swedish banking law and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Bank's review, the letter formally communicated Ms. H\u00e5kansson's decision to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   permits a court with jurisdiction (and where venue is proper) to decline to hear the case and decide the action should be addressed in another forum, based on the convenience of the parties and the court, and the interests of justice.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reyno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    454 U.S. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    70 L.Ed.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While Congress has enacted a statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), permitting federal courts to transfer venue between themselves for \"the convenience of the parties and the witness,\" there is no such statutory mechanism for federal courts to transfer cases to foreign courts. Instead, the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is used to bring \"about an international transfer of a case ... where plaintiffs may bring approximately the same action in the foreign forum, but without the unfairness and inconvenience that trying the case in this country would entail.\"\n   <em>\n    Howe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Goldcorp Investments, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525261\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/944/#p948\">\n    946 F.2d 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 948 (1st Cir. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A court's\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis begins with a presumption against the invocation of the doctrine. This is because \"there is a strong presumption in favor of a plaintiff's forum choice.\"\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tak How Invs., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334619\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/708/#p719\">\n    94 F.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (1st Cir. 1996). However, a foreign plaintiff's choice of forum \"deserves less deference.\"\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    454 U.S. at 255-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] plaintiff's choice of forum is entitled to greater deference when the plaintiff has chosen the home\n   forum. When the home forum has been chosen, it is reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient.

Because Sn\u00f6frost is a foreign entity, I start with the presumption that its choice of forum is afforded diminished deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To litigate this case in Sweden, Ms. H\u00e5kansson must clear two hurdles. First, she must prove that there exists an available and adequate alternative forum.\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    454 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   255 n.22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).

Mass. Sept. 30, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, Ms. H\u00e5kansson is willing to stipulate to jurisdiction of Swedish courts. She has submitted evidence, in the form of a legal opinion from a Swedish law firm, LA PARTNERS, signed by one its partners Magnus Bernro (the \"LA PARTNERS Opinion\"), which states that, under Swedish law, such consent would be effective. (\"If the Defendant provides a voluntary submission stating that it accepts the jurisdiction of the Malm\u00f6 District Court, that court would be obliged to respect such voluntary submission and, having received the Plaintiff's application for summons, to have jurisdiction over the case.\") Sn\u00f6frost has presented no evidence that undermines this legal opinion. I am satisfied, subject to Ms. H\u00e5kansson's formal stipulation to submit to personal jurisdiction, that she is amenable to Swedish service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition to personal jurisdiction, the foreign court must \"permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Piper Aircraft Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    454 U.S. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6185480\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/454/235/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute, the foreign court cannot be said to be available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to subject matter jurisdiction, Ms. H\u00e5kansson has produced two legal opinions stating that Swedish courts have subject\n   matter jurisdiction over this dispute. One is written by Vinge, a Swedish law firm, and signed by one of its partners, Erik Sjoman (the \"Vinge opinion\"). The second legal opinion is the LA PARTNERS opinion, mentioned\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . These opinions offer two legal bases why the Malm\u00f6 District Court would have subject matter jurisdiction over the current action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, a Swedish court would have jurisdiction pursuant to Ch. 10, \u00a7 4 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure (\"the Code\"), which provides \"[a] person with no known residence within the Realm who has entered into an obligation ... in the Realm may be sued in a dispute concerning the same at the place where the obligation was created ....\" Anticipating an argument from the Sn\u00f6frost that Ms. H\u00e5kansson cannot rely on this section of the Code because she denies the existence of any contract, both legal opinions state that, under Swedish law, under the \"assertion doctrine,\" courts have jurisdiction based on a \"plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    allegation\n   </em>\n   that a contract is entered into provided that the allegation is not clearly unfounded.\" While the opinions concede there is no case law directly on point applying the assertion doctrine to Ch. 10, \u00a7 4 of the Code, based on the reasoning of analogous cases and academic commentary, the opinions state that the assertion doctrine would apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Sn\u00f6frost's assertion as to a contract would ordinarily be enough to establish jurisdiction pursuant to Ch. 10, \u00a7 4 of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Although the opinions do not offer direct legal authority, they are firm - albeit not\n   absolutely certain - in their contentions that subject matter jurisdiction exists. Some courts have suggested that, as evidence of jurisdiction, a defendant must \"put forth unequivocal, substantiated evidence presented by affidavit testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Raytheon Engineers &amp; Constructors, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    H L H &amp; Assocs.

This standard, with its proliferation of adjectives of questionable authority\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and usefulness for weighing evidence, is, of course, not satisfied where unsubstantiated, cursory, or wholly speculative claims concerning jurisdiction are made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=142%20F.3d%201279\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (expressing doubts whether an unsworn declaration of a Panamanian attorney \"who stated, with no substantiation or citation of Panamanian legal authority, that the Panamanian court would take jurisdiction of the case\" was sufficient);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Varnelo\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eastwind Transp., Ltd.,\n   </em>\n   No. 02CIV.2084(KMW)(AJP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20230741\">\n    2003 WL 230741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 (S.D.N.Y.

Here, I am satisfied Ms. H\u00e5kansson has met her burden that Swedish courts would likely have subject matter jurisdiction based on Ch. 10, \u00a7 4 of the Code.

No. 8] is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   It is hereby ORDERED that the stipulation to be executed and filed by Ms. H\u00e5kansson shall provide in words and substance:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   That the defendant stipulates the Malm\u00f6 District Court in the Kingdom of Sweden has personal jurisdiction over the parties; that it is a proper venue for this case and competent to address this dispute; and, further, that the defendant will be bound by that court's determination regarding the enforceability,\n   <em>\n    vel non\n   </em>\n   , of the alleged agreement in dispute in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    For purposes of resolving this motion to dismiss, I act on the basis that \"[a]ll well-pleaded allegations in the complaint bearing on the venue question generally are taken as true, unless contradicted by the defendant's affidavits.\"\n    <em>\n     Turnley\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Banc of Am.

Thus, albeit without briefing by the parties on the issue, I will assume in the apparent absence of a dispute raised by Sn\u00f6frost that as under the Federal Arbitration Act, whether a contract containing an arbitration clause exists under Swedish law is generally a question for a court, not an arbitrator.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Large\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Conseco Finance Servicing Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413792\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/49/#p53\">\n     292 F.3d 49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 53 (1st Cir. 2002) ;\n    <em>\n     Specht\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Netscape Commc'ns Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p26\">\n     306 F.3d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 26 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"It is well settled that a court may not compel arbitration until it has resolved \"the question of the very existence\" of the contract embodying the arbitration clause.\");\n    <em>\n     Sphere Drake Ins.

Arbitrators lack a comparable authority to determine their own authority because there is a non-circular alternative (the judiciary) and because the parties do control the existence and limits of an arbitrator's power.

However, there is no analysis or discussion as to why such an absolutist standard was chosen by the Fifth Circuit. This standard does not appear to have been adopted by the First Circuit. Indeed, courts do not often deal in absolutes particularly in this context, and are limited in their ability to do so when the exercise involves predicting how a foreign court is likely to resolve a question of foreign law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Sn\u00f6frost initially argues that \"the Defendant has not established that the contract was entered into\n    <em>\n     in Malmo\n    </em>\n    \" because other material terms were negotiated by \"email and phone across various countries.\" [Dkt. No. 14 at 9]. Contradicting itself and undermining its own argument, Sn\u00f6frost then explicitly concedes that what was the \"substantially final version of the SPA,\" was agreed to in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, and contains \"\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    material deal terms.\" (emphasis added).
