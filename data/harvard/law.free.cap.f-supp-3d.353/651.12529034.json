Tarnow, Senior United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, Professor Pamela Smock, brings this \u00a7 1983 Complaint against the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan, Andrew Martin (Dean of the College of Literature, Science and Arts), Martin Philbert (Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs) and Mark Schlissel (President). Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they sanctioned her for alleged misconduct in April of 2017. She pleads that the University of Michigan's proceedings against her under its Standard Practice Guide (\"SPG\") I) deprived her of due process, II) on the basis of an unconstitutionally overbroad and vague policy, III) to retaliate against her exercise of protected speech. She seeks compensatory, exemplary, and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a tenured Professor of Sociology in the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (\"LSA\") at the University of Michigan (\"University\") in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She, along with graduate students under her supervision, study topics related to family, fertility, gender, demography, and sexuality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2016, Plaintiff questioned the integrity of one of the student's work. (Compl. \u00b6 32). Shortly thereafter, all three students contacted the Chair of the Department of Sociology, as well as UM's Office of Institutional Equity (\"OIE\"), with information about alleged misconduct by Plaintiff. (Id.). The students claimed that Plaintiff made inappropriate jokes and had conversations of a sexual nature with them. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 33-35). Plaintiff denies these allegations. (Id. at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The OIE conducted an eight-month-long investigation of the students' allegations against Plaintiff. At the conclusion of the investigation, in December 2016, the OIE concluded that Plaintiff's conduct, though inappropriate, \"was not sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive enough to create a sexually hostile environment.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47; Defs.' Ex. 1). In February 2017, Defendant Andrew Martin, the Dean and Chief Administrative Official of LSA, told Plaintiff via letter that he found the OIE's investigation report \"troubling.\" (Defs.' Ex. 2). Martin also said that there was \"evidence that Plaintiff failed to maintain\n   professional boundaries with students.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 52). Martin told Plaintiff that she faced possible sanctions and gave her the opportunity to submit additional documentation for consideration. (Id. at \u00b6 54). The extent of her submissions is unclear from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At any rate, on March 31, 2017, the LSA Executive Committee sanctioned Plaintiff for three years. Her salary was to be frozen at its 2016-17 rate; she was denied any opportunity for sabbatical leave or the accumulation of sabbatical equity; she was forbidden to serve as the primary advisor of doctoral students; and she was barred from meeting with students outside of professional settings. (Id. at \u00b6 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed a faculty grievance application several weeks later. The Grievance Hearing Board (\"GHB\") heard Plaintiff's grievance on September 9, 2017. At the hearing, the University argued for the first time that Plaintiff had violated its civility policy, SPG 201.96. (Id. at \u00b6 81). The University alleged that she violated the SPG by sharing a student's information; entering her students' hotel room and engaging in behavior that they found frightening; discussing her own sexual activities during research meetings with students; and asking a student and the student's spouse for personal favors. (Id. at \u00b6 84). The GHB upheld the sanctions on November 13, 2017, concluding that the evidence in the OIE report indicated an unprofessional pattern of behavior by Plaintiff. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 91-99). On January 18, 2018, Provost Philbert upheld this decision on appeal. (Id. at \u00b6 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed her first Complaint [Dkt. # 1] on February 2, 2018. On June 21, 2018, the Court gave her partial leave to amend her complaint. Before she did so, however, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Summary Judgment [17] on Count II of the pleadings. That motion is now fully briefed and functions as a cross motion to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiff filed her Amended Complaint on June 22, 2018 [23], and on July 20, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss [25] incorporating their old Motion to Dismiss [6]. That motion is now fully briefed too, and a hearing was held on both motions on October 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P 12(b)(6). On a motion to dismiss, the Court must \"construe the complaint in a light most favorable\" to Plaintiff and \"accept all of [its] factual allegations as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Lambert v.

Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the University's sanctions violated her right to due process. For this claim to be legally cognizable she must plead first that the privileges she was deprived are constitutionally protected,\n   and only then that she was denied the process that was due her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd.

Do the University's sanctions against Plaintiff, taken in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, constitute deprivations of Constitutional dimensions?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, Plaintiff did not suffer a constructive discharge. To create a constructive discharge, the employer must deliberately create intolerable working conditions, as perceived by a reasonable person, with the intention of forcing the employee to quit, and the employee must actually quit.\n   <em>\n    Moore v. KUKA Welding Systems &amp; Robot Corp.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639545\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/1073/#p1080\">\n    171 F.3d 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1080 (6th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff is still employed by the University, so she must prove that she has due process interests in the targets of the sanctions: her pay raises, sabbatical leave, and graduate student advising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff, as a public employee, is owed an adequate pre-deprivation hearing before being dispossessed of privileges short of being fired.\n   <em>\n    Ramsey v.

Property interests are created by state law or \"existing rules or understandings,\" not the Constitution, and employment privileges can become property interests when they are sufficiently secured as to be legitimate entitlements.\n   <em>\n    Town of Castle Rock, Colorado v.

He must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\"). Each of Plaintiff's alleged property interests will be considered in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Pay Increases\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A constitutionally protected property interest will not lie in the outcome of an employer's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Township of Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11196148\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/508/#p517\">\n    218 F.3d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that the plaintiff \"can have no legitimate claim of entitlement to a discretionary decision.\"). For that reason, a public employee does not have a property interest in a procedure that may provide a merit-based pay increase.\n   <em>\n    Swartz v. Scruton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42584\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/607/#p610\">\n    964 F.2d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding that merit pay that is based \"on multiple layers of contingency\" cannot form the basis of a due process claim). Multiple layers of contingency are exactly what governs pay increases at the University of Michigan, however, whose Faculty Handbook provides that pay increases are made pursuant to a series of discretionary recommendations and decisions. (Defs.' Ex. 8). Plaintiff therefore does not enjoy \"a legitimate claim of entitlement to a merit pay increase per se.\"\n   <em>\n    Swartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"42584\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/964/607/#p610\">\n    964 F.2d at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B. Sabbatical Time\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sabbatical leave, on the other hand, may rise to the level of a legitimate claim of entitlement. The handbook indicates that an application for leave must be made, but it is at least ambiguous as to the level of discretion invoked. (Defs.' Ex. 9). Further, Defendants have made no showing that there is a discretionary function to a professor's accumulation of sabbatical equity. Sabbatical leave and equity may rise to the level of constitutionally protected property interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramsey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548164\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/1268/#p1274\">\n    844 F.2d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that an employee had a property interest in accumulated sick days).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C. Graduate Student Advisor Roles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   If restrictions on Plaintiff's interactions with graduate students are only changes in job duties, her claim must be dismissed, for one does not have a property interest in one's job duties. Plaintiff has adequately alleged, however, that her role as an advisor to graduate students is necessary to her scholarship and her standing in the academic community. A change of job duties can be something much more when it both stigmatizes the employee and forces her to work beneath her station. The Sixth Circuit has held that a demotion may touch upon a constitutionally protected property right, but \"the contours of that interest depend, of course, on the terms of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharp v. Lindsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9445772\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/479/#p489\">\n    285 F.3d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (6th Cir. 2002). There are fact questions as to the nature of Plaintiff's tenure contract, the scope of her employment, and the extent to which her professorship relies on graduate students. But Plaintiff alleges that mentoring graduate student is necessary to continue her research, receive grants, engage in scholarship, and maintain standing in academia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff has therefore pled the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest in her sabbatical leave and graduate student mentorship. The question then becomes whether the process provided by the University is sufficient under\n   <em>\n    Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/\">\n    470 U.S. 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiff was cleared of sexual harassment charges (SPG 201.89) by the OIE investigation. She was then retried by an LSA Faculty Executive Committee and given only the chance to submit further documentation in writing. After Defendant Martin, with the Committee, imposed sanctions on the Plaintiff, she brought her complaint before the GHB. At the grievance board stage she was provided a hearing, and only then it was revealed that she was being tried for violating SPG 201.96, whose operative language is nearly identical to SPG 201.89. Neither party can identify the standard of review by which the GHB evaluated Defendant Martin's decision. Whether or not the GHB could even constitute a meaningful opportunity to be heard thus remains to be discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The GHB hearing suffered from two further shortcomings. First, Plaintiff challenged the credibility of her accusers but was denied an opportunity to cross examine them. The Sixth Circuit very recently emphasized the importance of cross examination to university disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Doe v. Baum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518564\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/575/\">\n    903 F.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018). Plaintiff's inability to challenge her accusers' credibility was complete: their identities were undisclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, Plaintiff alleges that she did not receive notice of the charges against her until halfway through the hearing. Plaintiff's inability to prepare a defense to the charges levied against her is troubling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loudermill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/\">\n    470 U.S. at 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299646\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/532/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a pre-deprivation hearing must be preceded by notice). Both of these shortcomings compound the inherent unfairness of charging Plaintiff twice for the same conduct after she was acquitted the first time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff has thus adequately pled that the University deprived her, without due process, of her constitutionally protected interests in her sabbatical leave and her graduate student advisorship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Unconstitutional Vagueness and Overbreadth\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff challenges SPG 201.96 as facially overbroad and vague.

While SPG 201.96 might fail to provide notice to the \"students of common understanding\" that the\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   court was concerned about, faculty members can fairly be expected to have a more sophisticated grasp of professional codes of conduct. Further, the \"reasonable person standard\" provides an objective standard for faculty members who may be concerned when their behavior is crossing a line.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaughan v. City of Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20Fed.%20Appx.%20405\">\n    212 Fed. Appx. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412-13 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding that courts have recognized that a reasonable person standard, when applied to qualifying offensive speech, \"creates an objective standard against which the ordinance can be enforced.\"). Further, the many examples of prohibited conduct also serve to put staff members on notice of what conduct is expected of them. See SPG 201.96(III). The University is not asking too much of its faculty by requiring that they exercise reasonable due care not to hinder the work and study of their peers and students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The next question is whether the policy carries the risk of providing \"an unrestricted delegation of power to law enforcement officers.\"\n   <em>\n    Dambrot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415528\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/1177/#p1190\">\n    55 F.3d at 1183-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This concern is vitiated by the use of the \"reasonable person standard\" in conjunction with the peer review process required before the imposition of sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Prior to the imposition of any significant sanction or disciplinary action, to ensure that a level of peer review has occurred, the administrator shall consult with a relevant faculty executive or advisory committee ... The faculty who provide the peer review should look at the totality of the circumstances and not just the precipitating event.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   SPG 201.96(III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The risk of capricious official action is naturally reduced when decision-making responsibility is shared between peers tasked with arriving at a shared conception of reasonableness. That this policy may not have been followed in the instant case animates Plaintiff's due process claim, but a single failure to follow procedure will not invalidate the whole policy. Further, the statute does not baldly prohibit hostility, intimidation, offensiveness, or abuse; it prohibits creating a climate marked by any of those four descriptors, which speaks to a requirement that respondents' conduct be evaluated in a broad context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate that SPG 201.96 is constitutionally overbroad. University of Michigan faculty members need not fear that their First Amendment rights are impermissibly crimped, and they have ample notice as to the standards of professionalism expected from them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
