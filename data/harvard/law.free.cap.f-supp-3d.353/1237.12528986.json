INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[T]his case presents a conflict between one of society's most cherished rights-freedom of expression-and one of the government's most profound obligations-the protection of minors.\"\n   <em>\n    American Booksellers v. Webb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1244996\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1493/#p1495\">\n    919 F.2d 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1495 (11th Cir. 1990) (citation omitted). Plaintiffs, licensed therapists, seek to provide talk therapy to minors with the goal of changing their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Defendants, governmental entities, have passed ordinances to prohibit this practice by the therapists, because they believe that such \"conversion therapy\" or \"sexual orientation change efforts\" (\"SOCE\") are contraindicated and harmful to all persons, but especially minors. At its core, this case is about whether Defendants can prohibit the licensed therapists from administering SOCE therapy to minors where the available medical and subject matter literature concludes that the therapy is harmful to minors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The case is before the Court on Plaintiffs Robert Otto and Julie Hamilton's Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction (\"the Motion\"), DE 8. In their Motion, Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from enforcing the two ordinances, passed in 2017, which ban the use of conversion therapy by licensed medical providers on minor patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants City of Boca Raton (the \"City\") and Palm Beach County (the \"County\") (collectively referred to as \"Defendants\") filed responses at DE 83 and DE 85, and Plaintiffs filed a consolidated reply at DE 95. The Court granted leave to the Trevor Project, Equality Florida, and the Alliance for Therapeutic Choice to file amicus briefs at DE 73 and DE 116, which were filed at DE 90 (Trevor Project), DE 91 (Equality Florida), and DE 115 (Alliance for Therapeutic Choice). The Court also had the benefit of a full day of oral argument regarding the Motion on October 18, 2018. Following oral argument, the Court requested that the parties submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and they were filed at DE 132, DE 133, and DE 134. The Motion is fully ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court has considered all of the briefings referenced above, the record, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. For the reasons stated below, the Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In moving for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of this preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tip in their favor, and that an injunction serves the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court concludes that the Plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the ordinances violate the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and thus a preliminary injunction barring their enforcement shall not issue. In reaching this result, the Court examines the three possible standards of review for Plaintiffs' free speech claim. Succinctly, rational basis review requires Plaintiffs to show that Defendants acted irrationally or unreasonably in enacting the ordinances. Intermediate scrutiny requires Defendants to show that they had a substantial interest in passing the ordinances and that the ordinances are narrowly drawn to achieve that interest. Strict scrutiny requires Defendants to show that they had a compelling interest in passing the ordinances, that the ordinances are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, and that no other less restrictive means could serve that interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that the law is unsettled as to which of these standards should apply to the facts of this case. The ordinances regulate conversion therapy that is effectuated entirely through speech, which suggests that the ordinances are subject to a standard greater than rational basis review. The ordinances also arguably are content-based, as they apply \"to particular speech because of the topics discussed or the idea or message expressed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   While content-based laws ordinarily are subject to strict scrutiny, that conclusion in this case is not clear. The case does not involve a heartland content-based speech regulation. No public forum restrictions exist in the ordinances. The ordinances define the reach of their prohibitions by topic or subject matter, but they do so only to identify the type of therapy covered, not the content of communications outside of the therapy itself. It is the type of therapy that is regulated. The regulation touches speech only when it is a part of conversion therapy. The ordinances do not prohibit or limit proponents or opponents of conversion therapy to speak about gender or sexual orientation conversion publicly and privately, including to their minor clients in forms other than therapy. And, the therapeutic prohibition of conversion therapy is plenary; it does not choose sides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Regardless of the level of review applied to the ordinances, the Court concludes that Defendants have identified a compelling interest in protecting the safety and welfare of minors. Protecting minors may be the paradigm example of a compelling interest. Defendants have pointed to and relied upon extensive credible evidence of the damage that conversion therapy inflicts. This body of information comes from well-known research organizations and subject matter experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At this early stage of the litigation, the Court need not resolve whether strict scrutiny is the applicable standard and whether the ordinances are the\n   <em>\n    least\n   </em>\n   restrictive means that Defendants could have used to achieve their interest in order to reach a decision regarding the Motion. While at trial Defendants will have the burden of demonstrating the constitutionality of their ordinances, at the preliminary injunction stage, the burden is on the Plaintiffs to establish that they have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits at trial. The Court analyzes the challenged ordinances through the lenses of all three methods of review, and concludes that the ordinances pass rational basis review, withstand intermediate scrutiny, and may survive strict scrutiny. The Plaintiffs, therefore, have not met their burden of showing that they have the requisite substantial likelihood of success on the merits. As such, the preliminary injunction shall not issue on Plaintiffs' free speech claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court also concludes that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits as to their prior restraint and vagueness claims, so the preliminary injunction shall not issue on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, on their claim that Defendants acted outside their authority based on Florida state law, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that an irreparable injury will occur in the absence of a preliminary injunction. Accordingly, the preliminary injunction shall not issue on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

DE 121-7, Otto Dep. 19:21-20:5, 143:23-144:2; DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 125, 127. Dr. Otto practices exclusively talk therapy, consisting of client-centered and client-directed conversations with his clients, concerning the clients' goals. DE 121-7, Otto Dep. 20:23-21:22 (\"I want to make a distinction that the therapy I provide is 100 percent speech....\"). Dr. Otto's talk therapy practice does not include any form of aversive treatment, which is treatment involving reprimand, punishment, or shame to turn a person away from certain thoughts or behaviors. DE 1 \u00b6 72; DE 121-7, Otto Dep. 121:22-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff Julie H. Hamilton, Ph.D., LMFT, is a licensed marriage and family therapist as well. DE 1 \u00b6 140. Dr. Hamilton practices throughout Palm Beach County, including in the City of Boca Raton. DE 121-8, Hamilton Dep. 329:3-335:15; DE 96-1. In her current practice, Dr. Hamilton provides individual, marital, and family therapy for a wide variety of issues, including the issues of \"unwanted same-sex attractions\" and \"gender identity confusion.\" DE 1 \u00b6 142. Dr. Hamilton's practice also consists only of talk therapy, which is a conversation that takes place between herself and the client. Dr. Hamilton does not engage in aversive or coercive techniques. DE 1 \u00b6 72. Dr. Hamilton does not coerce her clients into any form of counseling, engages in SOCE counseling only with those clients who desire and consent to it, and permits her clients to set the goals of any counseling she offers. DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 77, 131, 144.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Ordinances\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Drs. Otto and Hamilton challenge two ordinances passed by Defendants in the fall of 2017 that ban mental health providers from engaging in conversion therapy with minor patients. The two ordinances are very similar, although not identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    1. The City Ordinance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 10, 2017, the City enacted the Ordinance, which prohibits the practice of conversion therapy on minors by licensed providers (the \"City Ordinance\"). DE 1-4. The City Ordinance defines conversion therapy as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Any counseling, practice or treatment performed with the goal of changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including, but not limited to, efforts to change behaviors, gender identity or gender expression, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender or sex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:10-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The City Ordinance does not restrict anyone's conduct or speech outside of a formal therapy session.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:21-22 (\"[The City Ordinance] does not intend to prevent mental health providers from speaking to the public about SOCE.\").\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The Ordinance also excludes from its definition of conversion therapy, any counseling that provides support and assistance to a person undergoing gender transition or counseling that provides acceptance, support, and understanding of a person or facilitates a person's coping, social support, and development, including sexual orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or address unlawful\n   conduct or unsafe sexual practices, as long as such counseling does not seek to change sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:14-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The City Ordinance only prohibits formal treatment by licensed providers that has the goal of changing an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. Thus, even within a therapy session, the City Ordinance does not prevent licensed therapists from \"expressing their views to patients; recommending SOCE to patients \u2026 or referring minors to unlicensed counselors, such as religious leaders.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:21-5:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The City's Ordinance defines \"provider\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [A]ny person who is licensed by the State of Florida to provide professional counseling, or who performs counseling as part of his or her professional training under chapters 456, 458, 459, 490 or 491 of the Florida Statutes, as such chapters may be amended, including but not limited to, medical practitioners, osteopathic practitioners, psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, marriage and family therapists, and licensed counselors. The term \"provider\" does not include members of the clergy or other religious leaders who are acting in their roles as clergy or pastoral counselors, or are providing religious counseling or instruction to congregants, provided they do not hold themselves out as providing conversion therapy pursuant to any of the aforementioned Florida Statutes licenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6:21-7:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2.

After serving Defendants, Plaintiffs filed this Renewed Motion for Preliminary Injunction. DE 8. The Court set the case for trial at DE 11, and set a limited discovery plan for the purposes of considering the preliminary injunction, DE 25 (amended at DE 50). In addition to briefing the Motion addressed by the Order, the parties also have briefed Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, filed on August 1, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 34; DE 39; DE 62; DE 82; DE 84.

In grappling with how to strike this critical balance, the Supreme Court has recognized varying levels of scrutiny for analyzing laws that in some way curtail individuals' free speech rights.

When asked, the Florida Department of Health had no records regarding complaints against medical providers regarding SOCE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1-9. The lack of complaints to the Florida Department of Health, however, is not dispositive of whether the Defendants could have taken less restrictive actions, such as engaging in a publicity campaign - urging minors who feel they have been harmed to make a formal complaint about their providers - or passing a resolution condemning SOCE and encouraging concerned citizens to come forward with their complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The lack of SOCE-based complaints to the State could instead lead to the conclusion that existing regulations, such as the providers' codes of ethics and child abuse laws, were not sufficient to prevent this harm. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not interpreted the blanket and general prohibitions against discrimination and \"harming minors\" to prohibit them from exposing minors to the risk of conversion therapy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1, \u00b6\u00b6 132-36, 149-57 (describing Plaintiffs' performance of SOCE on minors prior to the ordinances' enactment); DE 121-7, Otto Dep. 59:19-25 (\"Q: How many\n   clients have you had where the issue to be addressed is the minor's same-sex sexual attractions?

No community members spoke at the City's public hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 128-17, 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The publications relied upon by the Defendants recognize a lack of research on non-aversive SOCE: \"We found that nonaversive and recent approaches to SOCE have not been rigorously evaluated.\" DE 1-6, 52. This may be due to the reluctance of practitioners and research institutions to engage in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   SOCE practices. Still, Defendants' cited authorities did not limit their recommendations against conversion therapy to only coercive, behavioral, or aversive techniques.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 128-6, Am. Psychoanalytic Ass'n Position Statement (\"Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful attempts to 'covert,' 'repair,' change or shift an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Such directed efforts are against fundamental principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in substantial psychological pain by reinforcing internalized attitudes\"); DE 128-10, SAMHSA Report 1 (\"[C]onversion therapy - efforts to change an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression - is a practice that is not supported by credible evidence and has been disavowed by behavioral experts and associations\u2026.Most importantly, it may put young people at risk of serious harm.\"). Rather, the authorities that the Defendants relied upon for enactment of the ordinances warn against all conversion therapy, including the type of \"talk therapy\" performed by Plaintiffs on minors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Requiring Defendants to produce specific evidence that engaging in SOCE through talk therapy is as harmful as aversive techniques would likely be futile when so many professional organizations have declared their opposition to SOCE.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 1-6, 20, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <em>\n    6.

Under intermediate scrutiny as well, these limitations are sufficient to show that the ordinances were \"narrowly drawn.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   However, if the ordinances are subject to strict scrutiny, Defendants must also demonstrate that the ordinances are\n   <em>\n    the least restrictive\n   </em>\n   means to accomplish their objectives of limiting harmful SOCE therapeutic practices on minors. This is a heavy burden for Defendants: \"[I]t is the rare case\" in which a government is able to demonstrate \"that a speech restriction is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

It is not clear from the record at this stage that the ordinances are the \"least restrictive means\" to protect minors from the documented harms of SOCE. Furthermore, there may be slight, but important differences between the Defendants' respective deliberative processes. The County has nearly two hundred pages of public hearing transcripts containing community members' support and opposition to the County Ordinance, including recommendations on limiting the ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 121-2; DE 121-3. These public hearing records may demonstrate\n   the County \"considered\" less restrictive alternatives. The City's ordinance did not encounter such opposition publicly,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DE 128-17, and therefore there is no similar record of the City's consideration of alternative means. That being said, the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    McCullen\n   </em>\n   cannot mean that one ordinance fails, because it received\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   public opposition than a nearly identical ordinance, which was vociferously opposed. Regardless, the Court need not probe the depths of the least restrictive means requirement at this stage. For now, it is sufficient to conclude that whether one or both of the ordinances survive the least restrictive means analysis is a close question, and Plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating substantial likelihood of success on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Viewpoint Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Finally, the Court returns to Plaintiffs' argument that the ordinances are viewpoint discriminatory.

In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the exclusion of counseling that \"provides support and assistance to a person undergoing gender transition\" from the definition of conversion therapy demonstrates that the ordinances are viewpoint discriminatory.

The ordinances do not regulate Plaintiffs' views about SOCE, homosexuality, or human attraction more generally. The ordinances also do not indicate a preference between heterosexual or homosexual individuals seeking to change their sexual orientation one way or another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1-4; DE 1-5; Hr'g.

And, the \"proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable on the basis of one feature (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   obscenity) but not on the basis of another (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   opposition to the city government) is commonplace.\"\n   <em>\n    R.A.V.\n   </em>\n   , 505 U.S. at 385,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p382\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The rationale of preventing harm to minors by prohibiting a type of therapy could be construed as viewpoint neutral. If the Court concludes that SOCE may be regulated, then the perspective that SOCE is beneficial also may be regulated. To find otherwise would swallow the subdivision of viewpoint-discrimination from content-discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   In addition, the ordinances do not prohibit or affect the expression of Plaintiffs' views regarding the benefits of SOCE, sexual orientation or any issue related to it. The ordinances do not ban change, or the expression of the viewpoint that change in sexual orientation is possible. The ordinances do ban efforts, through a medical intervention, by a licensed provider, to therapeutically change a minor's sexual orientation. Presented with a minor client seeking to change his or her sexual orientation or gender identity, Plaintiffs may commend and recommend conversion therapy.

The \"counseling\" and \"support\" that is excluded from the definition of conversion therapy is different in kind from SOCE, and is consistent with the modes of communication still available to Plaintiffs.

In addition, it is worth noting that the studies relied upon by Defendants are self-reflective studies of the practice of various forms of mental health care provided by licensed providers.
