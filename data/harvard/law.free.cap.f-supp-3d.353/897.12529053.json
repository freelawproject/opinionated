These different requirements, it reasons, are consistent with\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's recognition that an NTA can have more than \"one essential function,\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2115 n.7 ; Surreply at 5-6 (Dkt. 20). So, in its view, the IJ had jurisdiction over Arteaga because the NTA complied with the requirements of \u00a7 1003.15, even though the NTA did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 1229(a). Arteaga responds that this argument ignores the fact that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   directly addressed a regulation that purported to define NTA in a particular context to not require time and date requirements-and struck down that provision as inconsistent with the statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2110 ; Reply at 10-11. Arteaga contends that the Government's argument here is simply a redux of the rejected argument in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   : A regulation interpreting the definition of \"Notice to Appear\" cannot remove a statutory requirement of that definition. Reply at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Arteaga is correct. Like the Petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , Arteaga's 1997 NTA\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not contain a time or date; those spaces were left blank. Mot. at 2. The NTA was thus, under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , not in compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 1229(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Further, this Court is unpersuaded by the Government's contention that the requirements of an NTA are different for jurisdictional purposes than they are elsewhere in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 13-14. As the Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , \"it is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi v.

Indeed, the Court deemed the time and date information \"definitional\" and held that \"the omission of time-and-place information is not, as the dissent asserts, some trivial, ministerial defect.... Failing to specify integral information like the time and place of removal proceedings unquestionably would deprive [the NTA] of its essential character.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2116-17. And so the Court held that a regulation that authorized NTAs that lacked that information for purposes of the stop-time rule to be invalid, despite the existence of a regulation that purported to redefine an NTA in that particular context.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   So too here: an NTA is defined by statute and so, as in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , the existence of a regulation that purports to redefine NTA in a particular context-here, when jurisdiction vests,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -does not alter the plain meaning of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Government offers no explanation for why, despite the Court's admonishment that \"identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    at 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Taniguchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p571\">\n    566 U.S. at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189785\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/560/#p571\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1997\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), an NTA should be given a different definition as to jurisdiction than it has in other places in the INA and its implementing regulations.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Opp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nor did the Court in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   purport to limit its holding to the context of the stop-time rule. Instead, it held that \"when the term 'notice to appear' is used elsewhere in the statutory section,\n   <em>\n    including as\n   </em>\n   the trigger for the stop-time rule, it carries with it the substantive time-and-place criteria required by \u00a7 1229(a).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2116 (emphasis added). It is thus clear that the Court did not intend its holding to be read to apply only to the definition of an NTA in the context of the stop-time rule, but rather to apply to the definition of NTA in the context of the statute overall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For these reasons, the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   applies with equal force here.

In consequence, Arteaga's 1997 NTA was invalid because it lacked time and date information. And thus, because an IJ's jurisdiction vests only when a charging document-which must include an NTA-is filed, the deportation order was jurisdictionally invalid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003.14(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
