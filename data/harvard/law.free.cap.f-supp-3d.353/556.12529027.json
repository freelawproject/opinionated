Plaintiff alleges that the Union retaliated against her, and Southwest terminated her employment, for speech and activity protected by the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\") and the United States Constitution. Plaintiff also alleges that Local 556 breached its duty of fair representation by causing Southwest to terminate her employment. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that both Southwest and Local 556 discriminated against her for her religious beliefs and practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Southwest moves to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) [ECF No. 48].

Nor is Plaintiff alleging that Southwest prevented her from resigning from the Union to become a nonmember objector. In fact, Plaintiff resigned from the Union on September 29, 2013, and remained a nonmember objector without incident until her termination by Southwest on March 14, 2017. Second Am. Compl. \u00b6 13. Rather, she alleges a claim of retaliation and discrimination against her employer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104, 128. Plaintiff is essentially asking the Court to hold that Southwest, a private company, is a state actor in the context of an employment dispute because Southwest is a party to a CBA. Plaintiff has failed to identify a recognized legal theory for this proposition.\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   also does not support Plaintiff's argument that the RLA \"transforms\" Southwest into a private actor. In particular, the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   applies to public-sector unions and workers, not private-sector unions and workers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2478 (\"[W]e conclude that\n   <em>\n    public-sector\n   </em>\n   agency-shop arrangements violate the First Amendment[.]\" (emphasis added) ). And as discussed above, Plaintiff is a nonmember objector of a private-sector union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Southwest is not a state actor. Nonmember objectors in the private sector do have a First Amendment right to object to their union and pay reduced dues, which Plaintiff has elected to do. It remains to be seen if the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   will be extended to private-sector unions; however, this is not the issue before the Court in the instant case. Plaintiff asserts causes of action for retaliation by her employer and religious discrimination under Title VII. While she may object to paying her union dues, that is not the claim Plaintiff has brought before the Court in the instant case. Therefore, the Court grants Southwest's Motion to Dismiss on this ground and dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's retaliation claims against Southwest based on the exercise of her rights under the First and Fifth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (4) Title VII (Count V)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a Title VII claim against Southwest, alleging that Southwest discriminated against her for her religious beliefs and practices \"by terminating her employment because of her religious beliefs and practices, including sharing religious views on her personal Facebook page, with her union president, while off-duty and without any impact on the workplace.\" Second Am.

Southwest argues that Plaintiff has failed to state a valid religious discrimination claim, and therefore the Court should dismiss her Title VII claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer \"to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's ... religion.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). \"The term\n   'religion' includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate ... an employee's ... religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2000e(j).

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court grants in part and denies in part Southwest's Motion to Dismiss and Local 556's Motion to Dismiss. The Court denies Southwest's 12(b)(1) Motion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff's claims do not constitute a \"minor dispute\" under the RLA. The Court also declines to exercise its discretion to give preclusive effect to the findings of the arbitrator at the motion to dismiss stage, and thus denies without prejudice Southwest's 12(b)(6) Motion on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As to Counts I and II, the Court grants Southwest's 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss because Plaintiff cannot establish that judicial intervention is warranted in this post-certification dispute. The Court therefore dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's RLA claims. As to Count III, the Court grants the Union's 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's claim for breach of the duty of fair representation, but grants Plaintiff leave to amend. As to Count IV, the Court denies both Southwest and Local 556's 12(b)(6) Motions to Dismiss Plaintiff's retaliation claims based on RLA-protected activity. The Court, however, grants both Southwest and Local 556's 12(b)(6) Motions to Dismiss Plaintiff's retaliation claims based on constitutional violations because both Southwest and the Union are not government actors. Thus, the Court dismisses with prejudice Plaintiff's retaliation claims based on the exercise of her First and Fifth Amendment rights. Finally, as to Count V, the Court denies Southwest's 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Title VII claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Because further amendment may not be futile, the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   grants Plaintiff leave to amend her pleadings as to Count III.
