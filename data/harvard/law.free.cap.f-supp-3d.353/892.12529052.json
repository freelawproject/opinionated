Robinson Worldwide Incorporated (\"Robinson\") is a federally licensed property freight broker that contracts with motor carriers to haul freight shipments. (Doc. 36, \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). In August 2015, Robinson contracted with Luga Transportation to transport Glyphosate from Texas to Arizona. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 6). While transporting the Glyphosate, Manuel Prado, an employee of Luga Transportation, lost control of the trailer-truck, which rolled over on its side and blocked the lanes of the interstate near Gila Bend. (Doc. 26 \u00b6 9). Following the rollover, Plaintiff Robert Nyswaner collided with the trailer-truck and asserts that he suffered injuries as a result. (Doc. 26, \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Nyswaner filed a lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court against Luga Transportation and Mr. Prado. That case settled. (Doc. 42-1 at 1). Mr. Nyswaner then filed this lawsuit against Robinson, seeking damages under several different legal theories. (Doc. 1, Doc. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Robinson raises a single issue: whether the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (\"FAAAA\") preempts Mr. Nyswaner's claim that Robinson negligently hired Luga Transportation to provide services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Accordingly, preemption under the FAAAA occurs where \"a\n   <em>\n    customer\n   </em>\n   invokes [state law] to obtain certain\n   <em>\n    rates\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    services\n   </em>\n   \" outside those provided for in the contract, but not where \"the law is a generally applicable background regulation in an area of traditional state power that has no significant impact on a carrier's prices, routes, or services.\"\n   <em>\n    California Trucking Ass'n v.

The point at which Robinson provides services to its customers is where it agrees to arrange the transport goods for other businesses-not when it selects a carrier to provide that service. And the dispute in this case does not involve a customer seeking better rates or services. Instead, the claim is more analogous to other generally applicable laws that the Ninth Circuit has held are not preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Allowing Nyswaner's negligent hiring claim to proceed would not create a patchwork of state regulations as Robinson alleges. Rather, it would only require that Robinson conform to the general duty of care when it hires trucking companies to deliver goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Factory Mutual Insurance Company v. One Source Logistics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202608867\">\n    2017 WL 2608867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 (C.D. Ca. 2017) (holding that the FAAAA did not preempt negligent hiring claims). This duty of care is generally applicable and applies to many industries that make hiring decisions. In\n   <em>\n    Charas\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit explained that the similarly-phrased ADA \"intended to insulate the industry from possible state economic regulation,\" not to \"immunize the [industry] from liability for personal injuries caused by their tortious conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11682629\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/160/1259/#p1261\">\n    160 F.3d at 1266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same distinction applies here, where the FAAAA did not likely intend to immunize trucking companies from tortious conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This conclusion is supported by the lack of discussion of state common law claims when Congress enacted the preemption provision of the FAAAA. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"[i]t is difficult to believe that Congress would, without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Silkwood v.
