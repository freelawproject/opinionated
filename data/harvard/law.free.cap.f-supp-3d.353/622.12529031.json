DN 17. The Court entered the order because it had \"grave concerns about the propriety of ruling on issues surrounding ongoing state proceedings or final state proceedings which have not been appealed to the courts of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Defendants Laura Taylor, Lauren Ingram, and Tareka Morgan, along with Plaintiff George Alexander, responded. DNs 21, 23, 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Shante Franklin has not. These issues are ripe for review. Finding that the exercise of federal jurisdiction in this case offends the abstention doctrines of\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   , this Court will\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   dismiss the claims and deny all other pending motions as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tareka Morgan gave birth to a child, K.M. DN 1 at 3. George Alexander was present at the hospital during the birth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alexander refused to provide information for an acknowledgment of paternity form and alleges he later entered into an oral agreement with Morgan to provide medical insurance and $300 per month placed on a prepaid debit card in lieu of child support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This arrangement continued for about three months until Morgan and Alexander began to disagree on how the money was being spent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Alexander alleges that Morgan then threatened to pursue child support, an endeavor he believes was fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Eventually, the matter came to the Jefferson Circuit Court Family Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   There, two proceedings occurred. The first, 13-J-503960, established Alexander's paternity. DN 21 at 1. The second, 14-CI-502980, was initiated by Alexander and sought custody, visitation, and support.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. As a result of the second proceeding, Alexander was ordered to pay $450 per month in child support, which was eventually increased to $747 per month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During this process, Alexander was represented by counsel and present at the hearings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that point, Alexander made his initial foray into this Court. On February 17, 2017, Alexander filed a complaint against the Commonwealth of Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services and several employees of the Jefferson County Attorney's Office, including Laura Taylor (a Defendant in the current action), in their official capacities. There, he claimed the defendants \"fraudulently obtained his signature on an acknowledgement-of-paternity form and forced him to pay money for child support.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexander v. Ky. Cabinet for Health &amp; Family Servs.\n   </em>\n   , 3:17-CV-101-DJH-DW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204570309\">\n    2017 WL 4570309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1 (W.D.

Feb. 20, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Now Alexander, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , has returned to this Court to allege that Defendants participated in \"racketeering, commingling, and conspiracy against rights\" through the state child custody and support program. DN 1, p. 6. Concerned with interfering in the state court proceedings, this Court issued the order to show cause which is now under consideration.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\"\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   , 424 U.S. at 817,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027510\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/800/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Supreme Court has recognized various types of abstention, placing constitutional or prudential limits on the federal courts' exercise of jurisdiction over cases or controversies that could have been, were, or are being brought in state courts. For example, federal courts will not rule on a federal constitutional issue which might be mooted or presented in a different posture by a state court determination of pertinent state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Railroad Comm'n of Texas v. Pullman Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359292\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/496/\">\n    312 U.S. 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359292\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/496/\">\n    61 S.Ct. 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359292\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/496/\">\n    85 L.Ed. 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1941). Federal courts will also abstain where there are difficult questions of state law, issues of great public importance to the state, or where the state has special expertise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Abstention is also appropriate where, absent bad faith, harassment, or a patently invalid state statute, federal jurisdiction has been invoked to restrain ongoing state proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Younger v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Abstention is a crucial and important doctrine to preserve our system of federalism and ensure that federal courts do not overstep their boundaries. In this case, Alexander has asked this Court to act as an appeals court and overrule the decision of a state court. That is not the proper task for this Court. Therefore, the Court will dismiss this case and abstain. As a result, the Court will further deny all other pending motions as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A separate order will be entered in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Morgan responded late and has moved the Court to accept her late filing. DN 22. Since Alexander filed late as well (DN 24), and the Court wishes to hear all arguments surrounding the order, that motion will be granted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Sixth Circuit has held that\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    is inapplicable when there are federal questions that do not \"entangle us in the merits of the state child support proceedings, and accordingly we may answer them without treading on protected state interests.\"\n    <em>\n     Alexander v. Rosen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356284\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/1203/#p1207\">\n     804 F.3d 1203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1207 (6th Cir. 2015). Specifically, on that issue, the Sixth Circuit stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    [U]nlike other cases where we have abstained from addressing child support issues, Alexander does not ask us to regulate \"the day-to-day conduct of state hearings,\" assess the constitutionality of procedures used in those hearings, or opine on the merits of the child support determination.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tindall v.

This case does not require the sort of \"unduly intrusive interference with\" a pending state case,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sevier\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"613271\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/742/262/#p269\">\n     742 F.2d at 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , that typically justifies\n    <em>\n     Younger\n    </em>\n    abstention.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1207. In this case, however, the merits of the state court child support proceedings are directly challenged as to their validity and with respect to the claimed burdens they imposed on the Plaintiff. Alexander's requested remedy indicates his true motive. Specifically, he requests \"an injunction or rescission from the child support program\" as well as monetary damages from the wage garnishment and tax withholding pursuant to the state court's order. DN 1 at 4, 11, 15. In undertaking such a review of the procedures employed and the decisions rendered by the state child support court, this Court would be entangled in the merits of the state courts' rulings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
