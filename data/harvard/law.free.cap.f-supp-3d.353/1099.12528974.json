ARGUELLO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendant USAA Life Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment. (Doc. # 74.) Plaintiff filed a response (Doc. # 82) on June 6, 2018 and Defendant filed a reply (Doc. # 86) on June 20, 2018. Having thoroughly reviewed the underlying briefing, pertinent record, and applicable law, the Court grants Defendant's Motion for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2015, Theodore Bobkowski (\"Decedent\") applied for a life insurance policy with Defendant USAA Life Insurance Company. (Doc. # 74 at 9.) Based on Decedent's answers in Defendant's application, Defendant agreed to issue him a $1 million, 20-year term life insurance policy under Defendant's \"Preferred Ultra\" risk class, which is the least expensive risk class that Defendant offers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The policy became effective on September 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Decedent unexpectedly died on October 22, 2016, a little over a year after obtaining the policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, Plaintiff, as the named beneficiary, submitted a claim to Defendant on the policy. (Doc. # 21 at 2.) However, because Decedent died within the policy's two-year contestability period, Defendant requested and obtained from Plaintiff a HIPAA release in order to review Decedent's medical records. (Doc. # 74 at 10.) Defendant then analyzed the\n   records to determine whether Decedent's medical history was consistent with his responses in Defendant's application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant discovered that Decedent's application omitted numerous details of Decedent's medical history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In particular, Defendant learned for the first time that Decedent had been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in November 2012 during the first of two sleep study diagnostics which Decedent had not disclosed in his application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 10.) Under Defendant's underwriting guidelines, however, an applicant is not eligible for the Preferred Ultra risk class if the applicant has been diagnosed with OSA that has not been surgically resolved. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 10, 2017, Defendant denied Plaintiff's claim and refused to pay benefits on the grounds that Decedent materially misrepresented his medical history by failing to disclose his OSA diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Thereafter, Plaintiff brought this suit in state court asserting claims against Defendant for breach of contract, bad faith breach of contract, and violation of the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (\"CCPA\"). (Doc. # 21 at 2.) Defendant removed the suit to federal court. (Doc. # 1.) In the instant motion, Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it was justified in denying Plaintiff's claim on Decedent's life insurance policy and because there is a lack of evidence to substantiate Plaintiff's CCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

APPLICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff asserts three claims for relief against Defendant. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges: Defendant breached the life insurance contract into which Defendant entered with Decedent; Defendant's alleged breach of contract was in bad faith; and Defendant violated the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (\"CCPA\") by engaging in deceptive trade practices. (Doc. # 12 at 3-5.) Defendant, by contrast, argues: Defendant's denial of Plaintiff's claim was proper because Decedent knowingly made material misrepresentations regarding his health; Defendant's denial of Plaintiff's claim was justified and thus not in bad faith; and Plaintiff's CCPA claim fails because Plaintiff has not met its burden of producing evidence to substantiate Plaintiff's allegations. (Doc. # 74 at 3.)

Although an insurer may not cancel a policy to avoid a pre-cancelation loss, there are circumstances that allow insurers to \"avoid\" coverage after-the-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollinger v.

However, Plaintiff fails to establish that Decedent's misrepresentations\n   were due to an ambiguous question on Defendant's insurance application. Therefore, there is no genuine dispute of fact and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    a. Decedent concealed facts in his insurance application\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that Decedent was diagnosed with a medical condition known as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (\"OSA\") in 2012. (Doc. # 74 at 3.) OSA is \"a condition whereby people typically snore, [and] have some pausing or cessation of their breathing at night.\" (Doc. # 74-14 at 25.) It is also undisputed that Decedent sought medical care for his OSA on multiple occasions. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Decedent underwent a sleep study in November 2012 which is a diagnostic test designed to detect disorders such as OSA (Doc. # 74 at 3) (the results of the study indicated that Decedent had moderate OSA);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Decedent treated his OSA with a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (\"CPAP\") machine, which is a mask placed over the nose and mouth that forces air into the lungs (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Decedent underwent a second sleep study in January 2013 to determine the amount of pressure from the CPAP machine that was necessary to prevent his airways from becoming obstructed during sleep (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Decedent consulted a doctor regarding his sleep studies in February 2013 (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Decedent consulted a second doctor regarding his OSA in October 2013 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Additionally, it is undisputed that Decedent did not disclose his OSA diagnosis on his life insurance application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Decedent omitted his OSA diagnosis notwithstanding several relevant sections of Defendant's life insurance application. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 The application indicated that completion required \"[c]ontact information for all doctors and facilities\" as well as \"[m]edical history, including dates of diagnosis, tests and treatments\" (Doc. # 74-3 at 5);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 The application inquired whether the insured:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 \"[had] ever consulted with a health care provider for: asthma, emphysema, pneumonia or other respiratory system disorder ?\" (Doc. # 74-13 at 35);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 \"within the past five years: had an electrocardiogram, X-ray\n   <em>\n    or any other diagnostic test or procedure\n   </em>\n   that was not previously disclosed?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added); or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 \"consulted a health care provider for any reason not previously disclosed?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Decedent answered the foregoing questions in the negative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Decedent completed the life insurance policy application in 2015. (Doc. # 12 at 2.) Therefore, Decedent was required to disclose his sleep diagnostics because those tests were conducted within the applicable five-year period. Additionally, Decedent was required to disclose his OSA diagnosis because the application explained that sleep apnea was considered a \"respiratory system disorder.\" (Doc. # 74-5 at 1.) Finally, Decedent was required to disclose his OSA related consultations with health care providers-if for no other reason-because he had not previously disclosed those consultations in the application. Despite the fact that the terms of the application required Decedent to disclose his OSA diagnosis and related consultations and diagnostics, Decedent omitted the necessary information. Thus, by answering the relevant\n   application questions in the negative, Decedent made false statements of fact regarding pertinent medical history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Defendant's application asked whether applicants \"[had] ever consulted with a health care provider for: asthma, emphysema, pneumonia or other respiratory system disorder ?\" (Doc. # 74-13 at 35.) The foregoing question is not, as Plaintiff asserts, vague, ambiguous, or misleading. (Doc. # 82 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The word \"respiratory\" is defined as \"[d]esignating, relating to, or affecting the organs involved in respiration; of or relating\n   ... to the process of oxygen transport and respiration.\"\n   <em>\n    Respiratory, adj.\n   </em>\n   , OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY , http://www.oed.com/view/-Entry/163819?redirectedFrom=respiratory&amp; (last visited Oct. 10, 2018). One of the primary features of Defendant's OSA diagnosis was \"pausing or cessation of [his] breathing at night.\" (Doc. # 74-14 at 25.) Moreover, OSA is treated with a device that forces air into the lungs. (Doc. # 74 at 2.) Therefore, it is clear that OSA involves the process of oxygen transport and respiration. As such, OSA is fairly characterized as a respiratory disorder because it pertains to a defect in the process of respiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, a reasonable person in Decedent's circumstances-a person who had undergone multiple sleep diagnostics that analyzed their rate of oxygen intake, consulted with multiple health care professionals about the nature of OSA, and treated the condition with a machine that facilitated breathing-would understand that a question inquiring about respiratory disorders calls for disclosure of specific information related to an OSA diagnosis. (Doc. # 74-14 at 2) (listing oxygen intake levels and apnea-hypopnea index under the heading \"RESPIRATORY MEASURES\" in Decedent's 2012 sleep diagnostic).

Based on Decedent's statement that he did not have any respiratory disorders, Decedent was found to be eligible for Defendant's \"Preferred Ultra\" risk class, \"which is the best (i.e., least expensive) risk class that [Defendant] offers.\" (Doc. # 74 at 9.) However, under Defendant's underwriting guidelines, an applicant is not eligible for the Preferred Ultra risk class if the applicant has been diagnosed with OSA that has not been completely surgically resolved. (Doc. # 75 at 3.) Additionally, if an applicant's \"pre-CPAP sleep study shows that oxygen saturation levels dip below 90 percent at any point, the applicant is not even eligible for the Preferred Plus risk class (the second best class).\" (Doc. ## 74 at 10, 75 at 2.) In both of Decedent's sleep studies, his oxygen saturation levels were below 90 percent for nearly an hour. (Doc. # 74-14 at 2, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   If Decedent had disclosed his OSA diagnosis, Defendant \"would have sought his medical records relating to the diagnosis, including the sleep study reports, and thereby would have discovered ...

As a result, Decedent would have been \"classified in the Preferred risk class.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With an accurate risk determination, Defendant would not have offered Decedent the coverage Decedent selected at the price Decedent paid.

Decedent's responses to the inquiries in the application did not disclose his OSA diagnosis or any other medical conditions. (Doc. # 74 at 7-8.) Moreover, although Defendant hired a paramedical technician to conduct an examination of Decedent, the examination was intended to be a limited one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Technicians who carried out such examinations were instructed to obtain \"proof of applicant's identity ...; applicant's vitals (including height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse); applicant's initials confirming height and weight; whether applicant had a moving violation, or had driver's license revoked, in previous five years; applicant's blood sample; and applicant's urine sample.\" (Doc. # 74-15 at 42.) None of the foregoing information revealed that Decedent suffered from OSA, and the examination did not put Defendant on notice that Decedent had made misrepresentations on\n   his application. (Doc. # 74 at 9.) Therefore, Defendant was unaware of the facts concealed by Decedent's misrepresentations.

As a result, Defendant agreed to issue twice as much coverage as Decedent was eligible for. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, Defendant relied on Decedent's misrepresentations because Decedent's assertion that he did not have a respiratory disorder induced Defendant to issue a policy that did not reflect the risk posed by Decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In sum, Defendant has established that it detrimentally relied on material misrepresentations Decedent knowingly made on his insurance application.

Between 2012 and 2017, Defendant processed more than 17,500 life insurance claims nationwide. (Doc. # 74 at 20.) Of those claims, Defendant denied a total of 109 contestable claims, \"only two of which were from Colorado, including Plaintiff's claim....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Defendant denied\n   \"six-tenths of 1 percent\" of the claims it processed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As such, the trade practices Plaintiff challenges clearly have a de minimis impact on the public and are therefore outside the scope of the CCPA as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    b.

App. 1974).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Here, Plaintiff has failed to establish a causal link between Defendant's challenged practices and Plaintiff's alleged injury. In Plaintiff's complaint, Plaintiff alleges \"as a direct and proximate cause of Defendant's deceptive trade practices, Plaintiff has been harmed in an amount to be proven at trial.\" (Doc. # 12 at 5.) However, Plaintiff has neither identified nor produced any allegedly deceptive advertisements or other information that Defendant has issued. (Doc. # 74-14 at 43.) Further, Plaintiff does not allege that Decedent saw or relied upon any deceptive information before he completed his life insurance application. As a result, Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any causal connection between Defendant's allegedly deceptive trade practices and Plaintiff's alleged damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Decedent \"allowed a policy of life insurance benefitting Plaintiff in the amount of $400,000.00 to lapse because of and/or in anticipation of the issuance of the USAA life insurance policy.\" However, Decedent allowed his prior life insurance policy to lapse in June 2015 (Doc. # 74-15 at 45), yet he did not submit an application to Defendant until August 2015 (Doc. # 74-13 at 31). Therefore, because Decedent had not even submitted an application to Defendant when his prior life insurance lapsed, Defendant could not have relied upon his policy with Defendant at the time his prior policy lapsed. Moreover, Plaintiff has not alleged that Decedent's decision to allow his former policy to lapse was influenced by any advertisement or information issued by Defendant. Thus, Plaintiff is not entitled to damages under the CCPA because Plaintiff has not presented evidence of a causal link between Defendant's allegedly deceptive trade practices and Plaintiff's alleged injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the burden of production on Plaintiff's CCPA claim. Plaintiff argues that Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment because Defendant \"does not present affirmatively any evidence showing the [CCPA] claim lacks merit.\" (Doc. # 82 at 16.) However, in order to meet its burden as a movant for summary judgment who does not bear the ultimate burden of persuasion at trial for the CCPA claim, Defendant does not need to disprove Plaintiff's claim; rather, Defendant need simply point the Court to a lack of evidence for Plaintiff on an essential element of Plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    Adler v.

Defendant met its burden by pointing the Court to a lack of evidence on two essential elements of Plaintiff's CCPA claim. Specifically, Defendant noted that Plaintiff has not presented evidence that Defendant's challenged trade practices have a significant public impact. Further, Defendant established\n   that Plaintiff has not presented evidence of a causal link between Defendant's allegedly deceptive trade practices and Plaintiff's injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Once Defendant met its initial burden, the burden shifted to Plaintiff to \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's argument is \"nothing more than a rehashing of Defendant's prior motion [to dismiss] regarding the CCPA claim that has already been overruled by the Court.\" (Doc. # 82 at 16.) Therefore, Plaintiff effectively argues that the allegations in its complaint are sufficient for it to survive the instant motion for summary judgment. However, a nonmovant may not simply rest upon its pleadings to satisfy its burden.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p256\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Plaintiff failed to meet its burden because it did not offer any specific facts to substantiate the elements of its CCPA claim that Defendant challenged for lack of evidence. Therefore, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that Defendant USAA Life Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The Court notes that Plaintiff argues that \"Plaintiff need not discuss the materiality of the answer to issue to policy [sic] or [Defendant's] knowledge.\" (Doc. # 82 at 13.)

However, Decedent's subjective interpretation of his condition is irrelevant in light of the objective standard set forth in\n    <em>\n     Hollinger\n    </em>\n    .
