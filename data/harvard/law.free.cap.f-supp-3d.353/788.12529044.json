No. 62) for preliminary injunction and motion (Doc. No. 65) to exclude expert opinions, testimony and evidence by plaintiffs TrueNorth Companies, L.C., and TrueNorth Principals, L.C. (collectively TrueNorth). Defendant TruNorth Warranty Plans of North America, LLC (TN Warranty) has filed resistances to both,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 88 and 89, along with a sealed supplemental resistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 96. TrueNorth has submitted replies. Doc. Nos. 100 and 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Also before me are TN Warranty's motions (Doc. Nos. 90, 91) to amend/correct the protective order and extend pre-trial deadlines. TrueNorth has filed resistances (Doc. Nos. 101 and 103) and TN Warranty has filed replies (Doc. Nos. 114 and 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I held a hearing on the motions on October 26, 2018, and allowed the parties to submit supplemental exhibits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 121, 122, 123. TrueNorth followed up with a motion (Doc. No. 124) to strike the exhibits filed as Doc. Nos. 122-1, 122-2, and portions of Doc. No. 123-1. TN Warranty filed a third set (Doc. No. 125) of\n   supplemental exhibits and a resistance (Doc. No. 126) to TrueNorth's motion to strike. Finally, as if attempting to prove Yogi Berra's famous observation that \"it ain't over till it's over,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   TN Warranty has filed a motion (Doc. No. 127) for leave to supplement its resistance to TrueNorth's motion for preliminary injunction, which TrueNorth resists (Doc. No. 128).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   TrueNorth filed its original complaint (Doc. No. 2) on March 28, 2017, alleging two counts of trademark infringement, one count of mark dilution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of false designation of origin and one count of mark infringement under Iowa law based on the parties' respective design logos:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs':\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 27, 2017, TrueNorth amended its complaint to add two new counts: Count VI for false advertising under the Lanham Act and Count VII for unfair competition under the Lanham Act and common law. The parties then submitted a joint motion (Doc. No. 47) for revised deadlines, which Judge Williams granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 47, 48. The order established July 9, 2018, as the deadline for disclosure of defendant's expert witnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 48 at 3. This deadline was later extended to July 30, 2018. Doc. No. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 20, 2018, TrueNorth filed its motion for a preliminary injunction and motion to exclude TN Warranty's expert. It seeks a preliminary injunction to stop\n   TN Warranty from using any mark similar to the TrueNorth mark. TrueNorth alleges that since filing the lawsuit, it has received several communications from truck drivers and industry professionals demonstrating confusion about the affiliation between TN Warranty and TrueNorth. It also seeks to exclude TN Warranty's expert based on an alleged failure to disclose materials the expert relied upon under Rule 26(b)(4)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Nature of the Parties' Businesses\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   TrueNorth was formed in August 2000 by the merger of three financial services entities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 68 at 2. It provides financial and insurance services to a variety of clients nationwide including comprehensive property and casualty insurance, risk management and underwriting services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 4. It also provides other specialized products and services to commercial transportation companies and individual drivers including transportation risk management, transportation property insurance and transportation equipment insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TrueNorth originated in eastern Iowa and now has offices in Tennessee, Texas, Illinois, Michigan and Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   TN Warranty was formed on September 1, 2015, to market and sell commercial truck warranties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 88 at 4. Its products provide extended warranty services for mechanical components for used commercial vehicles manufactured by others whose original manufacturer's warranty has expired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. It markets its services through a network of independent truck dealers or \"authorized retailers,\" who purchase and resell its warranty products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The end user of TN Warranty's products is a truck owner or fleet owner who owns the truck(s) covered by the warranties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty estimates that approximately 80 percent of its authorized retailers are used truck dealers who sell TN Warranty products at the point of sale at or near the same time they close a deal for the sale of a used truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It estimates that approximately 15 percent of its warranties are sold by finance companies that provide the financing for the truck and approximately 5 percent of its warranties are sold by repair facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states that in rare circumstances (a fraction of one percent of sales), TN Warranty sells a warranty directly to an end consumer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   TN Warranty has six sales representatives who work directly with its authorized retailers. The representatives are assigned geographic regions and are encouraged to travel regularly to visit the authorized retailers in person.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty relies heavily on word of mouth and invests substantial resources into making sure its sales team meets face-to-face with dealers and retailers to discuss and educate them about TN Warranty's products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When recruiting new authorized retailers, TN Warranty states it makes in-person visits to explain, in detail, who it is, what it does and what it offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty provides training to authorized retailers about its products and TN Warranty's expectations in selling its products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   TN Warranty advertises and markets its products to truck dealers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states its largest marketing investment is in travel for its sales representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additional marketing includes direct emails to authorized retailers, its website and branding and marketing at the annual gathering of the Used Truck Association.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dealers around the country attend this event and not individual truckers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   TN Warranty states it does not market or sell insurance products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. It states that in training new authorized retailers, it emphasizes that it is not selling insurance, but a limited warranty. It does not compete with providers of insurance products and does not market its warranty\n   products through insurance brokers or agents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It contends that neither it, nor its authorized retailers, have encountered TrueNorth in the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty states an authorized retailer has never contacted it inquiring about the association between the two entities. It is unaware of any other entities that market insurance to the end user in the same way that TN Warranty markets its products. The used truck dealers, finance managers or repair companies that TN Warranty works with and that sell its products do not also offer insurance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   TN Warranty works directly with the authorized retailer when one of its products is sold. It invoices the authorized retailer and the authorized retailer pays TN Warranty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The authorized retailer will pay for the cost of the warranty in one lump sum and often for a package of several different warranty products for different trucks at one time. A used truck dealer or finance company may finance the resale cost of the warranty with the price of the truck such that the customer may pay for the warranty through monthly payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. All warranties require an inspection of the truck and TN Warranty's approval. TN Warranty may ask the authorized retailer to provide more information about a truck, such as a photo or a correction in the application prior to issuing a warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Authorized retailers market TN Warranty's product to two classes of customers: large operators who have a fleet of trucks and independent owner/operators. Authorized retailers answer customer questions regarding the warranty options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. TN Warranty states that most customers are interested in coverage, cost and convenience rather than the provider of the warranty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

It states it has invested over $30 million in marketing efforts to strengthen its brand locally and nationally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The history of TN Warranty's mark begins in 2015. Doc. No. 88 at 10. At that time, Carrbridge Berkshire Group, Inc. (Carrbridge) began marketing warranty products through its division Berkshire Fleet Services (Berkshire Fleet). The warranty products themselves were provided by CompassOne Warranty Plans of North America LLC (an offshoot of a family of companies under the umbrella The Compass Group, Inc., founded by William \"Kirk\" Eskridge in 2002).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Eskridge, who was the chief executive of Carrbridge, formed CompassOne Warranty in April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   CompassOne Warranty used the following mark to market its warranty products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty contends that from 2002 through 2012, The Compass Group, Inc. owned and used a Vector Compass mark created by a digital marketing firm hired by Compass Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It states that CompassOne Warranty's graphic was derived from the Vector Compass mark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 30, 2015, American Guardian Warranty Services, Inc. (American Guardian) filed a lawsuit against Carrbridge and Berkshire Fleet claiming that the use of the term \"Compass\" infringed on American Guardian's intellectual property rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   American Guardian claimed it had been using its Compass mark since in or around 2005. Eskridge agreed to change the name and mark and ceased operating CompassOne Warranty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On September 1, 2015, Eskridge formed TN Warranty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It used the same Vector Compass mark as CompassOne to promote its products. It states it chose the name \"Tr\u00fcNorth\" to pay homage to its CompassOne Warranty and Compass Group roots.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It chose to use a dieresis (\u00fc) in its mark to give the brand an international feel, consistent with the company's international aspirations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, TN Warranty began using its \"TR\u00dcNORTH\" mark and compass design (below) sometime in late 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   TN Warranty filed an application to register its mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on February 5, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. On October 31, 2016, TrueNorth filed an opposition to the application. Doc. No. 68 at 5. On December 20, 2016, the USPTO issued a notice of default regarding TN Warranty's application because it failed to answer TrueNorth's opposition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On February 16, 2017, the USPTO entered a judgment by default against TN Warranty, sustaining TrueNorth's opposition and denying TN Warranty's application for a trademark.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. History of Dispute Between Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In September 2015, TrueNorth learned of TN Warranty's mark when Joe Hoovestol of Lone Mountain Leasing in Carter Lake, Iowa, forwarded an email he had received from Rick VanHove, a Regional Sales Director for TN Warranty. Doc. No. 68 at 5. On January 19, 2016, TrueNorth sent a cease and desist letter to Eskridge, TN Warranty's CEO, demanding that TN Warranty stop using the word \"TR\u00dcNORTH\" or the logo stating that it infringed on TrueNorth's marks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August 23, 2016, TrueNorth received an application for insurance from one of its clients in the trucking industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Among the forms submitted with the application included a Component Breakdown Limited Warranty Agreement form for TR\u00dcNORTH\u2122.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TrueNorth ultimately filed this action on March 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After TrueNorth filed suit, TN Warranty attempted to reach a negotiated arrangement but those efforts were not successful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. TN Warranty states that it then voluntarily redesigned its mark as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TN Warranty asserts that it began implementing this design in May 2018. It is displayed on its website (https://www.trunorthwarranty.com) and TN Warranty represents that it is in the process of using this design on all print and online marketing materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   TN Warranty provides additional background concerning a non-party, Gateway Management Services, Ltd., d/b/a Premium 2000+ (Premium 2000+), and its President and Chief Executive Officer, Lynn Murphy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. TN Warranty states that Murphy and Eskridge were business partners at one time but are now rivals and competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It alleges that Murphy (and affiliates) have filed various lawsuits against Eskridge and his affiliates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. With regard to this lawsuit, TN Warranty claims that Premium 2000+ has offered to do business with TrueNorth, but has cited TN Warranty's name and mark as a \"road block\" to doing business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing Doc. No. 85-9 consisting of emails from Premium 2000+'s attorney to counsel for TrueNorth).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 123-1 (excerpts from Murphy's deposition). Essentially, TN Warranty contends that this evidence suggests that TrueNorth's lawsuit is premised more on Murphy's animosity towards Eskridge rather than on true confusion in the marketplace.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   TrueNorth has provided a detailed summary of emails and phone calls\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   it has received from truck drivers and professionals within the trucking and insurance industries that allegedly demonstrate confusion in the marketplace between TN Warranty and TrueNorth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 68 at 6-10. It contends these communications speak for themselves and that Premium 2000+ has nothing to do with TN Warranty's own actions in choosing a mark or the alleged, resulting harm to TrueNorth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 105 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     E. TN Warranty's Expert Disclosures\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   TrueNorth's other motion (Doc. No. 65) concerns TN Warranty's expert, Christopher King. TrueNorth states that with respect to damages, it relies on an unjust enrichment/profit disgorgement theory pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201117\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). TrueNorth alleges that an \"Expert Rebuttal Report on Damages\" authored by King and disclosed by TN Warranty reveals that much of the information King relied upon to form his opinions was not provided to TrueNorth in discovery and was not included with TN Warranty's expert disclosures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc.

Indeed, the hearing was set for both motions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 106, but time constraints allowed me to hear only arguments as to the motion for preliminary injunction. TN Warranty referenced Murphy's deposition during its argument. I will consider the Murphy deposition excerpts to the extent they are relevant to either motion. TrueNorth's motion (Doc.

Doc. No. 127. TrueNorth resists but acknowledges that - despite numerous representations to the contrary - no such letter was sent. Doc. No. 128. Having reviewed the parties' filings,\n   I have no doubt that TrueNorth's prior representations were wrong, but not intentionally so. It is clear that the purported second letter, supposedly sent on September 13, 2016, was actually sent to a different entity that was allegedly using TrueNorth's mark.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 128 at 1, \u00b6 3. Because this error was not discovered and brought to TN Warranty's attention until after the injunction hearing, I will grant TN Warranty's motion (Doc.

Thus, TrueNorth has to prove TN Warranty's revenues and TN Warranty then has to prove any costs that should be deducted to calculate its profits. Consistent with this statutory allocation of the respective burdens, TrueNorth's expert (Engstrom) has provided revenue opinions based on sales information produced by TN Warranty. Doc. No. 65 at 2, \u00b6 2; Doc. No. 69 at 1-5. Engstrom reached conclusions concerning TN Warranty's gross revenue, deducted claims paid by TN Warranty and arrived at a \"net amount.\" Doc. No. 69 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Pursuant to Section 1117(a), TN Warranty has retained King to provide opinions as to costs or other amounts that should be deducted from TN Warranty's revenues to determine TN Warranty's profits. The problem is that as of its expert disclosure deadline of July 30, 2018, TN Warranty had not even provided its own expert with the financial information he needed to arrive at final opinions. Thus, as King wrote in his report, he had to rely \"on the representations made to me with regard to certain financial information contained in this report.\" Doc. No. 69 at 10, \u00b6 11. Only after TrueNorth filed its motion to exclude did TN Warranty provide King with the actual financial information necessary for him to prepare a final (or \"supplemental,\" as TN Warranty calls it) report. As noted above, TN Warranty has yet to provide this information to TrueNorth, despite the requirements of Rule 26 and the fact that TrueNorth specifically requested such information in October 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 103-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   There is no doubt that TN Warranty violated the expert disclosure requirements of Rule 26(a)(2) by failing to produce the financial information its own expert must rely upon to form opinions\n   concerning \"all elements of cost or deduction claimed\" pursuant to Section 1117(a). In deciding whether sanctions are appropriate, I must consider whether TN Warranty's actions were substantially justified and harmless. They were not substantially justified. TN Warranty's excuse for withholding documents is based on Eskridge's alleged concern that TrueNorth (and particularly its in-house counsel, Rings) would violate the court's protective order by sharing documents with third parties. If counsel for TN Warranty believed Eskridge had a legitimate concern that could be supported with evidence, then TN Warranty could have and should have sought relief from the court long before July 30, 2018. Such relief could have included (a) a motion for further extension of the expert disclosure deadline and (b) a motion to amend the protective order to include additional protections (much like the motion TN Warranty finally filed nearly two months later).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Instead, TN Warranty engaged in extra-judicial self-help, taking it upon itself to decide what information to disclose while holding other evidence hostage in an effort to force TrueNorth to agree to its terms. This conduct is particularly egregious in light of the lack of evidence supporting Eskridge's alleged concern. Eskridge supposedly believed that Rings, a licensed attorney,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   would violate the protective order (and put his career at risk) by leaking highly confidential information to a third party - Premium 2000+. TN Warranty argues that the risk of disclosure by Rings is high because he is on the board of managers and is the corporate secretary for each TrueNorth entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 115 at 5. TN Warranty contends that its refusal to disclose information, and subsequent motion to amend the protective order, was precipitated by concerns that TrueNorth was in discussions with Premium 2000+, TN Warranty's competitor and business rival. TN Warranty cites portions of Murphy's deposition on October 4, 2018, in which Murphy described meetings between Premium 2000+ and TrueNorth during which TN Warranty was a topic of conversation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Excerpts from that deposition also reveal Murphy's animosity towards Eskridge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   None of this supports TN Warranty's purely-speculative concern that Rings might violate the existing protective order. Nor does it justify TN Warranty's intentional disregard of this court's scheduling order and brazen, dilatory conduct. TN Warranty and its counsel exercised incredibly poor judgment in electing to violate the scheduling order and disregard TN Warranty's expert disclosure obligations without even attempting to obtain relief from the court. TN Warranty's non-compliance was not substantially justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Nor was it harmless. As TrueNorth points out, its rebuttal expert disclosure deadline was August 31, 2018. Given that TN Warranty did not produce the actual financial information it apparently relies upon to support the amount of \"all elements of cost or deduction claimed\" pursuant to Section 1117(a), TrueNorth's expert could not possibly have studied the necessary data and provided rebuttal opinions by that date (or, for that matter, by today's date). The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   factor that weighs in TN Warranty's favor here is that trial is not scheduled to begin until July 2019 - seven months from now. Thus, ample time remains to cure the harm TN Warranty has caused. This will begin with TN Warranty's\n   almost-immediate production of King's \"supplemental\" expert report, along with all of the information required by Rule 26(b) with regard to that report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Thus, I find that TN Warranty's failure to disclose the financial information necessary to evaluate \"all elements of cost or deduction claimed\" pursuant to Section 1117(a) was neither substantially justified nor harmless. As such, its conduct is sanctionable. While this finding would permit exclusion of all or part of King's testimony at trial, I have discretion to impose other sanctions \"[i]n addition to or instead of this sanction.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). One alternative sanction is an order directing \"payment of the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)(A). I find this remedy, along with adjustments to the scheduling order as set forth below, to be appropriate to address TN Warranty's non-compliance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.
