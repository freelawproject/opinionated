CCE Specialties, LLC (\"CCE\"), Ixel R. Morales (\"Morales\"), and Keren Torres (\"Torres\"), for violations of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), breach of contract and conversion. (Pls.' Am. Compl.) (Doc. 7.) Plaintiffs settled their claims with defendant CCE, who appeared in this matter and agreed to pay all of the plaintiffs' alleged, \"actual\" damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Approving Settlement, July 17, 2017 (Doc. 42). Plaintiffs now seek liquidated damages under the FLSA against the defaulting defendants CCS, Morales and Torres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiff's motion for default judgment (Doc. 43), which seeks $ 44,749.74 in liquidated, FLSA damages, was referred to Magistrate Judge Anderson for a hearing and entry of a Report and Recommendation (\"Report\"). Judge Anderson filed his Report on August 11, 2017, recommending that the plaintiffs be awarded $ 39,096.25 in liquidated damages-$ 5,653.49 less than the plaintiffs requested. (Doc. 48.) Eight of the plaintiffs objected to Judge Anderson's Report, claiming that he improperly calculated a portion of their overtime wages. (Doc. 49.) Their objection is now before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Distilled to its essence, plaintiffs argue that Judge Anderson erred by using the minimum wage as opposed to their contracted rates of pay when calculating their overtime wages for the weeks they were paid nothing by their employers. For the reasons set forth below, plaintiffs are correct and their objection must be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The FLSA \"generally requires employers to compensate employees at the overtime rate for all work performed over 40 hours per week.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Roy v.

They are right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FLSA establishes a statutorily mandated floor, below which an employer's conduct cannot fall. But the FLSA does not preclude the parties from bargaining for hourly wages above the minimum wage. Here, the employees negotiated their hourly rate and were, in fact, paid their contracted wage for several weeks. Their employers cannot unilaterally reset the plaintiffs' regular rate of pay from the contracted hourly rate to the federally-mandated minimum wage by simply refusing to pay them. To hold otherwise would deprive the plaintiffs of the benefit of their\n   bargain and reward employers for violating the FLSA. The FLSA does not contemplate such a perverse result; and therefore, the established, contracted hourly rate should have been used instead of the minimum wage in calculating the plaintiffs' overtime for the weeks they were not paid by their employers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, and for good cause,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that plaintiffs' objection (Doc. 49) to the Magistrate Judge's Report is\n   <strong>\n    SUSTAINED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   It is hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the factual findings of the Report (Doc. 48) are\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED,\n   </strong>\n   and the legal conclusions are\n   <strong>\n    ADOPTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   as modified by this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that final judgment will be entered against CCS, Morales, and Torres in the amount of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     $ 44,749.74\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that within fourteen (14) days of the date of this Order, plaintiffs' counsel may file a motion requesting additional attorneys' fees and costs for their efforts in obtaining default judgment against defendants CCS, Morales and Torres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Clerk is directed to provide a copy of this Order to all counsel of record, and to place this matter among the ended causes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   John F.

Service of the first complaint was not completed on CCS, Morales, or Torres. On March 30, 2017, the District Judge entered a Scheduling Order directing plaintiffs to serve all defendants that had not been served before April 12, 2017. (Docket no. 10). The Scheduling Order also directed cross-claimant to serve all cross-defendants by April 12, 2017, and further ordered all parties required to file a responsive pleading to do so within ten days of being served.

(Docket no. 7) (\"Am. Compl.\"). Specifically, the amended complaint alleges that defendants failed to pay plaintiffs minimum and overtime wages as required by the FLSA. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2). Plaintiffs also assert claims for breach of contract against CCS (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 165-69), and a claim of conversion against CCS and Morales (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 170-71). CCE filed an answer to the amended complaint on April 5, 2017. (Docket no. 15). During May and June 2017, plaintiffs and CCE engaged in discovery, and filed a joint motion to approve their settlement agreement on June 30, 2017 (Docket no. 36), which the court adopted on July 17, 2017 (Docket no. 42).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the settlement agreement, CCE agreed to settle plaintiffs' claims against it for $ 57,455.83 in compensatory damages, plus $ 35,400 for attorney's fees and costs.

This return indicated on April 5, 2017 at 5750 General Washington Drive, Alexandria, Virginia 22312, Torres and Morales were served personally, and that CCS was served through personal service on Morales, its registered agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Pursuant to the Scheduling Order (Docket no. 10), CCS, Torres, and Morales were to file responsive pleadings by April 17, 2017, ten days after service of process. CCS, Torres, and Morales have failed to file a responsive pleading, and the time for doing so has expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 1, 2017, plaintiffs requested entry of default against defendants (Docket no. 20), which the Clerk of Court entered on May 2, 2017 (Docket no. 21). In the Order granting plaintiffs' and CCE's proposed settlement agreement, the District Judge directed plaintiffs to file a motion for default judgment and memorandum in support by July 28, 2017. (Docket no. 42 at 8). On July 28, 2017, plaintiffs filed the motion for default judgment and incorporated memorandum in support (Docket no. 43), and notice setting the hearing on the motion before the undersigned on Friday, August 11, 2017 (Docket no. 44).

(Docket no. 7). Plaintiffs are adult residents of Virginia and Maryland. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 6). Defendant CCS is a Virginia limited liability company with its registered office at 6300 Lincolnia Road in Alexandria, Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 7). At all times relevant to this action, CCS was an enterprise within the meaning of the FLSA; had an annual gross income volume of business of over $ 500,000; and had employees who were engaged in commerce or handle, sell, or otherwise work on goods or materials that have moved in or were produced in commerce. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 156). Defendants Morales and Torres are both adult residents of Fairfax County, Virginia. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9). Morales is a member and manager of CCS, and he approved plaintiffs as employees, arranged their work, determined their rate of pay, and paid them for their work. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 24). Torres is Morales' wife and an employee of CCS. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9). As an employee of CCS, Torres distributed payments to plaintiffs and kept records of the payments made. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At all times relevant, defendants were plaintiffs' employers for the purposes of the FLSA. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 156).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   CCE is a construction company that worked on the development of a luxury apartment building located at 1720 S. Eads Street in Arlington, Virginia (\"the Project\"). (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15). Plaintiffs allege that CCE hired CCS to act as a staffing agency and provide construction workers for the Project. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 15). Pursuant to this agreement, CCS selected and hired all of the plaintiffs to work at the Project's construction site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). CCS, through Morales, agreed to pay plaintiffs at an hourly rate, irrespective of the cost, success, or failure of the project. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 28). Morales determined the rate of pay for each plaintiff at the time that individual was hired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Under CCE's proposed work schedule, plaintiffs were required to work from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 26). Despite working approximately fifty-eight hours each week, plaintiffs allege that they were never paid the FLSA overtime rate of one and one half times their regular rate of pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs further allege that there were also occasions in which they were not paid for their regular hours worked. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32). Plaintiffs' amended complaint details the unpaid wages applicable to each plaintiff, and claims that these failures to fully compensate plaintiffs occurred from February 2016 through August 2016. (Am. Compl. at 13-28). Plaintiffs allege that defendants willfully violated the FLSA in failing to provide them full compensation for the work they performed. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   CCS, through Morales and Torres, typically paid plaintiffs in cash. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 29). Without plaintiffs' consent, Morales and Torres withheld 2% of each payment to cover the cost of \"cashing the check.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).When plaintiffs requested to be paid by check to avoid this charge, Morales refused, sometimes while displaying a firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs also allege that they had to go to either Morales' home or auto body shop, both located in Alexandria, to receive their payments. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 30). Torres regularly distributed payment to plaintiffs and recorded the payments she disbursed. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 31). Plaintiffs believe that Torres is the only individual with records of payments made by CCS to its employees and was the sole individual responsible for calculating the pay to be distributed to each employee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs also allege that they were often forced to wait hours to receive payment, after which defendants would give various reasons explaining why they could not be paid at that time. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 34). When plaintiffs complained or demanded full payment, Morales subjected them to verbal abuse and harassment, occasionally brandishing his handgun. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proposed Findings and Recommendations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 55 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for the entry of a default judgment when \"a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend.\" Fed.

During all relevant times, Morales was a member and manager of CCS and was in charge of approving plaintiffs as employees, arranging their work, determining the appropriate rate of pay for each individual plaintiff, and paying the plaintiffs. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 8). Morales also allegedly threatened plaintiffs when they complained about defendants' failure to pay them for all hours worked. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 38). At all relevant times, Torres was also an employee of CCS and was responsible for distributing payments to the plaintiffs. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 9). Torres kept records of all payments made, and plaintiffs believe she is the only individual with CCS's employment payment records, so is the individual responsible for calculating the pay distributed to each employee.

Mr. Alarcon alleges that for his sixteen hours of overtime work for these six weeks, he should have been paid at a rate of $ 27 ($ 18 x 1.5) per hour to compensate for the FLSA overtime provision, but was instead only paid at his regular hourly rate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The difference in payment of Mr. Alarcon's regular hourly rate and overtime payment is $ 9 per hour, so he correctly claims to have been underpaid by $ 144 ($ 9 x 16) for each of these six weeks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the total amount of overtime payment due to Mr. Alarcon from May 16 through June 27, 2016 is\n   <strong>\n    $ 864\n   </strong>\n   ($ 144 x 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From June 27 through July 2, 2016, Mr. Alarcon claims to have worked a total of\n   fifty-six hours for which he received no payment.

In the amended complaint and Mr. Alarcon's interrogatory responses, he claims he is owed his contracted rate of $ 18 per hour for the forty hours of regular work and $ 27 per hour for the sixteen hours of overtime, totaling $ 1,152, for this period. (Docket no. 43, Ex. G). However, federal law provides a minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C), which plaintiffs concede in their motion for default judgment (Docket nos. 43 at 8; 43, Ex. T). Thus, for each regular business hour worked, Mr. Alarcon is entitled to payment at the rate of $ 7.25 per hour, totaling $ 290 ($ 7.25 x 40). The FLSA also requires employers to provide overtime compensation at one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for every hour worked in excess of forty hours per week.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

So, for these sixteen hours of overtime worked, Mr. Alarcon seeks an award of $ 432 ($ 18(1.5) x 16).

Accordingly, Mr. Alarcon is entitled to $ 290 in regular wages, and $ 174 in overtime compensation ($ 7.25(1.5) x 16).

At the hearing on the motion for default judgment, plaintiffs' counsel confirmed that CCS is a limited liability company, not a corporation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    Not only has the ten-day period set in the Scheduling Order expired, the customary twenty-one day period to file a response has expired as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    The amended complaint also states a claim for breach of contract and conversion.

(Docket no. 43 at 8). Having reviewed this issue more closely since that report was prepared in 2009, the undersigned believes that the appropriate manner for the calculation of overtime in a week in which no payment was made is 1.5 times the minimum wage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    In Ms. Barriantos' interrogatory responses, she claims that she worked a total of 156 hours without receiving pay, comprised of 120 hours of regular work and 46 overtime hours. (Docket no. 43, Ex. F \u00b6 4). Based on Ms. Barriantos' representation, it appears that she worked for a total of 166 hours without receiving pay, not 156 hours.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Exhibit T to Docket no. 43 indicates that Ms. Bonilla worked 104 overtime hours instead.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6 96). This motion for default judgment seeks an award of \"unpaid liquidated damages\" to Mr. Flores in the amount of $ 717.44. (Docket no. 43 at 9). The above summary is based only on Mr. Flores' answers to the interrogatories. (Docket no. 43, Ex.

This motion for default judgment seeks an award of \"unpaid liquidated damages\" to Mr. Martinez in the amount of $ 714.14. (Docket no. 43 at 9).
