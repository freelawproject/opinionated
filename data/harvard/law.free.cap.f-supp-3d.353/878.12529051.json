Doc. 1. THC and Bonar move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Doc. 17. The United States moves to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Doc. 21. The motions are fully briefed, and no party has requested oral argument. For the reasons that follow, the Court will substitute the United States as a Defendant in place of THC and Bonar on four claims, grant THC and Bonar's motion to dismiss the other claims against them, and deny the United States' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

During his employment, Plaintiff made complaints regarding inappropriate expenditures of hospital money and inadequate medical care offered to tribal members. Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12-14. After reports surfaced about problems with care and corruption, THC placed Plaintiff on administrative leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.

Doc. 24, \u00b6 3 (\"the Parties stipulate that ... the United States is the sole and proper party for the allegations raised in Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6.\"). This appears to be a valid stipulation. Federal regulations explain that \"no claim may be filed against a self-determination contractor or employee based upon performance of non-medical-related functions under a self-determination contract. Claims of this type must be filed against the United States under the FTCA.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20900.204\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 900.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of this stipulation, THC and Bonar will be dismissed as Defendants in claims 1, 2, 3, and 6, and these claims will proceed solely against the United States. In the remainder of this order, the Court will address these claims as being asserted against the United States, properly substituted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Jurisdiction for Employment-Related Claims.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The United States argues that the FTCA excludes coverage for employment-related claims between tribal employers and their employees. Doc. 21 at 6. Without identifying specific claims, the United States appears to argue that all of Plaintiff's employment-related claims are actually breach of contract claims excluded from coverage by the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The FTCA does not cover claims for breach of contract.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20900.183\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 900.183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

By stipulating to substitute itself as the sole defendant in claims 1, 2, 3, and 6, the United States seems to concede that those claims are covered by the FTCA, which would mean they are not breach of contract claims. And, consistent with this position, the United States has not sought to substitute for THC and Bonar on claim 4, which asserts a breach of contractual covenant claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21 at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its reply brief, the United States cites\n   <em>\n    Pink v.

But\n   <em>\n    Pink\n   </em>\n   contains very little discussion of this issue. It states only that \"Pink's proposed amendment to substitute the United States would have been futile because Congress did not waive sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684752\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1185/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684752\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1185/\">\n    at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, by contrast, the government has\n   <em>\n    stipulated\n   </em>\n   to be substituted for the individual Defendants on claims 1, 2, 3, and 6. Doc. 24. And the other grounds for dismissal of the plaintiff's claims in\n   <em>\n    Pink\n   </em>\n   have not been asserted by the government in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684752\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1185/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684752\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/1185/\">\n    at 1188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The government also cites\n   <em>\n    Locklear v.

Ariz. Apr. 5, 2013), in its reply brief. Like\n   <em>\n    Pink\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Locklear\n   </em>\n   addressed employment-related claims brought against a tribe and various employees of tribal entities. The United States was not named as a Defendant in that case and did not substitute for any defendant.\n   <em>\n    Locklear\n   </em>\n   addressed the plaintiff's various arguments that the tribal defendants could be sued in federal court, and found none of them correct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-4. The court did not consider whether it could exercise jurisdiction over claims brought against the United States under the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government also argues in its reply brief that any employment-related claims, whether asserted as torts or breach of contract, must be brought in tribal court. Doc. 32 at 3-5. The government seems to suggest that FTCA liability for actions of employees of tribal self-determination entities is limited under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450f(c) (now found at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205321\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ) to claims arising out of the provision of medical care, and, because Plaintiff's claims do not stem from the provision of medical services, those claims are not covered by the FTCA and cannot be asserted in this case. Doc. 32 at 5. The Court has three problems with this argument. First, it was not asserted in the United States' motion to dismiss, and the Court will not consider an argument made for the first time in a reply brief. Second, it appears to be inconsistent with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20900.204\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 900.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides that claims \"based upon performance of non-medical-related functions under a self-determination contract ... must be filed against the United States under FTCA.\" Third, it is inconsistent with the government's substitution for THC and Bonar.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court will not dismiss the claims at this point on the basis of these arguments, but does not preclude the government from reasserting them at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Exhaustion and Plaintiff's IIED Claim.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The United States argues that Plaintiff's claim for IIED should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he failed to describe the injury sufficiently in his administrative claim to the BIA.

THC and Bonar have produced evidence that THC is a tribal organization operating under a 638 self-determination contract. Plaintiff agrees that THC operates under such a contract. Although Plaintiff argues that THC's 638 contract participation makes it a private corporation, incorporated under Arizona law, he points to no case law or evidence to support this assertion. In light of the law on 638 contracts, and absent additional information controverting THC and Bonar's evidence, it appears that THC is a tribal organization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
