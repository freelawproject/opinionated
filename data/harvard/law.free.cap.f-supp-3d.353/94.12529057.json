Petitioner, who is currently not in state custody, claims that his sentence of lifetime probation violates the state statutes of conviction and several of his constitutional rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before this Court are petitioner's motion for summary judgment and respondent's motion to dismiss the habeas petition as time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March, 1999, Hugal pled guilty to a four-count indictment in Norfolk Superior Court which charged him with assault with intent to murder, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, assault by means of a dangerous weapon and mayhem. That same day, the Superior Court sentenced him to seven to nine years in state prison for the charge related to armed assault with intent to murder and to lifetime probation with respect to the other three charges. In June, 2004, petitioner was released from state custody after receiving credits for previous jail time and he commenced his term of lifetime probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2006, petitioner's probation was transferred to Florida at his request. In July, 2008, petitioner filed a motion to modify the terms of his probation which was denied. In September, 2009, he filed another motion to modify the terms of his probation and in April, 2010, he filed a motion to leave the United States. The court did not rule on either of those motions. In June, 2011, petitioner filed motions to terminate and modify his probation which were denied. In November, 2014, he filed another motion to terminate his probation which the Superior Court denied in March, 2015. Thereafter, Hugal filed an appeal to the Massachusetts Appeals Court which affirmed the order denying the motion to modify or terminate probation in February, 2016. He then filed an application for leave to obtain further appellate review which was denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October, 2016, petitioner filed a motion to correct illegal sentence. The Superior Court denied that motion in December, 2016. Hugal appealed and the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the denial of that motion in November, 2017. In February, 2018, the Massachusetts\n   Supreme Judicial Court again denied petitioner's application for leave to obtain further appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In March, 2018, Hugal filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that petition, he alleges that his term of lifetime probation is an illegal sentence because 1) none of the charges for which he was convicted carry a life sentence and 2) it violates his due process rights, his right to interstate travel and his right to be free from double jeopardy. In May, 2018, petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment. A few weeks later, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that petitioner's claim was time-barred because it was not filed within the one-year statute of limitations under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\"AEDPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Application of the equitable tolling doctrine is justified only in rare occasions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riva\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ficco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710898\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/35/#p39\">\n    615 F.3d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (1st Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Even assuming that a petitioner can challenge his sentence of probation after he has been released from state custody, Hugal did not timely file his habeas petition. He entered a plea of guilty in March, 1999. Respondent submits that there is a split among the courts in this District with respect to whether the judgment of conviction becomes final immediately upon entry of the guilty plea or 30 days thereafter pursuant to Mass. App. R. 4(b). Even if the Court were to conclude that the limitations period begins to run after the 30-day period for a notice of appeal, however, Hugal's habeas petition would still be untimely. At the latest, the one-year limitation period expired in April, 2000. Hugal did not file his habeas petition until nearly 18 years later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Furthermore, the filing of motions by petitioner to modify and/or terminate his probation in 2008 and thereafter does not extend the one-year limitations period. Even if those motions qualified as properly filed applications for state post-conviction relief or other collateral review pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(2), they were not filed within the one-year limitations period and thus do not toll the period for the filing of a habeas petition nor do they reset the limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, petitioner has provided no factual basis for concluding that he is entitled to equitable tolling. Hugal did not pursue his rights diligently, as evidenced by the fact that his first filing related to his probation was made over nine years after his date of conviction. Hugal also does not identify any extraordinary circumstances that would have prevented him from filing his habeas petition timely. He suggests in his petition that he \"was heavily medicated on strong psychiatric drugs and was incapacitated\" but that claim is too vague to satisfy petitioner's heavy burden of proving extraordinary circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710898\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/35/#p39\">\n    615 F.3d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Mental illness does not per se toll the AEDPA limitations period ... [but rather] [t]here must be some causal link between a petitioner's mental illness and his ability seasonably to file for habeas relief.\"). Moreover, petitioner's claim of incapacitation is contradicted by the statements in his July, 2008, motion to modify his probation in which he asserted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [h]is mental health is stable and has been improving since his arrest and introduction to medication over twelve years ago ... [and thus he should be permitted] to travel and possibly work in Europe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioner also contends that he was \"indigent and had to learn the law\". Ignorance of the law, even for incarcerated\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   prisoners, is not an excuse for untimely filing.\n   <em>\n    Lattimore\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dubois\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9300765\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/311/46/#p55\">\n    311 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (1st Cir. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Hugal's petition for writ of habeas corpus\n   is time-barred pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A) and therefore that petition will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1) respondent's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 18) is\n   <strong>\n    ALLOWED\n   </strong>\n   and the petition for writ of habeas corpus is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2) petitioner's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 13) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    So ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    While neither party raises the issue of whether a person not in state custody can file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2254, the Court assumes, for present purposes, that a person released on probation can do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
