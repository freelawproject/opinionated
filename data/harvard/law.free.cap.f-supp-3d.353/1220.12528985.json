Doc. 26-1 at 48-50. Zhou's work consisted primarily of programming at the user interface level or \"client tier\" for a 3D software product called SmartPlant 3D (\"S3D\"). Docs. 26-3 at 20; 26-6 at 43-44. However, Zhou also studied the middle level coding language of C++ in school, and was learning the lower level code of WPF prior to her discharge. Doc. 26-1 at 81-82. While at Intergraph, Zhou worked on one particular project that involved coding on multiple \"tiers\" and received positive feedback from her supervisor Steve Herold and the client. Doc. 26-1 at 161-63. Zhou also received positive annual performance reviews that she was either \"meeting\" or \"exceeding\" expectations from her supervisors Lester Lynd (2011 - 2014) and Herold (2014 - 2017). Docs. 26-1 at 60, 62, 67, 83, 89; 26-6 at 13, 40. In these reviews, Lynd and Herold encouraged\n   Zhou to continue developing her skills and to \"focus on learning about the middle tier components\" of the S3D product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 26-1 at 141, 154, 172, 192; 26-2 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Harassing Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After becoming Zhou's immediate supervisor, Herold met with Zhou in December 2014, during which he told Zhou that he had power, that he knew how much people on his team made, that he had the right to put people \"in their bracket,\" and that he had the power to pick who to add to \"the layoff list.\" Doc. 26-1 at 116, 126-27. Herold added that if Zhou did not \"do what he said,\" he would add her to this \"layoff list.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116. Herold then made these same threats to Zhou in another conversation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126. It is unclear what specific actions Herold asked Zhou to undertake, but Zhou did not interpret Herold's demands as sexual in nature and she acknowledges they could have been work-related.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Zhou complained to Lynd (Herold's supervisor) about Herold's threats on at least two occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 241. Zhou asked Lynd if she could transfer to another group,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 116-17, in one or perhaps both of these conversations. When Lynd asked why, Zhou relayed her conversation with Herold and expressed her concern that Herold was threatening her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27. Lynd told Zhou that \"[Herold] would not say that,\" that there was no \"layoff list,\" and that Herold would not retaliate against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126-27, 117, 122. After this conversation, Lynd told Herold that Zhou had complained to him about Herold's \"layoff list\" comments. Doc. 26-6 at 65. Subsequently, Herold had a follow-up conversation with Zhou, the details of which are unclear. Doc. 26-1 at 123. Zhou decided not to pursue her transfer request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the course of the next three-to-four years, Herold engaged in various conduct that made Zhou uncomfortable and that she interpreted as sexual overtures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174, 240-41. For example, Herold repeatedly (less than ten times) told Zhou at various times that his wife was out of town, that he was a bachelor, and that he was \"free.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-46. Additionally, on multiple occasions, Herold told Zhou that she dressed \"very nice,\" a comment which Lynd also repeatedly made to Zhou.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 233-234. On two occasions, once while alone and a second time when others were present, Herold told Zhou that a female employee had seduced him by sitting next to him in his office and touching her leg against his, and that he had an affair with this employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 233, 237-38. Once, when Herold was using his phone to show Zhou photos of his grandchild, Herold displayed a photo of his daughter breastfeeding with her chest exposed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150-52. Then, Herold told Zhou that he had found a \"bloody picture\" of his wife delivering a child and tried to show her that picture as well, but Zhou turned away.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 153-54. Finally, in March 2016, Herold visited Zhou at her home one Sunday afternoon to give her a casserole while she was recovering from a car accident and while her husband was out of town.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168-73. Herold stayed for a few minutes, made no inappropriate comments, and then left.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-74. However, Herold apparently pressured Zhou into allowing him to eat dinner with her and only left when Zhou invited her daughter to meet him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With the exception of the \"layoff list\" conversation she reported to Lynd, Zhou did not report any of Herold's behavior to anyone at Intergraph prior to her termination, and also did not report Lynd's comments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 245.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Zhou acknowledges\n   that she had reviewed and was familiar with Intergraph's anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   26-1 at 53-56, 128-29, 132-33; 26-4; 26-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Graffiti Incident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 20 or 21, 2016, a co-worker, Luther Walke, told Zhou about graffiti in a men's restroom that referred to Zhou and three other employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92-94. The graffiti said \"Asian Sluts\" above a list of four names that included Zhou's first name, Susan, and the first names \"Nancy,\" \"Joseph,\" and \"Luther,\" with lines connecting the two females to the males.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95-97; doc. 26-8. Both Zhou and Jennifer Kaplan, the vice president of human resources, believed that \"Nancy\" in the graffiti referred to Nancy Ma, a Chinese employee, and that the males referenced were Joseph Harrison and Luther Walke, neither of whom are of Asian descent. Docs. 26-1 at 92-97; 26-7 at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon learning about the graffiti, Denise Bates, the facilities manager, temporarily taped chart paper over the graffiti and later ripped out the wallpaper. Doc. 26-7 at 18-19. Bates also called the police, and either Bates or Kaplan filed a police report. Docs. 26-7 at 18; 26-1 at 100. Subsequently, Bates provided Kaplan with employee badge access information to review, and told Kaplan that she had reviewed this information herself. Doc. 26-7 at 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Kaplan and Walke called Zhou to talk about the graffiti, Zhou told Kaplan, \"I don't feel safe to come work, because if we don't find this person, today they put things on the wall, tomorrow they may physically attack me.\" Doc. 26-1 at 92-93, 242. Zhou also told Kaplan that she felt nervous and uncomfortable walking around the parking lot. Doc. 26-7 at 24-25. Ostensibly for the purpose of investigating the incident, Kaplan also asked Zhou who she talked to at the office and Zhou named three men. Doc. 26-1 at 102-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After returning to the office from traveling during the winter holidays, Zhou asked Kaplan for an update. Doc. 26-1 at 108. During this conversation, Kaplan asked Zhou to help her review the badge access information from the date of the incident,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 105-06, and told Zhou that the detective assigned to the case did not have time to work on it,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 108. Zhou then called the assigned detective, who told Zhou that he had called Kaplan three times and left voicemails, that Kaplan never returned his calls, and that he had dismissed the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As for the investigation, although Kaplan reviewed the badge access information, she did not interview any employees. Doc. 26-7 at 22. Also, perhaps because there were no security cameras installed outside the bathroom or because she did not believe\n   such a review would prove useful, Kaplan did not review any of the footage from other cameras installed around the building. Doc. 26-7 at 23, 27. Ultimately, Intergraph did not identify the person(s) responsible for the graffiti.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Transfer Interview\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   About a month after the graffiti incident, Lynd's manager, Bucky Howell, suggested to Lynd that Zhou should interview for a position with the \"BIM\" team. Doc. 26-3 at 20. Lynd then spoke to Herold about the \"BIM\" position based on Lynd's contention that he wanted Zhou to interview for the \"BIM\" team because Zhou was \"more of a user interface programmer,\" and the type of work that she was doing on her S3D core team \"had exhausted mostly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21. As for Herold, he claims that he supported Lynd's suggestion because Zhou lacked \"good skills doing lower level tasks\" and \"she was the lowest performing member of [his] team.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Subsequently, Herold told Zhou that Intergraph had chosen her to interview for a position on the \"BIM\" team. Doc. 26-1 at 178-80. Zhou asked if the directive to interview for this transfer (which could have been local or to France) was related to the graffiti incident, stating that, \"I'm the victim. I shouldn't get transferred, I should get protected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178. Herold responded that she had to interview. Later, Zhou asked Lynd the same question and stated, \"I'm the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 205. Lynd denied that the incident factored in the decision, stated that Zhou was doing a good job, and that he wanted her \"skill to help other team [sic] as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, the \"BIM\" team did not select Zhou for the vacancy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Zhou's Termination\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A few weeks later, on February 7, 2017, Intergraph discharged Zhou due purportedly to a reduction in force dictated by economics. Doc. 26-3 at 34. In response, Zhou informed Lynd and Tara Argraves, a Human Resources employee, for the first time about Herold's alleged sexual harassment, including Herold's visit to her home, the photos of breastfeeding and childbirth, and the comments about his wife being out of town and about being seduced by an employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29, 35-36; doc. 26-1 at 131. When Lynd asked Zhou why she had not reported this conduct prior to her termination, Zhou cited Herold's age and her desire not to hurt him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As for the termination, Intergraph maintains that the President and CFO of its parent company, Hexagon, decided to reduce the workforce based on the economic outlook of the oil and gas sector. Doc. 26-7 at 28. According to Intergraph, when Howell informed Lynd that the S3D organization needed to decrease its resources, Lynd selected Zhou for discharge because her skills were no longer compatible with her team. Doc. 26-3 at 12, 24. Allegedly, Zhou's lack of skills was \"an ongoing issue\" that stretched back to when Lynd supervised Zhou.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lynd maintains that he chose Zhou for discharge without any input from Herold. Doc. 26-3 at 41. However, Lynd acknowledges also that he and Herold had regular conversations in which they ranked the performance of the employees on Herold's team.

Doc. 31 at 29.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record, when viewed in the light most favorable to Zhou, supports Zhou's cat's paw theory. It is undisputed that Lynd last directly supervised Zhou in 2014-three years before the discharge. Thus, an issue of fact exists regarding whether Lynd had current and independent knowledge of Zhou's abilities and skills. Indeed, Lynd admits that he had regular conversations with Herold in which they discussed and ranked employees' performances. In other words, Lynd was likely aware of Herold's opinion that Zhou was \"the lowest performing member of [Herold's] team,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   doc. 26-6 at 18, 25, 43, when he made the discharge decision. These conversations occurred as recently as a few weeks before the termination, when Herold shared his assessment about Zhou's abilities as part of the discussion on whether Lynd should suggest that Zhou apply for a transfer. A few weeks later, Lynd allegedly decided to discharge Zhou for that same reason, which suggests that Herold's opinions about Zhou that he regularly shared with Lynd influenced Lynd's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docs. 26-3 at 11-12, 19-21; 26-6 at 43-44. Thus, in light of the evidence that Lynd relied on Herold's characterization of Zhou's skills when he decided to discharge her, coupled with Herold's threats to Zhou about his power over the layoff list, the court cannot find as a matter of law that Herold had no involvement in the discharge decision. The\n   court finds instead that, when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to Zhou, a genuine issue of material facts exists regarding whether Zhou's refusal to submit to Herold's advances resulted in the tangible employment action. For these reasons, summary judgment on Zhou's sexual harassment claim is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Harassment Based on Race and National Origin\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the \"Asian sluts\" graffiti incident, Zhou also contends that Intergraph subjected her to harassment based on her race and national origin as a person who was born in China and is of Chinese descent.

Viewed in the light most favorable to Zhou, the record contains sufficient evidence of pretext. As an initial matter, the close temporal proximity of one month between Zhou's complaint to Lynd and her discharge is evidence of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurlbert v.

Moreover, Zhou has also presented evidence that Herold, Zhou's alleged sexual harasser, influenced Lynd's decision to discharge Zhou.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III-A-3. And, if that were not enough to raise a genuine dispute, Zhou can also point to evidence that she was a competent, if not commendable, programmer. Over the course of her employment, there is no documentary evidence that Zhou received any complaint or negative report concerning her performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wascura v. City of South Miami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088567\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/1238/#p1245\">\n    257 F.3d 1238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1245 (11th Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he lack of complaints or disciplinary reports in an employee's personnel file may support a finding of pretext\"). Indeed, Zhou's annual performance reviews from 2012 through 2016 consistently note that she \"meets expectations\" and, in four of the reviews, that she \"exceed[ed] expectations\" for the categories of \"Teamwork\" or \"Customer Impact/Value Added.\" Doc. 26-1 at 141-42, 154-57, 172-74, 192-94; 26-2 at 17-19. And, although Intergraph claims that it discharged Zhou because her \"skill set was no longer compatible\" with her team, doc. 25 at 13, Zhou's performance reviews seem to directly rebut that assertion. For instance, in Zhou's November 2016 review, completed only four months before her discharge, the comments under the category \"Job Knowledge/Skills/Capabilities\" state that Zhou is \"a solid developer\" with \"a good working knowledge of all the software languages used within the S3D product,\" and \"[s]he is able to leverage her knowledge to achieve positive results on her assigned projects.\" Doc. 26-2 at 17. Earlier reviews of Zhou's job skills also offer similar, positive feedback.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , doc. 26-1 at 154 (\"Susan is very conscientious that her work is of the highest quality which has led to very low rejection rate of her work items.\"), 172, 192. Furthermore, Herold's positive feedback for Zhou's work on two particular projects, one of which involved multiple tiers of coding, further undermines Intergraph's\n   proffered reason for discharging Zhou.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 26-1 at 160-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Taking this evidence into account, a reasonable factfinder could ultimately conclude that Intergraph's proffered reasons were \"unworthy of credence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Furcron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174455\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/1295/#p1310\">\n    843 F.3d at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Furthermore, because Zhou can establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation and can show that Intergraph's proffered reasons for the discharge are pretextual, Intergraph's motion is also due to be denied on her retaliation claim. However, Intergraph's motion is due to be granted as to Zhou's claims for hostile work environment based on race and national origin, sex discrimination, and race and national origin discrimination. The court will enter a separate order consistent with these findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   the 7th day of January, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Zhou contends in her brief that she told Kaplan that she was uncomfortable around Herold.

I testified, 'Jennifer, I feel unsafe after the bathroom incident, and also uncomfortable to Steve Herold.'

However, Zhou clarified subsequently that she never reported Herold's sexual harassment to Lynd or Kaplan and that, when she spoke with Kaplan about an incident involving bathroom graffiti, she did not mention anything about Herold. Doc. 26-1 at 244. Thus, although, \"[a]s a general principle, a plaintiff's testimony cannot be discounted on summary judgment,\" the court discounts Zhou's testimony that she told Kaplan, at some point, \"I feel ... uncomfortable to Steve Herold\" because this testimony is \"blatantly contradicted by the record\" and is \"blatantly inconsistent\" with her other testimony.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Feliciano v.
