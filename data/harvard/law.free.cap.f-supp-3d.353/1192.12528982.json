The Court has considered the evidence, motions, responses, and replies, and is fully informed in the premises. For the following reasons, the Court finds and Orders Plaintiff's Motion for Remand (Doc. 20) is DENIED; John Dugald Mactaggart's Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint (Doc. 11) is GRANTED; Defendants Quentin Morgan and Ewan Meldrum's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 35) is GRANTED as to Defendant Meldrum on personal jurisdiction and for Defendant Morgan on issue preclusion; Defendant Brisbane Angels Group, Ltd's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 13) is GRANTED; Defendants Jontra Holding Pty and Associated Construction Equipment Pty. Ltd's Motion to Quash Service (Doc. 16) is GRANTED; Defendants Simon Ashton, Kinabalu Australia Pty. Ltd., Kinabalu Australia Trust, and ProX Pty. Ltd.'s Motion to Dismiss (Docs. 18) is GRANTED; Plaintiff's Motion to Defer Briefing on Motion for Sanctions (Doc. 30) is GRANTED, and Plaintiff's Motion to File Surreply (Doc. 63) is GRANTED. The Court finds that all claims in this case are DISMISSED based on issue preclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Gas Sensing Technology Corp. (\"GSTC\") brought this action against Defendants for engaging in activities to improperly take over ownership and control of GSTC's subsidiary WellDog Pty. Ltd. (\"WellDog\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and misappropriating GSTC's intellectual property and trade secrets. (Doc. 8 [Amended Compl.] ). The takeover is referred to as the \"Take Over Action\" or \"Take Over Activities\" and those engaged in the Take Over Action are referred to as the \"Take Over Group.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action is the second time Plaintiff has asserted these claims before this Court. See\n   <em>\n    Gas Sensing Tech. Corp. v. Ashton et al.\n   </em>\n   , 16-cv-272-F (\"\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   \"). In that action the Court found that several defendants were not subject to personal jurisdiction in Wyoming, that the claims against other defendants were more properly heard in Australia, rather than this district, and that some claims failed to state a claim because GSTC relied on group pleading, making it impossible to determine the specific allegations against each defendant. Approximately a year after the Court dismissed that lawsuit without prejudice, GSTC refiled its Complaint in this case in state court. Defendants then\n   removed this case to federal court. An Amended Complaint and a flurry of motions followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   GSTC \"is an energy-focused technical services company that has developed its own patented reservoir Raman chemical sensing systems to provide commercial reservoir analysis services for coal, gas, alternative and conventional resources ....\" (Doc. 8 [Amended Compl.] at 8, \u00b6 99). On December 3, 2010, GSTC formed WellDog in Australia as its wholly owned subsidiary with the intent to expand its energy services throughout Australia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103). GSTC then sought private venture equity and debt from experts in the energy industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107). On June 1, 2011, the Ashton Controlled Entity Kinabalu invested private venture equity in GSTC by purchasing shares of stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). Between 2011 and 2014, the Ashton Controlled ProX provided approximately $4,000,000.00 in total venture debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120). In addition, the Linklater and Brisbane Angels also provided private venture equity and debt to GSTC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 125, 128).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the request of Ashton, Defendant Quentin Morgan (\"Morgan\") was hired in 2011 as GSTC's Chief Technology Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131). GSTC claims Morgan became Ashton's agent and used his position to assist the Take Over, violating his duty of loyalty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 135, 136). Defendant Graeme Michael Linklater (\"Linklater\"), was WellDog's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") until April 2016. GSTC claims \"Defendant Linklater used confidential financial and company information acquired while employed by WD Pty and an officer of GSTC to direct and assist the Take Over Group in its Take Over Activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6141).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December of 2012, an international oil and gas exploration and production company approached GSTC about developing a new technology for shale gas exploration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147). To help finance the research and development, \"the international exploration and production company's technology venture capital subsidiary named Shell Technology Ventures (\"INVESTOR\") invested capital in GSTC in exchange for private venture equity with the expectation for further investment upon a successful beta trial of the technology.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148). In May of 2015, GSTC completed a successful beta trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 149). According to GSTC, \"[t]he capital expected to be raised by the second round of INVESTOR equity investment in GSTC would have paid all maturing venture debt owed to Ashton/Ashton Trust, Mactaggart/Jontra/ACE, Brisbane Angels and Linklater/Linklater Trust.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152). GSTC also claims that \"[u]pon receipt of the INVESTOR's equity investment, GSTC would have been able to secure additional private equity and debt investment sufficient to pay in full the private venture debt provided by all Defendants and their respectively controlled entities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 153).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 19, 2014, Defendant Ashton signed the Director Agreement acknowledging his duties as a director of GSTC under Wyoming law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, \u00b6 155). On August 5, 2015, the GSTC Board of Directors adopted Resolution B to become part of the GSTC's By-Laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 162). GSTC claims Ashton has repeatedly violated the Code of Conduct to benefit the Ashton/Ashton Trust to the detriment of GSTC and its shareholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165). GSTC claims that in August of 2015, Ashton began \"attempting to sell Kinabalu's shares of GSTC to INVESTOR in competition with GSTC's efforts to secure additional private venture equity investments from INVESTOR.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 166). On August 14, 2015, GSTC's Chair of the Board of Directors, Dr. John Michael Pope, sent an email to Ashton warning Ashton that if he continued to pursue a transaction with INVESTOR, it would be considered a violation of the Director\n   Agreement and Code of Conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168). Despite this email, Ashton\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   offered to sell and sold to INVESTOR below market value non-statutory shares acquired by his Ashton/Aston Trust through options or warrants ... for a price far in excess of the purchase price of the shares, but at [a] price well below the market price that INVESTOR would have paid GSTC for additional shares.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170). Ashton notified GSTC's Board of Directors of his sale of Kinabalu shares to INVESTOR on November 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 173). GSTC alleges Ashton \"wrongfully converted for his sole benefit, GSTC's business opportunities and deprived GSTC of the business opportunities to sell its shares that would have benefited all shareholders pro rata.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175). Because Ashton converted the INVESTOR capital to his own use and thereby denied GSTC access to the capital, \"Ashton prevented GSTC from having a means to extinguish the Ashton's alter ego ProX debt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 186).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   GSTC also alleges that while Ashton served as the Wyoming Director for GSTC, he devised \"a plan to unlawfully and inequitably divest GSTC of its WD Pty subsidiary and/or assets of WD Pty for their benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 194). GSTC claims this was the plan for the Take Over Action. Mactaggart, Jontra, ACE and Brisbane Angels aided the Take Over Group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196). On August 17, 2015, Mactaggart and Linklater requested GSTC and WellDog to allow them to move their venture capital debt from an obligation to Welldog to GSTC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197). This reorganization of capital left \"ProX as the sole entity providing WD Pty venture capital debt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198). During this time, Ashton also recruited Linklater and Chief Technology Officer Quentin Morgan to help implement the Take Over Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 203).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   GSTC alleges that part of the Take Over Action was to simultaneously foreclose on the Take Over Group's venture debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 212). Thus, on September 1, 2016, ProX issued WellDog an initial notice of default based on the alleged failure to provide it with certain financial information for the months of June and July 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 213-214). GSTC claims it cured the alleged default on September 9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Similarly, Mactaggart also issued a notice of default to GSTC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 226). GSTC claims Mactaggart manufactured defaults were in violation of the debt instruments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 227).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   GSTC claims that in the summer of 2016, the Take Over Group began exposing the Take Over Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 267).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The plan for Simon Ashton through entities he controlled was to take over WD Pty. and for ACE, Jontra, and BA to take over GSTC was secretly articulated in an email from Defendant Ashton, dated September 21, 2016, to Defendant Meldrum, Defendant Morgan, and Defendant Linklater, with a fictitious proposed press release to be issued on October 1, 2016, suggesting that GSTC was surrendering its Australia WD Pty assets to ProX.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). As a result of the Take Over Group's conduct, GSTC claims damages, including the inability to pay out certain debts owed by WD Pty and GSTC, operational constraints due to undercapitalization, the inability to raise additional capital, the inability to realize certain commercial and\n   market opportunities, significantly weakening GSTC's financial condition, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 274-280). GSTC's two lawsuits followed, along with a number of other actions in other courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Currently before the Court are GSTC's Motion to Remand (Doc. 20), Defendant Mactaggart's Motion to Dismiss and for Sanctions (Doc. 11), Defendant Brisbane Angels Group Ltd's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 13), Motion to Dismiss or to Quash filed by Associated Construction Equipment Pty Ltd and Jontra Holdings Pty Ltd (Doc. 18), and Motion to Dismiss and Quash Service by Defendants Ewan Meldrum and Quentin Morgan (Doc. 35). The Court will first consider GSTC's Motion to Remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    GSTC's Motion to Remand\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GSTC filed its Motion to Remand asserting that the Finance Notes between Defendants Jontra, Associated Construction Equipment Pty Ltd, (\"ACE\") and Brisbane Angels Group Ltd (\"BAG\") and GSTC contained a forum selection clause waiving Defendants' right to removal. Alternatively, GSTC claims the Court should exercise its discretion and decline to exercise jurisdiction over this case that contains purely state law claims. Defendants oppose the motion asserting that the language in the Finance Notes does not prohibit waiver in this case and that abstention is inappropriate in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a \"civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Australia does not object to service by mail but requires the service to be by registered mail. GSTC does not dispute that it failed to properly serve Jontra or ACE. For these reasons, the Court finds that under the Hauge Convention, GSTC failed to properly serve Jontra and ACE. As a result, this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over these parties and cannot make any other rulings related to these parties. Jontra and Ace's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 16) is GRANTED and the attempted service on Jontra and Ace is QUASHED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Doc. 35). Defendant Meldrum claims that he was improperly served because the service was attempted by mailing his documents, but not by registered mail. Additionally, Meldrum claims that GSTC failed to comply with the requirement for forwarding documents to the Central Authority. GSTC concedes that it failed to properly obtain service on Meldrum. (Doc. 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For these reasons, the Court agrees that Meldrum was not properly served because he was provided service by regular mail. For this reason, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Meldrum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendant Morgan was personally served, but argues the service was ineffective because none of the documents he received suggested they were received by the Central Authority. In response, GSTC states that the documents were sent to a private process server, who personally served Morgan, but if the Court finds service was defective, then GSTC will re-serve Morgan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   While it appears that the use of the Central Authority is an option for service, service can also be made by any other internationally agreed means for accomplishing service. Under Australia law, personal service is an acceptable means for accomplishing service. Therefore, the Court finds GSTC properly served Defendant Morgan. Therefore, the Court considers Morgan's joinder in Ashton's Motion to Dismiss below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendants Meldrum and Morgan's Motion to Dismiss and Quash Service is GRANTED as to Defendant Meldrum and DENIED as to Defendant Morgan on the issue of service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

BAG argues that while GSTC and WellDog made presentations to BAC for purposes of soliciting loans and investments, those contacts occurred in Australia and any loans or investments were the result of decision, channeled through separate entities. BAG claims it did not loan money to GSTC, it did not own stock in GSTC, and did not contact GSTC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In response, GSTC claims that Brisbane Angels Nominees Pty Ltd, (\"BAN\") is a wholly owned subsidiary of BAG, sharing the same address and same registered agent. GSTC also claims that Mactaggart is the sole director of BAN and BAG and is therefore controlling both. GSTC also cites to the acceptance of jurisdiction in the Finance Notes signed by BAN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \"Companies conducting business through their subsidiaries can qualify as transacting business in a state, provided the parent exercises sufficient control over the subsidiary.\"\n   <em>\n    Pro Axess, Inc. v.

GSTC has failed to provide evidence that BAN is working as the alter ego of BAG. Mactaggarrt appears to be the only director of BAN. (Doc. 40-1 [Ex. 2 - BAN Extract] ). However, GSTC's exhibits show that BAG has numerous directors. (Doc. 40-1 [Ex 3-BAG Extract] ). Therefore, GSTC's assertion that BAG and BAN are both being controlled solely by Mactaggart is without support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   GSTC has failed to allege other facts to assert personal jurisdiction over BAG. Rather, GSTC asserts jurisdiction over BAG, through BAN's contacts, but fails to provide factual support for the argument that BAN was acting as BAG's alter ego.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court finds that BAG's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction (Doc. 13) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The Court disagrees. In considering this matter the Court finds it is telling that GSTC's original state court Complaint in this case was virtually identical to the Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   , including the same causes of action and most of the same factual allegations. Once the case was removed to federal court, GSTC filed an Amended Complaint (Doc. 8). In the Amended Complaint, GSTC removed ProX Pty Ltd as a party, changed some of the causes of action, and included additional language about interfering with GSTC's United States business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   However, GSTC's attempt to claim this is some new and different lawsuit is not convincing. This action is substantially the same as\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   , with the same claims based on the same facts, against most of the same Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   GSTC relies heavily on the fact that Jontra and BAN filed suit in Albany County District Court against the Financing Notes. However, the Court does not view the Albany County civil action seeking to collect on the Financing Notes as significantly altering this case. As the Court previously noted, GSTC has failed to cite to any case suggesting that submitting to specific jurisdiction for a contract action acts as a blanket acceptance of jurisdiction for any other civil action. Additionally, while Jontra and BAN are exercising their rights in Wyoming under the Financing Notes, the Financing Notes were also part of\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   , so this is not a new fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Additionally, GSTC claims the Amended Complaint contains different causes of action against parties over which this Court has jurisdiction. GSTC urges the Court to follow the roadmap laid out in a district court case from the Middle District of Florida,\n   <em>\n    J.C. Renfroe &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Renfroe Japan Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:08CV31J32MCR,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2055010\">\n    2009 WL 55010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (M.D. Fla. Jan. 7, 2009). However, in following the roadmap and comparing the allegations and causes of actions in GSTC's\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint to the\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, the Court finds there is no change in the material facts underlying the Court's prior judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Simply put, the claims in the Amended Complaint in this case arise from GSTC's claims that Ashton and others engaged in self-dealing and collusive efforts to improperly take ownership and control of WellDog, to divert its assets, and cause injury to GSTC. A comparison of the Amended Complaints demonstrates that there are no objective facts that materially alter the considerations underlying the previous resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The similarity of the cases is clear in considering the requested relief. GSTC seeks relief for conversion of a corporate opportunity. This claim was included in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 293-300)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the Third Claim for Relief but was titled tortious interference with contract expectancy. In\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   it can be found in the First Claim for Relief and is now titled Insider Transaction and Conversion of Corporate Opportunity (\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 297-305). The Second Claim for Relief in\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   is GSTC's claim for breach of fiduciary duties. While the language has been changed, it is still the same breach of fiduciary duty claim as the Second Claim for Relief in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 262-287). Both Amended Complaints have a claim for tortious interference with contract as the Fourth Claim for Relief. Both are the same claim, even though the language\n   has also been slightly changed to assert injury to GSTC. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 301-304,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at 338-341). In both Amended Complaints, the Fifth Claim for Relief is for Self Dealing and Unjust Enrichment (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 310-316,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 342-349). Again, the language has been modified to assert allegations related to GSTC's intellectual property, but it is the same claim, based on the same facts. The Sixth Claim for Relief in both Amended Complaints is for Civil Conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 310-316, Ashton II at \u00b6\u00b6 350-355). The Seventh Claim for relief in both cases is for Lender Liability and Breach of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 317-325,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 356-364). In this case, the claim is against Defendant Ashton, through his \"alter ego\" ProX, because GSTC has not included ProX as a party. However, it is the same claim based on the same acts. In both Amended Complaints the Eighth Claim for relief is Misappropriation of Trade Secrets and Resulting Unfair Business Practices and Unfair Competition. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 326-336,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 365-374). These claims involve many of the same factual allegations. The Ninth Claim for relief in both cases is for Declaratory Judgment (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 337-338,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at 375-376). Again, the language has been slightly modified, but it is the same claim based on the same facts. GSTC dropped its claim for temporary and permanent injunction, which was its Tenth Claim for Relief in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I.\n   </em>\n   However, in both cases, the final claim is for Setoff/Off Set of Damages Against Equity and Debt (\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 348-350,\n   <em>\n    Ashton II\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 377-379). For further demonstration of how this case is essentially the same case as\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants have extensively illustrated this point in their reply brief. (Doc. 53-3, 53-4, 53-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Using GSTC's suggested roadmap, the Court finds that GSTC failed to establish \"objective facts that materially alter the considerations underlying the previous resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Villar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518922\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/990/1489/#p1498\">\n    990 F.2d at 1498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, GSTC is asking the Court \"for a rebalancing of forum non conveniens considerations\", after it had a chance to slightly alter its claims to remove what it believed were the major considerations for the Court's earlier ruling. However, the Court has already found that these claims are properly pursued in Australia and that ruling is entitled to issue preclusion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Additionally, GSTC failed to address some of the Court's primary considerations in its prior order, specifically, that GSTC's conspiracy theory rests on the idea that Ashton planned to take control of WellDog and Mactaggart, Jontra, ACE and BAG to take control of GSTC. (\n   <em>\n    Ashton\n   </em>\n   II at \u00b6 199). To achieve the conspiracy, GSTC alleged Defendants, including Ashton and his alter ego ProX\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   planned to foreclose on their venture debt to attain control of WellDog. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6212, 283). The basis of these allegations and claims still rely on ProX's ability to foreclose on the venture debt, an issue that is governed by Australian law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   GSTC's Amended Complaint still asserts claims related to actions against an Australian company (WellDog). GSTC's Amended Complaint does not change the fact that it formed WellDog in Australia, encountered all Defendants-in some capacity-for the benefit of WellDog, an Australian company, and a majority of the events in this case occurred in Australia. While GSTC has attempted to illuminate and highlight the damage done to GSTC in Wyoming and the United States (which is non-specific and does not support keeping the case in this district), these facts do not\n   outweigh the competing facts that led the Court to determine Australia was the appropriate venue in the first instance. The private interest factors still weigh in favor of this case continuing in Australia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Additionally, the public interest factors also weigh in favor of Australia. It remains undisputed that this case is based on a hostile takeover action of WellDog, GSTC's Australian subsidiary. It also remains undisputed that all Defendants reside in Australia and, therefore, a majority of the evidence for GSTC's claims is still located in Australia. In its motion to file a surreply and corresponding surreply, GSTC attempts to argue that this case has local interest because Ashton has sent documents to businesses and bankers in Wyoming. However, the attached email was dated September 18, 2018, after the Amended Complaint in this case, and those allegations are not part of the allegations in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that issue preclusion bars GSTC's attempt to relitigate the issues raised in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, the Court finds that the same factors justifying the Court's earlier dismissal based on forum non conveniens are still present in this case. For these reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss based on issue preclusion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Motion for Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As part of their various motions, Defendants have asked the Court to impose sanctions on GSTC. Rather than responding to the motion for sanctions, GSTC asks the Court to stay any determination of sanctions until the claim of issue preclusion has been determined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court is generally not inclined to impose sanctions when parties are pursuing legitimate, although unsuccessful, trial strategies. However, this case raises unique issues. Specifically, the Court is troubled by the fact that GSTC's original state court complaint (Doc. 2) was nearly identical to GSTC's Amended Complaint in\n   <em>\n    Ashton I\n   </em>\n   , with the notable exception of the class action claims and the exclusion of Blue Sky Group, Inc. The original state complaint included ProX as a party, despite this Court's prior ruling finding the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over ProX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants removed this case to federal court on June 18, 2018. (Doc. 1). Perhaps realizing that the Court would not look favorably on a Complaint with almost identical allegations and identical causes of action to a case it dismissed based on forum non conveniens, GSTC filed an Amended Complaint on July 6, 2018. The Court would note that if GSTC had reason to believe its claims were so fundamentally different or altered to avoid issue preclusion when they first filed in state court, those claims and facts should have been included in the state court complaint, not added once GSTC realized the case would be coming back to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   However, in the Amended Complaint, GSTC altered some of the factual allegations, emphasizing the injury to GSTC's United State Operations based on Defendants actions. GSTC also included allegations related to Defendants new entity \"Qteq\", who was not included as a party. GSTC also provided more specific information about the involved transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Many of the newly added allegations were likely available at the time GSTC filed\n   <em>\n    Ashton I.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, GSTC was certainly aware of these new allegations when it filed its Complaint in state court. Also, for unclear reasons, in its Amended Complaint GSTC renamed the various Defendant groups, so for example, the \"Ashton Controlled Entities\" became \"Ashton/Ashton Trust\" and the \"Mactaggart Controlled Entities\" became \"Mactaggart Entities\". Additionally, while GSTC claims\n   it took out ProX as a party as justification for why the Court should not find issue preclusion, GSTC did not actually take out ProX or the allegations related to ProX. It just made ProX an \"alter ego\" of Ashton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, after apparently being made aware of the distinction between BAG and BAN through the proceedings on the Financing Notes, GSTC failed to take steps to dismiss its claims against BAG, or replace it as a Defendant with BAN. Rather, the Amended Complaint generally refers to Brisbane Angels (\"BA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   While GSTC claims the Amended Complaint materially altered the considerations underlying the previous resolution, the practical effect of GSTC's amendments was to make it more difficult for Defendants and the Court to parse through the Amended Complaint to determine whether GSTC was still asserting the same claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For these reasons the Court has serious concerns regarding GSTC's conduct in this case. Therefore, rather than denying Defendants' various claims for sanctions, the Court will require GSTC to respond to the motions for sanctions included in Defendants' motions on or before November 5, 2018. The Court will limit GSTC's response to ten (10) pages to address all the motions for sanctions. On or before November 19, 2018, Defendants may file any reply briefs limited to five (5) pages each, which should include the requested sanction. On or before December 3, 2018, GSTC may file a surreply of ten (10) pages, addressing only issues with the amount or type of requested sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court Finds and Orders as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiff's Motion for Remand (Doc. 20) is DENIED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that John Dugald Mactaggart's Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint (Doc. 11) is GRANTED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants Quentin Morgan and Ewan Meldrum's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 35) is GRANTED IN PART as to Defendant Meldrum;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendant Brisbane Angels Group, Ltd's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 13) is GRANTED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants Jontra Holding Pty and Associated Construction Equipment Pty.

GSTC's reply brief shall not exceed ten (10) pages and shall only address issues\n   related to the amount or type of requested sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   IT IS FINALLY ORDERED that this case is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    GSTC refers to WellDog Pty. Ltd. as WD Pty in its current Amended Complaint. The Court will use the name WellDog, which GSTC used in the earlier case,\n    <em>\n     Gas Sensing Tech. Corp. v. Ashton et al.\n    </em>\n    , 16-cv-272-F.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    A second notice of default was issued on October 6, 2016, a third notice was issued on October 21, 2016, and a fourth notice was issued on October 26, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 32-33, \u00b6 219).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The notice of default issued by Mactaggart was on behalf of Mactaggart, Jontra, and Associated Construction Equipment Pty. Ltd. (\"ACE\"). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 34, \u00b6 226).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The Court would also note that none of the documents would change the Court's prior analysis regarding Mactaggart's contacts with Wyoming. The documents may show that Mactaggart was engaged in a scheme related to the Australian entity, WellDog. However, the allegations in this case are that GSTC actively sought out Australian investors, to help start an Australian company. There are no allegations that Mactaggart targeted GSTC as a Wyoming resident in the first instance. While GSTC claims Mactaggart chose to conduct business with GSTC in the forum (Wyoming), there is no evidence that Mactaggart conducted any activities directed to Wyoming related to the takeover of WellDog. Rather, Mactaggart's activities all occurred in Australia, involving Australian entities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Additionally, the Court would note that while BAN consented to jurisdiction in state court in Albany County, it did not agree to jurisdiction in Wyoming for any other purpose than litigation under the Finance Notes. GSTC has failed to provide any case law that would suggested that specific jurisdiction for a contract action under a forum selection clause can create personal jurisdiction for other matters.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    For ease of reference the Court will refer to the Amended Complaints in both cases as\n    <em>\n     Ashton I\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Ashton II.\n    </em>\n    The Amended Complaint in\n    <em>\n     Ashton I\n    </em>\n    is located at Doc. 35 and the Amended Complaint for\n    <em>\n     Ashton II\n    </em>\n    is at Doc. 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    As another example of how this is the same lawsuit, GSTC has removed ProX as a party, but still includes its actions, only now as an \"alter ego\" to Ashton.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    GSTC could not completely remove ProX because it was ProX's actions in calling the notes (notes governed by Australian law), that form the foundation of GSTC's other complaints. It is very likely that ProX would be an indispensable party to this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
