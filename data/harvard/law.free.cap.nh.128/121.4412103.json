Such findings of fact exceeded the trial court\u2019s authority on motion for summary judgment which is limited to determining whether a \u201cgenuine issue of material fact requiring a formal trial\u201d exists. <em>Arsenault v. Willis, </em>117 N.H. 980, 983, 380 A.2d 264, 266 (1977). Moreover, the \u201cpossible\u201d factual issue, if genuine, was itself sufficient to preclude summary judgment. Since the trial court did not find that there was no genuine issue of material fact, the order of summary judgment was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-18\">We note that \u00a7 20 of the defendant\u2019s response states that there are \u201cno genuine issues as to any <em>relevant </em>facts.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) It is clear, however, that the defendant judged relevance by a legal theory that the trial court rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-19\">There being no basis to sustain the order, the summary judgment for the plaintiff must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-20\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
