We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">The plaintiff is an American corporation which imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, including Stolichnaya Vodka. Stolichnaya has been \u201clisted\u201d for sale in State liquor stores since 1980. \u201cListing\u201d refers to the procedures used by the commission in deciding whether to purchase alcoholic beverage products for sale in State liquor stores. N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 302.01. In September 1983, the commission voted to \u201cdelist\u201d Stolichnaya \u201cbecause of the ... Korean Airlines incident in which an airliner carrying civilian passengers was shot down by Russian aircraft.\u201d The product, however, is still available by \u201cspecial order\u201d; <em>i.e., </em>the commission will supply the product by the case upon the request of a customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The plaintiff several times petitioned the commission to reconsider its decision to delist Stolichnaya. In March 1985, the plaintiff filed a formal application to receive a product listing for Stolichnaya. N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 301.01, 302. The commission\u2019s director of marketing, merchandising and State operations recommended that the commission deny the application. On May 22,1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the commission notified the plaintiff that it had denied the application. The plaintiff received a copy of the vendor\u2019s specification form, which contained a notation stating that \u201c[t]his product is too controversial. There was no demand to list it on the consumer coupon returns.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 301.01(a)(6)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">On June 4, 1985, the plaintiff appealed the commission\u2019s decision. N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 301.01(a)(7). On June 24, 1985, the commission rejected the appeal, basing its decision on the fact that \u201c[t]he. September, 1983, event caused much concern among New Hampshire residents, as well as the [commission.\u201d The commission indicated that it viewed the listing request as an \u201cunusual situation\u201d within the meaning of N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 302.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in this court, seeking review of the commission\u2019s decision, and we accepted the case. The plaintiff presents the following questions of law: (1) whether the commission exceeded its statutory authority by denying the plaintiff\u2019s application for listing solely because Stolichnaya Vodka originates in the Soviet Union; (2) whether the commission\u2019s refusal to list Stolichnaya violated the plaintiff\u2019s due process rights; (3) whether the commission discriminated against the plaintiff in violation of its equal protection rights by refusing to list the product because it originated in a particular country; (4) whether the commission\u2019s stated basis for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application violated the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution; and (5) whether the commission\u2019s refusal to list the product unconstitutionally encroached upon the federal government\u2019s foreign policy powers. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that the commission exceeded its statutory authority by the way in which it denied the plaintiff\u2019s application for listing. We therefore answer question (1) in the affirmative, and need not address the remaining questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In reviewing a case before us on a petition for a writ of certiorari, our standard of review is a narrow one. We must determine \u201cwhether the agency or official acted illegally in respect to jurisdiction, authority, or observance of law, or whether it abused its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously.\u201d <em>Petition of Milan School District, </em>123 N.H. 227, 232, 459 A.2d 270, 274 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> The legislature may delegate limited power and authority to administrative agencies with clear standards and guidelines. <em>See Guillou v. State, </em>127 N.H. 579, 503 A.2d 838 (1986). <em>See generally Ferretti v. Jackson, </em>88 N.H. 296, 188 A. 474 (1936). \u201cCriteria and rules and regulations may properly be promulgated by administrative boards when so authorized by the legislature with proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>standards.\u201d <em>Reno v. Hopkinton, </em>115 N.H. 706, 707, 349 A.2d 585, 586 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\">The commission\u2019s powers and authority are conferred upon it entirely by statute. The legislature has expressed the primary duty of the commission as follows: \u201cto maximize state revenue, to maintain proper control and to be solely responsible for the efficient and effective operation of the commission.\u201d RSA 176:3-a (Supp. 1985). The legislature established the position of a director of marketing, merchandising and State operations, who is required to \u201crecommend to the commission the delisting of products not meeting gross profit levels and the listing of products that will maximize profits to the [S]tate.\u201d RSA 176:7-a, II (Supp. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In order to meet the mandate of the legislature, the commission established extensive, objective regulatory standards to guide the selection of alcoholic beverage products for sale. The regulations state that \u201c[the listing and delisting] system shall reflect the demand of the [S]tate\u2019s consumers on a current basis.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 302.02. The commission is required to consider several factors in determining the listing of products, including consumer demand, continuity of supply, gross profit projection, total sales performance of the product in other markets, the economics of transportation, unique quality or packaging or both, stability of the pricing practices of the vendor, and the trend of the category on a national and regional basis. N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 302.01(c), 302.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">We have long held that \u201c[a]n agency may not add to, change, or modify [statutory law] by regulation or through case-by-case adjudication.\u201d <em>In re Jack O\u2019Lantern, Inc., </em>118 N.H. 445, 448, 387 A.2d 1166, 1168 (1978). The legislature expressly established the overall standard of maximizing State revenue to govern the commission\u2019s actions, and clearly intended to prevent the commission from considering extraneous factors in the listing process. <em>See </em>N.H.S. Jour. 22-26 (1981) (Spec. Sess.) (statement of Sen. Monier). Rulemaking authority is granted to allow administrative agencies to effectuate their statutory purposes by \u201cfill[ing] in [the] details,\u201d and \u201c[i]ndeed, a legislative enactment that gives a board greater discretion than that needed to \u2018fill in details\u2019 is invalid.\u201d <em>Kimball v. N.H. Bd. of Accountancy, </em>118 N.H. 567, 568, 391 A.2d 888, 889 (1978). The legislature may not delegate the \u201cpower to make the law\u201d; it may only confer \u201cauthority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law.\u201d <em>State v. Normand, </em>76 N.H. 541, 546, 85 A. 899, 901-02 (1913). The objective regulatory standards established by the commission properly reflect the authority conferred by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The commission justifies its refusal to list Stolichnaya Vodka by a reliance on its own regulation providing that \u201c[s]ince the above description of a listing and delisting procedure in the [S]tate of New Hampshire does not, and cannot, cover all possible conditions, the commission shall review unusual situations on an individual basis.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Liq. 302.14. We cannot read this regulation, however, to permit the commission to reserve power to ignore an explicit set of regulatory standards and make a determination concerning the listing of products on a purely subjective basis. To read the regulation as broadly as the commission wishes would be to allow the exception to swallow the rule. The regulatory standards established by the commission\u2019s regulations would be meaningless if the commission could choose to ignore them at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The term \u201cunusual situations\u201d must be narrowly interpreted to allow the commission, in determining the listing of products, to consider additional factors <em>that are related to </em>the factors explicitly delineated in its regulations. The \u201cunusual situations\u201d provision does not permit the commission to consider extraneous factors that are unrelated to its statutory purpose as reflected in its regulatory scheme. Such a broad reading would render the provision void. A rule which \u201clays down no <em>rules </em>by which its <em>impartial execution </em>can be secured or partiality and oppression prevented\u201d is void. <em>Hanover Precinct v. Atkins, </em>78 N.H. 308, 310-11, 99 A. 293, 294 (1916) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Baltimore v. Radecke, </em>49 Md. 217, 230 (1878)).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The commission made no findings concerning the factors set out in its own regulations. \u201cA reviewing court needs findings of basic facts to understand administrative decisions and to ascertain whether the facts and issues considered sustain the ultimate result reached.\u201d <em>Society for Protection of N.H. Forests v. Site Evaluation Comm., </em>115 N.H. 163, 173, 337 A.2d 778, 786 (1975). \u201cOtherwise, there is no means by which a reviewing court can determine whether the board complied with the statute and considered each of the enumerated factors, or whether the evidence sustains the board\u2019s ultimate determination.\u201d <em>Appeal of Portsmouth Trust Co., </em>120 N.H. 753, 759, 423 A.2d 603, 606 (1980). The commission must consider each of the factors delineated in its own regulations, and must make a determination concerning listing based on those factors and any additional factors related to its statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> We hold that .the commission exceeded its statutory authority by interpreting the \u201cunusual situations\u201d language of its regulations to permit a denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application for listing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>solely on the basis that Stolichnaya Vodka originates in the Soviet Union. \u201cIt is the responsibility of this court to insure that another will is not substituted for that of the legislature when, out of necessity, it delegates certain limited powers.\u201d <em>Kimball, </em>118 N.H. at 569, 391 A.2d at 889. We remand for a consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s application in accordance with the standards contained in the commission\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b230-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
