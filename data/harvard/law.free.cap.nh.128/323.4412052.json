The plaintiffs claim that the Superior Court <em>(Dalianis, </em>J.) erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>charging the jury on the significance of an alleged violation of regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-678 (1982). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">It is undisputed that OSHA regulations applied to the job site in question and provided safety requirements for the scaffolding that collapsed and led to injury. The trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cfailure to comply with these regulations may be considered by you as evidence of negligence.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that this was error and that the judge should have instructed that a violation of the regulations was \u201cnegligence per se.\u201d The plaintiffs thus seek a determination that an OSHA regulation has the force of statute for purposes of applying the rule that \u201c[cjausal violation of a statute is a legal fault.\u201d <em>Frost v. Stevens, </em>88 N.H. 164, 167, 184 A. 869, 872 (1936); <em>see Bagley v. Controlled Environment Corp., </em>127 N.H. 556, 561, 503 A.2d 823, 826-27 (1986); <em>Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., </em>112 N.H. 50, 52, 289 A.2d 68, 71 (1972). <em>Cf. Lemery v. O\u2019Shea Dennis, Inc., </em>112 N.H. 199, 200-01, 291 A.2d 616, 617-18 (1972) (safety code not incorporated into statute or ordinance is merely evidence of appropriate standard of care). The record indicates, however, that the plaintiffs did not raise this issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Among the plaintiffs\u2019 forty requests for instructions, six included language bearing on the present issue. Request 32 sought an instruction that \u201cfailure to comply with . . . OSHA regulations on scaffolding, is evidence of negligence. Therefore, in determining wheth\u00e9r the defendant provided a reasonably safe work place, you may consider whether the defendant failed to comply with any of the OSHA regulations.\u201d Request 34 included similar wording. Request 35 sought an instruction that \u201cfailure to comply with [OSHA] regulations ... is evidence of the . . . failure to provide a reasonably safe work environment. . . .\u201d Request 36 included language that \u201c[i]n determining whether the defendant provided a reasonably safe work place, you may consider whether the defendant failed to comply with . . . OSHA regulations.\u201d Requests 38 and 40 sought instructions that a failure to comply with OSHA regulations \u201cis evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">After the trial judge instructed the jury that failure to comply with the OSHA regulations \u201cmay be considered by you as evidence of negligence,\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted to the refusal to give his requests numbers 37 through 40 verbatim and excepted to the instruction \u201cthat the violation of OSHA regulations may be considered as evidence of negligence.\u201d He added, \u201cWe take the position that violation is evidence of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Neither exception raised the issue that the plaintiffs seek to lit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>igate on appeal. For purposes of charging the jury, neither an instruction that failure to comply \u201cmay be considered ... as evidence of negligence\u201d nor an instruction that a failure \u201cis evidence of negligence\u201d states that an OSHA violation constitutes legal fault. For all practical purposes, the plaintiffs got exactly the instruction that they requested. The record indicates that it was only by a motion for new trial, dated two days after verdict, that the plaintiffs asserted that the trial court should have instructed the jury that causal violation of a regulation was, without more, legal fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\">Having failed to raise or preserve a timely claim of error, the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions are overruled. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. R. 72 and <em>Daboul v. Town of Hampton, </em>124 N.H. 307, 309, 471 A.2d 1148, 1149 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
