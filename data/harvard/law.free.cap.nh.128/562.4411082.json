The defendant argues that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>should have been given a lesser sentence for solicitation of murder. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\">The facts and procedural history of this case are set out in <em>State v. Kaplan, </em>124 N.H. 382, 469 A.2d 1354 (1983), in which we upheld the defendant\u2019s conviction. Subsequent to that decision, the defendant filed, and the Trial Court <em>(DiClerico, </em>J.) denied, a motion to correct sentence. In this appeal from that ruling, the defendant contends that the facts alleged by the State prove that the crime she committed was solicitation of murder, an inchoate homicide offense with a maximum penalty of fifteen years, and that the trial court thus erred in sentencing her as an accomplice to second degree murder, especially in light of the alleged murderer\u2019s acquittal. The State responds that she pleaded guilty to an offense under RSA 626:8 (criminal liability for conduct of another) and RSA 630:l-b (second degree murder), not RSA 629:2 (criminal solicitation), and that the sentence imposed by the trial court was correct under the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">RSA 629:2 states that \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminal solicitation if, with a purpose that another engage in conduct constituting a crime, he commands, solicits or requests such other person to engage in such conduct.\u201d The statute does not require that the solicited conduct actually occur. <em>See </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.02 comment 3 (1985). On the other hand, RSA 626:8, III states that \u201c[a] person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if . . . he solicits such other person in committing it.\u201d This statute requires that the solicited offense be committed by the solicitee. <em>See id.; </em>RSA 626:8, VII. The solicited offense in this case was knowingly causing the death of another. RSA 630:1-b.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">As we noted in <em>Kaplan, supra </em>at 384-85, 469 A.2d at 1354, the defendant pleaded guilty to a complaint which alleged that she, \u201cwith the purpose of promoting Morton Kaplan\u2019s death,. .. solicited William Gagne to cause [her husband\u2019s] death,\u201d and that Gagne \u201cpurposely caused [her husband\u2019s] death.\u201d Gagne\u2019s acquittal does not negate the possibility that the defendant could have been proven guilty as an accomplice to second degree murder at a trial. <em>See </em>RSA 626:8, VII; <em>Kaplan, supra </em>at 388-89, 469 A.2d at 1357; 4 C. TORCIA, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 713 (14th ed. 1981). Nevertheless, the defendant\u2019s guilty plea obviated the need for the State to prove that she committed the offense, and she cannot now challenge the propriety of the charge and its concomitant sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the inchoate nature of her crime supports a solicitation rather than an accomplice charge lacks merit in view of the defendant\u2019s plea and our prior decision. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>we uphold the trial court\u2019s sentence, and conclude that the court properly denied her motion to correct sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b598-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
