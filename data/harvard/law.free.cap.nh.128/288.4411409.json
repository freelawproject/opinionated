The jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>allowed to consider these two charges, as well as the lesser offenses of manslaughter by causing death recklessly, RSA 630:2,1(b) (Supp. 1983), and negligent homicide, RSA 630:3, 1(a) (current version at Supp. 1985). The verdict was guilty of second degree murder by causing death recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Before the charge to the jury, defense counsel proposed a specific instruction on the meaning of \u201cextreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d The court refused to give it, and defense counsel on appeal concedes that the instruction as proposed would have been erroneous. The court also refused a request to explain the phrase by an instruction of its own devising. The defendant argues that the court thereby failed to honor its obligation to clarify the issues by explaining the law in straightforward language related to the evidence and claims of the case. <em>State v. Bird, </em>122 N.H. 10, 15, 440 A.2d 441, 443 (1982). We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Although a trial judge has a comprehensive obligation to instruct a jury on the law, the judge has no duty to explain nontechnical terms or phrases that are readily comprehended. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 440 A.2d at 444. \u201cExtreme indifference to the value of human life\u201d is such a phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We have previously described those words as \u201ceasily understood,\u201d <em>State v. Dow, </em>126 N.H. 205, 207, 489 A.2d 650, 652 (1985), and we have cast doubt on the need to explain them to a jury. <em>See State v. Bailey, </em>127 N.H. 416, 503 A.2d 762 (1985). Our skepticism mirrors the view expressed in the official comment to the Model Penal Code:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cWhether recklessness is so extreme that it demonstrates . . . indifference [analogous to indifference indicated by purposeful or knowing killing] is not a question . . . that can be further clarified. It must be left directly to the trier of fact under instructions which make it clear that recklessness that can fairly be assimilated to purpose or knowledge should be treated as murder and that less extreme recklessness should be punished as manslaughter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.2, at 22 (1980) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">\u201cGiven the Model Code definition of recklessness, the point involved is put adequately and succinctly by asking whether the recklessness rises to the level of \u2018extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 25 (footnote omitted). Because the New Hampshire definition of recklessness is taken from the Model Penal Code, <em>compare </em>RSA 626:2, 11(c) <em>with </em>Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(c) (1985), the quoted comment is pertinent to the issue before us. We find the comment persuasive and hold that the phrase in question does not demand further explanation to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendant\u2019s attempts to marshal contrary authority only underscore the soundness of this view. He argues first that it would have been helpful to give the instruction approved in <em>State v. Howland, </em>119 N.H. 413, 416, 402 A.2d 188, 191 (1979). But although a <em>Howland </em>instruction is perfectly proper, even a casual reading of <em>Howland </em>reveals that the instruction never really actually defines the phrase in question; it simply repeats the juxtaposition between mere recklessness and recklessness manifesting extreme indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">He submits, second, that two Wisconsin cases indicate a need to elucidate the phrase: <em>Balistreri v. State, </em>83 Wis. 2d 440, 265 N.W.2d 290 (1978) and <em>Wagner v. State, </em>76 Wis. 2d 30, 250 N.W.2d 331 (1977). But they are no authority for the defendant\u2019s position. In each case, criminal liability required proof of a \u201cdepraved mind, regardless of human life.\u201d <em>Balistreri, supra </em>445, 265 N.W.2d at 294; <em>Wagner, supra </em>at 45, 250 N.W.2d at 340. Each case held that the defendant could not be convicted on evidence that indicated he had attempted to avoid hitting the victim with his car; and in each case, the court spoke of \u201cindifference to the life of others\u201d as a possible elucidation of \u201cdepraved mind, regardless of human life.\u201d <em>Balistreri, supra </em>at 450, 265 N.W.2d at 294; <em>Wagner, supra </em>at 45-47, 250 N.W.2d at 340. Each case thus ends where the clear statutory language in New Hampshire begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b324-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
