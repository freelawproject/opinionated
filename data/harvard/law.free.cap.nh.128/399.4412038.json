We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\">The defendant was charged with and convicted of the second-offense misdemeanor of driving while under the influence, in violation of RSA 265:82, :82-b, 1(b) (Supp. 1985). The following exchanges occurred during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the arresting officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">\u201cQ. Now, it is reasonable to say, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Hannigan, that it takes approximately 45 minutes to an hour and a half for someone to reach a [blood alcohol] peak, is that a good estimate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">A. I would say that is a good estimate if he drank \u2014 probably quickly, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">Q. So 45 minutes to an hour and a half, assuming he stopped drinking, \u2014 don\u2019t nod, say yes or no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">The Court: Just a minute. Ask the question, and try to be responsive. This is an adversary proceeding, but it need not get to the point where we are abrasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">[Defense counsel]: I am sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-13\"> After a brief recess, defense counsel moved for mistrial on the ground that the court\u2019s remark was prejudicial to the defendant. The court denied the motion, and counsel resumed cross-examination by asking his previous question. On appeal, the defendant argues that the court\u2019s interjection was unwarranted, stressing that the State had not objected, and that the court magnified its error by calling a brief recess after the colloquy quoted. We find no error on the record before us, however.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-14\">\u201cAlthough operating in the adversary system, trial judges are not mere referees. They have the right and in fact the duty to see that trials are conducted in a fair and orderly manner, and may on their own, without waiting for objection from opposing counsel, control the conduct of counsel and the introduction of evidence. Such action does not demonstrate prejudice but rather a proper concern for the real purpose of the adversary system. <em>See </em>ABA Standards Relating to The Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7 1.1 (Approved Draft 1972).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-15\"><em>State v. Collins, </em>115 N.H. 499, 503, 345 A.2d 162, 166 (1975). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Although admonitions to counsel should be given at the bench and out of the jury\u2019s hearing, whenever possible, we do not believe that the trial judge\u2019s statement in open court could have risen to the point of error by coloring the jury\u2019s decision on the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>See Young v. Clogston, </em>127 N.H. 340, 344, 499 A.2d 1007, 1010 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The court\u2019s statement did not go to the substance of any testimony. Although it expressed some degree of irritation, it was not intemperate. In the same breath that he suggested that defense counsel was getting abrasive, the judge instructed the State\u2019s witness to be responsive. After the recess, and defense counsel\u2019s repeated apology, the court stated before the jury that there was \u201cno necessity to apologize.\u201d And not long thereafter, during the same cross-examination, the court again instructed the witness to be responsive. Given this context, we do not believe that the jury\u2019s view of the merits of the case could have been influenced by the court\u2019s remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
