In response to the question on such blank, \u201c Do you recommend the granting of the application? If not, state reasons,\u201d the captain answered, \u201c No; place not needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">On a public hearing afforded the protest-ants, but one property owner was examined in opposition to granting the transfer applied for. He owned the premises No. 480 Hicks street, and his opposition was based on the ground that there were more than sufficient saloons already on the block, and the police captain also testified that he reported adversely to the application on the ground that \u201c the place is not required; there are enough there already; \u201d it was further shown by him that the block was about 600 feet long, and that there were four saloons on the block, counting both sides of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">On January 4, 1895, the relator\u2019s application was refused, and he now seeks by certiorari to review the determination of the board of excise refusing his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In the return to the writ of certiorari it appears that the board of excise denied the application of the relator \u201c on the ground that the large number of signatures on the protest was of adjacent residents, and that, in the opinion of the commissioners, there are sufficient licensed places in that vicinity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">If the foregoing facts stood alone I should not be inclined to interfere with the disposition by the commissioners of excise of the application of the relator, as, in my opinion, they are vested with a discretion as to the location of licensed places. This discretion, however, must be properly, fairly, impartially and consistently exercised, without discrimination in favor of one applicant as against another.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">It further appears from the return by the commissioners to the writ that on and prior to November 26, 1894, one Diskiu held a license from the board of excise for the sale of liquors at No. 456 Hicks street, a place located on the same block <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>and about 150 feet from the place to which the relator sought to transfer Ms license. On November <em>26, </em>1894, and about two weeks before the relator made his application for a transfer, the board of excise gave Diskin leave to transfer his license from No. 456 Hicks street to No. 7 Pulton street, and after that time the premises No. 456 Hicks street ceased to be a liquor store.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">On January 10, 1895, six days after relator\u2019s application had been denied, one Bielmeier applied to the board for leave to transfer his license from No. 381 Palmetto street to No. 456 Hicks street, being the premises formerly occupied by Diskin; two of the protestants against granting the relator\u2019s application appear as petitioners in favor of granting Bielmeier\u2019s application. The police captain recommended the granting of this application, and on January twenty-third, just nineteen days after relator\u2019s application had been denied on the ground of the protest of the adjacent residents, and that there were \u201c sufficient licensed places in that vicinity,\u201d the board of excise granted the application of Bielmeier for another licensed place in the same vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">It is sought to sustain or explain this action of the commissioners on the ground that there was no protest filed, and that when the police captain recommended the granting of the license to Bielmeier at No. 456 Hicks street he thought that the liquor business previously carried on there had only been temporarily suspended, and that he was ignorant of the transfer of Diskin\u2019s license from that place to No. 7 Fulton street. This may account for the apparent inconsistency in the reports of the police captain, but it did not alter the facts, and those facts were known to or accessible to the commissioners. The granting of the license to Bielmeier to sell liquors at No. 456 Hicks street in less than three weeks after the refusal to grant relator\u2019s application to sell liquors at No. 482 Hicks street on the ground that there were already <em>\u201c </em>sufficient licensed places in that vicinity,\u201d in the absence of any satisfactory explanation or any change in the surroundings, is so entirely inconsistent with a fair, impartial exercise of discretion based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201c good or valid reasons,\u201d and is evidence of such discrimination in favor of Bielmeier\u2019s application as against that of the relator, that I am forced to the conclusion that the application of the relator was <em>\u201c </em>arbitrarily denied,\u201d and that the action of the board of excise should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Let an order be entered directing the board of excise to grant the application of relator and awarding him costs on this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
