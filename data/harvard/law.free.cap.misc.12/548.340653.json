It appears to us that he had his day in court, but neglected to take advantage of it. Defendant had no <em>right </em>to have the default in question vacated. That is a <em>favor </em>which the court had a right to refuse him if the interests of justice required such a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Apparently the Special Term justice thought that the alleged defense was entirely without <em>merit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">In that conclusion, after an examination of the record, we concur, particularly as defendant denies any indebtedness in the answer, and admits in his affidavit that he owed plaintiff at least $490.83, because he swears that he assigned a claim for that sum to plaintiff in <em>pa/rt payment </em>of the claim in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">This contradiction, and his letters printed in the appeal book, show, I think, that the interests of justice were best served by making the order appealed from, which must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Newbueger and Cone ax, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
