J.</author>\n<p id=\"A16\">The plaintiff claims damages for breach of contract of employment by the defendant, a theatrical manager, under which she was to perform at the Star Theatre in a plav\"called \u201cBrother Jonathan,\u201d the performances of which were to commence in the latter part of February, 1893, and to run until about June first, at a salary of sixty dollars per week. The defense is that she was not employed for any particular period, but only for the run of the play, which lasted hut six weeks, and that her employment was conditional upon her rehearsal of the part to the satisfaction of the author of the play and of the defendant. She was notified in February, during the rehearsals, that her services were not needed, and she remained out of employment thereafter for the whole term, except one week, in which she earned $50. The case was submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiff in $910, being the whole amount claimed by her after deducting the $50 earned hy her.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Defendant concedes that there was a question of fact for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the jury upon the evidence as to the terms of the contract, but claims error in the charge of the court as to what would constitute a contract for a definite period as distinguished from an engagement for the run of the play. The court said : \u201c I charge that if the jury believe the testimony of Miss Sherwood, namely, that Brooks told her that Crane, the defendant, made no mistakes and that the play would run until June 1st, that was the contract, and she is not limited to six weeks, but is entitled to recover for the full period.\u201d To this the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The defendant contends that the evidence shows that the plaintiff was engaged only for the run of the play, and that the statement of Brooks, the defendant\u2019s agent, who engaged her, that the play would run to June first, was mere opinion and not a warranty that it would so continue. The testimony of plaintiff on her direct examination was that Brooks said : \u201cThis means a permanent thing for you in Rew York from the opening until the balance of the season. I will give you $60 a week from the time we open until the balance of the season; \u201d that she said, \u201c Suppose the play is a failure ? \u201d he said, \u201c Crane does not produce failures ; \u201d she said, \u201c How long is the season ? \u201d he said, \u201cWe will open in three or four weeks, at the very latest, from January 30th, and it will extend to about June 1st.\u201d On cross-examination she was asked: \u201c Q. I call your attention particularly to the conversation you had with Brooks the first time you met him, and I ask you the question whether or not it was not a fact that Brooks said to you you were engaged for the run of the play? A. Yes. Q. That is it ? A. Yes, and I asked him how long the run would be, and he'told me about three.weeks from January 30th until or about June 1st. Q. And that he told you would be the run of the play ? A. Yes.\u201d And, again: \u201c A. My first conversation with him I was engaged from the time I say until on or about June 1st. Q. For the run of the play? A. Yes; that is the length of the run of the play. Q. And he told you in his opinion it would run to June 1st about ? A. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>From this testimony, if the jury believe it, there was no doubt that Brooks not only expressed an opinion that the play would run until June first, but had so much confidence in Mr. Crane\u2019s judgment of plays and ability to run them as long as he pleased that he was willing to and did contract with plaintiff that her engagement in this piece would last to that date; so that, while he engaged the plaintiff for the run of the play, he distinctly specified that run as extending to June first, and there was no error in the instruction of the court on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">But if there were a doubt as to the sense in which Brooks\u2019 statement as to the run of the piece and plaintiff\u2019s engagement are to be understood, defendant is not entitled to the benefit of that doubt, for it is manifest that, from Brooks\u2019 declaration to plaintiff, that \u201c this means a permanent thing for you in Mew York from the opening until the balance of the season,\u201d and \u00cdCI will give you $60 a week from the time we open until the balance of the season,\u201d together with his other statements, that he must have supposed that the plaintiff understood he was contracting for the season; and this understanding constitutes the contract. <em>\u201c </em>Where the language of a promisor may be understood in more senses than one, it is to be interpreted in the sense in which he had reason to suppose it was understood by the promisee.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Etna F. Ins. Co., </em>32 N. Y. 405, citing <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Ontario Ins. Co., </em>5 Hill, <em>149; Barlow </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>24 N. Y. 40. It is to be observed that defendant did not ask that any question with regard to plaintiff\u2019s understanding, or what defendant supposed, or had reason to suppose that understanding to be, should be submitted to the jury, but contented himself with an exception to the instruction quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Bischoff and Pbyob, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
