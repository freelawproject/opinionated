On May 1, 1893, the plaintiff purchased the business from the defendant, together with the\"good will thereof, paid the defendant $1,500 therefor, and as an inducement to the sale the latter agreed not to re-enter the practice of dentistry for a period of four years from May 1, 1893, within the territory bounded by the Harlem river on the north, Seventieth street on the south, East river on the east, and the North river on the vest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The object of this agreement was to protect the good will, which formed the main inducement to the sale, and for which the plaintiff parted with almost all the money he paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Although the business sold was a professional one, the law recognizes the fact that it has a good will, which may be sold as an incident of the business. If the customers decline to go to the \u201c old stand,\u201d this is the plaintiff\u2019s misfortune; but the defendant must not interfere to the plaintiff\u2019s prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"ALnq\">Good will is a commodity (1 Coll. Part. [6th ed.] 226 <em>et seq. </em>); means the custom of any trade or business (Web. Die.); resolves itself into reputation <em>(Howe </em>v. Searing, 6 Bosw. 354); is the probability that the old patrons will continue customers at the old place (17 Yes. 347;. <em>Fenn </em>v. Bolles, 7 Abb. Pr. 202), and includes every possible advantage that lias been acquired by the vendor while carrying on the business. <em>Glen M. Co. </em>v. Hall, 61 N. Y. 226. It is a species of property depending on circumstances for its value. It is in some instances more -valuable than the second-hand chattels that go with it, and often the inducing cause of a purchase. It may be precarious, need attention, and at times protection. Part of the custom may by the change drift away, but the vendor must not create the current that carries it.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The covenant was to protect the good will and keep it with the plaintiff. The defendant thereafter violated the covenant by opening and maintaining a rival establishment within the restricted territory. High Inj. \u00a7 736 <em>et seq.; </em>Hilliard Inj. (3d ed.) 698; Pom. Spec. Perf. \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The claim that the defendant did not understand the nature and effect of the covenant, or that it was without consideration, is not borne out by the testimony, which clearly shows the contrary. He is an intelligent man, and before violating the covenant endeavored to procure permission from the plaintiff to resume business within the prohibited territory, and made offers to induce the plaintiff to give his consent thereto, which the plaintiff declined to grant. The defendant states he made these propositions because he felt under a moral obligation to refrain from carrying out his intention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Under the circumstances he might well have compunction in regard to the matter. The nature of the transaction with the plaintiff required his permission to authorize interference by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">It is clearly established that the defendant violated the covenant. The card issued by him in December following the sale, containing the defendant\u2019s name, address, and the word <em>ic </em>dentist,\u201d shows that he was, to an extent at least, still in the same business close by the \u201c old stand.\u201d- The fact that dentistry was practiced by the defendant in violation of the agreement was also clearly shown by witnesses who patronized him.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The covenant is legal and enforcible by a court of equity. <em>Francisco </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>143 N. Y. 488; <em>Diamond M. Co. </em>v. <em>Roeber, </em>106 id. 487; <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Pollard, </em>5 Misc. Rep. 490; 55 N. Y. St. Repr. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The case presented calls for equitable interference. The covenant must be preserved and enforced, and to that end the plaintiff is granted the injunctive relief claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
