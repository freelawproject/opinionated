The complaint avers that certain servants or employees were engaged in repairing the chimney, and that through the negligence and carelessness of the said servants or employees while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>in the pursuit of their employment, great quantities of soot or other substances or matter from said chimney fell with great force down the said chimney or flue into plaintiff\u2019s stove, filling his room with said soot, dirt and smoke, causing flames to bhrst out from said stove into said room or rooms; in consequence of which the intestate received a great shock, was compelled to inhale great quantities of said soot and of gas, sooty vapor, smoke and flames, and, as a result of such injuries and of said shock and said inhalation, said intestate died shortly afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">The action is not placed upon any duty of defendant as landlord to use diligence to prevent such an accident. If there be such duty it is not specified in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">On the trial it was admitted that the work done in the chimney was done under a contract with the defendant, and that the negligence which caused the soot to fall was that of the contractor or his servants. This statement shows that the doing of the repairs, if they were not negligently made, could not have involved any liability upon the landlord for the soot; he had a right to think that the work would he done in a proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Hnder the circumstances we find no error, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Sedgwick, Oh. J., and MoAdam, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
