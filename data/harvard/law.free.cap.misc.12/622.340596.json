Palmer, 115 N. Y. 506, 509; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>15 Johns. 380; <em>Jackson v. Collins, </em>3 Cow. 89), and <em>\u201c </em>if the words of a' statute are of themselves precise and unambiguous, then no more can be necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense. The words themselves do, in such case, best declare the intention of the legislature. Sutil. Stat. Const. \u00a7 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Section 272 of the Consolidation Act (Laws 1882, chap. 410), in view of the provisions of which the legislature must be presumed to have acted when amending the sections connected in subject with it, provides that \u201c no member * * * of the police force * * * shall be * * * dismissed from the police force until <em>written charges </em>shall have been made or preferred against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The word \u201c written \u201d may well be taken, and properly should, to exclude a <em>verbal </em>charge as a ground for trial and dismissal, and by no means looks necessarily to a formal presentment in order that a <em>charge </em>should exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">This is the only provision found 'with regard to the form of the \u201c charges \u201d in contemplation. A <em>\u201c </em>charge \u201d under the act may as well be an existing accusation made by a citizen against the officer and entertained by the board as a formal presentment by the board itself, with notice from it to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayc\">The courts, in their construction of statutes, are to observe the rule that words in a statute intended for the people should be understood in a popular sense (Suth. Stat. Const. \u00a7 251); that words are not to receive the narrowest interpretation, even in a penal statute (Id. \u00a7 357); that where words have two significations the popular one should have preference (Id. \u00a7\u00a7 248, 250); that common or popular words are to be interpreted in a popular sense (Id. \u00a7\u00a7 247, 248, 254, 255, 258); that a strict and literal interpretation is not always to be adhered to, and where a case is brought within the intention of the makers of the statute it is within the statute, though by a technical interpretation it is not within the letter ( <em>Weiler </em>v. <em>New</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number><em>bach, </em>47 Hun, 166); also, that the words of a statute, if of common use, are to be taken in their natural, plain, obvious and ordinary signification. <em>People ex rel. Bockes </em>v. <em>Wemple, </em>115 N. Y. 302; <em>Polhemus </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>123 id. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In realization of the fact that the legislature\u2019s obvious intent was to make the retirement of a worthy officer, and such officer alone, mandatory upon the board of police, where, before, discretion existed <em>(People ex rel. Brady </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>145 N. Y. 253), I proceed to apply the rules noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The words \u201c charge \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>pending \u2019\u2019\"are indeed susceptible of two interpretations, the legal and technical or the popular and liberal. To the lawyer\u2019s mind a <em>\u201c </em>charge \u201d would intend an accusation as to which formal notice was brought to the accused; and so, too, <em>\u201c </em>pendency \u201d would suggest the state of an undetermined proceeding after such notice had been given to the party proceeded against. But in the popular sense \u201c charge \u201d and <em>\u201c </em>accusation \u201d are practically synonymous, and the word <em>\u201c </em>pending,\u201d if Ave have recourse either to the vernacular or to the derivation of the term, means \u201c hanging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Certainly, accusations made to and entertained by the body having jurisdiction to act upon ..and investigate them are \u201c charges \u201d hanging \u2014 hanging over or <em>\u201c </em>pending \u201d in the popular sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In another part of the act we find the expression (\u00a7 4) <em>\u201c </em>pending the trial of charges.\u201d This may well be taken to denote the legislative appreciation of the distinction between \u201c pending,\u201d the condition of a charge without formal notice to the accused, and \u201c pending the trial,\u201d which the more properly denotes a condition presented by the observance of greater strictness of procedure. <em>\u201cExpressio unius, exel/usio alteriusB</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It results that the relator lias failed to establish his right to retirement <em>ex d\u00e9bito justitice, </em>and the writ sought is not to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
