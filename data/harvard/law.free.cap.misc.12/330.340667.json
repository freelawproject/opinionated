The court further directed that the question of past damages be reserved for determination after the easements should have been acquired, in such manner as the court should then direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Condemnation proceedings were instituted and prosecuted to awards, which the defendants paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">In October, 1894, plaintiffs moved to restore the causes to the equity calendar for trial as to past damages. The judge presiding at Special Term thereupon directed a reference, upon the ground that as the interlocutory judgment entered upon consent provided \u201c that the past damages be determined in such manner as the court should direct,\u201d it carried with it the right to refer that question to a referee. We think this view erroneous. The words \u201cin such manner as the court may direct \u201d assume the exercise of its lawful powers, and cannot be interpreted irrespective of the limitations imposed hy law. Express authority must, therefore, be found for the reference or its direction cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The admission that substantial damages had been sustained is equivalent to a finding to that effect after proof of title \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>nothing more. The Code contains no warrant for the appointment of a referee to complete the trial. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>136 N.
