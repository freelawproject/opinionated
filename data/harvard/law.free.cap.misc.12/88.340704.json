The appeal is from a judgment of a District . Court rendered May 10, 1894, and the judgment was satisfied on execution. The notice of appeal was served June 2, 1894, and the return of the justice was filed November 13, 1894. Neither party has placed the cause on the General Term calendar, and the motion to dismiss the appeal is made on five days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The motion must be denied because a notice of motion of five days is insufficient. Code, \u00a7 780; <em>Salters </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>11 Wkly. Dig. 189. An additional reason for denying it is that motions to dismiss appeals from District Courts for defects in the appeal or service of notice thereof, or for failure to file return, must he made at the Special Term. Rules 9 and 11 of the Common Pleas; Rules of Courts of Record, p. 374. Failure of appellant to serve notice of argument is by itself no ground for dismissing an appeal. Respondent having given notice of argument, should have placed the cause on the General Term calendar and brought the appeal to a hearing. Notice of argument may be given for the addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tional General Term in April next and a note of issue filed therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">This motion is denied, with ten dollars costs to appellant to abide event of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Bischoff and Pbyob, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Motion denied, with ten dollars costs to. appellant to abide event of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
