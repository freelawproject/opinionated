The defendants\u2019 agreement was \u201c to give said Winch five bonds of a first mortgage of <em>said </em>gas works or <em>said </em>company.\u201d \u25a0 The words \u201c said gas works or said company \u201d clearly refer to a gas company <em>\u201c </em>to be formed in Brooklyn or for operation in Brooklyn,\u201d or to <em>\u201c </em>a company already formed \u201d to be operated in Brooklyn.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">The last clause of the contract, which mentions the <em>\u201c </em>Equity Gras Company of Williamsburgh, Brooklyn,\u201d is quite evidently for the purpose of characterizing the information to be given, and not to specify the company meant. If the intention had been to agree to give the plaintiff bonds of the Equity Company, it would have been easy to say so in so many words, but, instead of such direct and definite expression, the parties <em>ex industria </em>employ language which is indefinite and descriptive, and naturally so, because it is plain that their plans were at the time uncertain and contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">It should be observed that the language is very guarded in that the defendants did not agree or undertake, but only proposed, to form or operate a gas company. The plaintiff\u2019s compensation was to be in bonds of such company, unascertained at the time, when they should at least have formed or operated it. He should, therefore, allege that the defendants formed or operated a company of the kind described.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>I do not think that the complaint could be saved by parol proof upon the trial that the parties meant the Equity Company instead of one unascertained at the time. Such proof would be inadmissible as varying or contradicting the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Neither is there any room for the presumption in support of the complaint that other written evidence will be produced upon the trial. The pleader relies too distinctly and unmistakably upon the particular writing pleaded. In this respect the case differs from <em>Cahill Iron Works </em>v. <em>Pemberton, </em>30 Abb. N. C. 450, 455. There the allegation was that the consideration for the guaranty sued upon was the plaintiff\u2019s agreement to renew certain promissory notes, and it was held that, notwithstanding the fact that certain writings, which were pleaded as guaranties, failed to state any consideration, it would be presumed that other writings would be forthcoming upon the trial, and that those set forth should be disregarded as being a pleading of evidence, and, therefore, surplusage. Here the allegation is not that there was an agreement to give the plaintiff bonds of the Equity Company, but that a certain writing set forth had that meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Upon the appeal in this case the attention of the General Term was concentrated upon the refusal to allow any amendment to the complaint, which it held to be error, and, as leave was given to amend, it was not deemed necessary to discuss the question now raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The demurrer should, therefore, be sustained, with leave to the plaintiff to amend, if so advised, upon the payment of costs of demurrer only.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
