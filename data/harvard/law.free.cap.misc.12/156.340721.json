Wickham, 135 N. Y. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Defendant, however, was permitted to testify, over repeated objections and exceptions duly taken, to a parol agreement entered into with him by the officers of the club whereby this script was to be received in satisfaction of indebtedness for dues and house account when tendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">For the error apparent in the admission of this evidence the judgment must be reversed. The certificates of indebtedness were, upon their face, complete as an expression of the agreement entered into and the obligation assumed, and the testimony admitted was solely for the purpose of showing another and earlier agreement inconsistent with that expressed in altering the time and method of payment as provided. The plaintiff was clearly entitled to its exclusion. <em>Willse </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>22 Hun, 242; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Ketcham, </em>8 Johns. 190; <em>Van Allen </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Holt, 525 ; <em>Lamson Consol.
