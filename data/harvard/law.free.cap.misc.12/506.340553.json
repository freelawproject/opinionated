It is well settled that in order to justify a recovery for damage alleged to have been sustained as a consequence of false and fraudulent representations, the intent to defraud must be alleged as well as proved. <em>Star Steamship Co. </em>v. Mitchell, 1 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 396 ; <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Hernz, </em>13 N. Y. St. Repr. 333; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Falker, </em>40 N. Y. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>When, as in this case, no complaint is served with the summons, the relief granted the plaintiff by default should be limited by his allegations as well as by his proofs. Code, \u00a7 1207; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>84 N. Y. 296: <em>Weatherby </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>29 How. 404; <em>Beach </em>v. Cooke, 28 N. Y. 508; <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Read, </em>57 id. 681; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>42 Hun, 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The intent to defraud being an essential element in the plaintiff\u2019s case, it was necessary to allege as well as to prove it. No intent to defraud having been alleged in the complaint, the court below was not authorized to find any. Therefore, as the judgment establishes an intent to defraud, it is not warranted by the complaint and should be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Titus, Ch. J., and Hatch, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
