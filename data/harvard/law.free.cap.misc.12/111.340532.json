Plaintiff occupied the store floor and had there an icebox, an oil tank and certain grocer\u2019s goods in cans. While he was absent, a plumber, under defendant\u2019s directions, came to the premises, and, by permission of plaintiff\u2019s wife or his daughter, entered to make certain necessary repairs to the Croton water fixtures, which were leaking. When plaintiff returned he found some of his goods missing, his icebox pulled apart and his oil tank bursted. He was not able to connect the plumber' with the disappearance of the groceries, but the testimony justified the inference that the icebox and oil tank had been moved by him in getting at the pipes, and it is claimed on his behalf that the judgment of twenty-five dollars rendered by the justice was compensation for the injuries done to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>articles. There was no evidence, however, of the amount of \u25a0 damage inflicted by the plumber, since there was no proof of what it would cost to repair the articles in question. The plaintiff testified that the icebox cost him thirteen dollars and the oil tank twenty-five dollars three years before the trial, but this was no evidence of the cost of repairs. Nor can we say from the record before us that no part of the damages was awarded by the justice for the loss of the groceries. He admitted proof of their value under the objection of defendant, although there was not the slightest evidence that defendant was responsible for abstracting them. No damages were allowable for entry upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, because it was the landlord\u2019s privilege, as well as duty, to make repairs necessary for the fixtures common to the. whole house, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
