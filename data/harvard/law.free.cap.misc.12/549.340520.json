Boyden, Respondent, <em>v. </em>Austin P. Baldwin et al., Appellants.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b585-13\">(City Court of New York</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A9Y\">General Term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZq\">May, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b585-14\">An employment of a sales agent by a servant of the employer is fully ratified by the subsequent conduct of the employer in filling orders obtained by such agent and paying him commissions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Open oral agreements to pay commissions on future sales of merchandise are legal and valid obligations, and are enforcible until terminated by some act of the parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b586-7\">A sales agent is entitled to his\" commissions, notwithstanding the participation of friends in the procurement of the orders.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">Appeal from judgment in favor of the plaintiff, entered upon a verdict directed by the court, and from order denying motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-9\"><em>Seward, Guthrie, Morawetz c&amp; Steele, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-10\"><em>Samuel G.

This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The plaintiff was entitled to his commissions notwithstanding the participation of friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">It is not contended that the friendly assistance plaintiff received in any way increased defendants\u2019 liability to pay commissions to others, nor can it be denied that they got the benefit of the orders so obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The appellants do not urge any of the rulings of the trial judge as error, and on all the facts we are of the opinion that the direction made by the trial judge was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">Fitzsimons, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
