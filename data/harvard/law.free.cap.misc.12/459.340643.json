The jfiaintiff is an infant under the age of twenty-one, and sues by her guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The defendant makes a motion for an order compelling plaintiff to give security for costs, on the ground that she is an infant whose guardian <em>ad litem </em>has not given such security. See Code, \u00a7 3268, subd. 5. At the same time, the plaintiff makes a motion, under section 458 of the Code, for leave to sue as a poor person. There can be no question that section 458 of the Code, providing that \u201c a poor person, not being of ability to sue, may apply, by petition, to the court for leave to prosecute as a poor person,\u201d applies to infants as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>well as adults. See <em>Tobias </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>39 N. Y. St. Repr. 183; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>10 N. Y. Supp. 474. As it is in the discretion of the court to allow an action to be prosecuted in- <em>forma pcmperis, </em>an infant plaintiff, suing by her guardian <em>ad litem, </em>may be permitted to sue in such form, in spite of the provisions of section 3268 of the Code, subdivision 5, to the effect that defendant, in such case, may require security for costs. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Lns. Co., supra. </em>These two motions are made at the same time, and the facts necessary to justify each of the orders asked for are shown. In such case, it seems to me that the motion for leave to prosecute in <em>forma pauperis </em>should be granted, and the motion for security for costs should be denied. See <em>Hotaling </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>7 Civ. Proc. Rep. 320. Mo costs of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
