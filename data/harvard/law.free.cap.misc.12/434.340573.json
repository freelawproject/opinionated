J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANF\">The plaintiff and defendant operated under the agreement of January 3, 1887, and the result was a loss which defendant fully paid up to plaintiff\u2019s firm. The plaintiff then claimed the sum of $5,000 under the guaranty in the sixth clause of the agreement. Such claim remained unsettled until about January 3, 1893, when it was settled between the parties by defendant giving the note bearing interest which is the basis of the claim in this action. The defense upon the trial was that the agreement of 1887 by which $5,000 of profits were guaranteed to the plaintiff was usurious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and that the note in suit, being given pursuant to such agreement, was void. This defense seems to have been established. While the defense of usury was not pleaded upon the return day, it was pleaded at the trial and proof taken thereof without objection. Respondent cannot be heard to object for the first time upon appeal that the defense was not pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Usury is made out by the contract itself, which clearly secured, and was intended to secure, to the plaintiff a compensation in excess of legal interest for advancing the sums necessary to carry on the defendant\u2019s contemplated speculation in American Cotton Oil Trust stock. It is argued that the agreement on plaintiff\u2019s part was not for a loan of money, but merely for a sale of his credit by the aid of which defendant was enabled to procure money from plaintiff\u2019s firm, and for which sale of credit the parties were entitled to agree upon whatever compensation they thought fit. Such is the rule where the agreement is for the sale of credit merely and there is no negotiation nor agreement for or about a loan and no loan is made. A man has as good a right to sell his credit as he has to sell his goods or his lands, and if he deal fairly he may take as large a price as he can get for either of them. <em>More </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>4 Den. 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">But this agreement was plainly for an advance of money by plaintiff on defendant\u2019s behalf and not a sale of credit, for the agreement between the parties provides: \u201c <em>Fourth. </em>C. E. Orvis guarantees that the account shall be carried for a period of six months from this date and agrees to furnish $4,500 for each 100 shares.\u201d Besides this, the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence was that he <em>\u201c </em>was the capitalist to furnish the money; \u201d that he \u201c advanced all the money; \u201d that he <em>\u201c </em>was to furnish the capital; \u201d that he <em>\u201c </em>furnished the money,\u201d and he did so through his own firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">It is also argued that the agreement was between partners, and that such agreements are not affected by the usury laws. This is so because the relation of debtor and creditor does not exist in the ordinary sense between partners. 27 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 1016, and cases cited; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Freer, </em>91 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Y. 43. The partners may stipulate for more than legal interest on overdrafts hy each other and the transaction is not usurious, because the excess of interest is paid into the firm and swells the profits in which the borrowing partner ultimately shares, and also because the proportionate amounts of capital contributed by each as fixed in the copartnership agree ment are altered by such overdrafts, and, as pointed out in the case last cited, one partner might receive profits at the rate of twenty per cent or more upon the amount he left in the business, while others would receive a much smaller percentage upon their investments. These reasons do not apply to the present case. The loan was not an incident to a permanent and continuing partnership relation, but began and ended with and was the basis of the so-called partnership, the agreement in question being manifestly nothing more than an agreement for a loan to enable a customer of the plaintiff\u2019s firm to operate in a particular stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">No partnership in a proper sense existed between the parties. The plaintiff took none of the risks of a partner as distinguished from those of a lender of money. He stood in no danger of losing the capital he furnished, because he was to receive that back in any event; he did not even stand in any danger of losing the use of his money, because he was to receive at least $5,000 profits in excess of six per cent interest however disastrously the venture might result; he was not exposed to any liability as a partner for the acts of his copartner, because the transaction was such that the copartner could obtain no ostensible authority and the agreement was such that he had no authority in fact to bind the plaintiff. He could deal only with the firm to which the plaintiff belonged and the plaintiff was under no risk except that which pertains to every loan of money, <em>i. e., </em>the inability of his debtor to repay.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In cases of ordinary partnership the evils which the usury laws are designed to prevent are not likely to occur where over-drafts are contemplated as possible and provided for on terms fixed in advance; but it would be too easy to evade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>such laws if agreements like the present were exempted from their operation, for a more convenient cover for usury could not possibly be devised. Rot only improvident speculators, but necessitous borrowers, could be forced to pay illegal rates for money under the mask of a partnership between the lender, or one of the lender\u2019s firm, and the speculator or borrower. Such pretended partnership could embrace operations in stock of some standard value with a guaranty of exorbitant profits to the lender, and usury be thus legally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">As the usurious character of the original contract prevents its enforcement by the plaintiff, he acquired no better right by taking the note of the defendant in pursuance of its terms, whether as security for the whole sum claimed or as a compromise of such claim. Contracts void by usury are incapable of being made valid by a new agreement based upon the original consideration. Where a security void by usury is given up and a new one taken, that is also void. <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Archer, </em>76 N. Y. 196. Had plaintiff taken defendant\u2019s note for the whole amount of the guaranty it would have been void for usury if the agreement was void for that reason, and a note taken for a less amount than the guaranty stands on no better footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The fact that such note was received on what is cabed a compromise of the plaintiff\u2019s demand under the agreement does not make it any more enforcible than the original agreement would have been. Otherwise part of the usurious claim would always be collectible under the pretense of a compromise. While it is the general rule that, upon the compromise of a disputed claim, the original consideration will not be the subject of inquiry, nor the debtor be permitted to set up defenses based thereon, this rule does not apply to claims made in contravention of pxiblie policy or express statute. The taking of usury is not only forbidden by statute, and all securities given in pursuance thereof declared void, but the act is made a misdemeanor by the criminal law. Ro holder of usurious paper can, therefore, pretend to an honest belief of a legal claim such as is necessary to support a compromise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>and prevent an inquiry into the original consideration for securities taken in settlement. Any claim may be sufficient consideration to support a compromise provided that the claimant honestly supposed that a valid claim existed, however mistaken he might have been <em>(Dovale </em>v. Ackerman, 11 Misc. Rep. 245); but the holder of a usurious security can have no such honest conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The note which is th\u00bf basis of this action is, therefore, affected by the illegality of the agreement and transaction which form the consideration of it and no recovery should have been allowed the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Bischoff and Pryob, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
