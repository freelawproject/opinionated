Hayes, 8 Misc. Rep. 211; 59 N. Y. St. Repr. 221; 28 N. Y. Supp. 519. This judgment will have to be reversed for error in charging, at plaintiff\u2019s request, a proposition which cannot be defended upon reason or authority. The court had already instructed the jury at plaintiff\u2019s request that <em>\u201c </em>the rule is unqualified that a master is bound to use all reasonable care, diligence and caution in providing for the safety of those in his employ and furnishing for their use in his work safe, sound and suitable tools, implements, appliances and machinery in the prosecution thereof and keeping the same in repair. This is the master\u2019s duty, and he cannot exempt himself from liability for this omission by delegating its performance to another, or, having required work to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>done, by omitting precautions and inquiries as to the manner of its performance,\u201d and had also charged in continuation, at plaintiff\u2019s request, seven other propositions, enlarging upon the principle in every conceivable particular. Finally, at plaintiff\u2019s request, the court charged the next proposition as follows: \u201c The duty of the master to the servant is to the result that the servant shall be under no risks from imperfect or inadequate machinery or other material means and appliances, or from unskillful or incompetent fellow-servants of any grade. It is for the master to do by himself or by-some other.\u201d To this instruction the defendant duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">This last instruction, following those that preceded it, summed up the whole duty of the master as undertaking to insure the servant from all risks from the perils named, and whatever impression the jury,received from the prior instructions as to the master\u2019s duty being confined to reasonable care, diligence and caution was thus explained to be that he was by himself or another to save the servant harmless from imperfect or inadequate machinery, means and appliances and from unskillful or incompetent fellow-servants of any grade. That is not the master\u2019s duty. He is liable only for negligence. 14 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 813 <em>et seq. </em>His negligence is the. omission of reasonable care in the business in which his servants are employed. <em>Slater </em>v. Jewett, 85 N. Y. 61. The test of his liability is not whether he neglected something he could have done, but whether he is reasonably prudent and careful. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>70 N. Y. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Judgment reversed, new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Bookstaver and Bischoef, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
