It is a general rule of practice that an affidavit upon which an order for the examination of a party before trial is made, which is entirely upon information and belief, and which states the source of such information, but does not assign any reason why an affidavit is not made by the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>from whom the information is obtained, is insufficient, and the order should be vacated. See <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>17 Civ. Proc. Rep. 199; <em>Koehler </em>v. <em>Sewards, </em>29 N. Y. St. Repr. 364; <em>Matter of Bronson, </em>78 Hun, 351. It, therefore, seems to me that the order must be vacated. However, as it is discretionary with the court to make an order for defendant\u2019s examination after having vacated a former one (see <em>Simpson </em>v. Budd, 9 Reporter 489), the plaintiff may renew the application on proper affidavits, upon payment to defendant\u2019s attorney of ten dollars costs of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Motion to vacate order granted, with leave to renew on payment of ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
