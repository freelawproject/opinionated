Judgment for the defendant. Amount paid into court is sufficient to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As there was no evidence of tender before suit, we are to assume that no such plea was intended by the answer, and that the seventeen dollars and five cents was meant to be a tender at the time of the joining of issue. The provisions of the Code authorizing tender after suit brought (\u00a7 731 <em>et seq.), </em>do not appear to be made applicable to District Courts (\u00a7 3347, subd. 6), and if they were there was yet no tender of costs and it was ineffectual. <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>82 N. Y. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">If the offer of judgment allowed by the old Code (\u00a7\u00a7 64, 68) is still applicable to District Courts, then that practice was not pursued in this, case, for there was no offer of judgment made.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">As the justice found that the plaintiff had a claim which the money paid into court was sufficient to satisfy, he should have rendered judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount due. He could only render judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on proof that tender had been made before suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Bischoff and Pryor, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
