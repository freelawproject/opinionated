This is an action brought by a receiver in a creditor\u2019s action to have priorities determined after conflicting claims had been made against the same fund remaining in his hands after a final judgment. The jurisdiction of a court of equity to entertain such an action is firmly established. It is no answer to say that the same result might be reached by motion. This is always doubtful, for even if the power should exist in a particular case to pass upon1 conflicting claims in a summary way, yet if a conflict as to the facts should be presented by the affidavits of the different parties in interest, the exercise of the power may be declined and the parties left to their remedy by action.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Sedgwick, Oh.
