Pridham, 3 E. D. Smith, 155 ; <em>Howard </em>v. Brown, <em>2 </em>id. 247; <em>Vorzimer </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>6 Misc. Rep. 143 ; <em>Jacobs </em>v. <em>Zeltner, </em>9 id. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In this case plaintiff, the assignee of the cause of action,, recovered a judgment for seventy-five dollars, apparently the supposed value of certain chattels alleged to have been converted by defendant, but no proper proof of this value appears from the record, and the judgment, therefore, is not to be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The cause of action for conversion, upon which plaintiff undoubtedly could sue as assignee <em>(Baumamn </em>v. <em>Jefferson, </em>4 Misc. Rep. 147), was predicated of defendant\u2019s failure to return, upon demand, certain household furniture belonging to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, the original possession of which- by defendant was in no way tortious. Dpon the question of damages the only proof adduced was the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s witness, given in answer to the question as to the value of the chattels, <em>\u201c </em>What is their value to-day ? \u201d The proof thus received fails to afford a basis for the recovery below.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">The property was not shown to be in nature fluctuating as to market value, and no element of malice appeared in the case; thus, there was nothing to justify a departure from the well-established rule that the recovery should be limited to-the value of the chattel at the date of the conversion, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>interest. <em>Wehle </em>v. <em>Haviland, </em>69 N. Y. 448; 5 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 40, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We are not to assume, in the absence of proof, that the value at the date of the trial, as given,, was not greater than at the date of plaintiff\u2019s demand, which, by reason of various conceivable causes, it might actually have become.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. Restitution ordered of the amount paid by the appellant in satisfaction of the iudgment here reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Giegebich, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event, and restitution ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
