The vendee then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>gave notice that it would not keep the amount actually delivered unless the bill was made payable September second, which was refused unless the entire contract was canceled. The vendee refused to consent to this condition and never returned the goods. <em>Meld, </em>that the vendor\u2019s default in making delivery according to the contract was waived by the retention of the goods; that the vendee\u2019s refusal in advance to make the payment as called for by the contract absolved the vendor from further performance, and that his abandonment of the contract as an entirety did not make him liable for a failure to make a delivery of the second lot.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">Hotioh for a new trial upon exceptions directed to be heard in the first instance at the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>George M.

We have delayed answering your letter as we preferred to fully consider the matter and advise ourselves on the subject. The contract we had with you speaks for itself, and we shall hold you responsible for its strict performance; we are, however, ready to carry out our proposition of the 8th inst.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Of the same date from plaintiff\u2019s intestate in reply: \u201cYours of the 13th at hand. I understood from your previous letters that you wanted to return the 25 packages rubber lately shipped you, and I agreed to this and am waiting for them, and would like to know if you are going to return them or not. If your factory is now closed you certainly knew this when I notified you that I had 25 packets for you. Your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>answer indicated to ship them, which I did. As for changing the contract I cannot do it. Either you take the goods as per contract, and as they arrive, or, if you wish, return the 25 baskets and cancel the sale. * * * I would like to know positively what you are going to do in regard to the 25 baskets, as your delay is causing me a loss,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">From defendant July fourteenth: \u201cWe are in receipt of your yesterday\u2019s favor and confirm for the third and last time that we are ready to return the 25 baskets of rubber, but not with the condition that we cancel the contract \u2014 which we absolutely decline to do. If you wish to receive this rubber without conditions we shall be glad to return it to you as soon as we hear from you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">To which plaintiff\u2019s intestate replied July fifteenth : \u201c Yours of 14th inst. at hand. I will not receive the 25 baskets unless upon the condition that the contract is canceled, as I would be at a loss were I to take them back now and tender them to some one else. I, therefore, return the bill to you for them.\u201d The next letter sent in the course of this correspondence follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">\u201cNew York, <em>Jul/y 18th, </em>1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201c Goodyear Vulcanite Co., City:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\u201c Dear Sirs.\u2014 I have notice of shipment of 23 baskets G. S. Borneo rubber which is due here about the 20th inst. As no shipping instructions are necessary I shall ship this to your factory as usual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\u201c Yours truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u201c Robert Soltau,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">\u201c P. T. Betts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">This letter was returned to Mr. Soltau by defendant bearing the statement: \u201cWill only accept the above payable Sept. 2nd. Goodyear Vulcanite Co., &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">Upon July twenty-first the defendant'wrote: \u201c Having received no corrected bill from you we have returned to you the twenty-five baskets of Borneo rubber. There seems nothing left to us but to adhere strictly to the contract.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">As a matter of fact the rubber was never returned, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>appeared that on the twenty-first of July the vendor\u2019s agent Betts had acceded to the proposition of defendant and had made the hill payable September second, in ignorance of the fact that Mr. Soltau had died on the nineteenth. Upon learning of this fact, Betts wrote to defendant, under date of July twenty-sixth, informing it of the death and the consequent nullity of his act after the agency had terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">It was admitted that the defendant\u2019s damage, resulting from the nondelivery of the rubber called for by the contract, was as claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Upon the trial a verdict was directed for the plaintiff, and the defendant\u2019s exceptions presenting the point as to the correctness of the ruling disallowing the counterclaim, and refusing a submission to the jury of the issue claimed to be raised by the evidence given in its support, are before us for review in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The determination of the court at Trial Term proceeded upon the ground that the defendant, and not Soltau, was first in fault, and that, by refusing to perform the contract according to its terms as to payment, the former committed a breach which entitled the latter to abandon further performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">It was held by the learned judge that the defendant could not now urge the vendor\u2019s default of strict delivery under the contract, in that by its answer of July first to the vendor\u2019s letter of June twenty-eighth, with no mention of the fact that the time for delivery had expired, it had waived such delivery during the last half of June, and, furthermore, had accepted and used the goods delivered; that, therefore, it could not avail itself of the claim that there was in that regard a breach upon the part of the vendor.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">An extension of time for the performance of a contract operates as a waiver of forfeiture for delay <em>(Gallagher </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>60 N. Y. 438), yet knowledge of the facts constituting the forfeiture is essential. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>88 N. Y. 545; <em>People </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>46 Barb. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">A party to'a contract will be estopped from asserting the other party\u2019s default where he has induced such party to act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>upon the reasonable belief that he will waive such default, and the party so acting has been misled by his reliance upon that belief (7 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, 32, and cases cited), but the basis of such an estoppel is an action induced upon the part of the party seeking to avail of it. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>75 N. Y. 560; <em>Dezell </em>v. Odell, 3 Hill, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">It would, perhaps, seem that, from the evidence in this case, the jury might have found facts sufficient to support an inference that the defendant\u2019s agent, Sonneborn, when writing on July first from Morrisville, Penn., in answer to Soltau\u2019s letter of June twenty-eighth, addressed to defendant\u2019s Hew York office, was acting under a mistaken assumption of fact that the goods had been delivered in Hew York before the end of June. See <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., supra. </em>Ho agreed place of delivery was specified in the contract, and in such a case it is to be assumed that the goods are to be at the buyer\u2019s disposal at the place where they are sold, in the absence of circumstances leading to an inference of a contrary intent. 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 526, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Hor was the vendor induced by this letter to forego delivery within the time required by the contract, since it was not received until after that period had elapsed, and, furthermore, there was no proof that he had the capacity to perform within the time. <em>Eddy </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>116 N. Y. 247; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Plimpton Co., </em>55 id. 484; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>86 id. 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">But, assuming that there was a question for the jury upon the issue of the waiver of June delivery, there is another question in the case which, if it be determined, as matter of law, adversely to the defendant, necessarily renders this prior Question of fact immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">This question relates to the defendant\u2019s acceptance and retention of the goods delivered after the lapse of the agreed time for delivery, and, we think, calls for an answer which fully supports the conclusion reached below.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">' The defendant, assuming a default upon the part of Soltau, took the position that the goods should be returned and the latter charged with a breach of the contract, the damages for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>which breach might be lessened by his subsequent deliveries of rubber, a position consistent with defendant\u2019s legal rights. But unfortunately for its present contention this position was not maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It offered to retain the rubber upon condition that payment therefor under the contract should be deferred to the last period of payment for goods to be subsequently delivered, and refused to accept other goods of .the earlier delivery except upon the same terms. To this Soltau did not accede, but insisted that a return of the goods would cancel the contract and claimed payment according to its terms if the rubber were retained by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Assuming the fact of his previous default, his claim that a return of the goods would cancel the contract was legally unsupported, and defendant\u2019s right to return them, with no loss of its existing remedy upon the contract, unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The return might, in view of Soltau\u2019s position, have merely put him further in default, but the fact remains that the defendant, still insisting that no payment on August second, as called for by the contract, would be made, continued to retain the goods thus tardily delivered, and at no time returned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">By this the vendor\u2019s default was waived. <em>Bock </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>8 Daly, 156; <em>Baldwin </em>v. Farnsworth, 10 Maine, 414; 25 Am. Dec. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The objection to the date of delivery, as reiterated by defendant in its letters, is not to affect the significance of its continued retention of the goods, and its definite and unretracted assertion of a determination to refuse payment on August second must be taken as a justification for the vendor\u2019s abandonment of further performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">As was said in the case of <em>Chapman </em>v. Morton, 11 M. <em>&amp; </em>W. 534, by Lord Abingeb, 0. B.: \u201c We must judge of men\u2019s intentions by their acts and not by expressions in letters which are contrary to their acts. If the defendant intended to renounce the contract he ought to have given the plaintiffs distinct notice at once that he repudiated the goods. * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Instead of taking this course the defendant has exposed himself to the imputation of playing fast and loose, declaring in his letters that he will not accept the goods, but at the same time preventing the plaintiffs from dealing with them as theirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">By reason of the defendant\u2019s definite and concededly unretracted refusal in advance to perform the contract Soltau was absolved from any duty of further performance <em>(Shaw </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>69 N. Y. 286; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>47 Barb. 574), and the defendant being charged with the first fault, his abandonment of the contract in its entirety laid him open to no liability for a failure to make delivery of the second lot of rubber as called for -during the last half of August, assuming the contract to have been in its nature divisible. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>102 N. Y. 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">As to the effect of the letter sent by the agent, Betts, on July twenty-first (two days after the death of Soltau), acquiescing in the extension of payment proposed by defendant, it can avail the defendant nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">While, in the case of a mere revocation of authority in fact, notice is required to be given by the principal in order that he may not be bound should the agent continue in his usual course of dealing in transactions wherein he had theretofore been recognized as such by all parties <em>(Barkley </em>v. <em>R. R. Co., </em>71 N. Y. 205 ; <em>McNeilly </em>v. <em>Ins. Co., </em>66 id. 23 ; <em>Claflin </em>v. <em>Lenheim, </em>Id. 301), yet in the case of the termination of an agency, when not coupled with an interest, by the death of the principal, the question is determined upon different principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The rule at common law which determines the authority of an agent by the death of his principal is well settled, and no notice is necessary to relieve the estate of the principal of responsibility, even on contracts into which the agent had entered with third persons who were ignorant of his death. Those who deal with an agent are held to assume the risk that his authority may be terminated by death without notice to them. <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Bridgman, </em>113 N. Y. 605.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The conclusion is that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not chargeable with a breach of the contract npon the evidence adduced, and the direction of a verdict in favor of the plaintiff upon her admitted cause of action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Exceptions overruled and judgment for plaintiff as directed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Bookstaver and Gibgerioh, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Exceptions overruled and judgment ordered for plaintiff as directed below, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
