J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEg\">The plaintiff was engaged in the city of New York and its suburbs in business as wholesale dealer in cheese, butter and groceries, its sales being mainly effected through the medium of salesmen driving over established routes and supplying goods- to grocers doing business in the line of such routes.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The defendant entered into the employment of the plaintiff\u2019s predecessor as one of its salesmen, driving a wagon over plaintiff\u2019s routes, and the defendant contracted with the company, among other things, \u201c that he would not, within the period of six months after his employment in said business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>should, cease, directly or indirectly engage in business in the city of Yew York, or within a radius of ten miles from said city, in competition with his said employer, either on his own account or as a servant or employee of others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The defendant afterwards was duly discharged from plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Since the discharge the defendant has driven a horse and wagon, carrying supplies of the same kind that plaintiff does business in, soliciting customers of the plaintiff on the same routes that he formerly used.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">The order below enjoined the defendant from continuing this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">There is an objection that an injunction will not be granted because the services of the defendant Avere not unique, special or extraordinary. Premising by saying that this applies to a case where, at the time the injunction is asked, the services are claimed by the plaintiff in the action in his business, it appears that the plaintiff here asks for no service, and does ask that the defendant shall perform his promise not to compete with it or take away its customers. This objection must be' overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Another objection is that the plaintiff took an agreement that $300 deposited with it should be liquidated damages for any breach by defendant. This objection is invalidated by <em>Diamond Match Co. </em>v. Roeber, 106 N.
