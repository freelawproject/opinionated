G. F. Wable, Jr., was duly elected its secretary, and that a subcommittee was appointed, to be known as the art committee, consisting of the defendants Perry Belmont, Bobert J. Iiognet and J. Armstrong Chandler, together with Messrs. D. F. Appleton, Albert S. Bickmore, Morris K. Jessup, Daniel G. Thompson and L. P. Di Cesnola; that on or about the 24tli day of August, 1892, the defendants in this action got together and, in conjunction with a number of persons not members of said art committee, and in the absence of the other members of the last-mentioned committee, the}7, said defendants, assumed to act as the said art committee, and as if they formed a quorum thereof, and resolved \u00a3\u00a3 to order 400,000 lampions from Olifiers; \u201d that the plaintiff prior to such meeting had furnished to said committee, at its request, an estimate for the manufacture and delivery of such lampions fitted with hangers and chains at a cost of eighty dollars per thousand, and agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>that he would take hack unbroken glasses at the rate of ten dollars a thousand; that after the adoption of said resolution Secretary Wahle wrote the following letter to the plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201c <em>August </em>26, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201c B.

That there is a defect of parties defendant, in that D. F. Appleton, Albert S. Bickmore, Morris K. Jessup, Daniel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Gr. Thompson and L. P. Di Cesnola, the other members of said art committee mentioned in the complaint, and Charles Gr. F. Wahle are not made defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u201c II. That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u201c III. That several causes of action have been improperly united, one being upon a contract of sale; a second in contract upon an implied warranty; a third in tort for fraud, and a fourth in tort for negligence of a public officer.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The defendant Chandler also demurred on grounds the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\"><em>\u201c First. </em>That there is a defect of parties defendant, in that Messrs. D. F. Appleton, Albert S. Bickmore, Morris K. Jessup, Daniel Gr. Thompson and L. P. Di Cesnola and O. G-. F. Wahle are not made defendants herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>That several causes of action have been improperly united; the first being a claim on contract of sale, and the second a claim on contract for breach of an implied warranty, and the third a claim in tort for fraud, and the fourth a claim in tort for negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\u201c <em>Third. </em>That the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The plaintiff seeks to charge the defendants upon the theory that one who assumes to act for a principal without authority, and draws another into a contract upon the assumption of such agency, is liable to an action in favor of the party injured <em>(Dung </em>v. Parker, 52 N. Y. 494); but as was said by the court in <em>Hall </em>v. Lauderdale, 46 N. Y. 70,75 : \u201c The rule that the agent is liable when he acts without authority is founded upon the supposition that there has been some wrong or omission on his part, either in misrepresenting or in affirming or concealing the authority under which he assumes to act.\u201d In that case the question was the authority possessed by a board of supervisors, and the court held that \u201c the boundaries of their power were known as well to the plaintiff as to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">One who deals with a public agent is charged with knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>edge of the law conferring his authority. <em>Mayor of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Reydolds, </em>20 Md. 1; 83 Am. Dec. 535 ; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Des Moines, </em>19 Iowa, 199 ; 87 Am. Dec. 423; <em>Whiteside </em>v. <em>United States, </em>93 U. S. 247; Mechem Public Offices <em>&amp; </em>Officers, \u00a7 809, note 2 and citations. In the present case the powers of the committee could have been ascertained by the plaintiff by a reference to the public statute (Ohap. 331, Laws of 1892), from which he would have learned that \u201c the power to make contracts involving the expenditure of money \u201d could be delegated by the committee oE 100 only to the executive committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The rule applicable to such cases is stated by Judge Dillon in his work on Municipal Corporations, volume 1, at page 263, note, to be as follows: <em>\u201c </em>Where the officers of a public or municipal corporation, acting officially, and under an innocent mistake of the law, in which the other contracting party equally participated, with equal opportunities\u00bbof knowledge, neither party at the time looking to personal liability, the officers are not in such case personally liable nor is the corporation liable,\u201d which statement is supported by a citation of numerous authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In Story on Agency, seventh edition, at section 307a, note 1, page 380, the learned author says: \u201c It has always seemed to us that the result of all the cases upon this point would not involve a public officer in any personal responsibility, where he was understood to be acting in his official capacity and not intending to assume any personal responsibility, and all the facts in regard to the extent of his authority were made known to the party with whom he contracted at the time of the contract, or where the authority was matter of public record and personally known to the other party. In such cases the promisee must take the risk of the promisor being able to bind his principal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>4 Minn. 126, 139; 77 Am. Dec. 502, 506, Emmett, Oh. J., in speaking for the court, said: \u201c When public agents, in good faith, contract with parties having full knowledge of the extent of their authority, or who have equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>means of knowledge with themselves, they do not become individually liable, unless the intent to incur a personal responsibility is clearly expressed, although it should be found that through ignorance of the law they may have exceeded their authority. * * * In this, as in all other cases, the intention of the parties governs, and when a person known to 'be a public officer contracts with reference to the public matters committed to his charge he is presumed to act in his official capacity only, although the contract may not in terms allude to the character in which he acts, unless the officer by unmistakable language assumes a personal liability, or is guilty of fraud or misrepresentatiop. Being a public agent, with his powers and duties prescribed by law, the extent of his powers are presumed to be as well known to all with whom he contracts as to himself. When, therefore, there is no want of good faith, a party contracts with such an officer with his eyes open, and has no one to blame if it should afterwards appear that the officer had not the authority which it was supposed he had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u2022 The foregoing extract is quoted by Mr. Mechem in his treatise on the Law of Public Offices and Officers at section 809, and he cites numerous authorities in support of the statements therein contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">To the same effect as the case last above cited are the cases of <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>21 Wis. 197; 91 Am. Dec. 468; <em>New York, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Harbison, </em>16 Fed. Rep. 688, and those cited under a note to 91 Am. Dec. at p. 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>42 Ind. 106,113, Osborne, Oh. J., in speaking for the court, said: <em>\u201c </em>If his authority to act is defined by public statute, all who contract with him will be presumed to know the extent of his authority, and cannot allege their ignorance as a ground for charging him with acting in excess of such authority, unless he knowingly mislead the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">It follows, therefore, that the defendants cannot be charged personally simply because they failed to bind their principal, as no intention to interpose their personal responsibility can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>be presumed from the fact of such failure. Neither does the complaint aver such an intention, or any facts which would warrant an inference thereof, nor is any misrepresentation or bad faith alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The conclusion thus reached upon the authorities is equally consonant with reason and public policy. It would be difficult to secure competent men to serve the public in many important capacities should it be held that they did so to the peril of their private fortunes in case of any mistake as to the scope of their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defendants gratuitously rendered public service of an onerous nature, and no hardship is apparent in the requirement that one dealing with them, with a view to private gain, should assume the risk attendant upon his failure to inform himself as to the extent of the powers conferred upon them by public statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">These views dispense with the necessity of considering the objections of nonjoinder of defendants and misjoinder of causes of action, and it follows, therefore, that the demurrers should be sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend within twenty days upon payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Demurrers sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend upon payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
