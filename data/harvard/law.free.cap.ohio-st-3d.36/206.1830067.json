We also concur in the board\u2019s conclusion that respondent\u2019s misconduct requires a severe sanction. We cannot ignore, however, the evidence suggesting respondent\u2019s compulsion to gamble, and that this compulsion contributed significantly to the circumstances from which this complaint arose. Moreover, we are impressed with the mitigating evidence which substantiates that, notwithstanding the instant misconduct, respondent\u2019s competence as a criminal defense practitioner is recognized by members of the judiciary and the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The foregoing persuades us that a sanction other than disbarment is needed in this case. Therefore, it is ordered that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. It is further ordered that no petition for reinstatement filed on respondent\u2019s behalf be considered for a period of two years from the date of this decision and then only upon the submission by clear and convincing proof of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">(1) that respondent has overcome any compulsive gambling condition with which he may be afflicted, such that he is demonstrably rehabilitated, and</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">(2) that respondent has made full restitution with respect to the matters which led to his convictions for violating R.C. 2913.11, as well as all sums owed due to respondent\u2019s involvement in efforts to purchase the Winner\u2019s Circle Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Douglas, Wright and H.
