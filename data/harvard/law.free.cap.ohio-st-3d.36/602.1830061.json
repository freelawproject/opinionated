Sweeney in case No. CR 207297 in the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County are insufficient to sustain a finding of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Further, the allegations are substantially the same as those filed in a previous affidavit in this same case, which was dismissed by entry dated September 8, 1987 (No. 87-AP-195).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Trial of this case is scheduled for November 2, 1987, less than one week from the filing of this latest affidavit. To permit a party to repeatedly file affidavits of disqualification would provide that party with an easy means of delaying trial. <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>White Properties, Inc. </em>(1985), 28 Ohio App. 3d 37, 28 OBR 47, 501 N.E. 2d 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">For these reasons, the affidavit of disqualification is found not well-taken and is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
