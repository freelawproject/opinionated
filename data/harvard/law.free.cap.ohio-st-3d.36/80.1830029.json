In addition, appellant neither timely objected to nor raised below the errors alleged in propositions of law twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-nine, fifty-one, fifty-two and fifty-three, and has thus waived them: <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St. 2d 112, 5 O.O. 3d 98, 364 N.E. 2d 1364, vacated in part on other grounds (1978), 438 U.S. 911; <em>Schade, supra; Fanning, supra; State </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 92, 26 OBR 79, 497 N.E. 2d 55. Our review of the record in each instance has failed to establish the presence of plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 91, 7 O.O. 3d 78, 372 N.E. 2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Scott, supra, </em>at 103, 26 OBR at 88-89, 497 N.E. 2d at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">In summary, we find no merit in the propositions of law raised by appellant relevant to the proceedings below or to the constitutionality of this state\u2019s death penalty scheme. Proceeding to our independent weighing of the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors presented herein, we note that appellant\u2019s three aggravated murder convictions specify fifteen separate aggravating circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>under R.C. 2929.04. However, as pointed out by appellant in his first proposition of law, for purposes of sentencing the doctrine of merger applies herein. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>paragraph five of the syllabus. Each aggravated murder count should thus contain only one specification that appellant\u2019s acts were part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons. R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Similarly, specifications pursuant to R.C. 2929. 04(A)(3) (escaping detection, apprehension, trial or punishment) and R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) (felony murder) are duplicative of and thus merge with R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), since these aggravating circumstances arise from the same indivisible course of conduct. Although the court of appeals did not apply the merger doctrine below, we have determined that the jury\u2019s consideration of the duplicative aggravating circumstances during sentencing did not affect their verdict. <em>Jenkins, supra. </em>Furthermore, we have independently determined that the remaining aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Of the mitigating factors specified in R.C. 2929.04(B) appellant relied solely on his allegation that he lacked, due to a mental disease or defect, substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law at the time of committing the offenses. R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Although there was testimony that appellant had characteristics of borderline and schizotypal personality disorders, the bulk of the testimony, from both defense and rebuttal expert witnesses, established that appellant was sane at the time of the acts, that he could have refrained from committing them, had he so chosen, and that..he understood the nature of his acts but elected to carry them out anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Appellant admitted to being the principal offender in three murders and two attempted murders. He did not have a significant history of prior criminal convictions or juvenile adjudications, nor was his age a factor. He was not under duress, coercion or strong provocation at the time of the crimes. His victims neither facilitated nor induced the offenses. Nothing in the nature and circumstances of these deliberate murders tempers the gravity of the offenses. We concur with the jury and lower courts that the balance of these factors lies heavily, and beyond reasonable doubt, on the side of the aggravating circumstances of which the appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Finally, considering all our prior decisions affirming a sentence of death, appellant\u2019s sentence was not arbitrarily, freakishly or capriciously applied, and is not. disproportionate to such prior sentences. Although the majority of such decisions involved a single victim, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 144, 25 OBR 190, 495 N.E. 2d 407, we affirmed a death sentence involving the murder of defendant\u2019s three sons. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the sentence of death was properly imposed upon appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, White-side, Holmes and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b112-10\">Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b112-11\">Whiteside, J., of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting for Locher, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> Appellant\u2019s merit brief, reply brief and attached appendix filed in this court comprise over nine hundred pages, all of which supplement a substantial, but average-sized, record of the proceedings in the lower courts. Although we do not presume to impose an arbitrary page limit on briefs in appeals from a sentence of death, we encourage the submission of concise, at least colorable, legal arguments, and conservative duplication of a record which we intend to exhaustively review on our own.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b112-12\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ASE\">concurring.
