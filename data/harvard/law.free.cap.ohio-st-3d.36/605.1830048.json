Studer, as grounds for the disqualification of Judge Randall L. Basinger in case No. 87 CIV 540 in the Court of Common Pleas of Allen County.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">These vague allegations are wholly without merit and are insufficient on their face for a finding of bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"AD2o\">Furthermore, this affidavit, like other affidavits of disqualification filed I f s t r <em>l </em>C c ^ v g I by this affiant, appears to have been filed solely to obtain a delay of the scheduled hearing. It is also observed that this affidavit contains language nearly identical to that found in a number of previous affidavits from Allen County. Affidavits filed to obtain a delay are an abuse of the purpose for which R.C. 2701.03 is intended, are a waste of judicial resources, and, if repeated, could result in appropriate sanctions being imposed against an offending person.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">* The affidavit filed herein is found not well-taken and is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
