We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">R.C. 2945.71 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201c(C) A person against whom a charge of felony is pending:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">\u201c(2) Shall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after his arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALE\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201c(E) For purposes of computing time under * * * [division] (C)(2) * * * of this section, each day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge shall be counted as three days. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">R.C. 2945.72 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">\u201cThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following: <em>((* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">\u201c(E) Any period of delay necessitated by reason of a plea in bar or abatement, motion, proceeding, or action made or instituted by the accused.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">The court of appeals held that appellant did not demonstrate that the trial court had taken more time than was reasonably necessary to rule on his motion to suppress. In arriving at this decision, it relied on an additional fact, developed at the hearing on the petition, that appellant was one of three co-defendants, each of whom filed motions to suppress, necessitating three separate hearings to accommodate the schedules of their counsel. Under these circumstances, we cannot say the delay was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">An appeal rather than a writ of habeas corpus is the proper remedy to challenge alleged violations of the right to a speedy trial. <em>In re Singer </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 130, 74 O.O. 2d 253, 341 N.E. 2d 849. The judgment of the court of appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-19\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
