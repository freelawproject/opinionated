Spahr to grant a continuance to plaintiffs, Linda Frazier et al., in case No. 84-S-78416 in the Court of Common Pleas of Licking County, as grounds for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">A trial judge\u2019s ruling on a motion for a continuance is not by itself evidence of bias or prejudice, and affiant does not even imply any other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Furthermore, this affidavit, as well as other affidavits of disqualification filed by this affiant, appears to have been filed solely to obtain a delay of the scheduled hearing. Affidavits filed to obtain a delay are an abuse of the purpose for which R.C. 2701.03 is intended, are a waste of judicial resources, and, if repeated, could result in appropriate action being taken against an offending person.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">The affidavit filed herein is found not well-taken and is hereby dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
