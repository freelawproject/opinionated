The application for a writ of prohibition is denied on the ground that the petitioner here will have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by appeal from any judgment rendered by said superior court in the <em>certiorari </em>proceeding, by which it may be aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Melvin, J., Shaw, J., Sloss, J., and Lawlor, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
