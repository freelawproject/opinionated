It was there said: \u201cBy the new constitution (art. II, sec. 1) residence in his election precinct for thirty days preceding the election is just as essential a condition of the right to vote as is residence in the county for ninety days, and in the state for one year. \u2019 \u2019 It is beyond the power of the legislature to make any change in the law thus declared by the constitution. There can be no question as to the correctness of the decision on this point in <em>Russell </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>83 Cal. 70, [23 Pac. 183], and it is equally clear that the enactment of May 26, 1915, is likewise in violation of the same constitutional provision, and therefore must be held to be absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed, with costs to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Lorigan, J., Lawlor, J., Sloss, J., Shaw, J., and Melvin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
