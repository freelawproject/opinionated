He veered into oncoming traffic, hit another vehicle head on, and injured the other driver. The State filed criminal charges and a jury convicted Mr. Hopkins of aggravated assault and battery, driving under the influence of a controlled substance, and unlawful use of a toxic substance. On appeal, Mr. Hopkins challenges his conviction for aggravated assault and battery.

Mr. Hopkins owned a practice in Cody, Wyoming, where he specialized in adolescent and addiction psychiatry. Mr. Hopkins personally suffers from addiction-he is an alcoholic and abuses Adderall and air dusters. His medical license was suspended in 2003 and 2010 due to his addictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hopkins maintained sobriety for periods of time, but relapsed prior to the incident due to severe financial problems. Mr. Hopkins did not seek treatment because he feared he would lose his medical license permanently. Instead, he used air dusters (inhalants) to combat \"the shakes\" and anxiety associated with alcohol withdrawal. He admitted air dusters made him light-headed, but denied that he had ever passed out from huffing prior to the incident. Mr. Hopkins abused the air dusters even though he read the warning label on the can and, as a psychiatrist, he knew the risks (including brain damage) of using air dusters and the effects of inhalants on the brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] On the morning of the incident, Mr. Hopkins used some \"duster\" shortly after he woke up. An hour later, he drove his son to school and headed to work. Mr. Hopkins began getting the shakes and stopped at his hotel room (where he lived temporarily) to get another can of Dust-Off. After he retrieved a can, Mr. Hopkins proceeded to\n   drive himself to his office. He \"possibly\" used the air duster again while driving and passed out. His vehicle veered into oncoming traffic and he hit another vehicle head on.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other driver sustained injuries and required neck surgery. A forensic toxicologist found inhalants in Mr. Hopkins' blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] In closing argument, defense counsel conceded Mr. Hopkins drove under the influence of a controlled substance and unlawfully used a toxic substance, but argued that the State failed to meet its burden on the \"knowingly\" element of the aggravated assault and battery charge. The jury convicted Mr. Hopkins of all three charges. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] Mr. Hopkins' issues on appeal all stem from his contention that he lacked the requisite mens rea for aggravated assault and battery under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 6-2-502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(ii) (LexisNexis 2017). During trial, Mr. Hopkins asserted that even though subsection (a)(ii) is a general intent crime, it nonetheless requires some purposeful intent and foreseeability. He argued that the State had to prove that he purposefully hit the victim's vehicle-not that he knowingly drove while under the influence of an inhalant. Mr. Hopkins reasoned that he could not have hit the victim's vehicle on purpose because he was passed out when he veered into oncoming traffic and, further, that the incident was not foreseeable because he had never before lost consciousness while using inhalants. The district court disagreed with Mr. Hopkins' position because it was an improper statement of the law. Consequently, the court did not allow Mr. Hopkins to argue his theory to the jury. Mr. Hopkins claims the district court erred in its ruling, which prevented him from providing a complete defense and resulted in a conviction based on insufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

Because Mr. Hopkins does not dispute that he caused bodily injury with a deadly weapon, the pertinent question is whether Mr. Hopkins voluntarily did so even though he was unconscious.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Saldana v.

And, while the voluntary act must \"concur\" with the mental fault, \"[t]he emphasis is upon results caused by the defendant, and any act or omission (with the prescribed state of mind) which causes that result will do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411641,8411667\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/137/124/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.3(c) at 617. A person, therefore, may be guilty of criminal homicide or battery even though he is unconscious or asleep at the time of the fatal or injurious impact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 618. For example, if\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   drives when he is extremely sleepy and hits another vehicle killing (or seriously injuring) a passenger, the act-which causes the death-is continuing to drive while knowing he is sleepy, which coincides with the required mental state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b613] Applying this reasoning, we have little trouble concluding that Mr. Hopkins knowingly caused bodily injury with a deadly weapon even though he was unconscious when he hit the victim's vehicle. Mr. Hopkins did not suffer an accidental loss of consciousness, as he had full knowledge of the effects inhalants have on the brain. Mr. Hopkins garnered this knowledge from his professional\n   psychiatry work specializing in addictions, his personal use of inhalants, and his reading the warning label on the air duster can. It was foreseeable that he could lose consciousness and lose control of his vehicle. Despite such knowledge, Mr. Hopkins chose to huff and drive himself to work while under the influence of an inhalant. He admitted that he possibly inhaled more along the way and a witness observed the air duster can in his lap as he was driving. Mr. Hopkins then lost consciousness, hit another vehicle, and injured the other driver. This voluntary and knowing conduct concurs with the general intent required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo.

He asserts that the district court's interpretation of \"knowingly\" in subsection (a)(ii) prevented him from presenting a complete defense and, thus, violated his due process rights.
