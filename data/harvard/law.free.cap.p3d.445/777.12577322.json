We affirm, and consider the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by designating Thomas a PFO for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sentencing purposes pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA (2015)?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The State charged Thomas with felony driving under the influence of alcohol and other offenses alleged to have been committed on July 23, 2016. Based on a prior conviction for felony escape, the State filed a notice seeking designation of Thomas as a PFO under \u00a7 46-18-502, MCA (2015). In January 2017, a jury convicted Thomas of driving with a blood alcohol content above 0.08, fourth or subsequent offense, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-406(1)(a), MCA (2015), and acquitted him of an alternative charge. Thomas sought and was granted multiple continuances of his sentencing hearing, which was not conducted by the District Court until July 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Between the time of Thomas' offense and his sentencing, the 2017 Montana Legislature passed HB 133, which prospectively amended thirty-eight sections of the Montana Code Annotated and repealed three others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Mont. Laws ch. 321. Most of HB 133's forty-four provisions addressed elements, definitions, or penalties of specific offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Mont. Laws ch. 321, \u00a7\u00a7 3-4, 6-22, 26-28, 31-39. Additionally, HB 133 changed the definition of a PFO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Mont. Laws ch. 321, \u00a7 23. Under existing law, the State could seek a PFO designation if an offender had one prior felony conviction within five years of the commission of the present offense, or had been released from a commitment imposed for the prior felony conviction within the last five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA (2015). The Legislature repealed one of the two PFO definitional sections, \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA, and revised the other definition within \u00a7 46-1-202(18), MCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Mont. Laws ch. 321, \u00a7\u00a7 23, 40. The new definition requires two predicate felony convictions before the State may seek a PFO designation, upon a third felony conviction. Further, one of the three felonies must be a sexual or violent offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-1-202(18), MCA (2017). Regarding timing, the Act was made effective on July 1, 2017. Consistent therewith, the Act included a separate applicability provision, which provided the Act would apply \"to offenses committed after June 30, 2017.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 At Thomas' July 27, 2017 sentencing hearing, his counsel acknowledged there had been a legislative revision to the PFO statute, but did not argue the change applied to Thomas. The District Court sentenced Thomas as a PFO under \u00a7 46-18-501, MCA (2015), imposing a ten-year prison sentence with no time suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 We review a criminal sentence imposing over one year of incarceration for legality.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The sections at issue, 2017 Mont. Laws, ch. 321, \u00a7\u00a7 43-44, state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 43. Effective date.\n   </strong>\n   [This act] is effective July 1, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 44. Applicability.\n   </strong>\n   [This act] applies to offenses committed after June 30, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 43 provides a special effective date making the Act effective on July 1, 2017. 2017 Mont. Laws, ch. 321, \u00a7 43. Consistent therewith, Section 44 provides that the Act, in its entirety, will apply \"to offenses committed\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   June 30, 2017.\" 2017 Mont. Laws, ch. 321, \u00a7 44 (emphasis added). Taken together, Sections 43 and 44 unquestionably provide that the revisions enacted by the Act would not apply to offenses committed prior to July 1, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 The Legislature further ensured that offenses committed prior to July 1, 2017 would continue to be governed under existing law by expressly making all of the Act's provisions, including the provision\n   <em>\n    repealing\n   </em>\n   the existing PFO definition, applicable only to offenses that occurred after June 30, 2017 (\"[This act] applies to offenses committed after June 30, 2017.\"). In other words, the repealer, as part of the Act, has no application or effect on statutes that govern offenses committed prior to July 1, 2017; rather, it operates to repeal those provisions only for offenses committed thereafter. Consequently, prior law remains effective for prior offenses. This contradicts Thomas' argument that \"[n]othing in HB 133 expressly says to apply the old PFO designation when presently sentencing an offender for an offense committed before its effective date.\" To the contrary, the Legislature deliberately retained prior law for prior offenses by limiting the repeal of prior law to post-June 30, 2017 offenses. By doing so, the Legislature conformed HB 133 to the longstanding and often constitutionally necessary principle that \"the law in effect at the time of the commission of the crime controls as to the possible sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Finley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4534011\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/276/126/#p147\">\n    276 Mont. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4534011\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/276/126/#p147\">\n    915 P.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 221 (1996) (\n   <em>\n    overruled in part by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, the law in effect at the time of Thomas' offense-specifically here, the 2015 PFO definition-remained applicable, even though his sentencing occurred after the effective date of the Act itself. This is the plain and unambiguous \"meaning of the words used.\"\n   <em>\n    Mont. Vending, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Thomas nonetheless argues that because the Act \"became effective\" before he was sentenced, and the Act contained no savings clause, he is entitled to the benefit of the ameliorative PFO definition pursuant to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    279 Mont. 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    926 P.2d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, first, although HB 133 itself went into effect on July 1, 2017, the revisions therein never \"became effective\" upon Thomas' case because they were expressly limited to future cases, while prior law was retained for prior cases, as discussed above. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   offers no support for Thomas because, unlike here, the Court there was presented with a legislative failure to \"indicate under what law a defendant who committed a criminal offense prior to the repeal should be punished.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    279 Mont. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    926 P.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If a more favorable PFO status had been made dependent upon a defendant's sentencing date, he would be incentivized to hinder and delay the process until the new law took effect.

The Montana Bill Drafting Manual 2016-written and published by the Montana Legislative Services Division \"to provide a uniform standard for bill drafting\"-distinguishes between effective dates, applicability dates, and savings clauses. It explains that \"[a]n effective date should not be included in a bill unless ... there is a reason requiring an early effective date.\" And it warns: \"Do not confuse an applicability date with an effective date.\" According to the Manual, the applicability date serves the purpose of expressly stating whether a bill applies retrospectively or prospectively, noting that \"[t]o apply retroactively, a law must expressly state that fact\" under \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA. The Manual explains that a savings clause, on the other hand, \"preserves rights and duties that already have matured or proceedings already begun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b626 These are different but related concepts. The applicability clause explains a bill's prospective or retrospective application, and the savings clause explains what law applies to \"duties that already have matured or proceedings [that] already [have] begun\" but have not\n   progressed to final judgment at the time the new bill goes into effect. The Manual explains that \"[b]ecause it is presumed that changes in the law are in full force beginning on the effective date of the act, new laws could disrupt transactions already in progress.\" Though it is possible that one clause could serve as both an applicability clause and a savings clause, it would need the requisite language for each. The Legislature recognized this, for example, when it enacted the Criminal Code of 1973. Section 45-1-103, MCA, includes three distinct subsections:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (1) The provisions of this code apply to any offense defined in this code and committed after January 1, 1974.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (2) Unless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, the provisions of this title and Title 46 govern the construction of and punishment for any offense defined outside of this code and committed after January 1, 1974, as well as the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (3) The provisions of this code do not apply to any offense defined outside of this code and committed before January 1, 1974. Such an offense must be construed and punished according to the provisions of law existing at the time of commission thereof in the same manner as if this code had not been enacted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   This statute shows plainly the Legislature's distinction between an applicability clause\n   and a savings clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b627 HB 133 contains nothing labelled as a savings clause.

The applicability clause clearly addresses amendments to offenses, but provides no clear explanation for which PFO statutes apply to pending prosecutions. Neither the general savings statute nor the applicability date expresses what PFO statute applies to \"proceedings already begun.\" Just as \u00a7 1-2-205, MCA, refers to \"criminal offenses,\" and not to sentencing laws,\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    279 Mont. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"388079\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/279/34/#p37\">\n    926 P.2d at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , HB 133 likewise refers to \"offenses,\" 2017 Mont.

For example, in one measure passed during the same session, the Legislature directly addressed a statute's prospective applicability for sentencing going forward: \"\n   <strong>\n    Applicability.\n   </strong>\n   [This act] applies to offenders who are sentenced on or after [the effective date of this act].\" 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 62, \u00a7 2 (brackets in original). Alternatively, the Legislature could have used the more comprehensive language in the sample savings clause in the Bill Drafting Manual: \"[This act] does not affect rights and duties that matured, penalties that were incurred, or proceedings that were begun before [the effective date of this act]\"-which the Legislature used in at least thirteen bills during the 2017 legislative session.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 44, \u00a7 2, ch. 55, \u00a7 9, ch. 102, \u00a7 3, ch. 244, \u00a7 15, ch. 247, \u00a7 9, ch. 320, \u00a7 15, ch. 326, \u00a7 22, ch. 339, \u00a7 11, ch. 346, \u00a7 12, ch. 367, \u00a7 29, ch. 384, \u00a7 37, ch. 389, \u00a7 11, ch. 446, \u00a7 3. HB 133 does not contain a \"clear expression of legislative intent\" that the ameliorative effects of the amended PFO statute should not apply to all persons sentenced after the act's effective date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130384\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/284/448/#p457\">\n    284 Mont. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130384\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/284/448/#p457\">\n    945 P.2d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b629 Considering the plain language of HB 133's applicability clause, the ameliorative purpose of the PFO amendments,\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   's requirement for \"a savings clause,\" and the Montana Legislature's different uses for a savings clause and an applicability clause, I agree with Thomas that the applicability date clause in HB 133 does not equate to a savings clause for the PFO statutes. If HB 133 had done no more than amend the PFO statute, the Legislature's intent may be clearer. But the bill amended many additional sections of the criminal code that define criminal offenses. The general applicability clause, evidencing an intention for those changes in criminal offenses to be\n   applied prospectively, sheds little light on the application of changes to the PFO definition to pending sentencing proceedings. This is particularly true because HB 133 as introduced repealed the PFO designation in its entirety. Later amendments reinstated the designation without amending the applicability clause. Neither the applicability date nor the savings statute, \u00a7 1-2-205, MCA, expressly preserved the 2015 PFO statute for proceedings that already were pending before the effective date. Far from a mere \"drafting error,\" Opinion, \u00b6 13, the Legislature's omission of a savings clause affects dramatically\n   the liberty of offenders like Thomas whose sentences were imposed after HB 133 became law. Thomas is entitled to be sentenced under the amended PFO statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b630 Finally, I am not persuaded by the State's argument that applying the amended PFO statute to Thomas would be unfair and would reward an offender for delaying his sentencing.
