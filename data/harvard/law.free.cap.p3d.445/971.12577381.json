The Foundation in January 2016 had made a virtually identical request but for an earlier time period.

DSHS also informed SEIU, the union representing the individual providers, and the SEIU Healthcare NW Training Partnership (Training Partnership) of the Foundation's PRA request. The Training Partnership responded by requesting from DSHS the same records the Foundation had requested. DSHS produced the records to the Training Partnership in installments on May 12 and June 9 and set deadlines for the Training Partnership to enjoin production of the records to the Foundation. But DSHS did not produce the same records to the Foundation until later. The Foundation filed suit against DSHS, claiming that DSHS's conduct in responding to the April 2017 request violated the PRA. The trial court dismissed the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 We hold that (1) the Foundation's lawsuit was not untimely even though the Foundation filed its compliant before DSHS took a final action on its PRA request, (2) DSHS's estimate of the time needed to respond was reasonable because DSHS's regional and area offices needed time to compile the responsive records, (3) DSHS did not unlawfully distinguish between the Foundation and the Training Partnership because the PRA allows an agency to delay production of requested records to allow a person affected by the production to obtain a court order preventing disclosure, and (4) DSHS did not violate the PRA by failing to produce the records to the Foundation on June 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing the Foundation's lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Original PRA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The Foundation filed a PRA request with DSHS on January 12, 2016, requesting \"[t]he times and locations of all contracting appointments for individual providers\" and the \"times and locations of any state-sponsored or facilitated opportunities for individual providers to view the initial safety and orientation training videos,\" both between November 1, 2015 and December 31, 2016.

The Foundation requested \"[t]he times, dates, and locations of all contracting appointments for individual providers\" and the \"times, dates, and locations of all state-sponsored or facilitated opportunities for individual providers to view the initial safety and orientation training videos,\" both between January 1 and December 31, 2017.

In order to locate and assemble the responsive records, the DSHS public records officer needed to contact three regional offices and\n   14 area offices. And on the same day that DSHS received the Foundation's request, DSHS also received approximately 79 other PRA requests and already was processing about 60 PRA requests. DSHS stated in its response letter, \"Due to workload, the number of other pending requests and the scope of your request, we estimate it will take up to 30 business days or until about June 13, 2017, to find, review, copy and produce any available records.\" CP at 311.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The Training Partnership's May 8, 2017 PRA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Also on May 2, DSHS notified SEIU and the Training Partnership that it had received a PRA request and that the responsive records related to SEIU and union members.

DSHS treated this request for records as a PRA request. DSHS responded to the Training Partnership's request by producing some of the requested records on May 12. DSHS also extended the deadline for the Training Partnership to obtain an injunction to May 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Subsequent Developments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 On April 26, 2017, this court had entered an order stating that the previously issued stay prohibiting DSHS from releasing the records sought in the January 2016 PRA request would continue in force until a mandate was issued. The parties disagreed whether the stay extended to the April 2017 request. On May 15, this court issued a stay prohibiting the release of the records responsive to the April 2017 PRA request pending further briefing on the issue. DSHS informed the Training Partnership on June 2 that it could not produce the remainder of the requested records because of the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 On June 9, this court entered an order clarifying that DSHS was not enjoined from releasing the records the Foundation requested in its April 2017 PRA request. On that same day, the Foundation emailed DSHS and stated its expectation that the requested records would be produced by the end of the day. Counsel for DSHS replied, \"DSHS previously sent a letter estimating its response date. We will let you know if there are changes to that estimated time frame.\" CP at 308. Also on June 9, DSHS produced to the Training Partnership the reminder of the records it had requested on May 8. DSHS extended the deadline for the Training Partnership to obtain an injunction to June 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Meanwhile, on May 24 SEIU had filed a petition for discretionary review of this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    SEIU 775\n   </em>\n   with the Supreme Court. On June 12, SEIU notified DSHS and the Foundation that it planned to file an emergency motion in the Supreme Court to enjoin DSHS from releasing the records sought in the Foundation's April 2017 PRA request. DSHS told the Foundation that it would not release those records to the Foundation pending receipt of the motion. On June 13, the Supreme Court temporarily enjoined DSHS from releasing records in response to the Foundation's April 2017\n   PRA request. The temporary stay expired on July 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 On July 11, DSHS produced to the Foundation the records responsive to its April 2017 PRA request. The records produced consisted of a 12-page spreadsheet providing the information the Foundation had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Lawsuit Against DSHS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b616 On June 12, the Foundation filed a complaint against DSHS based on its April 2017 PRA request. The Foundation alleged that DSHS had violated the PRA by providing an unreasonable estimate of the time necessary to respond to the request. In its answer to the Foundation's complaint, DSHS argued that the Foundation's claims were untimely because the agency had not yet taken a final action on the Foundation's PRA request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 The Foundation did not assert claims for other PRA violations relating to the delay in producing records in its complaint. Those claims were first asserted in the Foundation's summary judgment motion in October 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 In November, the trial court held a hearing on the merits pursuant to RCW 42.56.550(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Foundation argued that DSHS had violated the PRA by (1) providing an unreasonable time estimate, (2) distinguishing between requestors, (3) failing to provide the fullest and timeliest assistance, and (4) delaying the release of records. DSHS argued that the trial court should dismiss the Foundation's claims because the Foundation's lawsuit was filed before DSHS produced the records, and therefore was not timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 The trial court issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court initially concluded that all of the Foundation's claims were properly before the court. Regarding DSHS's time estimate, the court found that at the time of the estimate DSHS had over 2,000 public records requests and that DSHS had received over 50 PRA requests on the same day as the Foundation's request. The court also found that the records the Foundation requested were located in multiple different offices. The court concluded that (1) DSHS's estimate of time was reasonable under former RCW 42.56.520 (2010), (2) DSHS did not unlawfully distinguish between requestors and therefore did not violate former RCW 42.56.080 (2016), (3) any disparity in the timing of production between the Training Partnership and the Foundation was lawful, and (4) DSHS provided the fullest and most timely assistance to the Foundation and therefore did not violate RCW 42.56.100. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the Foundation's lawsuit with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 The Foundation appeals the trial court's order dismissing its complaint against DSHS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.

RCW 42.56.550(2) does not require an agency to take a final action before a party can challenge the agency's estimate of the time needed to respond and no case has imposed such a requirement.

An agency must provide the records, deny the request, or respond in one of three other ways. Former RCW 42.56.520. One of those ways is to acknowledge receipt of the request and provide \"a reasonable estimate of the time the agency ... will require to respond to the request.\" Former RCW 42.56.520(3).

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b631 The Foundation argues that DSHS's time estimate was unreasonable because the scope of the request was narrow, the type of record request was straightforward, and the volume of requested information was low. However, the DSHS public records officer realized that the responsive records were not located in one place and would need to be gathered from many different area and regional offices. In addition, DSHS received approximately 79 other PRA requests on the same day that the Foundation submitted its April 2017 PRA request. Finally, DSHS already was processing about 60 other PRA requests at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b632 DSHS considered how much time it would take to gather and return records from the various offices and then for the public records officer to review the records while also processing other PRA requests. Under these circumstances, we conclude that DSHS's estimate that it would be able respond to the Foundation's request within 30 business days was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 The Foundation argues that DSHS's estimate was unreasonable because DSHS did not conduct a case-specific investigation into how long it would take to gather the records, such as contacting each of the various offices. However, the Foundation cites no authority for the proposition that an agency must engage in such an investigation\n   each time it must estimate how long producing requested records will take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634 The Foundation also refers to the time that DSHS needed to actually produce the records to the Training Partnership, which was significantly less than 30 business days. But whether an estimate is reasonable necessarily must be based on a forward-looking evaluation at the time of the estimate, not on a backward-looking evaluation after the fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b635 Accordingly, we hold that DSHS provided a reasonable estimate of the time needed to respond to the Foundation's request and therefore complied with former RCW 42.56.520.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   D. TIMING OF DISCLOSURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b636 The Foundation argues that DSHS unlawfully distinguished between requestors in violation of former RCW 42.56.080 and violated its duty under the PRA to promptly produce the requested records. The Foundation relies on the facts that DSHS produced the requested records to the Training Partnership before producing them to the Foundation and that DSHS did not produce the records to the Foundation when they were ready on June 9, 2017. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1.

Further, former RCW 42.56.080 states that \"[a]gencies shall not distinguish among persons requesting records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b638 The Foundation argues that DSHS violated former RCW 42.56.080 by treating the Foundation differently than the Training Partnership regarding when the requested\n   records were produced. The Foundation and the Training\n   Partnership requested the exact same records. DSHS produced them to the Training Partnership in installments on May 12 and June 9, but did not produce them to the Foundation until July 11 once the Supreme court stay expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b639 DSHS argues that the Foundation and the Training Partnership were not similarly situated because the Training Partnership was an affected party for which DSHS was entitled to provide notice before releasing the records to the Foundation.

Affected Party Status\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b643 Initially, the Foundation argues that whether an agency can treat a person making a PRA request differently than a person who is affected by that request is immaterial because the Training Partnership was not an \"affected party\" with regard to the Foundation's request. The Foundation claims that the Training Partnership was not an affected party because the requested records did not pertain to the Training Partnership's activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b644 The Foundation relies solely on a May 11, 2017 letter from the Training Partnership's attorney to DSHS questioning whether any documents involving the Training Partnership were responsive to the Foundation's requests. But this letter is not determinative of whether the Training Partnership was an affected party. In the same letter, the attorney requested all Training Partnership documents that DSHS believed were responsive to the request in order for the Training Partnership to evaluate whether it needed to seek an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b645 An agency has wide discretion to determine who affected parties are.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=200%20Wash.%20App.%20781\">\n    200 Wash.

Here, the Foundation requested the times and locations of opportunities for individual providers to view training videos. DSHS reasonably could have believed that the Training Partnership was a person \"to whom the record specifically pertains.\" RCW 42.56.540. Therefore, we conclude that DSHS properly treated the Training Partnership\n   as an affected person for purposes of the Foundation's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b646 The Foundation also argues that DSHS should not have given notice to the Training Partnership because DSHS had no reason to believe that the requested records were exempt from production. The Foundation\n   points out that this court in\n   <em>\n    SEIU 775\n   </em>\n   already had determined that similar records were not exempt. However, the Foundation ignores the fact that SEIU still had the right to seek Supreme Court review of\n   <em>\n    SEIU 775\n   </em>\n   and subsequently did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   c. Distinguishing Between Two Requestors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b647 Even though the Training Partnership was an affected party, it also was a PRA requestor. The Training Partnership requested the records responsive to the Foundation's request, and DSHS treated the Training Partnership's request as a PRA request. The issue here is whether DSHS lawfully could distinguish between the two requestors based on the Training Partnership's status as an affected person.

An agency cannot lawfully produce the records to the original requestor during that period because the affected person must be given a reasonable opportunity to obtain an injunction. But no such prohibition exists with regard to production of the records to the affected party. And because the affected party in this situation also is a requestor, the agency has an obligation under the PRA to promptly produce the records.

DSHS's original deadline to obtain a court order was May 16, 2017. DSHS produced the first installment on May 12, within that deadline. However, before the deadline expired, on May 15, this court issued a stay prohibiting the release of\n   the records and that stay remained in effect until June 9. Therefore, DSHS did not violate former RCW 42.56.080 by not producing the records to the Foundation before June 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b655 The second installment produced to the Training Partnership on June 9 involves a slightly different situation. The stay no longer was in place on that date, and DSHS was not precluded by court order from producing the records. However, when it produced the records to the Training Partnership, DSHS extended the deadline for obtaining a court order stopping production to the end of the day on June 12. The Foundation provides no authority for the proposition that it was unreasonable for DSHS to extend this deadline by a few days. Because DSHS extended the deadline for the Training Partnership to seek a court order, DSHS could not lawfully have produced the records to the Foundation at the same time it produced the second installment of the records to the Training Partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b656 On June 12, SEIU notified DSHS that it planned to file an emergency motion in the Supreme Court to enjoin DSHS from releasing the records and on June 13 the Supreme Court temporarily enjoined DSHS from releasing records. Therefore, DSHS was not able to produce the records at that time. When the Supreme Court's order expired on July 13, DSHS promptly produced the records to the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b657 We hold that DSHS did not violate former RCW 42.56.080 by producing the requested records to the Training Partnership before producing them to the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   2.

As discussed above, an agency can delay the production of records to give an affected person a realistic opportunity to obtain an injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wade's Eastside Gun Shop\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456833\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/185/270/#p277\">\n    185 Wash.2d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20P.3d%2097\">\n    372 P.3d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; former RCW 42.56.520.
