As a firefighter, he has responded to several fires, including a large fire in a cabinet factory that contained \"paints, thinners, [and] lacquers,\" a fire in an airport hangar with burning jet fuel, a house fire with chlorine stored in the attic, and several burning methamphetamine labs. In May 2015, Aguirre was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (\"CML\"). He filed a workers' compensation claim alleging that his CML was caused by the toxic chemicals he had been exposed to while fighting fires for the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 After Aguirre's claim was denied by the City's workers' compensation carrier, CopperPoint American Insurance Company (\"CopperPoint\"), he requested a hearing before the ICA. At the hearing, Aguirre asserted a claim for benefits pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-901.01.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under that statute, a firefighter diagnosed with Aguirre's type of cancer is entitled to a presumption that he is suffering from a compensable occupational disease upon showing that he: (1) \"passed a physical examination before employment and the examination did not indicate evidence of cancer,\" (2) \"was assigned to hazardous duty for at least five years,\" and (3) \"was exposed to a known carcinogen ... and the carcinogen is reasonably related to the cancer.\" \u00a7 23-901.01(B)(1), (C)(1)-(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hahn v.

Marc Wilkenfeld, M.D., board-certified in occupational medicine, authored a report and testified on behalf of Aguirre. Wilkenfeld testified that Aguirre had repeated exposure to the carcinogens present at the fires, often without proper protective equipment. Wilkenfeld further concluded, based on his review of peer-reviewed studies, medical literature, exposure records, and Aguirre's medical history, that Aguirre developed CML \"as a result of the exposure to carcinogens he experienced during his work as a firefighter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 Jason Salganick, M.D., board-certified in medical oncology, prepared a report and testified on behalf of CopperPoint. Salganick testified that although firefighters are generally exposed to potential carcinogens, he could not determine if Aguirre was exposed to a known carcinogen because his records did not identify which specific toxins were present at particular fires, what protective gear Aguirre wore, or how long he spent at each fire. Salganick further stated that the medical literature only supported a possible connection between Aguirre's work as a firefighter and CML. Salganick testified that, in his opinion, he could not conclude whether Aguirre's CML was \"causally related to his work as a firefighter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 After the hearing, the ALJ denied Aguirre's claim for benefits. In his decision, the ALJ briefly summarized the testimony and noted that \"[t]his is a claim under the Occupational Disease Statute \u00a7 23-901.01 (A) and (B).\" The ALJ then issued the following ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   After a careful review of all the evidence, the undersigned is more persuaded by [CopperPoint's] Legal Memorandum and therefore, concludes [that Aguirre] has failed to carry his burden of proving by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence that he sustained a work related injury....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Aguirre filed a request for administrative review of the ALJ's decision pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 23-943.
