(collectively, \"Appellees\"). The tax court entered judgment requiring Pinal County to classify the Property as agricultural for the 2014 tax year. The County appealed, challenging whether Appellees satisfied the statutory requirements for such classification, including that there be a reasonable expectation of operating profit from the agricultural use of the property. Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 42-12152(A)(2). We hold that a taxpayer's submission of an affidavit as authorized by A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(C) conclusively establishes the reasonable expectation of operating profit requirement, and because Appellees filed the requisite affidavit, we affirm the tax court's ruling granting Appellees' motion for partial summary judgment as to that issue. We further affirm the tax court's rulings that Appellees satisfied the remaining requirements for agricultural land classification, including the court's findings after trial regarding the\n   Property's functional contribution to an overall ranching operation and the economic feasibility of the ranching operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 During the relevant tax periods, Appellees leased the Property to cattle rancher Charles Bush and his company Rancho Asueno, a ranching operation composed of multiple noncontiguous parcels of land throughout Pinal County. As part of the lease, Appellees allowed Bush and Rancho Asueno to run cattle on the Property. Bush also oversaw the Property, including maintaining fencing, ensuring sufficient forage and water for livestock, moving cattle, and monitoring traffic on the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 For the 2014 tax year, the county assessor classified the Property as vacant land, and the State Board of Equalization upheld the classification. Appellees appealed that determination to the tax court, and after a bench trial, the court reversed, ordering the County to classify the Property as agricultural.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Under A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 42-12151 to -12152, as relevant here, to be classified as agricultural property for tax purposes, land used for grazing must meet four criteria. First, the grazing land must have a minimum carrying capacity of 40 animal units and contain an economically feasible number of animal units. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12151(3). Second, the primary use of the property must be agricultural grazing and the property must have been in active production according to generally accepted range management practices for three out of the five previous years. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(1). Third, the property must have a reasonable expectation of operating profit from its agricultural use. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And fourth, property consisting of noncontiguous parcels must be managed and operated on a unitary basis, with each parcel making a functional contribution to the agricultural use of the property. A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Reasonable Expectation of Operating Profit.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Before trial, the tax court granted Appellees' motion for partial summary judgment regarding the third requirement (reasonable expectation of operating profit) after Appellees filed an affidavit attesting that the Property was \"actively producing with an expectation of profit.\" The County challenges that ruling.

The County acknowledges that Appellees complied with the statutory criteria of \u00a7 42-12152(C) by filing the signed affidavit, but asserts that accepting such an affidavit at face value violates other rules of statutory construction, such as the absurdity\n   doctrine or\n   <em>\n    in pari materia\n   </em>\n   ; allows the tax court to consider evidence that fails to satisfy the requirements of Arizona Rule of Evidence 602 and Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) ; impermissibly binds the judicial branch; and inequitably allows some landowners to gain an unfair tax advantage. But these arguments are unavailing in the face of clear and mandatory statutory language stating that the reasonable expectation of operating profit requirement \"shall be satisfied\" if the owner signs and submits the appropriate affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(2), (C).

The Legislature is tasked with determining the methods and procedures for taxation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 11, and based on that authority, the Legislature could have chosen to completely remove the requirement that agricultural property have a reasonable expectation of profit or, as it did here, provide a simple mechanism for satisfying that criterion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 We note that other statutory provisions provide for recoupment and penalties from taxpayers who provide false information in an affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12157 (\"If an owner of property or the owner's agent intentionally provides false information on an application form, ... [t]he property shall be reclassified immediately as being used for a nonagricultural use[,] ... [t]he owner is liable for the additional taxes[,] ... [and t]he owner shall also pay a penalty ....\"). Thus, if the County is concerned that a taxpayer has filed a fraudulent affidavit, the County can take remedial action. But in classifying property for tax purposes, the County cannot ignore the directive of A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(C) that the affidavit satisfies the reasonable expectation of operating profit requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The County further argues that Appellees' affidavit was incomplete because it did not list the Property's carrying capacity. But \u00a7 42-12152(C) does not require that the affidavit include information on carrying capacity. It only requires information regarding an expectation of operating profit, and here, the affidavit contained that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The County also asserts that the affidavit should not have been considered because it was created in 2015, which was after the valuation date (January 1, 2013) for the tax year at issue.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055279\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/65/#p67\">\n    225 Ariz. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67, \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055279\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/65/#p67\">\n    234 P.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (App. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 Under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(1), agricultural property must have been in active production under generally accepted agricultural practices for three out of the five previous years. Active production is the \"exhibition of physical preparation activities and ongoing labor practices which will yield an agricultural ... commodity.\" Manual at 1.3. Generally accepted agricultural practices are \"[t]hose activities and practices that are used in an agricultural operation which are widely accepted and that can be supported by experts in particular agricultural disciplines.\" Manual at 1.8. Grazing land qualifies as being \"in active production\" even if it has been inactive due to: (1) an act of God (but this can only be claimed for one year) or (2) \"reduced carrying capacity or generally accepted range management practices.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(1)(a), (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 Here, given that the tax year at issue had a January 1, 2013 valuation date, the Property must have been in active production or permissibly inactive for three out of the five years from 2008 through 2012. And the evidence supported the tax court's finding that the Property met that requirement. Bush testified that he ran his own cattle on the Property in 2008 and that sublessees ran cattle on the Property in 2011 and 2012. And the County does not dispute that in 2009 and 2010 the Property was inactive due to drought, which both parties agree qualifies as an act of God under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(1)(a).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Manual at 1.3-1.4. Thus, the Property was in active production (active cattle grazing) or permissibly inactive for the requisite amount of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 Relatedly, the County argues that the tax court erred by allowing Bush to testify as to \"generally accepted agricultural practices\" under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(1) without being disclosed as an expert witness. But the statute does not require expert testimony, and the Manual contemplates but does not require the use of experts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manual at 1.8. Consequently, the tax court properly allowed Bush, who has extensive experience in ranching, to testify about widely accepted cattle grazing practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Economic Feasibility.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Finally, the County asserts that the tax court erred by finding that the Property contained an economically feasible number of animal units.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12151(3). We review this finding for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rigel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055279\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/65/#p67\">\n    225 Ariz. at 67, \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4055279\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/225/65/#p67\">\n    234 P.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 The County contends that the tax court improperly ignored its expert, who opined that the Property was not economically feasible for cattle grazing. But the tax court determines the weight to be accorded to expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    Magna Inv. &amp; Dev. Corp. v. Pima County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1534105\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/128/291/#p294\">\n    128 Ariz. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1534105\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/128/291/#p294\">\n    625 P.2d 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (App. 1981). And because the County's expert had not visited the Property in several years and had considered the Property in isolation, rather than as a part of Rancho Asueno's larger ranching operation,\n   the tax court had an adequate reason to discount the expert's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b628 Furthermore, Bush testified as to economic feasibility, stating that his goal was always to make money and that he generated income from Rancho Asueno and the Property. He also testified that the Property allowed Rancho Asueno to be sustainable in the long term because it diversified his grazing land. Thus, the record supports the tax court's finding as to economic feasibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm. Appellees request attorney's fees on appeal under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-348(B). As Appellees have prevailed on appeal, we award them their costs and reasonable attorney's fees incurred on appeal upon compliance with ARCAP 21.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Reasonable expectation of operating profit under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12152(A)(2) is a distinct statutory requirement from economic feasibility under A.R.S. \u00a7 42-12151(3), although the concepts are at times conflated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ariz.

Sess. Laws, ch. 49, \u00a7 1 (54th Leg., 1st Reg. Sess.). Because the prior version applies to this case, we do not address the effect, if any, of this statutory change.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The County also argues that the tax court's decision to classify subleasing as agricultural, and not commercial, activity conflicts with\n    <em>\n     SWVP-GTIS MR, LLC v.
