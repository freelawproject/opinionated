We must decide whether petition signatures are void pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-118.01(A) because the measure's proponent paid petition circulators by the signature and whether the measure's 100-word description fails to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 19-102(A). We previously issued an order affirming the lower courts' decisions that the initiative measure qualifies for the ballot.

In 2015, voters passed Proposition 104, which set that tax at 0.7% until 2051 and created a Citizens Transportation Committee to review all tax revenue expenditures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Phx.

Upon receipt of the application, the City Clerk's office assigned the Initiative petition a serial number,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 19-111(B), which enabled BBP to gather the number of valid signatures required to qualify the Initiative for the ballot. To that end, BBP hired a commercial petition circulation firm, which paid circulators on a per-signature basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Arizona Chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America and David Martin (collectively, \"Contractors\") filed a complaint pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 19-122(C) seeking to enjoin placement of the Initiative on the ballot. They allege that petition circulators were paid by the signature in violation of \u00a7 19-118.01 and that the 100-word summary circulated with the petition created a significant danger of confusion or unfairness in violation of \u00a7 19-102(A).

Like \u00a7 19-118.01(A), \u00a7 19-111(D), which concerns circulation training materials, only applies to \"statewide\" measures. Significantly, the last sentence in \u00a7 19-111(D) provides that \"[n]otwithstanding \u00a7 19-141, this subsection does not apply to initiative, referendum or recall petitions for cities, towns and counties.\" Contractors assert that \"[i]f use of the word 'statewide' were enough to make a provision not apply locally, the subsequent 'notwithstanding' language in \u00a7 19-111(D) would have been unnecessary.\" They conclude that the legislature's omission of similar language in \u00a7 19-118.01(A) means the statute applies to local measures per \u00a7 19-141(A).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballesteros v.

Regardless, we are unconvinced that the 2017 legislature's omission of similar language in \u00a7 19-118.01(A) evidenced an intent to apply that provision to local measures. The 2017 legislature could have reasonably concluded that \u00a7 19-118.01(A) 's express reference to \"statewide\" initiative and referendum petitions sufficiently precluded application to local measures. Section 19-118.01(A) is thus unlike \u00a7 20-259.01, at issue in\n   <em>\n    Ballesteros\n   </em>\n   , which had no language requiring a Spanish-language insurance form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballesteros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755049,5754771\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/345/\">\n    226 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   349 \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755049,5754771\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/345/\">\n    248 P.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, the 2017 legislature plainly focused on \"statewide\" measures when enacting \u00a7 19-118.01 by finding that \"[s]tatewide initiative measures enact broad and sweeping changes to the laws of this state\" and that protecting the integrity of that process \"is a significant state interest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Ariz.

Specifically, to apply A.R.S. \u00a7 19-121.01(A)(1)(h) to local measures, the 2015 legislature did not rely on \u00a7 19-141(A) but instead deleted the words \"statewide ballot measures only.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 Ariz.

We have never required an initiative description to explain all potential effects of a measure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Our Vote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062577\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/145/\">\n    231 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   152 \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062577\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/231/145/\">\n    291 P.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that a description failed to \"completely describe the effects of implementing\" the measure because \u00a7 19-102(A) \"requires only a description of the principal provisions, not a complete description\"). The proper forum to argue the consequences of passing the Initiative is in statements of support and opposition, editorials, and the like.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tilson v. Mofford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496628\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/468/#p473\">\n    153 Ariz. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1496628\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/153/468/#p473\">\n    737 P.2d 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1372 (1987) (\"[T]he proper place to argue about the potential impact of an initiative is in the political arena, in speeches, newspaper articles, advertisements and other forums.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 Third, Contractors argue that the summary is misleading because it proposes to redirect \"light rail extension[ ]\" funds to \"infrastructure improvements\" but fails to reveal that \"infrastructure improvements,\" as defined in the Initiative, excludes repairs to light rail. Consequently, Contractors contend, signers were not informed that passing the Initiative would terminate funding for light rail upkeep as well as expansion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 Contractors' argument fails because the Initiative does not, in fact, eliminate funding for upkeep of the existing light rail system. The Initiative defines \"light rail extensions,\" as \"any and all construction, development, extension or expansion of, or improvement to, light rail transit authorized by Proposition 104.\" Thus, the light rail funds at issue in the Initiative are only those dedicated to light rail extensions, not upkeep, as authorized by Proposition 104.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Neither Proposition 104 nor the Initiative addresses funding to repair and maintain the existing light rail system. Therefore, the 100-word description is not misleading by stating that light rail extension funds would be redirected if the Initiative passes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 We affirm the superior court's judgment and the court of appeals' decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Valley Metro Rail, Inc.,\n    <em>\n     Valley Metro Rail FY20 Budget\n    </em>\n    7 (2019), https://www.valleymetro.org/sites/default/files/uploads/event-resources/vmr_fy20_budget_book_adopted.pdf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Before the court of appeals, Contractors also argued that the Phoenix City Charter adopts title 19, including \u00a7 19-118.01(A), as a local requirement.
