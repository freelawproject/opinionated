UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-503(1)(b), (3) (2014). A jury convicted Sanders of violating section 503 after police officers responding to a domestic complaint found Sanders in his backyard carrying a rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Sanders claimed that when the police officers arrived at his home, he was moving his girlfriend's son's firearm back into the house. Sanders argued that he was only transporting the rifle because it had been left in the backyard, which abutted an elementary school. He asked the district court to instruct the jury that it could acquit him if it found that he was innocently possessing the weapon. The district court refused. Sanders appeals, arguing that refusal was error. We disagree with Sanders and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the time of his arrest, Sanders lived with his Girlfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Girlfriend's teenage son, M.M., owned three firearms that he used for hunting. The firearms were stored, unsecured, in the bedroom closet Sanders and Girlfriend shared. Ammunition for those firearms was supposed to be stored separately in M.M.'s bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 One evening, Sanders learned that M.M. had left his hunting rifle outside, unattended, in the backyard. Upset, Sanders argued with Girlfriend about M.M.'s dereliction at a volume that prompted a concerned neighbor to call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The police responded to the complaint. When they arrived, an officer heard a man yell Girlfriend's name. The officer then saw Sanders standing on the back porch holding a rifle. The officer pulled out his flashlight and demanded to see Sanders's hands. Sanders set the rifle down, raised his hands, and said, \"I'm not armed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Sanders refused to talk to the officer and informed him in salty, if somewhat unoriginal, language that he needed a warrant to enter the house. Sanders then went inside, leaving the rifle on the back porch. Sanders had spoken with slurred speech, and the officers believed he was intoxicated. The officers then spoke with Girlfriend. Based on her comments, the officers concluded that Girlfriend's young daughter might be inside. The officers conducted a safety sweep of the home to ensure that the child was safe. During the sweep, the officers observed ammunition in a bedroom and a magazine for a rifle in the living room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 After the safety sweep, the officers ran a records check and discovered that Sanders was a restricted person; that is, because Sanders had been convicted of a felony, Utah\n   law restricts him from possessing a firearm. The officers went to the back porch and collected the rifle-which, as it turned out, was fully loaded. The officers then left the home. A few days later, Sanders called the police department and asked if he could get the rifle back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 Two weeks after the initial encounter, the officers returned with a warrant to retrieve firearms, dangerous weapons, ammunition, and any items related to firearms from Sanders's home. Sanders again asked the officers to return the rifle. And Girlfriend told the officers that additional firearms belonging to M.M. were in her bedroom closet. The officers arrested Sanders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 During their search of the home, the officers confiscated two unsecured firearms, multiple magazines, ammunition, a machete, and a sword. Additionally, the officers found a small amount of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 The State charged Sanders with three counts of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, third degree felonies in violation of Utah Code section 76-10-503(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Before trial, Sanders requested an innocent possession jury instruction. Sanders's requested instruction would have told the jury that a restricted person is not guilty of the offense of possession of a firearm \"if (1) the firearm was [ob]tained innocently and held with no illicit or illegal purpose, and (2) the possession of the firearm was transitory; that is, that the defendant took adequate measures to rid himself of possession of the firearm as promptly as reasonably possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12 The State opposed the jury instruction. The State argued that the felon-in-possession statute does not leave room for an innocent possession defense. The State further argued that even if there were such a defense, the facts did not support its application in this case because Sanders's possession was not \"transitory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13 The district court denied Sanders's request. The court ruled that it did not \"need to decide whether or not the innocent possession defense is available here\" because, based on the evidence presented at trial, there was no \"factual basis to give [the] instruction.\" The court reasoned that jurisdictions that recognize the defense require the \"defendant to demonstrate both that he intended to turn the weapon over to the police and that he was pursuing such an intent with immediacy and through a reasonable course of conduct,\" which Sanders did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 14 The jury convicted Sanders on one count of possession of a firearm by a restricted person. The jury acquitted him of the two additional charges of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, which were based on a theory that Sanders constructively possessed the firearms that the police officers found in his home. Sanders appealed the conviction. The court of appeals certified the case to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 15 \"Whether a jury instruction correctly states the law presents a question of law which we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sanders contends that: (1) the defense is consistent with the felon-in-possession statute; (2) the defense is consistent with our precedent; and (3) without the defense, Utah law will criminalize innocent behavior in a fashion that will generate absurd results. The State argues that neither the statute nor case law supports an innocent possession defense and that the Legislature could have rationally intended to criminalize Sanders's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. The Statute Does Not Support an Innocent Possession Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 To decide whether the felon-in-possession statute includes an innocent possession defense, we begin our inquiry with the statute itself.

A jury convicted Sanders of violating section 76-10-503(3), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) A Category II restricted person\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   who intentionally or knowingly purchases, transfers, possesses, uses, or has under the person's custody or control:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (a) any firearm is guilty of a third degree felony; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (b) any dangerous weapon other than a firearm is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 21 Section 503(7) then sets forth the specific defense applicable to that provision, under which a person may transfer a firearm within ten days of becoming a restricted person, but may not \"use,\" \"purchase,\" or \"possess[ ] on the person\" the firearm during that period:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (7)(a) It is an affirmative defense to transferring a firearm or other dangerous weapon by a person restricted under Subsection (2) or (3) that the firearm or dangerous weapon:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (i) was possessed by the person or was under the person's custody or control before the person became a restricted person;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (ii) was not used in or possessed during the commission of a crime ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (iii) is not being held as evidence by a court or law enforcement agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (iv) was transferred to a person not legally prohibited from possessing the weapon; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (v) unless a different time is ordered by the court, was transferred within 10 days of the person becoming a restricted person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) Subsection (7)(a) is not a defense to the use, purchase, or possession on the person of a firearm or other dangerous weapon by a restricted person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-503(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 22 Thus, section 503 evinces the Legislature's thinking on the limited circumstance in which an individual may lawfully possess a firearm after becoming a restricted person. Tellingly, the Legislature did not create a law that allows, as Sanders's instruction proposed, that a restricted person may possess a firearm \"if (1) the firearm was [ob]tained innocently and held with no illicit or illegal purpose, and (2) the possession of the firearm was transitory; that is, that the defendant took adequate measures to rid himself of possession of the firearm as promptly as reasonably possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 23 Acknowledging that section 76-10-503 does not explicitly contain his asserted innocent possession defense, Sanders nevertheless claims that it exists implicitly in that statute. Sanders argues that we should read the statutory term \"possess\" to exclude innocent possession, as he defines that phrase. In Sanders's view, the statute does not \"clarify whether the term 'possess' ... includes ... temporary possession for the purpose of returning a [firearm] to its lawful owner.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24 The Utah Criminal Code provides a general definition of \"possess,\" which \"means to have physical possession of or to exercise dominion or control over tangible property.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-1-601(10). Section 503 prohibits \"possession\" of a firearm by a restricted person, and section 76-10-503(7) contains the Legislature's decision about the specific circumstance in which a restricted person may engage in behavior that would otherwise violate the statute. The Legislature appears to have concluded that a restricted person may, under certain conditions, transfer a firearm-but only within ten days of becoming a restricted person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-503(7)(a). And that exception does not apply to \"use,\" \"purchase,\" or \"possession on the person\" of the firearm.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375790\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/814/568/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-10-503(7)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25 As noted above we do not view individual words, such as \"possess,\" in isolation, but in the context of the section, chapter, and code in which they are included. We also presume that the language chosen by the Legislature is meaningful, and that \"the expression of one [term] should be interpreted as the exclusion of another.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, we \"will not infer substantive terms into the text that are not already there. Rather, the interpretation must be based on the language used, and [we have] no power to rewrite the statute to conform to an intention not expressed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    I.M.L. v.

For the reasons set forth above, we presume that the Legislature considered when a restricted person might possess a firearm and specified these circumstances in section 76-10-503(7) as well as in the Code's general defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 27 In support of his position, however, Sanders points us to the legislatively defined purposes of the Utah Criminal Code. As Sanders points out, \" Utah Code section 76-1-106 directs a court to 'construe[ ] [criminal statutes] according to the fair import of their terms to promote justice and to effect the objects of the law and general purposes of [s]ection 76-1-104.' \" (quoting UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-1-106.) Sanders also directs us to the statement that the Code shall be construed to \"safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation as criminal.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-1-104(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 28 And we sometimes resort to these principles when addressing questions of statutory interpretation regarding the Utah Criminal Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Perea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945379\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/624/\">\n    2013 UT 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 115,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945379\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/624/\">\n    322 P.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reasoning that sections 76-1-104 and 76-1-106 \"make clear that a sentencing court is to consider all the evidence before it-the totality of the circumstances-in imposing a sentence that is proportionate to the crime and the culpability of the defendant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 29 But the Code's general statements of purpose do not support Sanders's proposed innocent possession defense. To the contrary, under the Code's guidelines, we are obliged to construe section 503 to \"effect the objects of the law and general purposes of [s]ection 76-1-104,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-1-106, which include \"forbid[ding] and prevent[ing] the commission of offenses\" as the Legislature has defined them,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945379\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/624/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-1-104(1).

Whether the brief possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is, generally speaking, conduct \"without fault\" is a legislative judgment, and one the Legislature has answered in the negative. As a result, we do not conclude that the felon-in-possession statute implicitly provides an innocent possession defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   II. Our Case Law Does Not Require an Innocent Possession Defense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 30 Sanders next argues that two of our cases support the conclusion that the felon-in-possession statute contains an implicit innocent possession defense. Sanders first points to\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   to contend that we have already recognized an affirmative defense for a restricted person who was \"innocent[ly] handling\" a weapon.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412665\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/711/232/#p233\">\n    711 P.2d 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 233 (Utah 1985) (per curiam). The State asserts that\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   does not \"support the broad innocent possession defense\" Sanders proposes and, even if it did, \"this Court should overrule\"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   in that respect. We agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 31 In\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   , the defendant contended that an additional jury instruction should have been given regarding the definition of \"possess,\" as that term is used in section 503.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412665\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/711/232/#p233\">\n    711 P.2d at 233-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Davis had been convicted of unlawfully possessing a firearm in violation of that provision, following the district court's instruction to the jury that: \"possession, custody or control of a firearm [is] more than the innocent handling of the weapon, but require[s] a willing and knowing possession with the intent to control its use or management.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412665\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/711/232/#p233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10412665\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/711/232/#p233\">\n    at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In other words, we found no language in the Act directly addressing the question of temporary or transitory possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 46 Seeking further guidance, we noted our responsibility under the Utah Criminal Code to construe provisions \"according to the fair import of their terms to promote justice\" and to \"safeguard conduct that is without fault from condemnation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20 (emphases omitted) (quoting UTAH CODE \u00a7\u00a7 76-1-104, -106). We then recited a number of scenarios in which we could see the Act sweeping in \"conduct that is without fault.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. For example, we hypothesized about a \"daughter who no longer lives at home but who picks up her sick mother's prescription medication and drives it to her mother's home,\" and a \"house guest who inadvertently leaves a prescription bottle of pills\" in a friend's house, creating a situation in which the friend \"could do nothing short of immediately fleeing her home to avoid 'possessing' the pills.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. In light of \"a myriad of absurd prosecutorial possibilities,\" we concluded that the Act implicitly included an innocent possession defense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 47 As noted above, the similarities between the Act and the felon-in-possession statute could tempt us to simply apply\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's reasoning here. But our task is not that simple-we must interpret section 503 as the Legislature intended. To do so, we construe the statute according to its plain language, giving meaning to its terms and reading those terms in context. Ultimately, the differences in the statutes prove more powerful than their commonalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 48 In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , we lacked any indication that the Legislature had considered temporary or transitory possession of a controlled substance for purposes of, e.g., delivering the substance to its lawful owner. Accordingly, we examined the possible consequences of such a rule and concluded that the Legislature would not have intended to criminalize that conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Thus, for purposes of the Act, we construed the definition of \"possess[ ]\" in section 58-37-2(1)(ii) as \"exclud[ing] temporary possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of returning it to its lawful owner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19 &amp; n. 14, 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 49 Here, we address a similar question but in the context of a different statutory scheme. And with respect to legislative intent, we have guidance that we lacked in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . The Legislature's textually expressed judgment that temporary or transitory possession of a firearm by a restricted person is not generally a lawful activity must govern our interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-503(7). Accordingly, we are not at liberty to alter that background rule and imply a defense under which temporary or transitory possession is, generally, lawful. While the Legislature could have excused temporary possession of firearms by restricted persons, in the way we concluded it had when dealing with the temporary possession of controlled substances by members of the general public, the Legislature did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 50 Relying in part on\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Sanders points to two related canons of construction and argues that their application supports his reading of section 503. Both deal with absurd results. Under the first, \"when the statutory language plausibly presents the court with two alternative readings, [this court] prefer[s] the reading that avoids absurd results.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Z.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8352974\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/165/1206/\">\n    2007 UT 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8352974\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/165/1206/\">\n    165 P.3d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the second, \"a court should not follow the literal language of a statute if its plain meaning works an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The second canon demands a stronger showing of absurdity, given \"the level of caution required when this court interprets a statute contrary to its plain meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15 n.5. Sanders's briefing does not delineate between the two, and we interpret it as raising both points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 51 Sanders argues that the criminalization of transitory possession, as outlined in his proposed instruction, would be \"absurd,\" and he cites the example of his own conviction as \"demonstrat[ing] the injustice that may result from strictly construing the term 'possess.' \" Sanders characterizes his own conduct as \"innocently handl[ing] the weapon temporarily\" \"to place the rifle out of the reach of passersby, particularly children in the adjacent schoolyard,\" \"until he could return the firearm to M.M.\" His argument fails, however, because he has not demonstrated that a legislative policy barring convicted felons from temporarily possessing firearms would be absurd. Or that the application of that policy to him, under the circumstances presented here, yielded an absurd result. As the State asserts, the Legislature could reasonably have intended to criminalize Sanders's conduct, as well as temporary or transitory possession of a firearm by a convicted felon generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 52 We have recognized the dangers the Legislature sought to criminalize in the felon-in-possession statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Willis\n   </em>\n   , we\n   reasoned that the Legislature was able to \"regulat[e] the potentially deadly privilege of firearm possession by convicted felons.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190943\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/100/1218/\">\n    2004 UT 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190943\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/100/1218/\">\n    100 P.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    State v. Nielsen\n   </em>\n   , we said that the purpose of section 76-10-503 \"was to deter those convicted of violent crimes from thereafter having guns, loaded or unloaded.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10464126\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/544/489/#p490\">\n    544 P.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 490 (Utah 1975). While the Legislature has since broadened the statute to deter all felons-not just those convicted of violent crimes-this policy choice remains the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 53 With respect to brief possession of a firearm, the Legislature could rationally have concluded that permitting an exception for temporary or transitory possession would run afoul of section 503's legislative purpose. And, therefore, prohibited restricted persons from possessing firearms, even briefly. Drawing the line in that manner, the legislature provides a bright demarcation between legal and illegal conduct. This bright line is particularly helpful here, since, as the State argues, \"Utah's statutory scheme reflects the legislature's recognition that 'danger may arise quickly.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645387\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/459/990/#p998\">\n    459 F.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 998 (9th Cir. 2006).) This bright line also prevents trials from focusing on the felon's rationale for possessing a gun he is forbidden from possessing. Accordingly, we cannot say that it was absurd for the Legislature to enact a law that required Sanders to find some other way of getting the firearm into the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 54 That is not to say that Sanders's argument is completely devoid of merit. It is not difficult to conceive of factual scenarios where the lack of an innocent possession defense might lead to an absurd result. For example, if a felon dispossessed a toddler of a loaded gun, and immediately placed the gun out of harm's way, we might conclude that a conviction for that behavior would be absurd.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is not the case before us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 55 Here, the Legislature could have rationally intended to criminalize Sanders's conduct. His retrieval of the rifle from the backyard was not reasonably necessary to avoid an imminent greater harm; the firearm was in a fenced backyard on a Friday night. Thus, we cannot conclude that a reasonable Legislature could not have intended for this statute to apply to Sanders, and application of the statute to Sanders does not lead to an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 56 We find no innocent possession defense explicitly or implicitly in Utah Code section 76-10-503.

Although Utah criminal law is wholly statutory and there are no longer common law defenses to statutory crimes,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Utah Code \u00a7 76-1-103, at first blush it appears that many of the instances in which we can envision a court concluding that a conviction under the felon-in-possession statute would be absurd would be those in which a jury applying the common law defense might have found that the defendant's actions were necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    The necessity defense applied where a person was confronted with a \"choice of two evils: either he may violate the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce a harmful result, or he may comply with those terms and thus produce a greater ... amount of harm.\" 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Subst. Crim. L. \u00a7 10.1 (3d ed. 2018). The public policy underlying the necessity defense is that \"the law ought to promote the achievement of higher values at the expense of lesser values, and sometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175868\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/212/#p218\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 10.1(a).
