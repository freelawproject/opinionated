He claimed entitlement to a new trial on five grounds: (1) the jury instruction on constructive possession was inadequate; (2) his prior drug possession and distribution convictions should not have been admitted at trial; (3) there was juror misconduct;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) his retail theft charge should have been severed from his possession with intent to distribute charge at trial; and (5) his trial counsel failed to move to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The trial court granted Defendant's motion but did not identify which of the five grounds raised by Defendant formed the basis for its decision.

But because appellate courts cannot meaningfully review a trial court's grant of a new trial without having the benefit of the trial court's reasons for its ruling-especially when some of the grounds argued warrant inquiry into the trial court's underlying legal conclusions-we agree with the State that it is\n   necessary to remand with instructions that the trial court identify the basis for its decision to grant Defendant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 \"We review a trial court's ruling on a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

And we might very well agree with Defendant's argument had he limited the arguments in his motion for a new trial to those that would not ordinarily require review of the trial court's underlying legal conclusions on appeal. For example, a determination of whether the jury misconduct in the present case merited a new trial would have been almost wholly dependent on the trial court's evaluation of the impact such misconduct had on the fairness of the proceedings-something that is inherently difficult for appellate courts to second guess. Had Defendant limited his motion to this and similar arguments, our review of the trial court's ruling would indeed be circumscribed by the assumption \"that the district court exercised proper discretion,\"\n   <em>\n    Serrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20UT%20App%2032\">\n    2019 UT App 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575823\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/440/734/\">\n    440 P.3d 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified), and we would reverse \"only if there is no reasonable basis for the decision,\"\n   <em>\n    ASC Utah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6964960\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/201/\">\n    2013 UT 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6964960\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/201/\">\n    309 P.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On the other hand, a trial court \"is not necessarily in a better position than an appellate court to identify its own errors of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Thus, when a trial court determines that a legal error \"had a substantial adverse effect upon the [defendant's] rights,\" Utah R. Crim. P. 24(a), it necessarily exceeds its discretion if there was no underlying error. Our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Billingsley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970765\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/995/\">\n    2013 UT 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970765\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/311/995/\">\n    311 P.3d 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is illustrative of this point. In\n   <em>\n    Billingsley\n   </em>\n   , the trial court had previously determined a teacher's testimony that a rape victim had made \"inappropriate sexual advances\" toward her to be inadmissible under rule 412 of the Utah Rules of Evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10. The court eventually granted a new trial to the defendant after it determined the evidentiary ruling to be in error and concluded that the exclusion violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Our Supreme Court held that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial because the court \"correctly excluded the evidence\" in the first place and the exclusion therefore \"could not justify arresting the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. It further concluded that the exclusion did not violate the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights and that \"[t]he trial court abused its discretion when it determined that [the defendant's] right to confront witnesses against her was violated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Likewise, the trial court in the present case would have abused its discretion had it, for example, granted a new trial based on its belief that the jury instruction on constructive possession was inadequate and we later determined that this underlying legal conclusion was incorrect. Because there would be no underlying error that could possibly have \"had a substantial adverse effect upon the\n   rights of [Defendant],\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Crim. P. 24(a), the trial court would not have been justified in granting a new trial in that situation. Thus, the trial court's reasons for granting a new trial are crucial to meaningful appellate review of its ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Defendant's argument that the record is sufficient to determine that the trial court did not exceed its discretion in granting a new trial is further undermined by Utah Supreme Court precedent, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If the trial court determines that a new trial is warranted and grants the motion, it should describe the basis for its decision in the record such that an appellate court can have the benefit of those reasons. ... \"In order to eliminate speculation as to the basis of the exercise of judicial discretion in granting new trials, the record should show the reasons and make it clear the court is not invading the province of the jury. ... With no indication as to the basis for exercise of the power vested in the court to grant new trials the appeal tribunal would be left to analyze the matter from the evidence, the record, and the instructions. It would be required to search out possible reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the trial court in the exercise of [its] discretion. The exercise of judicial discretion must be based upon some facts notwithstanding great latitude is accorded the trial court in such matter.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Crookston v.

But when our Supreme Court articulated this principle in\n   <em>\n    Saltas\n   </em>\n   , and subsequently reaffirmed it in\n   <em>\n    Crookston\n   </em>\n   , the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure did not require trial courts to state their reasons for granting a new trial as they do now.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

There are seven specific grounds on which a trial court may grant a new trial in civil cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Civ.

The court, in turn, informed the parties of what had transpired. The defense asked what the jurors had specifically said, but the bailiff could not provide any particulars other than that he had generally heard them \"talking about the case and about evidence.\" The court initially offered to ask the jurors what they had discussed but ultimately decided against it.

A successor judge would be no better positioned than would we to discern the rationale of the prior judge from a cold record. Indeed, in all cases where a matter is remanded for an explanation that is uniquely within the province of a particular judge, the matter on remand should be directed to the same judge, notwithstanding artificial constraints on the case finding its way to that judge automatically, such as a change in the judge's office location or responsibilities, reassignment of the case for reasons other than recusal, or the judge's taking senior status. Given the scheduled retirement of the judge who ordered the new trial, care should be taken to direct this matter to her promptly following remand.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
