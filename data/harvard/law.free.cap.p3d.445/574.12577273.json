In doing so, we analyze whether this case constitutes a matter \"substantially related\" to the firm's representation of the former client under RPC 1.9(a). Comment 3 to RPC 1.9 guides our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On behalf of Richard and Debra Plein, attorney Joel Hanson filed a complaint for insurance bad faith and various other claims against USAA Casualty Insurance Company. The claims stemmed from the actions of USAA and its recommended contractor for repairs following a house fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 A few months later, attorneys William Smart and Ian Birk from the law firm Keller Rohrback LLP, joined the\n   Pleins' legal team. USAA objected to Keller's participation in the litigation because the company and law firm had recently ended their extensive attorney-client relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Keller requested the trial court rule on the asserted conflict of interest. The trial court found no conflict under RPC 1.9. USAA filed a petition for discretionary review, which this court granted. We conclude Keller's representation of the Pleins violates RPC 1.9(a). Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The Pleins purchased homeowners' insurance from USAA. Later, in August 2015, a fire damaged their home and personal property. USAA determined that the insurance policy covered the damage and recommended The Sterling Group, LLC as a contractor to perform repairs. The Pleins followed the recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The Pleins moved back into their home after Sterling finished the repairs. They claim to have noticed a substantial lingering odor of smoke upon their return. According to the Pleins, Sterling had concealed, rather than properly repaired, the fire damage. The Pleins hired a public adjuster and USAA hired an industrial hygienist. The industrial hygienist discovered numerous deficiencies in the repair work. The Pleins alleged that USAA agreed to move them to a rental house to complete the repairs, but it did not investigate the cost of the needed repairs or offer payment for those repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The Pleins claim that as of November 14, 2017, USAA had not made a coverage decision as to the additional repairs. That day, Mr. Hanson filed a complaint against USAA and Sterling\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of the Pleins. In January 2018, Mr. Hanson approached William Smart, an attorney with Keller, about representing the Pleins in their lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That same month, Mr. Smart and another Keller attorney, Ian Birk, agreed to associate as counsel on the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 A conflicts check at Keller revealed the firm's past relationship with USAA. Keller attorney Irene Hecht and at least seven additional attorneys at the firm represented USAA and its affiliates for over a decade. Between August 2006 and November 2017, Keller represented USAA and its affiliates in at least 165 cases, approximately 12 of which involved insurance bad faith litigation by homeowners. Keller served as USAA's primary law firm in Washington for bad faith litigation. In the last two years of its representation, Keller billed over 8,000 hours of work for USAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 One of the cases in which Keller represented a USAA subsidiary in an insurance bad faith lawsuit involved issues very similar to the Pleins' case. Specifically,\n   <em>\n    Cueva v. Garrison Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , Pierce County Superior Court No. 10-2-06680-8, concerned\n   an allegation of insurance bad faith relating to the handling of repairs after a house fire. The similarities between\n   <em>\n    Cueva\n   </em>\n   and the Pleins' case included smoke damage inadequately repaired by a recommended contractor, health concerns arising from the smoke damage, appropriate methods to clean the house and personal property, and \"factual and legal disputes concerning the methodology for objectively testing for smoke damage.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The relationship between USAA and Keller ended in November 2017, the same month the Pleins filed suit. Keller's past work for USAA had not involved the Pleins. Additionally, the firm indicated that Mr. Smart and Mr. Birk had never been involved in Keller's relationship with USAA and did not have any knowledge of attorney-client communications with the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 After learning of Keller's involvement in the Plein lawsuit, USAA contacted the firm to claim a conflict of interest and demand immediate withdrawal. Keller moved for a ruling on the asserted conflict of interest. In response, USAA requested disqualification of Mr. Smart, Mr. Birk,\n   and Mr. Hanson. The trial court concluded \"the\n   <em>\n    Plein\n   </em>\n   matter is factually distinct from and not substantially related to [Keller]'s prior representation of USAA, and as a result, the firm's representation of the Pleins is not a conflict under RPC 1.9.\" The trial court allowed the Keller attorneys and Mr. Hanson to remain as counsel for the Pleins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 USAA requested discretionary review of the trial court's ruling. A commissioner of this court granted discretionary review as to the representation by the Keller lawyers, but denied review as to Mr. Hanson, who remains as counsel for the Pleins. The Pleins moved to modify the commissioner's ruling. A panel of this court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 USAA contends Keller's participation in the case violates RPC 1.9(a). It argues that this case constitutes a matter substantially related to the firm's prior representation of the company. The Pleins argue the conflict of interest prohibition does not apply, and ask us to view their case as factually distinct from prior USAA cases handled by Keller. For the reasons discussed herein, we agree with USAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 We review de novo \"a court's decision to grant or deny a motion to disqualify counsel.''\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

RPC 1.9 &amp; cmts. 1-9 at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=157%20Wash.%202d%201202\">\n    157 Wn.2d 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -06 (2006). The RPCs' \"Scope\" provisions explain the role of the comments: Such comments \"do not add obligations to the Rules but provide guidance for practicing in compliance with the Rules.\" RPC Scope [14]. \"The Comment accompanying each Rule explains and illustrates the meaning and purpose of the Rule. ... The Comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of each Rule is authoritative.\" RPC Scope [21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b622 Comment 3 provides guidance on the meaning of \"substantially related matter.\" However, it does not mention the prior standard for assessing substantially related matters as found in\n   <em>\n    Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Teja\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Hunsaker\n   </em>\n   . Since adoption of the comments, no published Washington case has interpreted the comments to RPC 1.9 in order to address the definition of \"substantially related matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b623 For the following reasons, Comment 3, rather than the prior case law, guides our analysis of whether Keller's prior representation of USAA is substantially related to this case. First, the Court of Appeals decided those prior cases before 2006, in the absence of any similar comment. And second, the comments bear the imprimatur of the Washington Supreme Court, which adopted them and which exercises plenary authority over attorney discipline.\n   <em>\n    Chism v. Tri-State Constr. Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12449927\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/193/818/#p838\">\n    193 Wash.

Below, we apply this definition as well as other provisions of the comment and conclude that this case and the prior representation of USAA qualify as substantially related.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b625 To illustrate, Comment 3 provides the example of a lawyer who learns \"extensive private financial information\" about a businessperson during representation and thus cannot subsequently represent the spouse in divorce proceedings. While the business and divorce proceedings are factually distinct, and do not involve the same transaction or legal dispute, there is a substantial risk that the attorney's knowledge of private financial information would materially advance the spouse's position in the divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b626 USAA faces similar concerns as the businessperson described in Comment 3. While the specific facts of the Pleins' case may qualify as distinct, Keller learned significant confidential information about USAA's strategies for bad faith litigation. USAA provided a declaration about the scope of Keller's representation during their professional relationship, which spanned over a decade. Keller does not dispute this description of the extent of its representation of USAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b627 According to USAA, it trusted Keller attorneys \"with direct access to confidential and proprietary business information of USAA CIC and its affiliated companies\" including, confidential claims handling materials, thought processes of adjusters and in-house attorneys, business and litigation philosophies, and strategies such as \"approaches to settlement discussions, motion practice, case analysis, defenses, witness meetings, witness preparation, trial preparation, and discovery both on a case-by-case and institutional, company-wide level.\" Keller served as one of the few law firms involved in insurance bad faith litigation on behalf of USAA in Washington, and had \"intimate business and litigation knowledge.\" Keller provided USAA and its affiliates with advice including \"insurance coverage matters, litigation strategies, factual positions, litigation mitigation recommendations for training and communication materials, and legal arguments.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b628 Keller also participated in seminars as part of enterprise-wide strategic discussions where attorneys became privy to \"proprietary information including litigation approach and strategies that has only been shared with a limited group of all of the law firms nationally representing USAA CIC and its affiliate companies in alleged bad faith litigation across the United States.\" And Keller attorneys had electronic login credentials to certain internal proprietary and confidential documents concerning insurance bad faith litigation, \"including document repositories holding attorney-client information and electronic claim databases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b629 Moreover, Keller gathered information on specific issues in order to defend USAA in\n   <em>\n    Cueva\n   </em>\n   . Keller provided advice on local expert witnesses in industrial hygiene and toxicology. Thus, USAA has shown a significant risk that Keller has knowledge of both specific and general confidential information that could materially advance the Pleins' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b630 Additionally, the temporal proximity of the prior representation affects the analysis of risk to the former client. \"Information acquired in a prior representation may have been rendered obsolete by the passage of time.\" RPC 1.9 cmt. 3. Here, Keller agreed\n   to represent the Pleins within three months of the end of its relationship with USAA. This short time frame provides scant opportunity for obsolescence, particularly given the extent-in substance and duration-of the prior representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b631 The Pleins contend that Keller had only general knowledge and information that would be disclosed during discovery. Comment 3 addresses the role of specific versus general information as well as information disclosed to third parties: \"In the case of an organizational client, general knowledge of the client's policies and practices ordinarily will not preclude a subsequent representation; on the other hand, knowledge of specific facts gained in a prior representation that are relevant to the matter in\n   question ordinarily will preclude such a representation,\" and, \"Information that has been disclosed to the public or to other parties adverse to the former client ordinarily will not be disqualifying.\" RPC 1.9 cmt. 3. The Pleins' argument, however, disregards the significant amount of confidential information on legal strategies and defenses developed between USAA and Keller. Moreover, the specific knowledge gained during defense of\n   <em>\n    Cueva\n   </em>\n   appears relevant to the issues in the Pleins' case. Therefore, Keller's knowledge of USAA's legal strategies goes beyond the permitted \"general knowledge of the client's policies and practices.\" RPC 1.9 cmt. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b632 Keller points to the fact that USAA has not suggested any pattern or practice of intentionally acting in bad faith that would have been learned during representation. However, the Comments state, \"A former client is not required to reveal the confidential information learned by the lawyer in order to establish a substantial risk that the lawyer has confidential information to use in the subsequent matter.\" RPC 1.9 cmt. 3. As further noted by Comment 3, \"[a] conclusion about the possession of such information may be based on the nature of the services the lawyer provided the former client and information that would in ordinary practice be learned by a lawyer providing such services.\" The bad faith litigation defense conducted by Keller on behalf of USAA, particularly in\n   <em>\n    Cueva\n   </em>\n   . creates significant concern that Keller possesses specific confidential information that could unfairly aid the Pleins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b633 In light of the foregoing, we determine that Keller's representation of the Pleins generates a substantial risk that USAA's confidential information would materially advance the Pleins' position in this case.

The Pleins highlight Comment 2's statement that \"a lawyer who recurrently handled a type of problem for a former client is not precluded from later representing another client in a\n    <em>\n     factually distinct\n    </em>\n    problem of that type even though the subsequent representation involves a position adverse to the prior client.\" RPC 1.9 cmt. 2 (emphasis added). But Comment 2 expressly focuses on the scope of the term \"matter.\" Deciding whether matters qualify as factually distinct does not necessarily complete the RPC 1.9(a) analysis.

One treatise describes it as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n    Some courts and commentators ... hold that the lawyer and [their] new client would have an improper advantage if the lawyer was permitted to make use of general tactical information and psychological insights, such as the former client's negotiating style, risk aversion, willingness to be deposed, and ability to handle the stress-including the financial stress-of litigation. ... This method of defining substantial relationship between legal matters is commonly referred to, utilizing a sports metaphor, as the \"playbook\" rationale. ... [A]lthough disqualification based on pure playbook concerns is unwarranted, courts have not infrequently taken a close look where playbook information blends into more specific factual information that could be put to adverse use. Thus, even where matters are factually distinct, disqualification is sometimes ordered where a lawyer represented a client in a series of matters that involve the same modus operandi and underlying factual base as the new matter.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    1 Hazard, Jr., Hodes &amp; Jarvis ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 14.10.

To a certain extent, it overlaps with the concerns set forth in Comment 3, and it is a concept that non-Washington courts have discussed extensively.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
