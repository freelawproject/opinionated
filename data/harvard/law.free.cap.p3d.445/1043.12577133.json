Because only our resolution of the applicability of the contract limitation provision to Freer merits publication, we have addressed Freer and JTF's other arguments in a memorandum decision filed concurrently with this opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Sup. Ct. 111(h). For the following reasons, and for those reasons addressed in our memorandum decision, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Freer is the founder, president, and sole shareholder of JTF. In August 2013, CliftonLarsonAllen (\"CLA\"), a national accounting\n   firm, agreed to provide JTF with a billing, collection, and revenue-cycle analysis. The scope of work was memorialized in an engagement letter dated August 15, 2013. On December 30, 2013, JTF and CLA entered into a second engagement letter (the \"December Engagement Letter\"), which provided that CLA would audit JTF's consolidated financial statements and perform other non-audit services. In the letter, JTF's management agreed it would be \"responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with [the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") ].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 The December Engagement Letter stated that \"any Dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, without giving effect to choice of law principles\" and included the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties agree that, notwithstanding any statute or law of limitations that might otherwise apply to a Dispute, any action or legal proceeding by you against us must be commenced within twenty-four (24) months ('Limitation Period') after the date when we deliver our final audit report under this agreement to you, regardless of whether we do other services for you relating to the audit report, or you shall be forever barred from commencing a lawsuit or obtaining any legal or equitable relief or recovery. The Limitation Period applies and begins to run even if you have not suffered any damage or loss, or have not become aware of the existence or possible existence of a Dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The letter defined \"Dispute\" as \"[a]ny disagreement, controversy, or claim ... that may arise out of any aspect of [CLA's] services or relationship with [JTF].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 On February 3, 2014, CLA delivered its audit report for 2013 pursuant to the December Engagement Letter. The report was addressed to \"Shareholder,\" i.e., Freer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 In June 2014, Vistria Group, LP (\"Vistria\"), through its subsidiary Aviation West Charters, LLC, as purchaser, entered an Asset Purchase Agreement with JTF, as seller, along with Freer, as JTF's shareholder, for the sale of substantially all of JTF's assets for $80,000,000, plus assumed liabilities. In the agreement, JTF warranted to Vistria that JTF's financial statements \"were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and present fairly the financial position and results of operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 In September 2014, Vistria filed a complaint in Delaware state court (the \"Delaware Lawsuit\") against Freer, JTF, and JTF's chief financial officer, Richard Larson, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, breach of warranty, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and civil conspiracy. Vistria alleged the defendants fraudulently induced it to purchase JTF at an inflated price because the company financial statements on which it relied did not conform to GAAP. It asserted Freer and Larson inflated JTF's 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\") to $40,800,000, when in reality, JTF's EBITDA amounted only to $11,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 In September 2016, Vistria settled its claims against Freer and the other defendants in exchange for payment of $4,850,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 On April 10, 2017, Freer and JTF sued CLA in Maricopa County Superior Court, alleging that professional negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty by CLA gave rise to the claims against them in the Delaware Lawsuit. In its answer, CLA asserted that applicable statutes of limitations and contractual limitations periods barred the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the superior court held that Freer was bound by the 24-month contractual limitations period in the December Engagement Letter, and ruled the limitation provision barred both plaintiffs' claims. Freer and JTF timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the superior court's grant of summary judgment and application of the law.\n   <em>\n    Andrews v.

Freer is the sole shareholder, president, and founder of JTF, and thus the beneficiary of that sale, with the price to be negotiated based on the financial statements CLA was hired to produce. Freer not only knew of the December Engagement Letter, he signed the management representation verifying the financial information JTF provided to CLA, and CLA relied on the accuracy of those financials in performing its audit. Freer directly facilitated CLA's performance of its obligations for JTF under the letter, and those obligations are at the center of his claims against CLA: that it misrepresented its expertise in the matters for which JTF hired it and breached its fiduciary duty and duty of due care. Thus, Freer's relationship to the December Engagement Letter, his knowledge of its terms, and the relationship of the obligations imposed by the contract to his claim all distinguish the present case from the general rule reiterated in\n   <em>\n    Sierra Tucson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 The superior court held that in light of Freer's role as founder, president, and sole shareholder of JTF, he was bound by the limitations provisions in the December Engagement Letter because his claims cannot be adjudicated without analyzing whether CLA complied with that contract.

Though\n   <em>\n    Manetti-Farrow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hugel\n   </em>\n   , and other closely-related-party doctrine cases typically address forum selection clauses, the same reasoning applies to the limitation provision in the December Engagement Letter. The limitation provision, along with other terms of the December Engagement Letter, promote efficient resolution of disputes while preserving an appropriate avenue for dispute resolution. The application of the 24-month limitation period to Freer's claims arising out of the contractual relationship between JTF and CLA would not have precluded Freer from pursuing those claims. Instead, it merely required him to bring his claims within 24 months after the completion of CLA's report. For the reasons cited above, we conclude that Freer is so \"closely related\" to the contract or its signatories that enforcement of the contract terms was \"foreseeable.\" As the superior court observed, Freer owns JTF and his claims against CLA arise out of and relate directly to the December\n   Engagement Letter between JTF and CLA.\n   <em>\n    See Carlyle Inv. Mgmt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012100\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/214/#p219\">\n    779 F.3d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In determining whether a non-signatory is closely related to a contract, courts consider [\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ] the non-signatory's ownership of the signatory ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 By way of example, Freer's negligent misrepresentation claim alleged CLA misrepresented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) it was qualified and capable of performing an analysis of [JTF]'s historic collection and revenue percentages and converting [JTF] from a modified accrual basis of accounting to a full accrual basis; (2) it was qualified and capable of preparing complete and accurate draft 2013 financial statements and accompanying notes and adjusting journal entries; (3) it was qualified and capable of performing an independent and unbiased audit of [JTF]'s 2013 financial statements in compliance with U.S. GAAS [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ], despite having performed consulting services for [JTF] on the very same control systems and procedures that it would be auditing; (4) it was qualified and capable of detecting and reporting material misstatements in [JTF]'s financial statements and weaknesses in [JTF]'s bookkeeping and accounting practices; and (5) [JTF]'s 2013 audited financial statements had been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Freer went on to allege that he \"relied upon the false information ... and engaged CLA\" to perform certain services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 In short, the crux of Freer's allegations is that CLA negligently misrepresented its qualifications and capabilities so that Freer and JTF would engage CLA to perform the audit, and that CLA's audit was not prepared in accordance to GAAP. Tellingly, Freer alleged his claim against CLA \"stems from actions taken by CLA in performing audit and other accounting work on behalf of its client, JTF.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 We hold that Freer's allegations are closely related to the contractual relationship between JTF and CLA. Moreover, enforcement of the limitation provision was foreseeable to Freer because of his close relationship to JTF and his involvement in the conduct of the contract. Accordingly, Freer is bound by the terms of the December Engagement Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 For the foregoing reasons and those in our related memorandum decision, we affirm entry of judgment against Freer.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
