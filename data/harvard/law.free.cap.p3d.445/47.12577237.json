INTRODUCTION\n  </strong>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   AMENDED OPINION OF THE COURT BY RECKTENWALD, C.J.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues in this case arise from three closed meetings the Honolulu Police Commission held in January 2017 concerning then-Chief of Police Louis Kealoha, who had received notice that he was the target of a federal criminal investigation. The Police Commission cited the need to protect Kealoha's privacy and to confer with its attorney when closing the meetings to the public. At the end of the third meeting, the Commission approved an agreement for Kealoha's retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Several days later, Plaintiff-Appellant Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest, Inc. (Civil Beat) filed a complaint against the Honolulu Police Commission and the City and County of Honolulu (collectively, the Appellees) in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit (circuit court). Civil Beat pled six counts, seeking declaratory rulings interpreting Hawai'i's Sunshine Law, and finding violations of the Sunshine Law. In addition to declaratory relief, Civil Beat sought an order requiring the Appellees to attend Sunshine Law training, releasing the Commission's executive meeting minutes for the three closed meetings, and invalidating the Commission's retirement agreement with Kealoha. Civil Beat did not join Kealoha as a party to the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Appellees filed a motion to dismiss, which the circuit court granted on all counts. Civil Beat appealed to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA), and we accepted transfer of this case to resolve matters of first impression concerning the meaning and scope of the Sunshine Law's open meeting requirement, personnel-privacy exception, and attorney-client exception, and the extent to which closed meetings must conform with these exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing Civil Beat's complaint. The Sunshine Law does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that meetings related to personnel matters be closed to the public; rather, that decision is discretionary, provided that certain statutory requirements are met. Nor does the Sunshine Law subject board members to criminal penalties for holding an open meeting. We resolve these and other questions of law in this appeal, and remand Civil Beat's claims regarding alleged violations of the Sunshine Law, with instructions to order that Kealoha be made a party, or, if he cannot be so joined, the court shall determine whether in equity and good conscience\n   the action should proceed in any form among Civil Beat and the Appellees, or whether it must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because we are reviewing the circuit court's order on a motion to dismiss, our review is \"strictly limited to the allegations of the complaint, and we must deem those allegations to be true.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Rogers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260403\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/103/275/#p280\">\n    103 Hawai'i 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12260403\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/103/275/#p280\">\n    81 P.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195-96 (2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blair v.

The Target Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In December 2016, Kealoha received an FBI Target Letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office notifying him that he was the target of a federal grand jury investigation. In response to the Target Letter, Kealoha voluntarily placed himself on temporary restricted duty. The same day, the Chair of the Police Commission acknowledged the Target Letter and confirmed that Kealoha placed himself on leave. The Chair said that the Commission would consider the issue at its next meeting on January 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Commission Discusses the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" in Executive Session\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Commission's January 4, 2017, meeting agenda indicated that the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" would be discussed in an executive session, closed to the public, pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) and (4), respectively, for the Commission to consider personnel actions \"where consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved\" and to consult with the Commission's attorneys. During the public portion of the Commission's January 4 meeting, the Chair stated that \"because of Hawai'i Revised Statute on personnel matters,\n   <em>\n    we have to\n   </em>\n   discuss [the Police Chief] in executive session.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Commission continued the January 4 meeting regarding the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" to January 6, 2017, and on that day met solely in executive session. After the January 6 executive session, the Commission publicly announced that it had come to \"an agreement in principle on [the Chief of Police's] retirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The City Council is Denied a Briefing on the Retirement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 12, 2017, the Honolulu City Council requested a briefing from the Commission on the retirement agreement. The next day, the Chair of the Commission declined the Council's request, stating that according to the Sunshine Law, \"only the individual [employee] concerned may request an open meeting\" when personnel matters involving the hire, evaluation, dismissal, or discipline of that employee are discussed. The Chair stated that \"without the consent of Chief Kealoha, the Commission cannot discuss this personnel matter in open session.\" The Chair indicated that the Commission members may be subject to criminal penalties if personnel matters were discussed in open session.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Commission Approves a Retirement Agreement with Kealoha in Executive Session\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Commission's agenda for its next meeting on January 18, 2017 stated again that the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" would be discussed in executive session pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) and (4) for the Commission to consider personnel actions \"where consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved\" and to consult with the Commission's attorneys. At the January 18 meeting, the Commission voted in executive session to approve a retirement agreement with Kealoha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Circuit Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Civil Beat's Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 26, 2017, Civil Beat filed a complaint in circuit court against the Appellees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Civil Beat sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including voiding final action\n   taken by the Commission. Civil Beat asserted six claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Count 1: Sunshine Law does not require closed meetings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Count 2: Board members cannot be criminally prosecuted for holding an open Sunshine Law meeting;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Count 3: Not all personnel actions may be discussed in closed session;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Count 4: Personnel evaluations of a police chief must be discussed in open session;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Count 5: The City and the Commission violated the Sunshine Law on January 4 and 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Count 6: The City and the Commission violated the Sunshine Law on January 18, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Counts 1 and 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In Counts 1 and 2, Civil Beat sought declaratory relief interpreting the Sunshine Law's open meeting requirement, HRS \u00a7 92-3, and criminal penalties provision, HRS \u00a7 92-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In Count 1, Civil Beat alleged that the Commission misinterpreted the Sunshine Law's open meeting requirement and that Commission members incorrectly believed that they were required to enter into an executive session to discuss the Chief of Police. Civil Beat asserted that when voting to enter executive session, members of the Commission \"did not believe that they had the option to vote for an open session-stating that 'without the consent of Chief Kealoha, the Commission cannot discuss this personnel matter in open session.' \" Civil Beat sought an order \"declaring that the Sunshine Law does not require boards to enter into executive session[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In Count 2, Civil Beat asserted that the Commission misinterpreted the Sunshine Law's criminal penalties provision because Commission members \"believed that they were subject to criminal prosecution if they discussed the matter in open session.\" Civil Beat sought \"an order declaring that the Sunshine Law does not subject Sunshine board members to criminal prosecution under HRS \u00a7 92-13 for holding an open meeting[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Counts 3 and 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In Counts 3 and 4, Civil Beat sought declaratory relief interpreting the Sunshine Law's personnel-privacy exception, HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2), and applying this interpretation to require the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" to be discussed in open meetings in all circumstances as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In Count 3, Civil Beat alleged that Commission members misinterpreted the personnel-privacy exception to permit an executive session \"for any discussion that involved 'the hire, evaluation, dismissal, or discipline of an officer or employee or of charges brought against the officer or employee' ... regardless whether 'consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved.' \" Civil Beat contended that HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) \"requires an analysis of whether the personnel discussion involves private matters and a balancing of the privacy interests against the public interests in disclosure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In Count 4, Civil Beat applied this balancing test to argue that, as a matter of law, the \"Status of the Chief of Police\" cannot be discussed in executive session due to the public's compelling interest in monitoring the person serving as Chief of Police. Civil Beat argued that \"[p]rivacy is not an absolute when it concerns conduct of government officials\" and noted that the Chief of Police, \"unlike most government employees,\" performs \"a critical function to our community that impacts thousands of people daily.\" Civil Beat thus argued that the public has a compelling interest \"in monitoring both the Chief of Police and the Commission,\" and that this \"outweighs any privacy interests the Chief of Police may have\" in discussions regarding the \"Status\" of this position. \"To prevent future violations of the Sunshine Law,\" Civil Beat requested \"an order declaring that discussion of the 'Status of the Chief of Police' is not a matter 'where consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved' and thus cannot be held in executive session.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Counts 5 and 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In Counts 5 and 6, Civil Beat alleged that the Commission's discussions concerning the\n   \"Status of the Chief of Police\" in the January 4, 6, and 18 executive sessions violated section 92-5(b) of the Sunshine Law because portions of these discussions were not \"directly related\" to any permissible exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Count 5, Civil Beat first raised the issue of whether HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2), the personnel-privacy exception, was permissibly invoked in the specific circumstances here. Unlike in Count 4, Civil Beat's allegations in Count 5 addressed Kealoha's privacy interests, the Target Letter, and the nature of the Commission's deliberations. Civil Beat claimed that the Commission did not discuss \"any highly sensitive information\" concerning Kealoha in the executive meetings. Rather, \"the only development presented to the Commission was the FBI Target Letter that was already public knowledge.\" Civil Beat argued that \"[t]he Commission's deliberations about what it planned to do about the FBI Target Letter, the evaluative criteria it considered, the options it weighed, and how it approached the situation are not private merely because it may affect [Kealoha's] reputation or may be embarrassing.\" Moreover, according to Civil Beat, any privacy interests were outweighed by the public interest in Kealoha's evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As such, Civil Beat claimed, \"[o]n information and belief,\" that \"portions of the January 4 executive session, continued on January 6, concerning the 'Status of the Chief of Police' were not 'directly related' to 'consideration of matters affecting privacy.' \" Additionally, Civil Beat alleged that portions of the same January 4 executive session, continued on January 6, \"were not 'directly related' to questions for the Commission's attorney 'pertaining to the board's powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and liabilities.' \" Civil Beat thus argued that the closed meetings \"exceeded the scope of any permissible [exception].\" Civil Beat sought an order declaring that the Commission violated the Sunshine Law, and \"requiring disclosure of any audio or other recordings and any meeting minutes or similar record\" of the first two executive meetings at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Count 6 was substantially similar to Count 5, though it focused on matters from the Commission's January 18, 2017, executive meeting, including \"the basis for [Kealoha's] retirement, how the Commission evaluated the terms of that retirement, and the reasons that the Commission chose to spend public monies on that retirement[.]\" Like in Count 5, Civil Beat alleged that portions of the January 18 executive meeting were not \"directly related\" to \"consideration of matters affecting privacy\" or to questions for the Commission's attorney \"pertaining to the board's powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and liabilities.\" As such, Civil Beat argued that the Commission \"exceeded the scope of any permissible [exception].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In addition to seeking declaratory relief and disclosure of the January 18 executive meeting minutes, Civil Beat sought an order \"voiding [the Commission's] approval of the retirement agreement,\" pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dismissal of the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On February 16, 2017, the Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Hawai'i Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) Rule 12(b)(6) (2000). The Appellees argued that there was no controversy to resolve in Counts 1 and 2, and that Counts 3 to 6 relied on incorrect interpretations of the Sunshine Law. In opposition, Civil Beat argued that the Appellees misconstrued the law and that they \"move to dismiss by simply ignoring the facts as alleged.\" Regarding Counts 5 and 6 in particular, Civil Beat argued that it would be inappropriate to dismiss the matter due to the presence of disputed issues of fact concerning the scope of the Commission's discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After a hearing on the motion, the circuit court entered a written order dismissing the complaint. The order provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   1. As to Counts [1] and [2], there is no dispute that Defendant Honolulu Police Commission (the \"Commission\") followed the required procedures and properly met in executive session pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"HRS\") \u00a7\u00a7 92-4, 92-5(a)(2), and 92-5(a)(4) to protect privacy interests of the Honolulu Chief of Police and to preserve the attorney-client privilege between the Commission and its counsel. The Commission had the authority to\n   and did meet in executive session to preserve its attorney-client privilege, even if the Commission was not required to meet in executive session to discuss the status of the Honolulu Chief of Police. Therefore, Counts [1] and [2] are dismissed as moot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   2. As to Counts [3] and [4], HRS Chapter 92 does not require a \"balancing of private interest against the public interest in disclosure\" in deciding whether a board may properly meet in executive session. The balancing test set forth in HRS Chapter 92F applies to the \"disclosure of a government record\" and not whether the Commission properly decided to meet in executive session. The Commission properly entered into executive sessions pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-4, 92-5(a)(2), and 92-5(a)(4). As such, Counts [3] and [4] are dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   3. Counts [5] and [6] set forth conclusory, rather than factual, allegations and are therefore dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On November 30, 2017, the circuit court entered final judgment \"in favor of Defendants City and County of Honolulu and Honolulu Police Commission on all claims for relief\" in Civil Beat's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Appellate Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Civil Beat timely appealed the circuit court's judgment to the ICA, and we later accepted transfer of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Civil Beat raises three issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [1]. Whether the public is entitled to declaratory relief to prevent violations of the Sunshine Law by correcting a government board's erroneous understanding that its vote to enter executive session was meaningless because the Sunshine Law required a closed meeting and permitted criminal prosecution of the board members for holding an open meeting (Counts [1] and [2] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   2. Whether the circuit court erred in holding that the Sunshine Law personnel privacy exception broadly applies to all discussion of personnel matters concerning the chief of police regardless whether \"consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved\" (Counts [3] and [4] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [3]. Whether a complainant alleging that a government board exceeded the scope of permissible exceptions to the Sunshine Law during a closed meeting (Counts [5] and [6] ) may be dismissed as a matter of law for failure to state a cause of action under HRS \u00a7 92-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The circuit court improperly applied a heightened pleading standard to dismiss these counts, which sufficiently alleged violations of the Sunshine Law.

Counts 1 and 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The circuit court erred in dismissing Counts 1 and 2 as moot. In both counts, Civil Beat established a live controversy regarding interpretation of the Sunshine Law's open meetings requirement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-3 to - 5, and its criminal penalties provision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In Count 1, Civil Beat alleged that Commission members incorrectly believed that the Sunshine Law required personnel matters to be discussed in executive session, and that the Commission could discuss such matters in an open meeting only with the consent of the person being discussed. In Count 2, Civil Beat alleged that Commission members incorrectly believed that they may be criminally prosecuted under the Sunshine Law for holding an open meeting without Kealoha's consent. While Civil Beat acknowledged that the Sunshine Law provides criminal penalties for \"[a]ny person who willfully violates any [of its] provisions,\" HRS \u00a7 92-13, Civil Beat argued that the Commission's belief was erroneous because holding an open meeting does not violate the Sunshine Law. For both counts, Civil Beat sought declaratory relief \"[t]o prevent future violations\" by correcting the Commission's misunderstanding of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In their motion to dismiss, consistent with their appellate briefs, the Appellees claimed that no controversy existed by avoiding and recharacterizing Civil Beat's arguments. Rather than addressing whether the Sunshine Law requires closed meetings, the Appellees argued that the \"Commission was authorized to conduct a meeting closed to the public under HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) and (4) and followed the proper procedures to hold the executive meeting under HRS \u00a7 92-4.\" They argued that because the Commission satisfied statutory requirements, addressing \"whether the Commission members had incorrect conceptions of the law\" would be a needless academic exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   With regard to Count 2, the Appellees argued that there was \"no dispute and no relief\" because they \"agree\" with Civil Beat that Commission members were not subject to criminal penalties. They explained that they \"agree that the members of the Police Commission were not subject to criminal prosecution because they followed the requirements of HRS \u00a7 92-4 and HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) and (4) when convening the executive session,\" and because no one alleged a willful violation of the Sunshine Law. This did not address Civil Beat's argument in Count 2 that the Sunshine Law does not provide criminal penalties for holding an open meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Furthermore, the Appellees argued that had any Commission members believed that they \"may be subject to criminal prosecution for violating the Sunshine Law by holding the subject discussion in an open meeting,\" such a belief aligned with guidance from the\n   Office of Information Practices (OIP),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"that only the subject employee may request that a meeting under HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) be open to the public[.]\" (Citing OIP S. Memo 09-13, at 4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Appellees appeared to contend that because \"only the subject employee may request that a meeting be open to the public,\" a meeting must be closed under section 92-5(a)(2) unless such a request is made. Under this theory, holding an open meeting without the employee's permission would appear to violate the Sunshine Law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Appellees did not assert that the complaint misrepresented the Commission's interpretation of the Sunshine Law, and they did not otherwise suggest that the Commission's interpretation of the Sunshine Law had changed since the events at issue took place. Moreover, in dismissing Counts 1 and 2 on mootness grounds, the circuit court appeared to conclude that the Commission's interpretation of the Sunshine Law was not relevant, and that clarification of the Sunshine Law was therefore unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"A case is moot if it has lost its character as a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if courts are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract propositions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaho'ohanohano v.

Board members are required to understand the requirements of the Sunshine Law and act in good faith in accord with its spirit and purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Sunshine Law declares the policy \"that the formation and conduct of public policy-the discussions, deliberations, decisions, and action of governmental agencies-shall be conducted as openly as possible.\" HRS \u00a7 92-1. The Sunshine Law implements this policy by establishing the presumption that all government board meetings will be open to the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-3 (\"Every meeting of all boards shall be open to the public and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting unless otherwise provided in the constitution or as closed pursuant to sections 92-4 and 92-5.\").

If board members misconstrue the Sunshine Law and take action based on these misconceptions, their conduct undermines the intent of the Sunshine Law and impairs the public's \"right to know.\" HRS \u00a7 92-1. For this reason, the Sunshine Law provides people access to the courts to ensure that boards understand and comply with their Sunshine Law obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-12(c) (\"Any person may commence a suit ... for the purpose of requiring compliance with or preventing violations of\" the Sunshine Law). Civil Beat sought declaratory relief in Counts 1 and 2 in accord with this purpose, and was entitled to have these counts resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To resolve Count 1, we recognize that the Sunshine Law does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   closed meetings when an exception applies, since the applicable provisions explicitly recognize that the decision to close a meeting is discretionary if certain conditions are met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-4 (\"A board may hold an executive meeting closed to the public upon an affirmative vote, taken at an open meeting, of two-thirds of the members present; provided the affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the members to which the board is entitled. A meeting closed to the public shall be limited to matters exempted by section 92-5.\"); HRS \u00a7 92-5 (\"A board\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   hold a meeting closed to the public pursuant to section 92-4 for one or more of the following purposes[.]\" (Emphasis added)). As such, a board will not violate the Sunshine Law by holding an open meeting, so long as the board has complied with all other Sunshine Law requirements, such as sufficient notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We reject the Appellees' contention that when section 92-5(a)(2) applies, an open meeting may be held only upon the subject employee's request. When section 92-5(a)(2) applies, \"[a] board\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   hold a meeting\n   <em>\n    closed\n   </em>\n   to the public pursuant to section 92-4, ...\n   <em>\n    provided that\n   </em>\n   if the individual concerned requests an open meeting, an open meeting\n   shall be held[.]\" HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   OIP S. Memo 09-13, at 4 (recognizing that when section 92-5(a)(2) applies, an employee has the \"right to require the [board] to consider [the employee's] evaluation in an open meeting\"). This rule does not establish that an open meeting may be held only upon the subject employee's request. Rather, it establishes that an open meeting\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be held if such a request is made. As such, this rule limits the applicability of an\n   <em>\n    exception\n   </em>\n   , and thus places no limitation on the open meetings requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To resolve Count 2, we recognize that pursuant to section 92-13, members of a government board may be prosecuted for willful violations of the Sunshine Law, and upon conviction, will be guilty of a misdemeanor and \"may be summarily removed from the board unless otherwise provided by law.\" HRS \u00a7 92-13. Because holding an open meeting does not violate the Sunshine Law, even when an exception under HRS \u00a7 92-5 is applicable, board members are not subject to criminal prosecution under section 92-13 for holding an open meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Counts 3 and 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In dismissing Counts 3 and 4, the circuit court ruled that \"HRS Chapter 92 does not require a 'balancing of private interests against the public interest in disclosure' in determining whether a board may properly meet in executive session.' \" We affirm this ruling on grounds of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In Count 3, Civil Beat sought a declaration defining the scope of the personnel-privacy exception under section 92-5(a)(2) as one that \"requires an analysis of whether the personnel discussion involves private matters and a balancing of the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure[.]\" As further discussed below, we hold that the Sunshine Law's personnel-privacy exception does not include a public interest balancing test. As such, the circuit court properly ruled against Civil Beat on Count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In Count 4, Civil Beat argued that given the overriding \"public interest in monitoring both the Chief of Police and the Commission,\" the circuit court should declare that \"discussion of the 'Status of the Chief of Police' is not a matter 'where consideration of matters affecting privacy will be involved' and thus cannot be held in executive session\" as a matter of law. However, because section 92-5(a)(2) does not include a balancing test, the public interest in monitoring the Chief of Police would not preclude the Commission from entering into executive session to consider matters affecting the legitimate privacy interests of the Chief of Police. Count 4, which relied on a balancing theory, was thus properly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Moreover, the applicability of section 92-5(a)(2) must be determined on a case-by-case basis, as an analysis of privacy requires a specific look at the person and the information at issue. Although Count 4 referred to \"the Chief of Police\" and \"the Commission,\" the allegations therein were not grounded on the facts of this case concerning the Commission's deliberations about the Target Letter and Kealoha's retirement taking place January 4, 6, and 18, 2017. Without knowing the content of future deliberations about future Chiefs of Police, courts cannot rule as a matter of law that \"matters affecting privacy\" are not involved. We therefore reject Count 4 on this basis as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, while the circuit court properly held that the personnel-privacy exception does not include a balancing test, the circuit court improperly concluded in one part that \"[t]he Commission properly entered into executive sessions pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 92-4, 92-5(a)(2), and 92-5(a)(4).\" The personnel-privacy exception requires the presence of legitimate privacy interests, and an ipse dixit claim to privacy in personnel discussions does not establish that the exception was properly invoked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-1(3) (\"The provisions providing for exceptions to the open meeting requirements shall be strictly construed against closed meetings.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sapp v.

Even though a matter involves the personnel status of an employee, it does not necessarily follow that a legitimate\n   privacy interest was impacted. The record lacks a sufficient factual basis to support the circuit court's conclusion that the Commission properly invoked the personnel-privacy exception.

Understanding that this exception must be \"strictly construed against closed meetings,\" HRS \u00a7 92-1(3), we construe the first and second clause in section 92-5(a)(2) as separate requirements.

The UIPA's privacy exception applies when disclosure of a government record would constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" HRS \u00a7 92F-13(1). In\n   <em>\n    Peer News LLC v.

Neither the language nor structure of the Sunshine Law's personnel-privacy exception aligns with the UIPA in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The plain language of the privacy clause in section 92-5(a)(2) of the Sunshine Law differs considerably from that in sections 92F-13(1) and 14 of the UIPA. The personnel-privacy exception plainly allows a closed meeting if \"consideration of\n   <em>\n    matters affecting\n   </em>\n   privacy will\n   <em>\n    be involved\n   </em>\n   \" in certain personnel discussions. HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2) (emphasis added). The UIPA's plain language, on the other hand, allows a record to be withheld from the public if the record contains information that, if disclosed, \"would constitute a\n   <em>\n    clearly unwarranted\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    invasion\n   </em>\n   of personal privacy,\" HRS \u00a7 92F-13(1), and the UIPA sets forth an express test for determining whether this standard is met,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92F-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In addition to these differences in plain language, the Sunshine Law and the UIPA's exceptions differ in structure. The UIPA establishes a distinct process for first identifying and evaluating privacy interests, and second, determining whether disclosure would constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion\" of these interests. HRS \u00a7 92F-14. The Sunshine Law lacks a similar process for determining whether \"matters affecting privacy\" are involved in a personnel discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Sunshine Law and the UIPA's exceptions also differ in the mode of their application. When a UIPA exception applies, the record is directly exempted from the disclosure requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , HRS \u00a7 92F-13(1) (\"\n   <em>\n    This part shall not require disclosure of\n   </em>\n   : (1) Government records which, if disclosed, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" (Emphasis added)). The Sunshine Law, on the other hand, does not provide automatic exceptions, as boards have the discretion to determine whether a closed meeting must be held.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   When the personnel-privacy exception applies, a government board may decide to close a meeting to engage in deliberations without risking the invasion of fundamental privacy rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Understanding that \"the proverbial bell cannot be 'unrung' with regard to protecting individual privacy interests,\" OIP S.

While they share a similar policy intent, they are different statutes. In light of their distinctions, we do not read the UIPA's balancing test into the Sunshine Law's personnel-privacy exception.

The following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   THE COURT: With respect to Counts 5 and 6, they rely in large part on the claims in Counts 3 and 4 that you apply a balancing test when the court reviews the allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   [COUNSEL]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   THE COURT: So if the court were to agree with the defendants' position that the balancing test that you allege in Counts 3 and 4 does not apply to the meeting, it applies to the documents, then ... what would remain in Counts 5 and 6 to establish that there was a claim for an improper executive session?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   [COUNSEL]: I think it still would be a question of whether or not the entire executive session was proper, ... [and] that just can't be resolved on a motion to dismiss. ... [E]ven if they had a proper invocation of the personnel exception, even if they had a proper invocation of the attorney-client privilege, they still would have to show in some fashion, which often involves in camera review, they would have to show in some fashion that the entire set of meetings was properly within the scope of the executive session.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In its written order, the circuit court dismissed Counts 5 and 6 because they \"set forth conclusory, rather than factual, allegations[.]\" This was improper.

A board, thus, must reconvene in an open meeting to make or deliberate toward a decision to the extent it may do so without defeating the lawful purpose for which the executive meeting may be held.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Based on Civil Beat's allegations in Counts 5 and 6, the circuit court should first determine whether the personnel-privacy exception was a permissible exception for the January 4 meeting, continued to January 6, and for the January 18 meeting. This determination will inform the nature of the court's second inquiry, which is whether the Commission's discussions at each meeting remained directly within the scope of the personnel-privacy exception, if permitted, or were otherwise directly within the scope of the attorney-client exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Permissibility of the Personnel-Privacy Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   To determine whether the personnel-privacy exception applied to the January 4 and 6 executive meetings, or the January 18 executive meeting, the circuit court must determine (1) whether the Commission considered Kealoha's \"hire, evaluation, dismissal, or discipline,\" or charges against him, and (2) whether the considerations involved matters in which Kealoha had a legitimate privacy\n   interest. HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2). The circuit court may only resolve this after further development of the facts and after providing the parties the opportunity to assert their respective positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Based on the limited factual record before this court, we make the following preliminary observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   First, a \"retirement\" is not within the plain meaning of \"hire, evaluation, dismissal, or discipline,\" or \"charges.\" HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2). The allegations in the complaint provide that the Commission, which had already come to an \"agreement in principle\" on Kealoha's retirement on January 6, entered into an executive session on January 18 to reach a formal agreement as to Kealoha's retirement. It is thus unclear, based on the limited record before us, whether the January 18 executive session in fact involved considerations within the scope of the first prong of the personnel-privacy exception. Moreover, as to the \"privacy\" prong, because no legitimate privacy interest may be held in matters already public, Kealoha's retirement would not appear to be within the scope of \"matters affecting privacy\" at the January 18 executive session.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Similarly, the circuit court should consider Civil Beat's allegations regarding the public nature of the Target Letter when determining what matters discussed at the January 4 and 6 executive sessions affected Kealoha's legitimate privacy interests. The court should further consider other circumstances that would limit or perhaps diminish Kealoha's reasonable expectations of privacy in certain information, given his then-role as a prominent public servant at the head of the State's largest police force, and given any other relevant considerations regarding the matters under discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Whether the Discussions Remained Within the Scope of the Permissible Exceptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   If the circuit court finds that the Commission had a proper basis for invoking the personnel-privacy exception at the executive sessions under review, the court must conduct a two-step analysis. First, the court will determine to what extent the Commission's discussions and deliberations therein fell within the scope of the personnel-privacy exception. That is, the court must determine to what extent the Commission's discussions and deliberations were \"directly related to\" the purpose of closing the meeting pursuant to the personnel-privacy exception. HRS \u00a7 92-5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The personnel-privacy exception allows boards to discuss the \"hire, evaluation, dismissal, or discipline\" of personnel, or \"charges brought against\" personnel, without the risk of invading the person's privacy. HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(2). The purpose of this exception is to protect individual privacy rights. Thus, on remand, the circuit court must examine the meeting minutes in-camera to determine to what extent the Commission's discussions were \"directly related to\" this purpose. HRS \u00a7 92-5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Second, if portions of the executive meeting minutes fell outside the scope of the personnel-privacy exception, the circuit court will then alternatively consider the attorney-client exception. The court must determine whether the remaining portions of the executive meeting were \"directly related to\" the purpose of \"consult[ing] with the board's attorney on questions and issues pertaining to the board's powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and liabilities.\" HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   If the circuit court finds that the personnel-privacy exception was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   properly invoked for a given meeting and was therefore impermissible, then the court must proceed directly to the second step of the above analysis to identify whether any portions of the meeting exceeded the scope of the attorney-client exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   If any portions of the meetings at issue exceeded the scope of any permissible exception, then this will indicate that the Commission did not comply with section 92-5(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Scope of the Attorney-Client Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As discussed above, the circuit court must resolve whether the Commission held a closed meeting that exceeded the scope of any permissible exception, and this analysis will involve an in-camera review of the January\n   4, 6, and 18 executive meeting minutes to determine whether portions of the meeting fell outside the scope of the Sunshine Law's attorney-client exception under HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(4).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRS \u00a7 92-5(b). Because our case law has not yet construed the scope of this exception, we take this opportunity to provide guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In the circuit court's order granting the Appellees' motion to dismiss, the court ruled that \"the Commission had the authority to and did meet in executive session to preserve its attorney-client privilege.\" We clarify that a board's authority to meet in executive session to consult with its attorney pursuant to HRS \u00a7 92-5(a)(4) is narrower in scope than the attorney-client privilege, as demonstrated by the plain language and legislative history of the attorney-client exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The attorney-client privilege protects \"confidential communications\" between a client and the client's attorney \"made for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of professional legal services to the client[.]\" Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 503(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Sunset Beach Coal. v.

No. 94-01, at 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    We do not consider these opinions palpably erroneous for referring to the UIPA, as they were limited to circumstances related to the disclosure of meeting minutes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cty. of Kauai v.

As such, these opinions do not suggest that the UIPA's disclosure standard must be applied to determine whether an executive meeting was properly convened.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
