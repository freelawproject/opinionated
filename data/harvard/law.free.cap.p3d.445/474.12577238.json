His parents brought claims for negligence and premises liability on his behalf against Talisker Canyons Finance Company and ASC Utah (collectively, Talisker). Talisker asks us to hold that the Rutherfords' claims are barred by (1) a release of liability signed by Levi's father or, alternatively, (2) Utah's Inherent Risks of Skiing Act, Utah Code sections 78B-4-401 to -404 (the Act).

Today, Talisker asks us to abandon our holding in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   and turn turtle three decades of precedent and the settled expectations of skiers and the ski industry in favor of an alternate approach to interpreting the Act. But because of our established practices in statutory construction and precedential decisions in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , we reject this substitute construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Instead, we hold that Talisker has not convinced us that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   was wrong, much less met its heavy burden to persuade us to\n   overturn such weighty precedent. We therefore uphold the court of appeals' decision that the district court was correct to apply\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . We do, however, take this opportunity to streamline the implementation of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's holding and remand this case to the district court with instructions to apply\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in a manner consistent with this opinion. We also agree with the court of appeals' conclusion to affirm the district court's partial grant of summary judgment to the Rutherfords, finding the release unenforceable under Utah law-although we do so for reasons other than those stated by the court of appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Ten-year-old Levi Rutherford was a member of the Summit Ski Team, an affiliate of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association (USSA), during the 2009-2010 winter season. Levi was an advanced skier who regularly skied \"on the double blacks, which were the expert runs.\" Levi's father signed him up for the team online in the fall of 2009. In the process, Levi's father signed an \"Assumption of Risk and Release of Liability\" on Levi's behalf. The release purported to waive Levi's right to sue USSA, the ski team, and any ski area operator for any injury due to any reason, including the negligence of one of the above-named entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 On January 15, 2010, Levi's parents dropped him off at The Canyons ski resort for ski team practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Levi met up with his coaches, who told him to take a warmup run while they set up gates for training on the Retreat run. At this time, multiple snow-making machines were in operation on Retreat. The coaches did not ask The Canyons to turn off the snow-making machines because \"in the past [The Canyons] kept running the snow guns until they saw that people were up there ... and then they would shut them off when they saw that [the ski team] was on that run.\" The coach in charge of training that day testified in her deposition that she would not have had the team ski through the gates if the snow-making machines were still running by the time the course was set up \"[b]ecause of [the] bad visibility and inconsistent snow.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Levi took his warm up on Retreat while the snow-making machines were in operation, making visibility poor. Warning signs were posted at the top of the run, stating: \"snowmaking in progress.\" Despite the warning, Levi headed down Retreat without making turns. He went into a tuck position with his knees bent, his poles tucked under his arms, and his head near his knees. Near the bottom of the run, Levi ran into a mound of sticky, wet, machine-made snow that was roughly a foot high, which caused him to crash. Levi sustained a brain injury from the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The Rutherfords filed suit on Levi's behalf against the ski team and Talisker. After discovery, the parties filed multiple cross-motions for summary judgment. At issue here are the motions concerning whether the Rutherfords' claims for negligence and premises liability against Talisker are barred either by the release signed by Levi's father or by the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 Regarding the arguments for the release, the district court read this court's precedent in\n   <em>\n    Rothstein v. Snowbird Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8396012\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/175/560/\">\n    2007 UT 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8396012\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/175/560/\">\n    175 P.3d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as meaning that all preinjury releases for recreational skiing are unenforceable, while, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Berry v. Greater Park City Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362664\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/442/\">\n    2007 UT 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362664\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/442/\">\n    171 P.3d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penunuri v.

Based on this understanding, the district court held that the preinjury release signed by Levi's father was unenforceable because the type of skiing Levi was engaged in at the time he crashed was more similar to recreational skiing than competitive skiing. The district court alternatively held that the release was unenforceable under\n   <em>\n    Hawkins ex rel. Hawkins v. Peart\n   </em>\n   , which held that a preinjury release signed by a parent on behalf of a minor was unenforceable for violating Utah public policy.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451281\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/1062/\">\n    2001 UT 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9451281\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/37/1062/\">\n    37 P.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    superseded by statute as stated in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penunuri v.

The court held that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Clover v. Snowbird Ski Resort\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1991), there was a disputed question of material fact as to whether a skier wished to confront sticky, wet, machine-made snow from a machine that was allegedly \"not functioning properly\" and whether that risk could be eliminated through the exercise of reasonable care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 Talisker appealed the district court's partial grant of the Rutherfords' motion for summary judgment and its denial of Talisker's motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed the district court's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b611 With respect to the preinjury release, it affirmed on the ground that the 2006 amendment to the Act, coupled with our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rothstein\n   </em>\n   , effectively overruled\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   and eliminated the distinction between preinjury releases for recreational and competitive skiing, making both types of releases unenforceable.\n   <em>\n    Rutherford ex rel. Rutherford v. Talisker Canyons Fin.

Additionally, the court of appeals \"reject[ed] the trial court's determination that the ... release is unenforceable because it was signed by a parent on behalf of a minor; rather, the release is unenforceable based on the Act's policy statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 30. We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision. Based on our review, we hold that the court of appeals reached the correct result, but that its declaration that preinjury releases signed by parents on behalf of children do not generally offend Utah's public policy was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b612 The court of appeals also affirmed the district court's ruling with respect to the Act's machine-made snow exemption, stating that there is a \"question[ ] of fact regarding the applicability of the machine-made snow exemption\" in the Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. We affirm the court of appeals' and the district court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in making this determination.

For purposes of our opinion today, we begin with our precedential tools. We do so because in\n   <em>\n    Clover v. Snowbird Ski Resort\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1991), this court has already done much of the important work of interpreting the Act. And we find its reasoning both reasonable and persuasive, especially in light of the ambiguity in the Act's construction and the historical context in which it was enacted. With this in mind, and in accord with our case law, we see no reason to abandon the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   court's core interpretation of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 We do, however, take this opportunity to clarify the test announced in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in a way that implements the core holding of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   by simplifying\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's two-prong subjective-objective inquiry into a one-step objective inquiry.

We based our conclusion on a number of observations, all of which remain equally forceful today.

According to Talisker, by superseding\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   with respect to certain equine and livestock activities, the legislature has made clear that preinjury releases signed by parents on behalf of their children do not offend public policy. Talisker's logic does not follow, and this argument may hurt Talisker's case more than it helps. Indeed, it is difficult to logically conclude that the legislature's decision to allow for preinjury releases by parents for minors in one very narrow area translates to a general policy that all such preinjury releases are valid. The conclusion that the legislature meant to say that preinjury releases signed by parents for minors are valid only in the unique context of equine activities is equally likely. In short, the legislature's action sheds no light on its view of the public policy surrounding the larger question, and, absent any positive signal from the legislature, we are loath to forsake\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   and its reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 Having concluded that the preinjury release Levi's father signed on Levi's behalf does not preclude the Rutherfords' claims, we turn to Talisker's argument that the Act stands as a bar to the Rutherfords' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    CLOVER\n   </em>\n   IS ENTITLED TO\n   <em>\n    STARE DECISIS\n   </em>\n   RESPECT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 The district court denied Talisker's motion for summary judgment on the issue of negligence and premises liability based on this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Clover v.

The Act uses the general catchall term of \"dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of ... skiing.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1). If we were tasked with determining whether a danger or condition not covered by the exemplary list was an inherent risk of skiing, we would ask how the specifically enumerated risks can inform our understanding of the general \"dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of ... skiing.\" One way in which the specifically enumerated risks would inform our understanding is to consider the character and nature of those risks. Here, the specifically enumerated risks are presented in the \"character\" or \"nature\" in which a skier would reasonably expect to encounter them while skiing. Instead of listing, say, \"faulty lift towers\" or \"improperly constructed terrain parks,\" the Act simply lists \"lift towers\" and \"terrain parks.\" Therefore, we would only consider a non-enumerated danger or condition to constitute an inherent risk if that danger or condition was of the same character or nature as the enumerated risks-that is, if the danger or condition was one that a skier would reasonably expect to encounter while skiing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b639 And\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's interpretation also makes sense in practice. As\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   succinctly puts it, refusing to modify the list of risks by reference to the phrase \"integral part of the sport of skiing\" would \"result in a wide range of absurd consequences.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at 1044-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Talisker's proposed interpretation of section 402, a collision with a lift tower that the ski resort has intentionally camouflaged as to be practically invisible to skiers is an \"inherent risk of skiing\" because \"impact with lift towers\" is an enumerated risk. That cannot be right; such an interpretation defies our understanding of the \"ordinary and accepted meaning of the term 'inherent' \" as used by the legislature in the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But such results are inevitable under Talisker's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b640 Indeed, the universe of potential absurd scenarios is nearly limitless. For example, the Act includes \"rocks\" in the definition of inherent risks. UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(c). Given the location of ski resorts on mountains, skiers reasonably expect to encounter rocks while skiing. And if a skier's injury was caused by a rock in the state or condition in which a skier would expect to encounter a rock while skiing, then the Act would undoubtedly bar recovery for that injury. But what skiers would not reasonably expect to encounter-and what the Act could not reasonably bar recovery for-are, for example, rocks gathered in a pile in the middle of a blind spot on a beginner ski run waiting to be placed for landscaping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b641 Fortunately, it is a common sense and long-standing canon of construction in Utah that, as between competing interpretations of an ambiguity in a statute, the one that avoids such nonsensical outcomes is generally preferred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Rather, as we noted in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , the legislature's purpose according to section 401 was to clarify that ski area operators may still raise a defense of primary assumption of risk against a skier's claim for liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under this doctrine, ski area operators owe a duty to exercise reasonable care, but a skier assumes the inherent risks of skiing to the extent that those risks persist after the ski area operator's exercise of reasonable care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1409609\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/96/786/\">\n    96 F.

And in doing so, the legislature provided the standard of reasonable care required of ski area operators with respect to the inherent risks of skiing. Specifically, section 78B-4-404 provides that \"[s]ki area operators shall post trail boards at one or more prominent locations within each ski area which shall include a list of the inherent risks of skiing ... as defined in [the Act].\" Therefore, once a ski area operator posts trail boards warning skiers of the inherent risks of skiing, it has discharged its duty of reasonable care-and therefore owes no further duty-with respect to the inherent risks of skiing, and skiers assume the risk of any injury caused by those risks to the extent that they are inherent risks within the meaning\n   of the Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   This understanding of the Act comports with the self-described purpose of the Act to \"clarify the law\" by providing ski area operators with a means to assert the defense of primary assumption of risk while also maintaining a cause of action for skiers injured by risks that they do not assume, such as those risks created by ski area operator negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b653 This interpretation is further bolstered by the fact that the word \"negligence\" is mentioned nowhere in the Act. Unlike the dissent, we find it nigh impossible to believe that the legislature intended to completely abolish the negligence cause of action with respect to enumerated risks when the Act itself says nothing about negligence. It is one thing to say that the legislature could have spoken more clearly, it is entirely another to apply that concept when the act in question neglects to mention its alleged core purpose.

The fact that the legislature has specifically taken up the Act, not once, but twice, and expressly declined to amend it so as to do away with\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's holding, is a good reason to continue to accord\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   weighty\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    b.

There can be no doubt that contracts are in place to supply, maintain, and replace this infrastructure and that some of the personnel forewent other employment opportunities in favor of working at the resort. Nor can there be any doubt that insurers and resort owners have negotiated policies and premiums against the backdrop of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . And consider the potential commercial advantage that Utah ski resorts may have obtained over other ski resorts by virtue of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's construction of the Act-which may afford more opportunities for relief to injured skiers in Utah and hence, at the margins, more incentive to ski in the state. We respectfully suggest that it is na\u00efve to think that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   has not generated significant reliance interests in an industry as large and complicated as Utah's ski industry. And again, Talisker certainly has not met its burden of dispelling this notion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    c. Workability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b669 Additionally, Talisker has not met its burden of producing evidence to suggest that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is unworkable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b670 For one,\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's workability is evidenced by the fact that, despite being nearly thirty years old, it has not generated substantial appellate litigation. This suggests that district courts are able to understand and apply\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in ski area operator liability cases. Of course, other explanations are also possible. But it is Talisker's burden to show us that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is poorly understood. To carry this burden of persuasion, Talisker must adduce evidence of confusion and lack of reliance among litigants and in the lower courts. It has not done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b671 Importantly, the ski industry appears to have done nothing to \"correct\"\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in the legislature. Indeed, when asked at oral argument, both Talisker and amicus Ski Utah stated that they were unaware of any\n   efforts made to lobby the legislature to alter\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's core holding. Certainly, if the standard were as unworkable as Talisker and amici suggest, Utah's ski industry would have, at some point in the last twenty-eight years, introduced some evidence in the record demonstrating the industry's confusion and consternation. It did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b672 Furthermore, other jurisdictions have drawn on\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's analysis in evaluating their own liability statutes. For example, the Supreme Court of North Dakota has adopted\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   's core holding. North Dakota's version of the Act provided that \"[e]ach skier expressly assumes the risk ... for any injury ... caused by the following: variations in terrain; surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions; bare spots, rocks, trees, or other forms of forest growth or debris.\"\n   <em>\n    Bouchard v.

Rather, the Act requires a case-by-case analysis to determine whether the injury-causing risk is truly an inherent risk of skiing under the Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We agree with this holding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b677 To implement this holding,\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   announced a test that asks whether a skier \"wishes (or does not wish) to confront\" a certain risk. If a skier wishes to confront a risk, then it is an inherent risk.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In announcing this clarification, we do not aim to overturn the results of our prior decisions in this area. Instead, we aim to clarify the implementation of law and more clearly bring it in line with the intent of the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b679 The two-prong analysis under\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in which a court first makes a subjective determination of whether a skier wishes to confront a risk followed by an objective determination of the ability to eliminate the risk (in the event that the risk is one a skier does not subjectively wish to confront), can be effectively collapsed into a one-step objective inquiry. Specifically, this objective inquiry asks whether a skier reasonably expects to encounter the risk when skiing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   If so, then the risk is an integral\n   part of the sport of skiing and therefore an inherent risk of skiing. And by extension, the list of enumerated risks captures those risks that the legislature believed to be inherent risks of skiing when they are encountered in the way that skiers would reasonably expect to encounter them. We believe this test effectively captures the legislature's intent when it announced that skiers assume the inherent risks of skiing as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b680 To determine the legislature's intent we can turn to the Act's definition of inherent risks of skiing in section 402. Along with the general definition of inherent risks of skiing, the Act also provides an exemplary list of inherent risks of skiing in section 402. Crucial to our understanding of the legislature's intent is the way in which the exemplary risks are presented: the risks listed in section 402 are presented in an entirely unremarkable manner. That is, all of the risks are presented in the manner in which a skier would reasonably expect to encounter them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. This is useful for understanding exactly what types of risks for which the legislature intended to bar recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b681 For example, the Act bars recovery for injury caused by impact with lift towers. The relevant inquiry in a case involving an impact with a lift tower is whether the legislature meant for the Act to cover the kind of impact with a lift tower at issue in the case. In deciphering what kinds of impact with lift towers the legislature envisioned when drafting the statute, it is telling that\n   the legislature chose to simply use \"lift towers\" with no other qualifying terms. This language conjures up images of standard lift towers as any skier would reasonably expect to encounter them. Similarly, the use of \"impact\" suggests that the types of impacts contemplated with lift towers are those impacts that a skier could reasonably expect to occur while skiing. Interpreting the exemplary risks in this manner dispatches with the possibility of the kind of absurd or unreasonable results that the legislature could not have intended when applying the Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Utah Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8861676\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/13/99/\">\n    13 Utah 2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8861676\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/13/99/\">\n    368 P.2d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 n.3 (1962) (\"[I]t is a general rule that where a statute is ambiguous in terms and fairly susceptible of two constructions, the unreasonableness or absurdity which may follow one construction or the other may properly be considered. Unreasonable, absurd, or ridiculous consequences should be avoided.\" (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of barring recovery for an impact with a lift tower lying on its side waiting to be erected or painted to blend in with its alpine setting, the Act bars recovery for impacts with lift towers as skiers reasonably expect to encounter them. By extension, instead of barring recovery for an injury in which the chairlift cable snaps and a skier is thrown from a lift chair into a lift tower, the Act bars recovery for impacts as skiers would reasonably expect them to occur, such as skiing out of control and crashing into an ordinary lift tower.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b682 In addition to tracking the commonplace descriptions of risks in section 402, requiring an analysis of whether a skier would reasonably expect to encounter a given risk aligns with the purpose of the Act. As section 401 states, the purpose of the Act was to \"clarify the law\" as it existed in 1979. As discussed earlier, the Act served to reassert the defense of primary assumption of risk with respect to ski injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-54. Under a primary assumption of risk analysis, the question is not necessarily whether a skier would \"wish\" to encounter a certain risk, but whether a risk is inherent or essential to the sport of skiing and therefore whether the risk is one that a skier reasonably expects to encounter when participating in the sport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hansen v.

INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b686 The Inherent Risks of Skiing Act is simple and straightforward. It provides a detailed but non-exclusive list of \"inherent risks\" of skiing, UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1) -a list that includes \"snow or ice conditions\" of all kinds, including \"machine-made snow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(b). And it bars claims against ski resorts for injuries resulting from these and other \"inherent risks\" enumerated by the legislature.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b687 Our case law has distorted the clear terms of this statute. In\n   <em>\n    Clover v. Snowbird Ski Resort\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Utah 1991), we erased the categorical bar on recovery for inherent risks of skiing listed in the statute and introduced negligence into the equation. In so doing we nullified the statutory list of inherent risks and redefined that term in accordance with a new liability regime of our own making.\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   conditions statutory immunity on proof that the risk in question (even one listed in the statute) is one that \"no one wishes to confront\" and that \"cannot be alleviated by the use of reasonable care on the part of a ski resort.\"\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b688 This standard has never been elucidated in any workable detail. We have never explained how a court is to decide whether a risk is one that a skier may \"wish[ ] to confront,\" or what sort of evidence may be permitted or required to prove this threshold element. The closest we have come to an explanation is a set of categorical statements in\n   <em>\n    White v. Deseelhorst\n   </em>\n   -that risks such as \"steep grades, powder, and mogul runs\" are\n   risks that skiers wish to confront (and that ski resorts are thus \"relieved of any obligation to eliminate\"), and that risks like \"bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, ... lift towers and other structures\" are risks that skiers do not wish to confront (and thus that are inherent only if they cannot be \"eliminated by reasonable care\").\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10370414\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/879/1371/\">\n    879 P.2d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1375 (Utah 1994) (alteration in original)\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penunuri v.

We have never offered any clarification on our methods of devising these categories, however. And we have never prescribed a standard or means of proving that a risk is one that \"cannot be alleviated by the use of reasonable care on the part of a ski resort.\"\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our opinions in this field, moreover, have been deeply divided-with various members of the court questioning the compatibility of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   framework with the text of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b689 These and other concerns prompted us to invite the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether we should reformulate the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard of liability. The petitioners responded with an extensive showing of the basis for repudiating the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard under our doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . They have highlighted the degree to which\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   distorts the legal framework enacted by the legislature-depriving the statutory list of inherent risks of any meaning, and replacing the statutory grant of immunity with a vague inquiry into negligence. And they have questioned the workability of the existing framework by noting the difficulty of (and lack of any guidance in our cases on) deciding whether a risk is one that a skier \"wishes to confront.\" The respondents, for their part, asked us to retain the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   framework. They urged a reaffirmation of this precedent under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . But they offered little or no help in prescribing a workable means of applying\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   to a case like this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b690 The majority rejects the petitioners' request that we repudiate\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . It opines at length about the importance of the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . And it purports to \"clarify\" and \"streamline\" the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard in a way that renders it more transparent and workable.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12. For all its fulmination, however, the court pays no more than lip service to the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   -stating a patriotic commitment to\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   as super precedent in one breath while completely rewriting the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard in the next. The rewriting is substantial. The majority replaces the two-part standard from\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   with a one-part standard of its own making. Under the majority opinion we ask only what a \"reasonable skier\" would \"expect to confront.\" We have reframed the first step and eliminated the second. And we apparently have abandoned the two categories of risks set forth in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   -with \"steep grades, powder, and mogul runs\" on the \"wish to confront\" side and \"'bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, ... lift towers and other structures' \" on the \"prefer to avoid\" side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b691 Despite this reformulation, the court does nothing to solve the workability problems that have plagued our courts for decades and that prompted our supplemental briefing order and multiple oral arguments in this court. The court relabels the standard-replacing the verb \"wish\" with \"expect.\" And it frames the question in objective terms. But the court's opinion never answers any of the practical questions that we posed to the parties in our supplemental briefing order. In fact, it compounds the unworkability of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   by presenting a standard that sounds\n   <em>\n    alternatively\n   </em>\n   as either a question of law (as to whether the risk in question is presented in a manner that falls within the ordinary meaning of the terms of the statutory list) or a fact-intensive mixed question (as to whether a reasonable skier would expect to encounter the type of risk that is presented in the relevant circumstances).\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D (discussing this problem). And the majority never tells us how either of these standards is to be established-by the court as a matter of law, or by a fact-finder weighing evidence. Nor does the court clarify what it means for a given risk to be \"expected,\" or\n   how expectation is to be proven (through expert testimony, etc.).\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b692 We can do better. Once we own up to the fatal workability problems with\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   we should do more than just rearrange deck chairs. We should state a clear, workable standard that gives voice to the statutory scheme enacted by our legislature. I would do so. I would apply the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act as written and hold that the petitioners are entitled to immunity under the statute if they can establish that the plaintiff's injuries in this case resulted \"from any of the inherent risks of skiing,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-403, listed in the statute, such as \"snow or ice conditions as they exist or may change,\" including \"machine-made snow,\" and \"variations ... in terrain\" resulting from \"snowmaking or grooming operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(b),(d). I would interpret the listed \"[i]nherent risks of skiing\" in their ordinary sense. And I would reverse and remand to allow the parties to present evidence and argument to the district court on the question whether the injury in question resulted from these or other inherent risks of skiing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b693 This approach respects the independent meaning canon and related canons cited by the majority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-38. The cited canons all emphasize a central point-that the statutory definition of \"[i]nherent risks of skiing\" includes a phrase (\"an integral part of the sport of ... skiing\") that should be given independent meaning as a modifier of the statutory \"[i]nherent risks.\" But that is common ground. Everyone agrees that the \"integral part of the sport\" clause has this independent meaning as a modifier. The question is\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the modifier works-in particular, whether it calls for a court to make an independent assessment of whether even a\n   <em>\n    listed\n   </em>\n   risk of skiing is \"integral\" to the sport, or whether listed risks are deemed categorically \"integral\" by being listed. I see no basis for the former approach. It fails because it completely nullifies the detailed statutory list of inherent risks. My reading, by contrast, gives meaning both to the statutory list and to the \"integral part of the sport\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b694 Under my reading, listed risks are categorically included as \"[i]nherent risks of skiing.\" That is the whole point of the statutory list.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401 (emphasizing that the statute's purpose is to \"establish as a matter of law that\n   <em>\n    certain risks\n   </em>\n   are inherent in th[e] sport\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-4-402(1) (indicating that listed risks are \"includ[ed]\" in the \"dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of ... skiing\"). And that list can be treated as categorical without depriving the \"integral to the sport\" clause of its own meaning. The statutory definition, after all, also encompasses unlisted risks-the list is only exemplary. So for an unlisted risk a court must make its own independent assessment of whether it is an \"integral part of the sport\" of skiing. That is the independent meaning of this clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b695 My approach also leaves room for the majority's concerns about \"absurd\" applications. If a ski area operator were ever to stoop to the folly of constructing a \"lift tower\" that is \"practically invisible to skiers,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39, an injured skier could simply assert that such a tower does not fall within the ordinary meaning of the sort of \"lift tower\" that is \"includ[ed]\" as an \"[i]nherent risk[ ] of skiing.\" Or, alternatively, the injured skier could seek resort in the doctrine of absurdity-a safety valve built into our law of interpretation that is designed specifically to deal with the kinds of absurd problems that the majority has imagined. If and when these sorts of outliers come to the court, we could then decide whether to override clear statutory text on the ground that \"no rational legislator could\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   have intended\" such an application.\n   <em>\n    Garfield Cty. v.

But that is not what the majority is doing here. It is not saying that the circumstance before us in this case is so absurd as to justify an isolated departure from the statutory text on the facts of this case. It is conjuring absurd possibilities to support the sweeping conclusion that the statute can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   mean what it says. That is not how the doctrine of absurdity works. Or at least it is not how it has ever worked before today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   John F. Manning,\n   <em>\n    The Absurdity Doctrine\n   </em>\n   , 116 HARV. L.

ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b697 In enacting the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act, the legislature found that the sport of skiing \"significantly contribut[es] to the economy of this state\" and concluded that insurance \"premiums\" for \"ski area operators\" \"have risen sharply in recent years due to confusion as to whether a skier assumes the risks inherent in the sport of skiing.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401. With these concerns in mind, the legislature also adopted a statement of \"purpose\": \"to clarify the law in relation to skiing injuries and the risks inherent in that sport, to establish as a matter of law that certain risks are inherent in that sport, and to provide that, as a matter of public policy, no person engaged in that sport shall recover from a ski operator for injuries resulting from those inherent risks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The operative terms of the statute effectuate this purpose. But\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   overrides those statutory terms. And it does so in a manner that is unworkable and thus unworthy of deference under our doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b698 I set forth the basis for my conclusions and my response to the majority in the paragraphs below. First I highlight the incompatibility of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   with the text of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. Second, I explain the basis for my conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is not only wrong but so clearly wrong and so unworkable that the usual presumption of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is rebutted. Third, I articulate a legal standard that is dictated by the text and structure of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act and describe the grounds on which I would reverse and remand the case to the district court. Fourth, I highlight problems and unanswered questions with the majority's reformulation of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   test, emphasizing that the new test represents a substantial departure from the old one while also managing not to answer any of the practical problems highlighted by the parties in their briefing in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is Incompatible with the Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b699 The text of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act is clear, straightforward, and categorical.

Instead of embracing the statutory list the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   court replaces it with two new tiers of \"risks of skiing\"-those risks skiers \"wish to confront\" and those they do not.\n   <em>\n    Clover,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at 1046-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statute makes no mention of the inquiry into the skier's mindset-of wishing, or not wishing, to confront certain risks. And the statutory list of \"inherent risks\" leaves no room for the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   court's formulation. The statute treats all listed risks equally. All are identified as \"inherent risks of skiing.\" And all are on parallel statutory terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6104 The\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   court overrides this structure. It says that some of the listed risks qualify for statutory immunity but others do not. And it says that the dividing line depends on a criterion nowhere listed in the statute-on whether it is a risk skiers \"wish to confront.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6105 The\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   opinion provides no definition of this crucial criterion. But it does identify some of the risks listed in the statute that purportedly qualify for statutory protection: \"steep grades, powder, and mogul runs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This only highlights the incompatibility of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard with the terms and structure of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. Perhaps there are good policy reasons for treating risks like \"steep grades, powder, and mogul runs\" differently from other, more treacherous risks identified by the legislature-like \"bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, streambeds, cliffs, trees, and other natural objects,\" or \"impact with lift towers and other structures and their components such as signs, posts, fences or enclosures, hydrants, or water pipes.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(c),(e). And maybe the intuition behind this policy is that skiers generally \"wish [or expect] to confront\" only the former risks as a necessary part of skiing. But this policy is not the one embraced by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b6106 The Inherent Risks of Skiing Act also affords categorical immunity to enumerated risks of skiing \"as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-4-401. But\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   reintroduces a negligence standard, asking whether the risk can \"be alleviated by the use of reasonable care.\"\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If so, the ski resort can be held liable.

None of these points is persuasive. I respond to each below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   1. Statutory Structure and Canons of Construction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6108 The majority claims that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   respects the \"structure\" of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. It cites a series of canons that\n   it views as reinforcing the framework set forth in that decision.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   \u00b6109 The \"structure\" cited by the majority is the phrase \"integral part of the sport of ... skiing.\" The majority hangs its textual defense of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   on this clause. It notes that this clause is an element of the definition of the \"[i]nherent risks of skiing.\" And it cites the independent meaning canon to emphasize the independent function of this provision in the statutory definition of the \"[i]nherent risks of skiing.\" The majority's insistence on the independent role of the \"integral part of the sport\" clause is unassailable. But it is also unhelpful to the defense of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   \u00b6110 I have no quarrel with the proposition that the \"integral part of the sport\" clause \"provides important, independent value\" in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. This provision, moreover, surely \"modifies the 'dangers' and 'conditions' \" that count as an \"[i]nherent risk[ ] of skiing.\" It does not follow, however, that the question whether a danger-be it listed or not-is covered by the statute requires a \"case-by-case analysis\" of whether that risk is an integral part of the sport.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   \u00b6111 That is a premise of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . But that premise overrides and completely discredits the statutory list of inherent risks-treating it as an exercise in futility. That cannot be the right way to interpret this statute. The statutory list of risks must have some meaning. And we can preserve independent meaning for the list while also crediting the \"integral part of the sport\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   \u00b6112 There is a straightforward way to preserve independent meaning for both the \"integral part of the sport\" clause and the statutory list of \"inherent risks.\" All we have to do is recognize the dual nature of the statutory definition. By statute, both listed and unlisted risks may qualify as \"inherent risks of skiing.\" The operative provision thus consists of a general definition of \"[i]nherent risks of skiing\" and a list of risks that are \"includ[ed]\" in that definition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   (1) \"Inherent risks of skiing\" means those dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of recreational, competitive, or professional skiing, including, but not limited to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   (a) changing weather conditions;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   (b) snow or ice conditions as they exist or may change, such as hard pack, powder, packed powder, wind pack, corn, crust, slush, cut-up snow, or machine-made snow;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   (c) surface or subsurface conditions such as bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, streambeds, cliffs, trees, and other natural objects;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   (d) variations or steepness in terrain, whether natural or as a result of slope design, snowmaking or grooming operations, and other terrain modifications such as terrain parks, and terrain features such as jumps, rails, fun boxes, and all other constructed and natural features such as half pipes, quarter pipes, or freestyle-bump terrain;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   (e) impact with lift towers and other structures and their components such as signs, posts, fences or enclosures, hydrants, or water pipes;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   (f) collisions with other skiers;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   (g) participation in, or practicing or training for, competitions or special events; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   (h) the failure of a skier to ski within the skier's own ability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402. The \"integral part of the sport of ... skiing\" clause is significant. This clause states the general precondition for a risk to qualify as \"inherent.\" It makes clear that any risk may qualify as \"inherent\" if it is an \"integral part of the sport\" of skiing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6113 This is a clear, independent function of the \"integral part of the sport of skiing\" clause. It forms the backbone of the statute's generally applicable definition of \"inherent risks of skiing.\" For unlisted risks it is the controlling inquiry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6114 It does not follow, however, that the statute leaves a court free to make its own independent assessment of whether a\n   <em>\n    listed\n   </em>\n   inherent risk is an \"integral part of the sport of ... skiing.\" The whole point of the statutory list is \"to establish as a matter of law that certain risks are inherent in th[e] sport\" of skiing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-401. And the list is rendered superfluous if enumerated risks are still subject to elimination if they are not deemed \"integral\" to skiing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6115 The \"integral part of the sport\" clause thus plays a central, independent role in the statutory definition. It modifies the definition of \"[i]nherent risks of skiing.\" But the question is how the modifier works-whether it calls for an independent judicial assessment of whether even listed risks are \"integral,\" or whether listed risks are categorically deemed \"integral\" by being listed. The latter reading is the correct one. And it is the only one that preserves independent meaning both for the \"integral part of the sport\" clause and for the statutory list of \"includ[ed]\" inherent risks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6116 The statutory list is extensive and detailed but non-exhaustive. It comes on the heels of the general definition-which consists of the \"integral part of the sport\" of skiing clause-as a set of dangers that are \"includ[ed]\" in the definition.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-402(1) (stating that the \"[i]nherent risks of\n   skiing\" \"includ[e]\" but are \"not limited to\" the listed dangers).\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   also renders that proviso superfluous. It says that listed dangers may or may not be included-it depends on whether a court deems them \"integral\" in the sense of being risks skiers \"wish to confront.\" This is yet another problem with the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6117 We have never clearly stated what it means for a risk to be one that skiers \"wish to confront.\" But we have asserted that some of the risks listed by the legislature are \"inherent\" in skiing and that others are not. We have characterized \"steep grades, powder, and mogul runs\" as \"inherent\" in the sport of skiing, while insisting that \" 'bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, ... lift towers and other structures' \" are not inherent \"[i]f they can be eliminated by reasonable care.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10370414\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/879/1371/\">\n    879 P.2d at 1375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). But these propositions are utterly irreconcilable with the clear text of the statute. By statute, all of the foregoing conditions are \"includ[ed]\" as \"[i]nherent risks of skiing.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78-B-4-402(1)(c)-(e) (stating \"bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps,\" \"variations or steepness in terrain,\" and \"impact with lift towers and other structures\" are all inherent risks). And a legal regime that sweeps away the obvious point of this statutory list cannot be viewed as compatible with the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6118 There is an irony in the majority's resort to canons that emphasize the importance of preserving independent meaning for each provision of a statute. I endorse those canons. But they cut against the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   approach and in favor of the statutory framework that I have outlined. My approach preserves meaning for each separate clause-for the \"integral part of the sport\" clause and for the enumerated list of \"[i]nherent risks.\"\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, proffers a construction of the first of these clauses that utterly obliterates the second. And that is incompatible with the canons identified by the majority and thus fatal to the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   2. The Statutory Goal of Clarifying the Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6119 The majority next asserts that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is consistent with \"the codified purpose\" of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 n.10. Again citing\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , the majority contends that \"the purpose of the statute was 'to clarify the law, not to radically alter ski resort liability.' \"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 n.10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10380652\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/808/1037/\">\n    808 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1045 ). And it insists that the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   court reasonably \"recognized that, unless the Act was construed to allow suits arising from the negligence of ski area operators-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , from any risks that were not integral to the sport-the statute would effectively abolish the negligence cause of action against ski area operators.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 The majority further claims that this \"understanding of the Act comports with the self-described purpose of the Act to 'clarify the law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.

And the majority today says that this \"appears to be correct.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6121 I have no quarrel with the idea that the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act was \"clarifying\" our law. And I have no doubt that the statute speaks to an area of the law previously covered by the common law doctrines of primary and secondary assumption of risk. But I see no basis for the conclusion that the statute was merely restoring a body of common law cases. The statute, of course, says nothing about restoring a ski area operator's right to \"raise a defense of primary assumption of risk against a skier's claim for liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. And it certainly does not say that \"ski area operators owe a duty to exercise reasonable care, but a skier assumes the inherent risks of skiing to the extent that\n   those risks persist after the ski area operator's exercise of reasonable care.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b651. Those might be good policies. But they are not the policies set forth in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   \u00b6122 The statute does identify a purpose of \"clarify[ing]\" the law in this area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401. But that does not tell us\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   clarification the legislature had in mind. It doesn't tell us whether the clarification involved a minor alteration of the law or a \"radical\" one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. To discern the nature and extent of the clarification we have to look at the text of the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   \u00b6123 The statute speaks of clarification after lamenting \"confusion\" in the law \"as to whether a skier assumes the risks inherent in the sport of skiing.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401. That suggests that the clarification accomplished by the statute is in setting out a bright-line rule in a previously murky area. The statutory definition of \"inherent risks of skiing\" does just that. It furthers the legislature's stated purpose of \"establish[ing] as a matter of law that\n   <em>\n    certain risks\n   </em>\n   are inherent in th[e] sport\" of skiing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-401 (emphasis added). The statutory clarification is thus enhanced by giving effect to the plain meaning of the enumerated list of inherent risks of skiing. So the general reference to the goal of clarification does nothing to support the obliteration of the statutory framework established by the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   \u00b6124 The problem with the majority's approach is not its general premise that the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act \"clarif[ies] the law\" by codifying the doctrine of primary assumption of risk. It is its specific conclusion as to which risks are subject to that doctrine. The statute says that listed risks are \"inherent\" and thus beyond the defendant's duty to discover and prevent. Yet the majority rejects that conclusion, adopting instead a standard under which no risk is categorically inherent-not even a risk listed in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   \u00b6125 The majority seeks to \"bolster[ ]\" its approach by noting the absence of the word \"negligence\" in the statute.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. It finds it \"nigh impossible to believe that the legislature intended to completely abolish the negligence cause of action with respect to enumerated risks when the Act itself says nothing about negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. And it finds the abolition of negligence claims arising from inherent risks of skiing a large \"elephant\" unlikely to be hidden in the \"mousehole\" of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. I see this differently. I see neither an\n   <em>\n    elephant\n   </em>\n   nor a\n   <em>\n    mousehole\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   \u00b6126 The statute, as all agree, addresses an area of our law that had long been in a state of confusion-the applicability of the doctrine of primary assumption of risk to the sport of skiing. We also all agree that the statute establishes a bar on tort claims for risks that are deemed \"inherent\" and an \"integral part of the sport.\" With that in mind, there is nothing elephant-ish about the establishment of a bar on a negligence claim for injuries arising from inherent risks of skiing. Nor is there anything mousehole-ish about the terms of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. The majority is right that the statute never uses the term negligence. But it speaks clearly, and in even more sweeping language-in expressly establishing the \"purpose\" of \"provid[ing] that, as a matter of public policy, no person engaged in th[e] sport [of skiing] shall recover from a ski operator for injuries resulting from th[e] inherent risks\" of the sport, UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401, and categorically providing that \"no skier may make any claim against, or recover from, any ski area operator for injury resulting from any of the inherent risks of skiing,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-4-403.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   \u00b6127 I read these provisions to sweep even more broadly-and clearly-than a bare statement of repudiation of a \"negligence\" claim for injuries arising from inherent risks of skiing. Granted, the legislature never said it was abrogating a \"negligence\" claim against ski resorts. But it did say that it was abrogating \"any claim against, or recover[y] from, any ski area operator for injury resulting from any of the inherent risks of skiing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And this is no mousehole. It's a sweeping statement that \"any\" and all \"claim[s]\" or attempts to \"recover\" are barred. This is an elephanthole (or whatever we would call the type of large chasm an elephant might crawl into)-and a clear statement by the legislature that the majority has rendered meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   3. \"Absurd Consequences\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   \u00b6128 The majority next hypothesizes \"absurd\" applications of the plain language of the statute that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   purportedly avoids. The majority imagines \"intentionally camouflaged\" lift towers that are \"practically invisible to skiers.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. It \"cannot be right,\" in the majority's view, that a collision which such nefarious death-traps is covered by the statute. And because the court sees such a conclusion as \"inevitable,\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39., it invokes the absurd consequences canon to justify the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   \u00b6129 This is problematic. Legislative line-drawing may often seem arbitrary. But that is no license for judicial rewriting of legislation. We may override clear statutory text only in the very rare event that the language enacted into law is not just arbitrary but outright absurd-\"so absurd that no rational legislator could\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   have intended it.\"\n   <em>\n    Garfield Cty. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2041\">\n    2017 UT 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23 n.55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n    424 P.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   \u00b6130 The list of risks in the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act is hardly absurd. It consists of dangers that the legislature considered to be inherent in the sport. And for those dangers the statute calls for immunity for ski area operators. Yet the statute does not foreclose immunity for other risks. For unlisted risks the statute calls for a case-by-case determination of whether the risk is a \"danger[ ] or condition[ ] which [is] an integral part of the sport\" of skiing. UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   \u00b6131 This is a sensible legal framework. An \"impact\" with a \"lift tower[ ]\" is a listed \"inherent risk.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(e). But an invisible lift tower could reasonably be dismissed as a deviation from the ordinary understanding of \"lift tower,\" and thus falling outside the terms of the statute. If so, the statute's language would not be interpreted to stretch to cover such a deviation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. The same may hold for the majority's example of the \"pile of rocks intended for later landscaping placed in the middle of a beginner run.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. The listed risk, after all, speaks not of \"rocks\" in the abstract, but of \"surface or subsurface conditions such as bare spots, forest growth, rocks, stumps, streambeds, cliffs, trees, and other natural objects.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(c). And a man-made \"pile of rocks\" placed artificially on a ski run \"for later landscaping\" at least arguably would not qualify as a \"natural\" \"surface or subsurface condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Natural\n   </em>\n   surface or subsurface conditions presumably would be limited to relatively permanent conditions existing in nature, and would not extend to conditions created temporarily by human intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   \u00b6132 Yet we need not decide the \"invisible lift tower\" or \"pile of rocks\" cases to resolve the one before us today. Our law of interpretation bears tools that are suited to the resolution of the majority's hypotheticals-and that would allow us to do so without distorting the statute in a case that is more standard (and in no way presents any concerns about absurdity). The principal tool is the doctrine of absurdity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   \u00b6133 This doctrine yields limited power for courts to override the clear terms of a statute. We may do so, however, only in the rare, limited circumstance in which we can conclude that \"no rational legislator could\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   have intended it.\"\n   <em>\n    Garfield Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2041\">\n    2017 UT 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23 n.55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12569494\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/424/46/\">\n    424 P.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When we do so, moreover, we do not strike the statute down, or distort its terms as applied to standard (non-absurd) circumstances. We simply foreclose the application that is deemed to satisfy the high bar of absurdity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   John F. Manning,\n   <em>\n    The Absurdity Doctrine\n   </em>\n   , 116 HARV. L. REV. 2387, 2388 (2003) (stating that the absurdity doctrine allows departure from \"clear[ ] statutory text\" when a \"given application\" would produce an absurd result). The majority distorts the absurdity doctrine here. It employs hypothetical circumstances that might test the limits of the statutory text\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to foreclose application of the statute to those specific circumstances, but to rewrite the statute more generally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is problematic.

Constitutional Avoidance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   \u00b6134 A final point raised by the majority is its assertion that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is justified on constitutional avoidance grounds.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.

If a law is working well in practice and sustains significant reliance interests, it may be costly to reform the law by overruling precedent. And that is a point favoring deference to precedent. The second consideration goes to the upside of overruling an erroneous precedent. The more clearly errant a prior decision, the greater the need to set it aside in advancing our commitment to the rule of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6142 This is what our cases mean when they speak of more \"good\" than \"harm\" coming from overruling a prior opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Admiral Beverage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982810\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/275/208/\">\n    2011 UT 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6982810\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/275/208/\">\n    275 P.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The principal \"harm\" is in undermining stability of our law and reliance interests built around our precedent. So the argument for overruling a prior decision is strongest when the costs of overruling (from a reliance or stability standpoint) are low and the benefits (from a rule of law standpoint) are high. And that is the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   \u00b6143 First, the usual costs of overruling precedent are diminished here because\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is not deeply rooted in our law, is unworkable in practice, and does not sustain significant reliance interests. The inquiry called for in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   -as to whether a given risk is one that skiers may \"wish to confront\"-does not lend itself to consistent, principled application. Indeed the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   standard masks a latent ambiguity that invites arbitrariness. And that renders\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   more vulnerable under our doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    2015 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    345 P.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (identifying the \"fact-intensive\" nature of an issue, the dearth of case law guidance, and the fact that \"trial courts and juries\" are left \"to make decisions that are effectively without guidance\" as grounds for overturning precedent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   \u00b6144 One formulation of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   inquiry would invite fact testimony and lay analysis-as to whether a given risk is one that a reasonable skier would \"wish to confront.\" Yet this is an invitation for arbitrariness, and for overriding the clear terms of the statute. Many of the risks deemed \"inherent\" by the legislature are unlikely to be desired by many skiers. \"[B]are spots,\" for example, are listed in the statute as an inherent risk of skiing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(c), but many skiers likely would prefer not to \"confront\" them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Other similar examples appear in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1) (listing many risks that many skiers undoubtedly would prefer not to confront, particularly when they result in injury, such as \"changing weather conditions,\" \"slush,\" \"collisions with other skiers,\" and \"the failure of a skier to ski within the skier's own ability\"). So this inquiry opens the door for the factfinder to deem most any risk listed in the statute as one a reasonable skier would not wish to confront. And that would thoroughly defeat the clear terms of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6145 Perhaps the use of expert testimony regarding what dangers are standard within the industry would remove some of the arbitrariness in the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   analysis. Yet it is also likely that it would lead to the \"dueling expert\" trial, in which each side presents opinion\n   testimony on whether the ski area in question lived up to industry standards. And that sort of inquiry would stretch the legal framework of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act past its breaking point. The purpose of the statute, as noted, was \"to establish as a matter of law that certain risks are inherent in\" skiing, and to thus provide that \"no person engaged in that sport shall recover from a ski operator for injuries resulting from those inherent risks.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-401. Those purposes would be thwarted by a legal framework that requires expert testimony to determine whether the risks presented at a given ski area are in line with an industry standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   \u00b6146 The \"industry standard\" inquiry is a matter for the law of negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the liability of a ski area operator for injuries resulting from risks listed as \"inherent\" were dependent upon a case-by-case assessment of the operator's compliance with industry standards, then the core premise of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act would be defeated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6147 Neither variation on the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   inquiry is accordingly viable. And absent some refinement or reformulation, our law under\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   leaves parties guessing about the likely outcome of a case filed under the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. That is a hallmark of unworkability-and a basis for overruling\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   despite the deference that is normally owed to our precedent under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    2015 UT 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879938\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/553/\">\n    345 P.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (overruling a legal standard in our precedent on the ground that it left fact-finders \"without guidance\" to make a highly \"fact-intensive\" determination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6148 This is one of the reasons we sought supplemental briefing from the parties in this case. The initial briefing left us without much guidance on the proper framework for assessing whether and to what extent a given risk is one that skiers may \"wish to confront.\" And we accordingly asked the parties to advise us (a) on whether to retain or repudiate\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , and (b) on how to frame the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   inquiry into risks that skiers \"wish to confront\" in the event that we kept that standard in place. That briefing offered little help on the latter question. And the lack of a reasoned basis for distinguishing the two categories of risks identified in\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is a basis for concluding that the standard established in that case is not just wrong but unworkable-and thus unlikely to sustain significant reliance interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6149 The majority disagrees. Yet it has not offered an answer to the analytical puzzle left open by\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   -as to the means of assessing whether a given risk is one that skiers \"wish to confront.\" Instead, the majority relies on a simple reformulation of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   test-substituting the word \"expects\" for \"wish.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. But this does nothing to reduce the uncertainty generated by\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . Our decision today will only perpetuate the uncertainty and continued litigation about the availability of immunity under the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. We still have not explained how a court is to decide whether a given risk is one that a reasonable skier might or might not \"expect\" to encounter on her journey down the slopes. And this is an open invitation for courts to enact their own judgment about what is \"reasonable\" into the law. The majority's failure to delineate an applicable rule of law based on\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   further underscores the need for us to revamp our law in this area-and to bring it in line with the statutory text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   \u00b6150 The majority offers a series of grounds for rejecting this conclusion.

We requested supplemental briefing from the parties on how courts could determine whether a risk is one that \"skiers wish to confront.\" The parties could not identify a workable standard.

This is not a decision that overrides a statutory list of inherent risks of skiing and replaces it with a new set of categories turning on a determination of which risks skiers \"wish to confront.\" It is simply a restatement of the operative statutory standard. The North Dakota statute is distinct from our Utah statute. It begins with an extensive list of \" 'duties' \" that \" '[e]very ski operator shall have ... with respect to the operation of a skiing area,' \" and then proceeds to state that skiing is \" 'hazardous ... regardless of all feasible safety measures which can be taken,' \" and thus that \" '[e]ach skier expressly assumes the risk of' \" injuries resulting from enumerated inherent risks of skiing.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 83 (quoting North Dakota statute).

But it nowhere endorses the framework of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   decision. And again the statute at issue is distinct from our Utah statute. The New Hampshire statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Nutbrown\n   </em>\n   is like the North Dakota and Montana statutes: It begins with an express list of duties of ski area operators, and only then provides that \"[e]ach person who participates in the sport of skiing accepts as a matter of law, the dangers inherent in the sport.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 679-81 (citing New Hampshire statute).

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Nutbrown\n   </em>\n   cites\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   only for the proposition that \"[t]he statute does not purport to immunize a ski area operator for injuries caused by the operator's own negligent or intentional acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 680. And it ultimately gives effect to the statutory scheme. It holds that the plaintiff stated a viable claim arising from the ski area operator's failure \" 'to properly mark' the beginning of a trail\" because that involved the breach of a duty set forth by statute, but that plaintiff's other claims all involved \"allegations of fault and causation [that] were inherent risks of skiing and thus [were] not actionable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 683. Thus, if anything\n   <em>\n    Nutbrown\n   </em>\n   undermines\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ; it does so by following the operative statutory scheme instead of replacing it with a new \"inherent risks\" standard of a court's own making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b6161 For these reasons the majority's cited cases do nothing to sustain the viability of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   framework (or the puzzling modification made thereto today).

At most, the majority has identified a statement by a single member of the 2006 legislature indicating his view that the 2006 amendment to the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act would not \"exempt the negligence of the ski resort\" from liability in certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. But that is insufficient for numerous reasons. For one thing, the views of a single member of the legislature have no power to bind the whole body. For another, the 2006 legislature cannot override the views of the 1979 legislature (which enacted the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act) without repealing the statute. The legislature as a body expresses its views only by voting a bill into law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graves v. N. E.

And the statement made by Senator Hillyard on the Senate floor was never voted into law. It accordingly tells us nothing of relevance to the question presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   \u00b6169 Even if this kind of statement could tell us something of relevance about this question,\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   statement actually cuts the other way when Senator Hillyard's comments are considered in context. The statement reads in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-224\">\n   Now, I should indicate that there's no intention in this to exempt the negligence of the ski resort.\n   <em>\n    In other words, if they have an employee running a trail groomer and they run somebody over, that's ordinary negligence\n   </em>\n   .

And I think for everyone involved we should just [ ] keep up to date and clarify that policy. And so that's what we've done is [ ]\n   <em>\n    taken those words\n   </em>\n   and [ ]\n   <em>\n    give them better definitions and more specificity\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Recording of Utah Senate Floor Debates, 56th Leg., Gen. Sess. (Feb. 13, 2006) (statement\n   of Sen. Lyle Hillyard) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6170 There are two important points to highlight. First, Senator Hillyard's example of ski resort negligence is beyond the bounds of the enumerated inherent risks. Senator Hillyard could have used an example that supports the majority's interpretation. He could have said that even though impact with signs or fences is listed as an inherent risk of skiing, a skier could still recover where the ski resort had been negligent in placing that sign or fence. But instead he used an example of negligence of an employee \"running a trail groomer.\" That is not an inherent risk of skiing enumerated in section 78B-4-402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   \u00b6171 Second, not only does Senator Hillyard fail to mention\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ; he also endorses the \"policy\" that the \"state made ... in the 1980s,\" which he characterizes as the \"policy of the state of Utah.\" Perhaps Senator Hillyard is thinking about this policy with the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   overhaul in mind. But there's nothing in his statement to suggest that. And the context of the statement cuts the other way. Hillyard harkens back to the \"policy\" that the \"state made in the 1980s,\" not the common law developments since that time. And he states the purpose of proposing an amendment to \"take [the statute's] words and [ ] give them better definitions and more specificity.\" There is no real point to clarifying the definitions of the items on the statutory list under\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ; that decision renders the statutory list irrelevant. So if anything Hillyard's comments seem to reinforce the statutory standard-not the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   rewrite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   2. Reliance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   \u00b6172 The majority's final point is the assertion that a decision to overturn\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   might upset significant reliance interests. Here the majority suggests that ski resorts may have \"invested in infrastructure and personnel to abate potential negligence actions under\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\" that \"insurers and resort owners\" may have \"negotiated policies and premiums against the backdrop of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   ,\" and that Utah ski resorts \"may have obtained\" a commercial advantage by attracting skiers with the allure of a more friendly tort system.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   \u00b6173 I cannot dispute that there may be some degree of disruption in a decision to overturn\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . But a decision to overrule precedent will always have some effect. That alone cannot be enough to sustain a precedent that is both clearly incompatible with the controlling statute and unworkable in its application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Robertson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2027\">\n    2017 UT 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 31-34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575056\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/438/491/\">\n    438 P.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (overturning precedent after considering \"the plausibility of the existing interpretation\" and whether the interpretation \"has worked in practice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   \u00b6174 This holds even when we can identify some reliance interests built up around our precedent. A decision like this one is always a balancing act. I acknowledge that there are some downsides to setting aside\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   . But I would nonetheless overrule it because the significant upsides substantially outweigh the downsides.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   \u00b6175 Perhaps it's true that ski resorts, insurers, and even skiers rely to some degree on the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   framework. But these reliance interests are minimal. Ski resorts likely have negotiated insurance premiums with\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in mind, but their reliance interests cannot be harmed by following the language of the statute, which severely\n   <em>\n    limits\n   </em>\n   liability. And nothing in our opinion would inhibit a resort from independently compensating injured skiers if in fact they receive more business on account of Utah's increased \"incentive[s] to ski in the state.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   \u00b6176 Rutherford's reliance interests-as well as those of similarly situated skiers-are minimal. This is so because an unworkable precedent is unlikely to sustain the same kind of reliance interests as a decision establishing a clear, bright-line rule. When a decision is unworkable, litigants will struggle to predict its application, and thus to rely on its operation. No one can anticipate the effects of\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   in difficult cases because the standard is stated in such ambiguous terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   \u00b6177 And overturning Clover has significant upsides. We can be faithful to the governing statute while reducing confusion by implementing a framework that is predictable in its application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   C. Remand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   \u00b6178 For all of the above reasons I would conclude that\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   is ripe for reconsideration. And I would repudiate it on the ground that it is clearly incompatible with the statutory scheme enacted by the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   \u00b6179 That takes us back to square one. And square one in a statutory case is always the statutory text. The text of the statute is the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graves v. N.E. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880071\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/619/\">\n    2015 UT 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6880071\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/345/619/\">\n    345 P.3d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The governing law is defined ... by the statutory text that survived the constitutional process of bicameralism and presentment.\"). That text governs-without any need for elaboration or consideration of other sources-so long as it is plain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64 (explaining that we look beyond the text to \"inform[ ] our construction of ambiguities in the law,\" \"[b]ut its utility ends there\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   \u00b6180 Here the statute is plain. It speaks in broad, categorical terms. It says that \"no skier may make any claim against, or recover from, any ski area operator for injury resulting from any of the inherent risks of skiing.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   \u00b6181 This is the operative legal standard. Under the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act, a skier's tort claim is statutorily barred if it is (a) for an \"injury resulting from\" (b) \"any of the inherent risks of skiing.\" These are questions of causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barneck v. Utah Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    2015 UT 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 36-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6859339\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/353/140/\">\n    353 P.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing \"result from\" language in a statute as a \"causation standard\"). The first inquiry concerns the causal connection between the skier's injury and an alleged risk of skiing. The next question is whether the risk of skiing qualifies as an \"inherent risk of skiing\" under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   \u00b6182 That is purely a question of statutory interpretation. The statute defines inherent risks of skiing and includes a list of such risks. UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1). If a skier's injury is causally connected to that risk and the risk qualifies as an \"inherent risk of skiing\" under the statute then the plaintiff's claim is statutorily barred. The statute leaves no room for any inquiry into whether the risk in question is one that skiers might wish to confront, or any of the related elements of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   analysis. It does, however, leave open the question whether the injuries at issue here resulted from a risk encompassed within the ordinary meaning of the terms of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   \u00b6183 I would remand for further proceedings under that standard. Talisker asserts that the snow that caused Levi Rutherford's injury was an \"inherent risk of skiing\" under the terms of the statute. It notes that the statute lists \"snow or ice conditions\" as an inherent risk of skiing,\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(b), and that \"machine-made snow\" counts as a \"snow or ice condition[ ]\" that is an inherent risk.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Talisker also emphasizes that inherent risks also include \"variations or steepness in terrain, whether natural or as a result of slope design, snowmaking or grooming operations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   \u00b6184 Talisker may well be entitled to summary judgment under the ordinary meaning of these terms of the statute. But the Rutherfords have not had an opportunity to present an argument that the snow and ice conditions in question do not fall within the statutory terms. And this question has never been decided by the district court. We should remand to allow that court to resolve this issue in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   D. The Majority's Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   \u00b6185 The majority claims to \"clarify\" the holding in our\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   opinion.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. But the majority's standard is hardly clear. Quite the contrary. The court seems to articulate two alternative standards-without committing itself clearly to either, and without explaining how either should play out in practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   \u00b6186 At times the court seems to be thinking of an \"inherent risks of skiing\" inquiry that is framed as a question of law, turning (at least in part) on the ordinary meaning of the text of the statute. This is arguably implied by the court's assertion that its test \"track[s] the commonplace descriptions of risks\" set forth in the statute,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82, and requires a consideration of the unadorned terms of the listed risks in the manner that a \"skier would reasonably expect to encounter [them] while skiing,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. This seemingly legal inquiry suggests that a ski resort would be entitled to immunity under the statute if an injury results from a listed risk \"when\" it is \"encountered in the way that skiers would reasonably expect to encounter\" it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   \u00b6187 Elsewhere, however, the court seems to speak of the\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   inquiry in terms that contemplate a fact-intensive mixed question. Quoting\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , the majority says that \" '[c]ourts cannot determine that a risk is inherent in skiing simply by asking whether it happens to be one of those listed in' \" section 402 of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79 n.27. \"Instead,\" the court says that we must ask (even for injuries arising from risks listed in the statute) whether the risk \"was an integral part or essential characteristic of the sport of skiing\"-an inquiry that seems to contemplate a fact-intensive determination of whether the particular circumstance of the injury is one that \"a skier ... reasonably expects to encounter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This also seems reflected in the question that the majority frames for the district court on remand: \"whether a skier would reasonably expect to encounter the wet, sticky snow that [Rutherford] encountered at The Canyons.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   \u00b6188 The majority's discussion of the statute's treatment of \"impact[s] with lift towers\" (a risk identified by the legislature as \"inherent,\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 78B-4-402(1)(e) ) highlights the internal tension in the majority's approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court first says that \"[t]he relevant inquiry in a case involving an impact with a lift tower is whether the legislature meant for the Act to cover\n   <em>\n    the kind of impact\n   </em>\n   with a lift tower at issue in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81 (emphasis added). And it says that the statute \"bars recovery\" for claims by skiers who \"ski[ ] out of control and crash[ ] into an\n   <em>\n    ordinary\n   </em>\n   lift tower.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81 (emphasis\n   added). This sounds like the framing of a legal question-as to the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute. Yet the court never establishes this as the governing legal standard. In fact it seems to take back the framing of a legal question in the same paragraph of the opinion, where it asserts that the statute should be understood to \"bar[ ] recovery for impacts\n   <em>\n    as skiers would reasonably expect them to occur\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. This, again, seems more of a factual inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   \u00b6189 The fact-intensive nature of the court's standard seems reinforced elsewhere in the opinion where the majority analyzes the \"pile of rocks\" hypothetical.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. There the court concludes (wrongly in my view-\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 131-32) that a \"pile of rocks intended for later landscaping placed in the middle of a beginner run ... is certainly a 'surface ... condition[ ] such as ... rocks\" within the ordinary meaning of the\" statutory text.\n   <em>\n    Supra \u00b6\n   </em>\n   43. Yet the majority suggests that this would fall outside the \"inherent risks\" covered by the statute-presumably because (in the court's view) a reasonable skier would not \"expect to confront\" these sorts of \"rocks.\" This is consistent with the majority's assessment of another hypothetical-the \"twenty-yard bare spot running through the middle of a groomed ski run.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 n.15. On this hypothetical the court accepts the notion that this \"is a 'bare spot[ ]' under ordinary meaning analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 n.16. But it again suggests that its\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   reformulation would allow our courts to uphold a skier's right to sue on an injury caused by such a bare spot-again presumably because a purportedly reasonable skier would not \"expect to confront\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   \u00b6190 For these reasons I read the majority opinion to eschew a legal construct of \"inherent risks\" rooted in a question of statutory interpretation and to endorse a free-ranging, fact-intensive inquiry into what a reasonable skier would \"expect to confront.\" Yet I also have no idea what either test would entail in practice. And I grieve for the trial judge or litigant who is left to decode the tea leaves we leave on this question in our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   \u00b6191 The court's framing of a quasi-legal inquiry leaves several key questions unanswered. If the law requires us to ask whether a given injury resulted from a risk that is \"encountered\n   <em>\n    in the way\n   </em>\n   that skiers would reasonably expect to encounter them,\"\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79 (emphasis added), we must identify what counts as part of the relevant \"way.\" Consider the court's lift tower analysis. The court says we should ask whether \"the legislature meant for the Act to cover the kind of impact with a lift tower at issue in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81. But to answer that question we would have to identify which elements of the impact with the lift tower are of relevance to the inquiry. And we would then have to guess whether the legislature meant to cover that risk under the immunity provided to ski resorts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   \u00b6192 Imagine an accident involving a collision with a lift tower that is alleged to have been negligently designed or placed by the ski resort (a scenario much more likely to come to pass than the \"invisible\" lift tower). How is a court to decide whether this lift tower is \"encountered in the way that skiers would reasonably expect to encounter\" it? The plaintiff will inevitably say that a reasonable skier would not expect to encounter it in this \"way\" because this is a negligently designed or placed lift tower. And that will open the door to expert testimony about lift tower design and placement, rendering the statutory list inoperative and effectively reinstating a negligence regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   \u00b6193 The court's factual framing of the inquiry is equally opaque. Nowhere does the majority tell us what it means for a reasonable skier to \"expect\" a certain risk. In some sense no one \"expects\" to encounter any sort of mishap that occurs on the ski hill. Any ski injury is in a very practical sense an \"accident\"-something\n   <em>\n    unexpected\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Accident\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2011) (defining an accident as something \"unintended and unforeseen\"). For this new test to do any work, then, we have to identify the quantum of expectation that we have in mind-how likely the expectation must be. The court nowhere does that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   \u00b6194 And that is just the beginning of the problem. We also have to identify which aspects of the risk or resulting injury must be \"expected.\" And finally, and quite importantly, we must determine whether and to what\n   extent expert testimony is required to satisfy our new standard of expectation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   \u00b6195 The majority specifies none of this. It fails to identify a clear standard. And it leaves unanswered the key questions required to make sense of the two competing tests it has alluded to. Instead it just frames a muddled question for remand, hoping the district court and the parties will figure it all out later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   \u00b6196 We can do better. The path to doing so is to return to the plain text of the governing statute. I would take that route. I would ask the court on remand to decide whether Levi Rutherford was injured by an inherent risk that falls within the ordinary meaning of the statutory text. That inquiry resolves all of the many practical problems with the majority's standard. And it also paves a path to deal with the various absurd hypotheticals imagined by the majority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   \u00b6197 This case has occupied the attention of the Utah appellate courts for the past four years. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   because we perceived a need to bring clarity to a legal regime that has drawn skepticism and concern since its inception, and that has long stood in need of clarification. And we ordered supplemental briefing and heard oral argument on the case three times, again because we saw a pressing need for a substantial overhaul of the law in this area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   \u00b6198 In light of this extensive history, the bench and bar will be justifiably disappointed in our disposition of this case. Instead of clarification or reformulation, the majority mostly just kicks the can down the road. It replaces one indecipherable test with another, and leaves our law in a state of disarray. This is what happens when we ignore the plain language of the law and venture into the territory of judicial rewriting of legislation. I see no reason to condone our past endeavors of this sort. And I certainly don't think it's a good idea for us to double-down on our past missteps with a new test that is equally problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   \u00b6199 I dissent. I would credit the text of the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act. I would overrule\n   <em>\n    Clover\n   </em>\n   , and in so doing affirm that our job is to interpret statutes, not rewrite them.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-263\">\n    <em>\n     Hawkins\n    </em>\n    has been superseded by statute-Limitations on Liability for Equine and Livestock Activities, Utah Code sections 78B-4-201 to -203-albeit only with respect to defined equine and livestock activities.\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-264\">\n    The Rutherfords argue that the \"Assumption of Risk and Release of Liability\" submitted by Talisker is not the one that Levi's father signed.

In other words, once a risk has been shown to be an integral part of the sport of skiing-which is done by showing that a skier would reasonably expect to encounter that risk-there is no more discussion to be had about whether that risk is inherent: risks that a skier would reasonably expect to encounter are inherent risks as a matter of law.

It is that the legal standards prescribed by this statute-in a list of risks deemed \"inherent\" as a matter of law-cannot properly be subject to such an inquiry. In subjecting it to a fact-intensive negligence inquiry, the majority deprives the statutory list of its expressly intended effect (of establishing inherent risks as a matter of law). The problem here, moreover, is that the standard articulated by the majority does not just \"require a predicate factual inquiry\n    <em>\n     in some cases\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b679 n.28 (emphasis added). It requires such an inquiry in\n    <em>\n     every\n    </em>\n    case-as to listed statutory risks and unlisted risks alike. This makes the list entirely ineffectual.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-308\">\n    For unlisted risks I agree with the majority's invocation of the\n    <em>\n     ejusdem generis\n    </em>\n    canon of construction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 38. In defining risks \"not covered\" by the statutory list we should undoubtedly look to the \"character and nature\" of the listed risks.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 38. But the majority takes this canon a couple of puzzling steps further. First is the assertion that the statutory list is useful (and not superfluous) simply\n    <em>\n     because\n    </em>\n    it can inform the meaning of the catchall definition of risks not included in the express list.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 38. This is a distortion of the canon, or a use of\n    <em>\n     ejusdem\n    </em>\n    that would invoke a wholesale override of the independent meaning canon. Statutory lists certainly inform ambiguities in catchall fallbacks. But I have never encountered the idea that that is the whole point of a statutory list-or that we can ignore the straightforward application of a list because its sole function might be to inform the meaning of the catchall. This use of\n    <em>\n     ejusdem\n    </em>\n    would do more than override the canon of independent meaning; it would defy common sense. And it would give us a license to ignore clear statutory lists-lists clearly intended to have independent meaning-because the only meaning of the list may be to inform a catchall term.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-309\">\n    This leads to the second problem with the majority's use of this canon. The court is effectively turning the canon upside down. \"The\n    <em>\n     ejusdem generis\n    </em>\n    canon applies when a drafter has tacked on a catchall phrase at the end of an enumeration of specifics.\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 199 (2012). The canon tells us that the meaning of the \"catchall phrase\" is informed by the character or nature of the enumerated \"specifics.\"\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . But the majority isn't interpreting the catchall-the definition of unlisted risks. It is \"interpreting\" (I would say overriding) the enumerated specifics. And it is doing so by incorporating an element of the catchall definition-\"integral part of the sport\" of skiing-to override the terms on the list. This isn't how it works. I know of no basis for considering the \"character and nature\" of listed risks in deciding whether listed risks count. Certainly that's not what\n    <em>\n     ejusdem generis\n    </em>\n    is about. The majority's approach is a gross distortion of the\n    <em>\n     ejusdem generis\n    </em>\n    canon.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-310\">\n    In a puzzling attempt to avoid this problem the majority notes that section 404 of the Act \"requires ski area operators to post warning signs that list the inherent risks of skiing set forth in section 402.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37. And it suggests that the list in section 402 may function simply to tell the ski area operator which risks to list on its warning signs. This assertion falters on two grounds. First, the majority ignores the express, obvious function that listed risks have under the statute-not just in establishing the components of a warning sign but in barring skiers from asserting \"any claim against, or recover[ing] from, any ski area operator for injury resulting from any of the inherent risks of skiing.\" Utah Code \u00a7 78b-4-403. This is the heart of the Act.\n    <em>\n     See id\n    </em>\n    . \u00a7 78B-4-401 (stating that the \"purpose\" of the statute is \"to provide that, as a matter of public policy, no person engaged in th[e] sport [of skiing] shall recover from a ski operator for injuries resulting from th[e] inherent risks\" of the sport). The majority says that warning signs provide \"important, independent value.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37. But its approach eliminates the express, core function of a list of \"inherent risks,\" yielding no independent meaning to the independent function of providing immunity for injuries arising from listed risks. The court is right that the statute's requirement of a warning sign is a separate one. But the requirement makes no sense as understood by the majority. Surely the point of a \"warning sign[ ] that list[s] the inherent risks of skiing set forth in section 402,\"\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37, is a warning sign that means something. Yet the warning sign as imagined by the majority is pointless. If inherent risks listed by the legislature are not controlling, as\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    and the majority indicate,\n    <em>\n     see infra\n    </em>\n    Part II.D., then a ski resort would have no reason to list those risks on a posted sign. Instead the sign should tell skiers that skiing will subject them to risks that a reasonable skier would \"expect to confront,\" however that standard may be defined. This is the second problem with the notion that the warning sign required by section 404 gives independent meaning to the statutory list of inherent risks. The majority has rendered the list irrelevant. And that also renders the required warning sign superfluous.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-311\">\n    The majority says that the Act \"conflate[s]... two forms of assumption of the risk.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51 n.18. But that highlights the atextual nature of the\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    framework. That framework essentially says that (a) the purpose of the law was to restore the doctrine of primary assumption of risk, but (b) the text of the statute is just mistaken in the way it deals with it.

Because the statutory list of inherent risks is \"presented in an entirely unremarkable manner,\"\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 80, the majority concludes that the proper inquiry is whether the risk the skier encountered is one that she would \"reasonably [have] expect[ed]\" to encounter.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79. This is so, the majority asserts, regardless of whether the risk is actually included in the statutory list.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    Yet this move undermines the majority's resort to the doctrine of\n    <em>\n     stare decisis\n    </em>\n    . If the majority is seeking refuge in that doctrine it is in no position to reformulate its standards. (Once we start in that direction we are no longer following precedent-we are returning to first principles of statutory interpretation. And if we do that we will hardly end up at\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    .) \"Reasonably expect to encounter\" does not mean the same thing as \"wish to confront.\" So the majority is substantively altering the legal framework set forth in\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    . The court says this alteration is permissible because it \"effectively captures the legislature's intent.\"\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79. That may be. But it does not accurately capture\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    's holding. Thus, despite much hand-wringing about the importance of precedent, the majority does violence to the\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    standard. It does so, quite clearly, by transforming a two-step subjective inquiry into a one-part objective one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 80. Surely an objective test is not the same as a subjective inquiry. And a one-step test is different from a two-step one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-324\">\n    I suppose there is a sense in which the majority can claim that its entirely new formulation is a simple refinement of\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    . But that is only because neither test has any clear substantive content. As I explain in greater detail in Part II.D. below, the majority's test, like its\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    predecessor, is marked primarily by its extensive indeterminacy. Neither test is capable of generating remotely predictable outcomes. And in that sense I suppose we can say that the new test \"does the same work\" as the\n    <em>\n     Clover\n    </em>\n    test.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79 n.27. We cannot properly say that the test is the same, however. Nor can we say how the test will play out in practice. The only thing litigants and lower courts can know for sure is that the statutory text doesn't matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-325\">\n    <em>\n     See infra\n    </em>\n    Part II.D.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-326\">\n    The majority cites a lack of appellate litigation as an indication of workability.\n    <em>\n     Supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 70.

Thus, I would ask whether any given injury resulted from a risk that falls within the ordinary meaning of the terms of the statute. I would ask, for example, whether an injury results from \"snow or ice conditions,\" or \"impact with lift towers.\" Utah Code \u00a7 78B-4-402(1).

It is that the legal determinations prescribed by the Inherent Risks of Skiing Act-establishing that \"certain risks are inherent\" in skiing \"as a matter of law,\" Utah Code \u00a7 78B-4-401 -do not call for a predicate factual inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-332\">\n    The majority eventually gets around to addressing this point.

And I see no way to defend that conclusion here. In context, it is quite clear that the whole point of the statutory list is to identify those risks that are \"inherent\" as a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code \u00a7 78B-4-401 (emphasizing that the statute's purpose is to \"establish as a matter of law that certain risks are inherent in th[e] sport\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-4-402(1) (indicating that listed risks are \"includ[ed]\" in the \"dangers or conditions which are an integral part of the sport of ... skiing\"). The legislature certainly could have indicated that inherency is a legal determination to be made after predicate factual findings. But it clearly did not do so. And we should honor the framework established by the legislature instead of formulating a new one.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
