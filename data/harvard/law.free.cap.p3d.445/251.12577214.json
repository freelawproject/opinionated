Acting under authority delegated by the EPA, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) issued a general permit in 2010 for the discharge of certain pollutants resulting from suction dredge mining. Petitioners filed this proceeding arguing, among other things, that only the Corps has authority under the Clean Water Act to permit the discharge of materials resulting from suction dredge mining. The Court of Appeals disagreed and affirmed the trial court's order upholding DEQ's permit. Having allowed review, we now affirm the Court of Appeals decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As applicable here, suction dredge mining involves using a small motorized pump mounted on a boat to \"vacuum up\" water and sediment from stream and river beds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The water and sediment are passed over a sluice tray, which separates out heavier metals, such as gold, and the remaining material is\n   then discharged into the water.

We allowed review to consider the single assignment of error that the Court of Appeals decided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before turning to that assignment of error, we note that neither petitioners nor the state disputes that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining constitutes a \"pollutant\" for the purposes of the Clean Water Act. That act provides that \"pollutant\" means, among other things, \"dredged spoil,\" \"rock,\" and \"sand.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 USC \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6). The parties' dispute arises over which agency (the EPA or the Corps) has authority under the Clean Water Act to permit the discharge of those pollutants into the waters of the United States. Petitioners raise essentially two arguments on that issue. They argue initially that suction dredge mining does not come within the EPA's authority because that activity does not entail the \"discharge\" or \"addition\" of a pollutant to the water. They argue alternatively that, even if discharging material resulting from suction dredge mining adds a pollutant to the waters of the United States, the discharge is \"dredged material,\" which\n   the Corps has exclusive authority to permit. We begin with petitioners' first argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. ADDITION OF A POLLUTANT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioners' first argument starts from the proposition that the EPA's permitting authority applies only to the \"discharge of a pollutant,\" and they note that the statutory phrase \"discharge of a pollutant\" is defined as \"any addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201362\">\n    33 USC \u00a7 1362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (12). Petitioners contend that, because suction dredge mining does not add anything to the water that was not already there, there is no addition of any pollutant and thus no discharge of a pollutant for the EPA to permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioners' first argument is problematic. Almost 30 years ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that, \"even if the material discharged [as a result of placer mining] originally comes from the streambed itself, [the] resuspension [of the material in the water] may be interpreted to be an addition of a pollutant under the [Clean Water] Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Rybachek v.

As we read\n   <em>\n    Rybachek\n   </em>\n   , the court recognized that the statutory term \"addition\" is ambiguous, and it deferred to the EPA's reasonable conclusion that the suspension of solids resulting from placer mining-a practice that includes suction dredge mining-constitutes the \"addition\" of a pollutant within the meaning of the Clean Water Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    Rybachek\n   </em>\n   , the EPA has confirmed that conclusion. In 2018, in responding to comments regarding the reissuance of a general permit for suction dredge mining in Idaho, the regional office of the EPA reaffirmed that the suspension of solid materials caused by suction dredge mining constitutes the \"addition\" of a pollutant to the water. EPA, Response to Comments on Idaho Small Suction Dredge General Permit 5 (May 2018).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, the EPA explained in response to another comment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"If, during suction dredging, only water was picked up and placed back within the same waterbody, the commenter would be correct that no permit would be necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    South Florida Water Management Dist. v.

However, in suction dredging, bed material is also picked up with water. Picking up the bed material is in fact the very purpose of suction dredging-the bed material is processed to produce gold. This process is an intervening use that causes the addition of pollutants [rock and sand,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CWA \u00a7 502(6) ] to be discharged to waters of the United States.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (bracketed material in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We also note that, when the EPA reissued a general permit for suction dredge mining in Idaho in 2018, it prohibited suction dredge mining that resulted in visible turbidity \"above background [levels] beyond any point more than 500 feet downstream of the suction dredge operation,\" directed operators to avoid \"concentrated silt and clay,\" which could\n   cause \"a significant increase in suspended solids resulting in increased turbidity and downstream sedimentation,\" and provided that, if mercury is found during suction dredge mining, the operator must stop suction dredge mining \"immediately if that is the only way to prevent remobilization of the collected mercury.\" EPA, General Permit for Small Suction Dredge Miners in Idaho 19-20 (April 25, 2018). Those restrictions reflect the EPA's considered conclusion that suction dredge mining can result in the addition of pollutants to navigable waters in the form of suspended solids and \"remobilized\" heavy metals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Beyond that, the Corps and the EPA have issued numerous regulations in which they have recognized that redepositing materials dredged from stream and river beds constitutes a regulable discharge or addition of a pollutant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20323.2\">\n    33 CFR \u00a7 323.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (2001) ; 40 Fed Reg 31321 (July 25, 1975)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (explaining the types of redeposits of dredged material that would constitute a \"discharge of dredged material\" under the regulations).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those regulations implementing the Clean Water Act, as well as the agencies' consistent interpretation of them, warrant deference as a matter of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coeur Alaska, Inc. v.

POLLUTANTS RESULTING FROM SUCTION DREDGE MINING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioners mount a second, more substantial argument.

In the state's view, the statutes and the implementing regulations are ambiguous on that issue; that is, the state recognizes that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining\n   reasonably could be characterized either as dredged material or processed waste. The state maintains, however, that, in interpreting and administering their regulations, the Corps and the EPA reasonably have concluded that the material is processed waste subject to the EPA's permitting authority rather than unprocessed dredged material subject to the Corps' permitting authority and that we should defer to those agencies' reasonable interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In considering the parties' arguments, we note, as a preliminary matter, that the United States Supreme Court addressed a related but separate question in\n   <em>\n    Coeur Alaska\n   </em>\n   .

Unlike the term \"pollutant,\" the Clean Water Act does not define what the phrase \"discharge of dredged *** material\" means. More specifically, it does not define whether material that was dredged from navigable water remains \"dredged material\" after it has been processed.

We accordingly turn first to the regulations promulgated to implement the Act and then to the agencies' interpretation and application of those regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coeur Alaska\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n    557 U.S. at 277-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, if the text of the Clean Water Act is ambiguous, courts look to the agencies' implementing regulations and, if those regulations are ambiguous, to the agencies' interpretation and application of their regulations to determine what the Act means).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Regulation and administration of the Clean Water Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The regulations issued by the Corps and the EPA to implement the Clean Water Act do not specifically address which agency has authority to permit the discharge of material resulting from suction dredge mining. However, in later interpreting the regulations, the Corps and the EPA explained first in 1986 and later in 1990 that the EPA, not the Corps, is authorized under the Clean Water Act to issue permits for the discharge of material resulting from suction dredge mining. More importantly, since that time, the EPA has issued general permits after notice and comment for the discharge of material resulting from suction dredge mining, and the Corps has acted consistently with the\n   EPA's permitting authority. As we discuss below, last year, the EPA reaffirmed that allocation of authority in issuing a general permit for suction dredge mining in Idaho.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   That regulatory history goes a long way toward answering the second issue that petitioners raise. Petitioners, however, argue that regulations adopted in 1975 and 2001 support their view that the Corps has exclusive permitting authority. We accordingly set out the regulatory history in greater (some might say mind-numbing) detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Save Our Rural Oregon v.

We begin with the Corps' promulgation of regulations defining \"dredged material\" and the \"discharge of dredged material\" in 1975. We then turn to a separate but related dispute over the difference between \"fill\" and \"waste,\" which led to the Corps' express statement in 1990 that the EPA had exclusive authority to permit the discharge of waste resulting from suction dredge mining. After that, we consider the EPA's efforts from 1999 to 2001 to comply with a federal decision that \"incidental fallback\" of dredged material does not constitute the \"discharge of dredged material,\" efforts that petitioners contend led to a 2001 regulation that supports their position. We also consider the Corps' 2008 rules, which the dissent views as dispositive. Finally, we look to the EPA's and the Corps' history of issuing permits for suction dredge mining.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    \"Dredged material\" and the \"discharge of dredged material\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On May 6, 1975, the Corps published four alternative sets of proposed regulations in response to a federal district court decision issued less than two months earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   40 Fed Reg 31320 (July 25, 1975) (recounting that history). The district court had ruled that the statutory phrase \"navigable waters\" to which the Clean Water Act applies was broader than the Corps had understood, and it directed the Corps to adopt final regulations within 30 days (later extended to 80 days) that applied to \"the entire aquatic system, including all of the wetlands that are part of it, rather than only those aquatic areas that are arbitrarily distinguished by the presence of an ordinary or mean high water mark.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Fed Reg 37124 (July 19, 1977) (recounting the regulatory history).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In carrying out that task, the Corps adopted definitions of \"dredged material\" and the \"discharge of dredged material\" in 1975 that, in relevant part, have remained largely unchanged. The regulations defined \"dredged material\" as \"material that is excavated or dredged from navigable waters.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20209.120\">\n    33 CFR \u00a7 209.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4) (1976). That definition, however, did not add much to the statutory phrase \"dredged\n   * * * material.\" The regulatory definition essentially restated the statutory term and left unanswered when, if ever, dredged material that has been processed will become some other form of a pollutant that is subject to the EPA's permitting authority rather than the Corps'.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The 1975 definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" shed more light on the issue. It provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The term 'discharge of dredged material' means any addition of dredged material, in excess of one cubic yard when used in a single or incidental operation, into navigable waters. The term includes, without limitation, the addition of dredged material to a specified disposal site located in navigable waters and the runoff or overflow from a contained land or water disposal area. Discharges of pollutants into navigable waters resulting from the onshore subsequent processing of dredged material that is extracted for any commercial use (other than fill) are not included within this term and are subject to 402 of the [Clean Water Act] ***.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20209.120\">\n    33 CFR \u00a7 209.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5) (1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Not surprisingly, that definition makes clear that, if unprocessed dredged material is reintroduced into navigable water, it remains \"dredged material,\" which is subject to the Corps' permitting authority. In explaining its proposed regulations, the Corps observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"The types of activities encompassed by this term [discharge of dredged material] would include the depositing into navigable waters of dredged material if it is placed alongside of a newly dredged canal which has been excavated in a wetland area. It\n   would also include maintenance of these canals if excavated material is placed in navigable waters. Also included is the runoff or overflow from a contained land or water disposal area.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   40 Fed Reg 31321 (July 25, 1975). All those activities focused on the placement of unprocessed dredged material adjacent to or in navigable waters, and the commentary to the regulations makes clear that the Corps' focus was on the discharge of dredged material in wetlands. That focus is hardly surprising since the district court's order had directed the Corps to include, for the first time, wetlands as part of the navigable waters to which the Clean Water Act applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" also identified an exception to that definition. It provided that \"[d]ischarges of pollutants into navigable waters resulting from the onshore subsequent processing of dredged material extracted for any commercial use (other than fill) are not included within the term and are subject to section 402 of the [Clean Water] Act.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20209.120\">\n    33 CFR \u00a7 209.120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5) (1976). In explaining the exception, the Corps stated that \"[d]ischarges of materials from land based commercial washing operations are regulated under section 402 of the [Clean Water Act]\" by the EPA. 40 Fed Reg 31321 (July 25, 1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   That exception resolves a question that the statutory text and the regulatory definition of \"dredged material\" had left unanswered. The exception makes clear that the act of processing dredged material can result in the discharge of a \"pollutant\" that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402 rather than the discharge of \"dredged material\" that requires a permit from the Corps under section 404.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Petitioners, however, rely on that exception to argue that the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" draws a broad distinction between discharges resulting from processing dredged material on land, which will be subject to the EPA's permitting authority, and discharges resulting from processing dredged material over water, which will be subject to the Corps' permitting authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because dredged material is typically processed over water during suction dredge mining, it necessarily follows, petitioners reason, that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining is \"dredged material,\" which requires a permit from the Corps rather than the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Petitioners' argument is problematic for at least two reasons. First, the exception to the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" does not draw the distinction that petitioners perceive. The exception does not distinguish between discharges that result from processing dredged material over water and discharges that result from processing dredged material over land. Rather, the exception applies to discharges from the onshore processing of dredged material that is extracted for a commercial use. If, however, dredged material is extracted for some other use (a recreational one, for example), then the exception does not apply regardless of whether the dredged material is processed over land or water.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, petitioners' argument depends on drawing a negative inference from the existence of a single exception to the definition of\n   \"discharge of dredged material.\" That is, petitioners' argument depends on the proposition that, by recognizing that discharges resulting from the onshore processing of dredged material extracted for a commercial use are pollutants subject to the EPA's permitting authority, the rule implies that all other discharges resulting from processing dredged material will be dredged material that is subject to the Corps' permitting authority. Apparently, in petitioners' view, that is true however the dredged material is processed and regardless of the type of chemicals that are discharged into the water as a result of processing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Ordinarily, the sort of negative inference upon which petitioners' argument depends is appropriate when there is \"a series of terms from which an omission bespeaks a negative implication.\"\n   <em>\n    Chevron U.S.A.

Second, some onshore processing of dredged materials will result in discharges of pollutants that require a permit from the EPA under section 402 rather than the Corps under section 404. Third, that exception to the definition of discharge of \"dredged material\" does not go further than identifying a single exception. That is, in recognizing an exception for one category of onshore processing (discharges from dredged material extracted for commercial uses), the rule leaves unanswered whether other categories of water-based or land-based processing operations will result in the \"discharge\n   of dredged material\" that requires a permit from the Corps under section 404 or the discharge of a pollutant that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the 1975 regulatory definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" either does not address or does not unambiguously resolve whether discharges resulting from suction dredge mining are subject to the Corps' or the EPA's permitting authority, we look to the ways in which the Corps and the EPA subsequently resolved that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Fill and waste\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In 1977, the Corps renumbered and amended the regulations to address issues that had arisen since it promulgated them two years earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Fed Reg 37122-30 (July 19, 1977). Of relevance here, the Corps considered when the discharge of \"waste materials such as sludge, garbage, trash, and debris in water\" would constitute \"fill\" that\n   was subject to the Corps' permitting authority and when they would constitute another pollutant that was subject to the EPA's permitting authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37130. Initially, the Corps took the position that the answer to that question turned on the purpose for which those materials were discharged into the water.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It modified the definition of \"fill\" in the 1977 regulations to \"exclude those pollutants that are discharged into water primarily to dispose of waste,\" with the result that the EPA would have permitting authority over waste discharged primarily for that purpose while the Corps would have permitting authority over waste that was discharged primarily to convert wetlands into dry land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In 1986, the EPA and the Corps entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to resolve a lingering dispute about the scope of \"fill\" materials that were subject to the Corps' permitting authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   51 Fed Reg 8871 (Mar 14, 1986) (publishing the 1986 agreement).

The second sentence in paragraph B.5 took a different approach to defining which materials are subject to the\n   EPA's permitting authority. Instead of listing the properties of discharged material, the second sentence listed specific examples of processed waste that will be subject to the EPA's authority. Not only does the second sentence expressly name the specific types of processed waste over which the EPA will have permitting authority, but it lists \"placer mining wastes,\" which includes waste from suction dredge mining, as one of the wastes that will fall within the EPA's authority. Put\n   differently, the second sentence makes clear that placer mining wastes are pollutants other than dredged material and thus subject to the EPA's permitting authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Four years after the Corps and the EPA issued the 1986 memorandum of agreement, the Corps issued a regulatory guidance letter that interpreted the 1986 agreement and stated that the material discharged as a result of placer mining is subject to the EPA's exclusive permitting authority.

However, if this material is subsequently processed to remove desired elements, its nature has been changed; it is no longer dredged material.

Petitioners focus on only half the sentence. Although \"in-stream mining\" most likely includes suction dredge mining, the general rule stated in paragraph (i) applies only to \"the use of mechanized earth-moving equipment to conduct *** in-stream mining.\" The small shop-vac-like equipment used to conduct suction dredge mining hardly qualifies as \"mechanized earth-moving equipment,\" unless one views vacuum cleaners and other small suction devices as \"mechanized earth-moving equipment.\" Were there any doubt about the matter, the explanation for the 2001 rule removes it.

When both the entire rule and the reason for promulgating it are considered, we cannot agree with petitioners that the 2001 rule signaled a departure from the Corps and the EPA's stated position in the 1986 memorandum of agreement. Similarly, we do not agree with petitioners that the 2001 rule reflects the Corps' conclusion that discharges resulting from processing dredged material over water, as opposed to processing it over land, will be automatically subject to the Corps' permitting authority under section 404.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    That same conclusion follows from the explanation for the 2001 final rule, which incorporated the preamble to the 2000 proposed rule.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    66 Fed Reg 4552 (Jan 17, 2001).

The dissent reasons that, even if that is a correct interpretation of the 1975 definition of \"discharge of dredged material,\" the 2008 version of that definition resolved the ambiguity. We reach a different conclusion. The 2008 version of the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" left the relevant part of the 1975 regulations unchanged, and the differences between the 1975 version and the 2008 version of the definition provide no reason to think that the 2008 regulation somehow changed what the 1975 regulation meant when it was initially promulgated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The relevant part of the 1975 definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" does not differ in any material respect from the 2008 definition.

The Corps explained that it had intended in 1975 to make clear that \"activities such\n    as plowing, seeding, harvesting, and any other activity by any other industry\n    <em>\n     that do not involve discharges of dredged or fill material\n    </em>\n    \" do not require section 404 permits. 42 Fed Reg 37130 (July 19, 1977) (emphasis added).

That exception is discussed at some length above.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The second and third exceptions (added in 1977 and 1999) are excluded from the definition of \"discharge of dredged material\" because the Corps concluded that they do not involve any \"discharge\" of dredged material. The first exception stands on a different footing. That exception assumes that there is a \"discharge\" but establishes that, as a result of the act of processing dredged material, the material discharged is a \"pollutant\" subject to section 402 rather than \"dredged material\" subject to section 404. That is, the second and third exceptions turn on the absence of a discharge; the first turns on the nature of the material being discharged.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Contrary to the dissent's reading of the 2008 definition of \"discharge of dredged material,\" the changes to that definition between 1975 and 2008 provide no reason to say that the exception promulgated in 1975 means anything other than what it meant in 1975. Specifically, both the 1975 and the 2008 regulations leave open the question whether other instances of processing dredged material-namely, instances other than the one instance identified in the 1975\n    exception-will result in the discharge of a pollutant subject to section 402 or the discharge of dredged material subject to section 404. It is precisely because the regulations leave that question open that the EPA and the Corps' application of the statute and regulations matters.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Regulatory approval\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Either the EPA or a state agency acting under authority delegated by the EPA may issue a permit under section 402 of the Clean Water Act for the discharge of pollutants after providing an opportunity for a hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n     33 USC \u00a7 1342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1) (permits issued by the EPA);\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201342\">\n     33 USC \u00a7 1342\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (states acting under delegated authority).

Similarly, others argued that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining was incidental fallback and thus not subject to regulation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n     at 5-6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In responding to those comments, the EPA explained that \"commenters often confuse the 'discharge of dredged material' with the 'discharge of a pollutant.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n     at 7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The EPA reaffirmed its position that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining was the \"discharge of a pollutant\" subject to regulation under section 402 and not incidental fallback, which does not constitute a regulable\n    discharge of dredged material.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The EPA then noted that, consistently with that conclusion, \"the Corps routinely informs applicants who request a 404 permit for small suction dredging in Idaho that, unless a regulable discharge of dredged or fill material will occur, the EPA is the lead agency for the activity.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325094\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/1/#p19\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The EPA thus reaffirmed that the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining is a pollutant that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402 and not dredged material that requires a permit from the Corps under section 404. Petitioners argue, however, that the Corps has issued three permits that lead to a different conclusion. Specifically, they rely on two nationwide permits (NWP) issued by the Corps and a regional permit also issued by a division of the Corps. We consider each permit separately.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    The first permit, NWP 19, authorizes dredging of \"no more than 25 cubic yards below\" the plane of the ordinary high water mark. 82 Fed Reg 1988 (Jan 6, 2017). Notably, NWP 19 only authorizes dredging-the removal of dredged material from navigable waters. It does not authorize the discharge or addition of dredged material to the navigable waters of the United States, which is the statutory predicate for a section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     National Mining Assoc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344534,3714519\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/1399/\">\n     145 F.3d at 1404\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (distinguishing between the Corps' authority to permit dredging under the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and its authority to permit the discharge of dredged or fill material into navigable waters under section 404 of the Clean Water Act). Because a permit authorizing the removal of dredged material from\n    navigable water differs from a permit authorizing the discharge of dredged material into navigable water, NWP 19 does not advance petitioners' argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The second permit, NWP 44, is arguably closer to the mark. It authorizes the discharge of \"dredged or fill material\" into the nontidal waters of the United States for mining activities, provided that either the discharge does not cause the loss of \"greater than 1/2-acre of nontidal wetlands\" or as long as the total mined area does not exceed 1/2 acre for open waters, such as rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. 82 Fed Reg 1994 (Jan 6, 2017). By its terms, NWP 44 applies to the issuance of a permit for a single mining project that can entail water impoundments and construction on fill or dredged material discharged into the water.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    NWP 44, General Conditions Nos. 8, 9, 14, 15, 23, and 24. Moreover, it requires preconstruction notification for certain activities and remedial mitigation by the project proponent.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344534,3714519\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/1399/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    At first blush, the fact that NWP 44 authorizes the discharge of dredged material for mining purposes appears to support petitioners' argument. On closer inspection, however, we reach a different conclusion. First, NWP 44 is directed at individual mining projects that can involve the impoundment of water and construction of temporary or permanent structures for mining, rather than recreational suction dredge mining. Second, in authorizing the discharge of up to one-half acre of fill or dredged material, NWP 44 appears to refer to unprocessed dredge material or fill. It does not expressly address whether processed dredged material remains subject to the Corps' permitting authority under section 404 or whether processing can result in the addition of a pollutant subject to the EPA's permitting authority under section 402. Third, and consistently with the second observation, the commentary to NWP 44 states that \"[d]ischarges of processed mine materials into waters of the United States may require authorization [by the EPA] under section 402 of the Clean Water Act.\" 82 Fed Reg 1921 (Jan 6, 2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Finally, petitioners rely on a regional general permit that the Corps issued in 1995 for northern California\n    for \"certain work activities and incidental discharges of dredged or fill material associated with suction dredge mining.\" Department of the Army, Regional General Permit No. 21181-98 (June 7, 1995). Again, at first blush, the permit appears to support petitioners' view that the Corps has exercised permitting authority over suction dredge mining. However, from 1961 to 2009, the State of California issued permits authorizing suction dredge mining under section 5653 of the California Fish and Wildlife Code,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     People v.

That rule was later modified in 1999 to except \"incidental fallback,\" and it is unclear whether the Corps' 1995 regional permit was issued merely to comply with the rules in effect from 1993 to 1999 that the discharge of unprocessed dredged material that was incidental to any activity required a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Regional General Permit No. 21181-98 (authorizing \"incidental discharges of dredged or fill material associated with suction dredge mining\"). Beyond that, the 1995 regional permit does not purport to be the exclusive permitting authority for suction dredge mining but serves instead only as auxiliary authorization. The Corps' permit applies only if a person possesses a standard permit for suction dredge mining issued by the State of California.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Finally, the 1995 regional permit expired on July 1, 2000, and petitioners do not identify any other permit issued by the Corps after it amended its regulations in 1999 to exclude incidental fallback that provides auxiliary authorization for incidental discharges resulting from suction dredge mining.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Ultimately, we do not view NWP 19, NWP 44, or Regional General Permit No. 21181-98 as persuasive authority for petitioners' position. Rather, NWP 19 does not authorize the discharge of dredged materials; the commentary to NWP 44 recognizes that the discharge of processed mining waste may require a permit from the EPA under section 402; and the 1995 regional general permit provided auxiliary authorization for incidental discharges associated with suction dredge mining at a time when the Corps' regulations recognized that any discharge of unprocessed dredged material that was \"incidental to any activity\" was a regulable discharge under section 404.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In our view, the regulatory history reveals that, from 1986 to 2018, the EPA and the Corps have been on the same page. From the 1986 memorandum of agreement between the EPA and the Corps to the general permits issued by the EPA in 2018 and the Corps in 2017, both agencies consistently have recognized that processed waste discharged as a result of suction dredge mining is a pollutant that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402. Similarly, they consistently have concluded that the discharge resulting from suction dredge mining is not \"dredged material\" that requires a permit from the Corps under section 404. With that regulatory history in mind, we turn to the deference owed those agency decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Deference\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Coeur Alaska\n    </em>\n    , the Court explained that Congress had not \"directly spoken\" to the precise question in that case, and it looked \"to the agencies' regulations construing [the statutory text], and [the Corps and] the EPA's subsequent interpretation of those regulations\" to determine the answer to that question.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n     557 U.S. at 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2458\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    As\n    <em>\n     Coeur Alaska\n    </em>\n    recognized, agencies charged with administering a federal statute may interpret that statute\n    in ways that call for deference.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The agencies may promulgate rules after notice and comment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

One would hardly expect Congress to have focused on such a small detail. Rather, that is precisely the sort of issue that ordinarily would be (and was) left to the EPA's and the Corps' application of the broader principles stated in the Clean Water Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    We also conclude that the regulations that those agencies have promulgated do not resolve that issue. The regulations expressly recognize that the act of processing dredged material can result in the discharge of a pollutant that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402 rather than the discharge of dredged material that requires a permit from the Corps under section 404. However, as explained above, the regulations do not resolve whether the discharges resulting from suction dredge mining constitute a pollutant subject to section 402 or dredged material subject to section 404. Both the statutes and the regulations are genuinely ambiguous on that question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    In our view, the most persuasive answer to that question lies in the general permits for suction dredge mining that the EPA has issued after notice and comment. Because the level of formality that attends the issuance of those permits bears on the deference due the EPA's interpretation,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Mead Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p226\">\n     533 U.S. at 230\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313070\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/218/#p226\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2164\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , we discuss that issue briefly.

As explained above, it is possible to classify the material discharged as a result of suction dredge mining as \"dredged material\" subject to the Corps' permitting authority.

Unlike the discharge of dredged material, which often is project-specific, suction dredge mining is a recreational activity that numerous people can pursue simultaneously in the same or multiple locations. EPA, Response to Comments on Idaho Small Suction Dredge General Permit at 13 (explaining that the EPA deemed suction dredge mining as a \"recreational activity,\" which numerous people can undertake).\n    In responding to similar objections to treating the discharge from suction dredge mining as a pollutant subject to section 402, the EPA has observed that suction dredging is \" 'of special concern where it is frequent, persistent, and adds to similar effects caused by other human activities.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11 (quoting Bret C. Harvey and Thomas E. Lisle,\n    <em>\n     Effects of Suction Dredging on Streams: a Review and an Evaluation Strategy\n    </em>\n    15 (Aug 1998)). In determining the extent to which suction dredge mining should be permitted, the EPA considers the total maximum density load of sediment that a stream is capable of handling. That varies depending on, among other things, the type of sediment where the suction dredge mining will be conducted, the extent to which a stream is already impaired by sediment, the rate of stream-flow, and the number of point sources-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , suction dredge miners-discharging additional sediment into the stream.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. The concern is not with the navigability of the water body, a concern that falls within the Corps' expertise; rather, the concern is with the health of the water body, a concern that lies at the heart of the EPA's expertise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The Corps and the EPA reasonably could conclude that the EPA was better suited than the Corps to make those types of water quality decisions. The risks posed by the cumulative effects of multiple suction dredge mining operations on the overall health of a stream differ from the sort of engineering issues that the Corps typically addresses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Nadia H. Dahab,\n    <em>\n     Muddying the Waters of Clean Water Act Permitting:\n    </em>\n    NEDC\n    <em>\n     Reconsidered\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Or.%20L.%20Rev.%20335\">\n     90 Or L Rev 335\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 352-54 (2011) (discussing the EPA and the Corps' respective spheres of expertise). Specifically, the effect of increased sedimentation on water quality posed by multiple suction dredge mining operations requires the permitting agency to consider the number of permits that should be issued, the streams in which suction dredge mining should be permitted or limited, and the appropriate restrictions that should be included for each stream on the intensity, duration, and frequency of the activity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Perhaps the Corps could have made those same kinds of water quality decisions. However, in light of the cumulative impact of sedimentation on water quality that\n    can result from suction dredge mining and in light of the need to include appropriate limits on the permits to maintain the health of affected water bodies, the Corps and the EPA reasonably could conclude, as they have, that permits for the discharge of material resulting from suction dredge mining should be issued by the EPA under section 402 rather than by the Corps under section 404. It follows, we think, that the general permits issued by the both the EPA and the Corps are reasonable agency interpretations of a statute following notice and comment procedures that warrant deference under\n    <em>\n     Mead\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    We note alternatively that the EPA's and the Corps' resolution of this issue can be viewed as the agencies' interpretation of their own \"genuinely ambiguous\" regulations. As explained above, the regulations recognize that the act of processing dredged material can result in the discharge of \"pollutants\" that require a permit under section 402 rather than the discharge of \"dredged material\" that requires a permit under section 404. However, as explained above, the regulations\n    do not unambiguously answer the specific question in this case-whether the processed waste discharged as a result of suction dredge mining falls into the former or the latter category.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620765\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2400/#p2414\">\n     139 S.

Even if deference to the agencies' formal interpretation of their regulations were not sufficient under\n    <em>\n     Mead\n    </em>\n    , the EPA and the Corps' consistent and reasonable interpretation of the regulations warrants deference under\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     28\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Two other issues require mention. First, much of petitioners' opening brief focuses on evidentiary challenges to the factual premises underlying DEQ's issuance of the permit. The Court of Appeals, however, declined to exercise its discretion to consider petitioners' third assignment of error contending that DEQ's findings were not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners have not argued that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in making that decision, and it is unclear how much, if any, of petitioners' fact-specific challenges are properly before us. Beyond that, as we understand the legal question before us, it is whether the EPA and the Corps reasonably have concluded that the EPA (and by extension DEQ) has permitting authority under section 402 over discharges resulting from suction dredge mining. It is difficult to understand how the factual record developed in a state hearing somehow limits the Corps' and the EPA's interpretation of their own regulatory authority, as opposed to establishing the appropriate numeric,\n    geographic, and temporal limitations on suction dredge mining permitted in local rivers and streams.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Second, petitioners argue that the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the single discharge resulting from suction dredge mining was subject to permits issued by both the Corps and the EPA (or its state delegate). In petitioners' view, only one agency had the authority to permit the discharge. Although petitioners do not cite\n    <em>\n     Coeur Alaska\n    </em>\n    in support of their argument, we note that that decision is consistent with their position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coeur Alaska\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n     557 U.S. at 286\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658036\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/261/#p277\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2458\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (agreeing that a \"two-permit regime [for a single discharge] is contrary to the [Clean Water Act] and the regulations\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Dahab\n    <em>\n     ,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Muddying the Waters of Clean Water Act Permitting\n    </em>\n    , 90 Or L Rev at 354-56 (critiquing the two-permit reasoning in\n    <em>\n     NEDC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199984\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/232/619/\">\n     232 Or.

As explained above, we defer to the EPA's and the Corps' reasonable conclusion that the EPA (or its state delegate) has the\n    authority to issue a permit under section 402 for all the processed waste discharged as a result of suction dredge mining. Given the Corps' and the EPA's conclusion that the EPA has authority over that permitting decision, we need not decide whether those agencies could have divided permitting responsibility for a single discharge between them. To be sure, DEQ's 2010 permit may have been too narrow in that it applied to only part of the discharge resulting from suction dredge mining. However, petitioners do not challenge the 2010 permit on the ground that it is too narrow. Rather, they challenge it on the ground that it is too broad.

Certainly, nothing in the text of the regulations stands for that proposition. Indeed, the one regulation that addresses discharges resulting from processing dredged material points in precisely the opposite direction. That regulation excepts discharges of pollutants resulting from the onshore processing of dredged material extracted for a commercial use from the \"discharge of dredged material,\" without regard to whether the processing consisted of removing part of the dredged material or adding something to it. Finally, the dissent's premise is contrary to over 30 years of the EPA's and the Corps' consistent interpretation of their rules that the discharge of placer mining waste (waste left over after minerals have been removed from dredged material) is the discharge of a pollutant that requires a permit from the EPA under section 402.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"27\">\n    <p id=\"p-206\">\n     Both the EPA and the Corps are charged with implementing the Clean Water Act.

It could be argued that this text is enough to settle the case. After all, suction dredge mining does \"dredge\" material. And, in a literal sense, that material is then \"discharged\" into water. But suction dredge mining also involves passing that dredged material over a sluice tray in order to separate out gold. It may be that dredged material remains dredged material indefinitely. But it might reasonably be thought that in some circumstances material that has been dredged will cease to\n    qualify as dredged material. For example, the gold removed from the stream may be \"dredged material\" initially, but it might be anomalous to refer to it as \"dredged material\" once it has been turned into a wedding ring. Additionally, the context of section 404 is relevant. The words \"discharge of dredged or fill material\" demarcate the jurisdictional line between the EPA and the Corps, and thus might be read in a way that takes into account the relative competencies of the agencies-such as by focusing on the purpose or the environmental effects of the discharge. Thus, at\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    step one, I find the statute ambiguous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    's first step being satisfied, it is appropriate to turn to agency interpretations. The Corps and the EPA have promulgated rules, through notice and comment rulemaking, to clarify the definitions of \"dredged material\" and \"discharge of dredged material.\" Those rules, which were most recently revised in 2008, define dredged material as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n    \"The term dredged material means material that is excavated or dredged from waters of the United States.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20323.2\">\n     33 CFR \u00a7 323.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Thus, \"dredged material\" is defined based solely on the source of the material-the waters of the United States-and the process by which it is removed-excavation or dredging. There is no temporal caveat, and no qualification based on subsequent processing or environmental effects.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    To read the definition to be conditioned on such requirements would require a judicial addition to the rule's text, which would be entirely inconsistent with the\n    Supreme Court's directive that we \"must employ traditional tools of interpretation\" to interpret regulations.\n    <em>\n     Christopher v.

All of the remaining material, absolutely everything ultimately added to the water, was \"excavated or dredged from waters of the United States.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Because everything released by suction dredge mining is \"dredged material,\" the next question is whether the release of that material into the water qualifies as \"discharge of dredged material\":\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n    \"(d)(1) Except as provided below in paragraph (d)(2), the term discharge of dredged material means any addition of dredged material into, including redeposit of dredged material other than incidental fallback within, the waters of the United States.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20323.20\">\n     33 CFR \u00a7 323.20\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1). Leaving aside, for the moment, the exceptions, this definition also favors the Corps' authority.

Thus, it is captured by \"any addition of dredged material into *** the waters of the United States.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    I turn to the exceptions set out in paragraph (d)(2):\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n    \"(2) The term discharge of dredged material does not include the following:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n    \"(i) Discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States resulting from the onshore subsequent processing of dredged material that is extracted for any commercial use (other than fill).

The majority reasons that the 1975 version of the same regulation sets forth a \"general rule\" that \"redeposit of unprocessed dredged material into navigable water will constitute the 'discharge of dredged material,' \"\n    <em>\n     Eastern Oregon Mining Assoc. v.

Those materials, which postdate the statute, are not relevant to our\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    step one interpretation of section 404, using the ordinary tools of statutory construction. Instead, the majority interprets section 404 by deferring, under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    , to a few of those agency materials: a general permit issued by the EPA in Idaho in 2018, and general permits issued by the Corps and the EPA in Alaska over the past decade.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Any attempt to defer to those materials faces an insurmountable hurdle.\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    requires deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute, but nothing in the permits, or even in the associated materials, contains an interpretation of section 404 or any of its terms.

Similarly, the Corps permits state that the EPA has authority over suction dredge mining. But none of that allows us to discern what either agency understood \"discharge,\" \"dredged material,\" or any other statutory term in section 404, to mean (much less that they agreed on an interpretation). The majority does not hazard a guess as to what their interpretation is. Therefore, rather than assessing the agency interpretation of the statute for reasonableness, as\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    's second step requires, the majority evaluates only the reasonableness of its practical consequence-that the EPA rather than the Corps gets to regulate suction dredge mining.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    365 Or. at 351-52, 445 P.3d at 272-73.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Moreover, it is doubtful that the agencies' analysis of section 404 extended any further than concluding (as they must) that the answer really turns on the meaning of the more specific definitions contained in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20323.2\">\n     33 CFR \u00a7 323.2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , not the bare text of the CWA. Consequently, the permitting\n    decisions that the majority relies on are very likely interpretations of the agencies'\n    <em>\n     regulations\n    </em>\n    , not a statute. That interpretation would be entitled to deference, if at all, not under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    , but under\n    <em>\n     Auer v.

Not long ago, the distinction might not matter in a case like this one, because\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    was generally understood to give even more deference to agency interpretations of rules than is accorded to agency interpretations of statutes under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    . However, the Supreme Court recently emphasized that it \"has cabined\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    's scope in varied and critical ways.\"\n    <em>\n     Kisor v.

The upshot of that shift is that while courts previously could have been insensitive to whether the implicit agency interpretation of a statute that they were deferring to under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    was actually an implicit interpretation of a rule-because even if it were, deference would be required anyway-accepting that uncertainty is no longer an option. Given that\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    have different, non-coextensive limits, it cannot be appropriate to defer to an agency's implicit interpretation under\n    <em>\n     Chevron\n    </em>\n    unless it is either clear that the agency really is interpreting a statute, or, at minimum, that the agency's interpretation would be owed deference under\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    even if the agency were interpreting a rule.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    For that reason, the majority decides, in the alternative, that it can defer to the same materials under\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    in interpreting the applicable regulations. 365 Or. at 352, 445 P.3d at 272-73.\n    In light of\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    now requires a five-step analysis before deference can be accorded to an agency's interpretation of its rules. \"First and foremost, a court should not afford\n    <em>\n     Auer\n    </em>\n    deference unless the regulation is genuinely ambiguous.\"\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620765\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2400/#p2414\">\n     139 S.

Neither the majority nor the state offers a permissible reading of the 2008 rule under which suction dredge mining involves the discharge of anything other than \"dredged material.\" But even if the regulation were ambiguous, deference would not be appropriate here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    Although the majority points to recent general permits by the EPA regulating suction dredge mining under section 402, the Corps has\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    issued a general permit for suction dredge pursuant to section 404. That occurred in California, in 1995, with the permit expiring in 2000.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Department of the Army, Regional General Permit No. 21181-98 (Jan 7, 1995). The majority downplays that fact, suggesting that \"the 1995 regional permit does not purport to be the exclusive permitting authority for suction dredge mining, but serves instead only as an auxiliary authorization\" to state permits. 365 Or. at 345, 445 P.3d at 269. The same is true of the 2018 EPA Idaho permit that the majority does rely\n    upon-suction dredge miners also need approval from the Idaho Department of Water Resources-and is of no consequence for either. More substantial is the majority's suggestion that the 1995 permit may have been issued as part of the Corps' short-lived efforts to regulate in-stream excavation under the theory that the \"incidental fallback\" from excavation constituted a regulable \"discharge of dredged material.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    If the 1995 permit were directed only to the excavation involved in suction dredging, and not to the release of processed dredged material back into the water, then any inconsistency with the EPA's subsequent permitting of suction dredge mining would be lessened. But the majority's suggestion does not hold up to scrutiny, because the 1995 general permit plainly was not limited to \"incidental fallback\" from excavation. As the permit was \"for certain work activities\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    incidental discharges of dredged or fill material associated with suction dredge mining\" (emphasis added), its coverage was not limited to incidental discharges, much less to incidental fallback. And the requirements of the permit made clear that it applied to the post-processing discharge of dredged material, not (or, at least, not just) incidental fallback as a result of excavation. For example, it specified that \"[m]ercury recovered from the waterway as part of the suction dredging-process may not be returned to the waterway.\" That requirement makes sense only if it is understood as a limitation on the release of dredged material that has been fully removed from the water and processed in some form.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Thus, in 1995, under the same statute and a functionally-identical operative regulation, the Corps concluded that suction dredge mining\n    involved a discharge of dredged material under section 404, from which it would necessarily follow that the EPA would not have permitting authority. If there is an agency interpretation in play here, it does not appear to have been a consistent one, as\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    requires. Those inconsistent actions, the product of regional offices, also raise serious concerns that the regional permitting process may not \" 'reflect[ ] the considered judgment of the agency as a whole' \" as to the meaning of the regulations.\n    <em>\n     Kisor\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620765\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2400/#p2414\">\n     139 S.

If the Corps and the EPA were to promulgate a new rule, clarifying that suction dredge mining was not within the Corps' jurisdiction, I doubt that I would have any difficulty concluding that that also was a reasonable interpretation of section 404. The point is simply that those agencies have not done so. The last time that they spoke in a way that merited deference-when they jointly\n    promulgated the 2008 regulations-they put suction dredge mining within the Corps' purview. The Corps may now wish to disclaim permitting authority over suction dredge mining. But the current rules say what they say, and no principle of agency deference accords the emanation of an intention the same stature as a rule promulgated after notice and comment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-208\">\n     There are parallel and identical definitions contained in rules issued by the EPA and located in\n     <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20232.2\">\n      40 CFR \u00a7 232.2\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .
