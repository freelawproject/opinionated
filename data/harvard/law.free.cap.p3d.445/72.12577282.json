The rule contains two exclusions, however, that collectively prohibit using the public record exception to admit observational and investigative police reports against defendants in criminal cases. These exclusions ensure that law enforcement personnel testify in person when the contents of their police reports are sought to be admitted as evidence in a trial, thereby allowing the defendant an opportunity to confront and cross-examine police officers regarding statements in their reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   However, another hearsay exception in our evidentiary rules permits the previously recorded recollections of a witness to be read into evidence when the witness is unable to sufficiently recall the subject matter of the statements to testify fully and accurately at trial. Applied literally, this second exception\n   would appear to provide a path to circumvent the prohibition on the use of observational and investigative police reports against defendants in criminal cases. This path of circumvention oddly would only occur when the law enforcement official who prepared or signed-off on the report testifies to insufficient recollection of the events underlying the report to be subject to meaningful cross-examination. Such a situation occurred in this case, resulting in the defendant being convicted on the sole basis of a police report authored by a law enforcement officer who testified at trial that he could no longer remember the material facts underlying the defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We now hold that records excluded by the public records exception cannot be read into evidence based on an alternative evidentiary ground. This is to say that litigants may not utilize another hearsay exception as a back door to bypass the restrictions contained in the public records hearsay exception. Accordingly, we vacate the defendant's conviction and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 26, 2016, the State filed a criminal complaint against Nino Abrigo in the Hawai'i District Court of the First Circuit (district court), charging him with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant (OVUII) in violation of Hawai'i Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 291E-61(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Abrigo pleaded not guilty, and a bench trial commenced on August 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The only witness called by the State was Officer Aaron Ostachuk of the Honolulu Police Department. Due to a series of continuances, Officer Ostachuk's testimony was delivered on three separate days over the course of five months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. August 1, 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the first day that he testified, Officer Ostachuk related that he first encountered Abrigo at approximately 3:00 a.m. on May 15, 2016, while on traffic patrol in the Dillingham-Kalihi area of the island of Oahu. The officer stated that he saw the vehicle driven by Abrigo commit two traffic violations; first, the vehicle drifted across the broken white lines that separated its lane from other lanes going the same direction, then the vehicle swerved back to straddle the solid yellow lines separating the lane from oncoming traffic. Officer Ostachuk testified that he initiated a traffic stop of the vehicle based on these infractions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When he approached the driver-side window, Officer Ostachuk stated, he noticed that Abrigo's eyes were \"red, watery, and glassy\" and the smell of alcohol was emanating from inside the vehicle. Abrigo complied with his request to exit the vehicle, the officer explained, and agreed to take the standard field sobriety test (SFST).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Officer Ostachuk testified that Abrigo followed his instructions during the first part of the SFST, the horizontal gaze nystagmus test (HGN). Officer Ostachuk explained that after he administered the HGN, he placed\n   Abrigo in the starting position for the \"walk-and-turn\" test--the second part of the SFST--and explained the instructions, telling Abrigo not to start walking until he was told to begin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the officer was relating the instructions, he testified, Abrigo began to sway from side to side. Abrigo also started to walk before being told to do so, the officer stated. Although Abrigo complied when he was told to begin walking, the officer said, he exhibited several clues of intoxication: he stopped three times, he missed seven heel-to-toe steps, he raised his arms four times, and he did not take the correct number of steps. Additionally, Officer Ostachuk stated that Abrigo stepped to the side seven times, then clarified that because \"there [was] no straight line ... long enough to use\" at the location where he administered the SFST, he based this assessment on Abrigo's failure to \"step[ ] one foot in front of another in a straight line.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Abrigo reached the \"turn\" part of the test, he was able to execute it, Officer Ostachuk testified. But when asked to describe Abrigo's turn, the officer said, \"I do not recall. It was[ ] nothing out of the ordinary or I would note it down.\" Shortly thereafter, the trial was continued because it was late in the day. Although the transcript indicates trial was initially scheduled to continue on October 19, 2016, proceedings did not recommence until December 15, 2016, for reasons undisclosed in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    2. December 15, 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When the State resumed its direct examination of Officer Ostachuk on December 15, 2016, the officer stated that Abrigo was off-balance when completing the turn portion of the walk-and-turn test because \"[h]e had his knees slightly bent.\" He explained that he interprets a person bending their knees as indicating \"that they can't keep themselves upright in an up--in the standing position, and they use that bending in order to regain themselves.\" Officer Ostachuk then testified that he explained the instructions for the \"one-legged stand\" test, the third part of the SFST, and administered it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He described several clues of intoxication that he said Abrigo exhibited during this test, including swaying, raising his arms, hopping after losing his balance, and putting his foot down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Officer Ostachuk about his memory of Abrigo's traffic violations, and the officer testified that he could not remember the specific details. Specifically, he stated that he could not remember how far or for how long Abrigo crossed over the broken white line or straddled the solid yellow line. Officer Ostachuk also testified that he could not remember his exact reason for pulling Abrigo over without looking at the report that he created that documented his interaction with Abrigo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When asked whether he \"independently remember[ed] giving [Abrigo] the instructions\" to the SFST, Officer Ostachuk answered, \"[I]t's not something off the top of my head I remember specifically, ... I just remember these--this is what I instruct people to do.\" The defense then asked Officer Ostachuk if he remembered \"why [he] checked off the box 'starting too soon' \" in his report, and he responded that he could not remember.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nor could Officer Ostachuk independently recall why he marked the box in his report indicating that Abrigo could not keep his balance during the walk-and-turn test. When asked directly if he could remember his reasoning, the officer responded, \"No. It's just something that I observed at the time, and I checked off the box.\" When asked whether his testimony was \"just based on that box\n   being checked off\" on his report, he answered, \"That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defense counsel then asked, \"Do you actually remember [that] h[e] stop[ped] walking? Or was that testimony based on what is contained in the report?\" The court,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , did not allow the witness to answer because it said that the question was misleading. Outside of Officer Ostachuk's presence, the court clarified that it viewed the question as \"blur[ing the] distinctions\" between Officer Ostachuk's \"memory four months ago when he testified and today.\" The \"crux of the case,\" the court stated, was \"not what he remembers today,\" but rather whether Officer Ostachuk was \"testifying based on a present memory\" or \"just parroting what was in a report\" on August 1 when he testified on direct examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After Officer Ostachuk reentered the courtroom, defense counsel inquired at length as to whether his testimony on August 1 regarding the SFST had been based on his memory at the time or simply reviewing his report. Officer Ostachuk repeatedly replied that he did not recall what had been asked and what he had testified to during the August 1 examination, nor what he had remembered at that time. When defense counsel inquired into his present recollection, Officer Ostachuk stated that he did not have independent memory regarding any aspect of the SFST and could testify only based on what was written in his report. The trial was then continued again for reasons that are not reflected in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3. December 30, 2016\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 30, 2016, the defense resumed its cross-examination of Officer Ostachuk. The officer once more testified that he could not independently recall any details about Abrigo's performance on the SFST. He acknowledged that his testimony was solely based on looking at his report and the annotations it contained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to Abrigo's performance during the one-legged stand test, Officer Ostachuk again said that he did not recall whether he had had an independent recollection of Abrigo's performance when he had testified on August 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defense counsel moved to strike Officer Ostachuk's testimony about the SFST, arguing that the officer lacked independent recollection about the tests and therefore could not be effectively cross-examined. The court denied the motion and said that it would \"not put on the record now, in the officer's presence, the reasons for that because he would still be testifying.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During re-direct examination, the State asked Officer Ostachuk whether \"the clues that [he] marked off on the SFST sheet reflect what [he] observed at the time that [he] actually administered the SFST,\" but the court sustained an objection by the defense. The State then elicited testimony indicating that Officer Ostachuk had a recollection of \"other things that happened that day\" that were not in his report. Specifically, Officer Ostachuk recalled having a conversation with Abrigo, that Abrigo was cordial and cooperative, and the type of car that Abrigo was driving. After Officer Ostachuk's testimony concluded, the State rested. The defense did not present any evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court proceeded to find Abrigo guilty as charged. Although the court found that the officer had \"very limited recollection\" when he testified on December 15, 2016, and \"almost no recollection\" when he testified on December 30, 2016, it concluded that his testimony on August 1, 2016, \"was a product of then-present recollection.\" The court also concluded that the defense had had an opportunity to effectively cross-examine the officer. Abrigo was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and was required to complete a substance abuse assessment class and pay court fees. Abrigo filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ICA Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, Abrigo argued that the court had erred in denying his motion to strike Officer Ostachuk's testimony, which was inadmissible because the officer did not have a present recollection throughout the trial regarding the events to which he testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Abrigo contended that even assuming Officer Ostachuk had present recollection of administering the SFST when he testified on August 1, 2016, he indisputably lacked such recollection when he was cross-examined at the continued trial. This did not afford him a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Officer Ostachuk regarding his testimony, Abrigo argued, and it thus violated his rights to confrontation and cross-examination under the Hawai'i Constitution. Without this erroneously admitted testimony, Abrigo concluded, there was no evidence to support his conviction of OVUII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In response, the State argued that even if Officer Ostachuk lacked the present recollection required to testify regarding the SFST, the officer's statements in his report were themselves admissible under Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 802.1(4), the past recollection recorded exception to hearsay. Abrigo countered in reply that Officer Ostachuk's testimony was inadmissible under the past recollection hearsay exception because (1) the State did not establish an adequate foundation to satisfy this exception, (2) admitting contents of a police report would contradict and nullify the public records and business records exceptions to hearsay, (3) the contents of Officer Ostachuk's report did not have adequate indicia of reliability, and (4) Officer Ostachuk's testimony violated Abrigo's rights to confrontation and cross-examination under the state and federal constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) held that it was clear that Officer Ostachuk's testimony regarding Abrigo's performance on the SFST was not from his present recollection. However, the ICA concluded that Officer Ostachuk's testimony was nonetheless admissible under the past recollection recorded exception. Relying on\n   <em>\n    State v. Bloss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3374586\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw-app/3/274/\">\n    3 Haw. App. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=649%20P.2d%201176\">\n    649 P.2d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), the ICA determined that Officer Ostachuk's report satisfied the past recollection recorded exception because it was \"a record concerning Abrigo's OVUII charge of which Officer Ostachuk once had personal knowledge but at trial had insufficient recollection to enable him to testify fully and accurately.\" And the SFST form accurately reflected Officer Ostachuk's knowledge of the tests, the ICA held, because the officer testified that he filled out the form at the same time that he administered the tests and regularly made accurate records of the same kind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ICA also held that Officer Ostachuk's testimony did not violate Abrigo's right to confrontation or cross-examination because \"a witness who appears at trial and testifies satisfies the confrontation clause, even though the witness claims a lack of memory that precludes them from testifying about the subject matter of their out-of-court statement.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Delos Santos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312437\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/124/130/#p145\">\n    124 Hawai'i 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12312437\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/124/130/#p145\">\n    238 P.3d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (2010).) Thus, the ICA affirmed the judgment of conviction. Abrigo filed a timely application for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The admissibility of evidence requires different standards of review depending on the particular rule of evidence at issue.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Public Records and Past Recollection Recorded Hearsay Exceptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The HRE Rule 803(b)(8) public records hearsay exception allows for the admission of certain \"[r]ecords, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The provision has three distinct subsections, the latter two of which are relevant in this case. The second subsection, HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B), permits the admission of public records setting forth \"matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and other law enforcement personnel.\" The third, HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(C), allows for the admission of public records containing \"factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law,\" but only \"in civil proceedings and against the government in criminal cases.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This court outlined the contours of these two subsections in\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , a criminal case in which we considered the admissibility of a technician's sworn statements indicating that, based on the technician's expert interpretation of data produced by an accuracy test, an Intoxilyzer was working properly when it measured a defendant's breath sample.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    140 Hawai'i 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 254,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    400 P.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 (2017). In analyzing whether the out-of-court statements should have been admitted pursuant to HRE Rule 803(b)(8)(B), we noted that the phrase \"matters observed\" could be interpreted as \"encompassing all 'records describing an almost endless variety of acts, events, and conditions in the world observed and depicted by public officials.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    at 257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    400 P.3d at 458-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Christopher B.

Thus, admitting police reports under the HRE Rule 802.1(4) past recollection recorded hearsay exception, which applies only when a testifying declarant has \"insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately,\" creates an illogical dichotomy. Documents that are wholly inadmissible both when the authoring official is absent, and thus subject to no cross-examination, and when the author testifies from personal knowledge and is subject to full cross-examination, would be deemed admissible only when the author has insufficient recollection to testify fully and accurately about the events underlying the reports, making the official subject to only cross-examination that is ineffective at ascertaining the truth. Such a distinction is not rationally justified, and it is contrary to statements by multiple courts that the public records exception was \"intended to bar the use of law enforcement reports as a substitute for the testimony of the officer.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sawyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431860\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/607/1190/#p1193\">\n    607 F.2d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1193 (7th Cir. 1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The dissent argues that this extremely limited cross-examination is sufficient to satisfy any concerns the drafters may have had about the introduction of police reports. Dissent at 144 Hawai'i at 507-08, 509 n.4, 445 P.3d at 88-89, 90 n.4. This contention is plainly refuted in this case and decidedly incorrect as a general principle. A police officer's pro forma taking of the stand, as occurred here, does not eliminate the danger that the law enforcement exclusion in the public records exception was intended to address: a defendant being denied the right to cross-examine a police officer about the substance of the officer's report. Such reports are inherently less reliable than other witness recollections that are recorded soon after the events they recount, for police reports are created in an adversarial setting for the primary purpose of substantiating a criminal charge against the defendant. Only through meaningful cross-examination can a defendant test the accuracy of a police officer's account of events that took place in this context, and this cannot occur when an officer testifies to a lack of memory and simply recites the contents of the report to the factfinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The State in this case was essentially able to use Officer Ostachuk's report as a substitute for his testimony. When the defense counsel attempted to cross-examine the officer about the SFST he conducted, the officer could not testify to any information about Abrigo's performance that was not contained in his report--a document that was prepared for the specific purpose of building a case against Abrigo. Because of the officer's lack of memory, Abrigo did not have a meaningful opportunity to challenge any of the officer's observations and conclusions regarding the clues of intoxication that Abrigo allegedly displayed. That is, the State convicted Abrigo on nothing more than a police report without affording him an adequate opportunity to challenge the officer's observations. Abrigo's ostensible ability to question the officer's general credibility and methodology was a hollow substitute for cross-examination on the officer's actual basis for arresting Abrigo and charging him with a crime, and the process plainly did not offer any assurances of the report's reliability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The dissent argues that our interpretation could adversely affect an OVUII prosecution by precluding the introduction of a police officer's report when the officer is unable to recall the details of the driver's SFST performance months after a stop. Dissent at 144 Hawai'i at 505, 445 P.3d at 86-87. But the administrative difficulty of providing a prompt trial does not justify dispensing with the assurances of reliability inherent in meaningful cross-examination. Moreover, the same result could occur in any trial in which a police report is admitted under the past recollection recorded hearsay exception, irrespective of the seriousness of the charges or the strength of the evidence against the defendant. A defendant could be convicted of a major felony offense on the sole basis of a report authored by a police officer who is the only witness to the alleged crime, all without any opportunity to challenge the substance of the report through in-court cross-examination. The injustice of an interpretation of our evidentiary rules that would allow a defendant to be convicted solely on the basis of a\n   police report being read into evidence is manifest, and we are thus obliged to reject it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRE Rule 102 (providing that the \"rules shall be construed to,\"\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"secure fairness in administration\" and to promote the \"growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that\n   <em>\n    the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The dissent also responds by quoting a passage from a treatise on evidence that argues that it is impractical to expect law enforcement officials to recall specific, detailed information such as \"serial or license numbers, makes of cars, detailed descriptions of objects at crime scenes, or precise details about physical layout.\" Dissent at 144 Hawai'i at 508, 445 P.3d at 89 (quoting Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick,\n   <em>\n    Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.51 (5th ed. 2012)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an initial matter, this court has not yet addressed the extent to which the law enforcement exclusion in the public record exception bars the admission of purely routine observational data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    140 Hawai'i at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   259 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314327\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/140/252/#p254\">\n    400 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   460 n.15 (declining to reach the issue). Assuming such informational data cannot be admitted through this route or by properly authenticated documentary evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HRE Rule 901, a police report or any other document, photograph, or object may be used to refresh an officer's memory both before testifying and while on the stand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HRE Rule 612. Only when the officer's recollection of the events underlying the report is so inadequate that reviewing the report or other refreshing item is unable to bring these details to mind and other means are not available would the admissibility of routine observational data under HRE Rule 803 require consideration. This rare scenario cannot drive the result of our analysis when the alternative-depriving the defendant of meaningful cross-examination of a significant State's witness--is the outcome of the dissent's position. To hold that reading the contents of the police report is admissible in this case, in which the witness was the only source of evidence against the defendant, would establish a precedent for trials to be\n   determined on the basis of police reports and not testimony, ultimately compromising the fundamental rights of defendants and the ability of factfinders to accurately determine the issues before them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, we now formally hold that police reports may not be admitted against a defendant in a criminal case under the HRE Rule 802.1(4) past recollection recorded hearsay exception. We conclude that Officer Ostachuk's report could not have been admitted under the public records exception, and thus the past recollection recorded exception could not serve as a \"back door\" to read the report into evidence. Accordingly, the ICA erred in holding that the content of Officer Ostachuk's report was admissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Officer Ostachuk's testimony was the only evidence presented by the State, Abrigo's conviction cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the ICA's judgment on appeal is vacated, the judgment of conviction is vacated, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   CONCURRING IN THE JUDGMENT, AND DISSENTING OPINION BY RECKTENWALD, C.J., IN WHICH NAKAYAMA, J., JOINS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This case requires us to consider the following scenario: a police officer conducts a standardized field sobriety test (SFST) of a defendant suspected of driving under the influence of an intoxicant. The officer writes a report of the observations made of the defendant during the course of the test. Months later, when the officer is called to testify, the officer cannot recall the details of the stop. Provided that the officer is subject to cross-examination and a proper foundation is established, should the officer be allowed to read his or her report into evidence, as past recollection recorded under Hawai'i Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 802.1(4) ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Majority holds that use of the officer's report in that manner is absolutely precluded because HRE Rule 803(b)(8), the public records exception to hearsay, requires that result. In reaching that outcome, the Majority relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Oates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"938031\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/560/45/#p68\">\n    560 F.2d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d. Cir. 1977), a federal case that analyzed the legislative history of a federal rule of evidence similar to HRE Rule 803(b)(8). The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Oates\n   </em>\n   argued persuasively that the federal rule was not intended to allow police reports to be admitted into evidence as a substitute for live testimony by the police officer who wrote the report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, as other courts including the Second Circuit itself have noted,\n   <em>\n    Oates\n   </em>\n   does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   address the situation in which the officer who wrote the report testifies, and then is subsequently cross-examined.\n   <em>\n    Oates\n   </em>\n   therefore does not address the applicability of the past recollection recorded rule. In such a circumstance, many courts hold that testimony about the report's content is admissible, provided that a proper foundation is established. Notably, these decisions include several state cases that consider the precise circumstances presented by the instant case: testimony by an officer based on a report about an encounter with a defendant suspected of driving while intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The practical effects of the Majority's decision are substantial. A police officer patrolling busy streets may not be able to recall the details of a driver's SFST performance when called to testify months after a particular stop. Under the Majority's analysis, the officer will not be able to testify about the contents of their report, even if a proper foundation under HRE Rule 802.1(4) can be established and even if the officer is subject to cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Such a result is not required by the federal or Hawai'i constitutions. Rather, it is a product\n   of the Majority's interpretation of the history of a federal rule of evidence, an interpretation that many other courts have rejected. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the Majority's analysis, but concur in the judgment given my conclusion that the State failed to establish a proper foundation under HRE Rule 802.1(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On May 15, 2016, after allegedly observing Abrigo commit multiple traffic violations, Honolulu Police Department Officer Aaron Ostachuk (Ostachuk) pulled Abrigo over. Suspecting that Abrigo was inebriated, Officer Ostachuk administered an SFST, and based on Abrigo's performance, arrested him for OVUII. Abrigo's bench trial began on August 1, 2016, with Officer Ostachuk's testimony spanning three days due to several continuances. According to the district court, Officer Ostachuk's August 1, 2016 testimony stemmed from Officer Ostachuk's independent recollection of events. The district court noted, however, that by December 15, 2016, Officer Ostachuk had \"very limited recollection\" of the events, and that by December 30, 2016, Officer Ostachuk had \"almost no recollection\" of the events. Indeed, Officer Ostachuk testified on December 15 and 30 that he could not recall many of the details of Abrigo's traffic violations or performance on the SFST without reviewing his police report. On appeal, the ICA held that Officer Ostachuk's testimony, which in large part had been based on his report, was admissible under HRE Rule 802.1(4), the past recollection recorded exception to hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As such, the Majority concludes that Officer Ostachuk's testimony, which was based in large part on the notations in his police report,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   should have been excluded from evidence.

If the preparer testifies to lack of recollection on such points and the report otherwise qualifies as past recorded recollection, admitting it seems wise: The purpose of the use restrictions is satisfied in large measure because an investigator ... submits to cross, and the report is admissible only insofar as recollection fails.

In other words, in order to be reliable, \"the statement must reflect personal knowledge of the recorded event, must have been contemporaneously made, and must be vouched for in terms of accuracy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Addison M.

Despite this, the State failed to establish that Officer Ostachuk's report was accurate. The State attempted to establish this requirement by asking: \"You guys fill out clues on the SFST pretty regularly, right?\" This question, even when answered in the affirmative, did not speak to the record's accuracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Professor Michael H.

Under our current caselaw, the admission of a witness's prior out-of-court statements does not violate a defendant's confrontation and cross-examination rights even when the witness is completely unable to remember the subject matter of the prior statement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.

It is thus noteworthy that, in addition to all of the stated reasons underlying our analysis, our holding is consistent with our duty to adopt an evidentiary interpretation that avoids addressing a grave constitutional question. That is, by concluding that Officer Ostachuk's report was inadmissible on the basis of our evidentiary rules, we render it unnecessary to address Abrigo's contention that the officer's near-total lack of recollection violated his constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The treatise on which the dissent relies also counsels that the exclusion of law enforcement reports in the public records hearsay exception should not be used to exclude various public records for which another \"narrow and specific\" hearsay exception applies in the rare instance in which they are authored by police.
