App. Oct. 18, 2018), Joshua M. Coffee (\"Father\") moved for special action relief from the superior court's order that his minor son (\"Son\") immediately move from Arizona to Kansas and live with Jennifer Leigh Appling (\"Mother\"). A different panel of this court accepted jurisdiction and concluded the superior court had deprived Father of due process. This court ordered the superior court to conduct a second evidentiary hearing at which Father receives due process, and then revisit its decision to relocate the child based on a developed record. The superior court was also ordered to consider Mother's request for modified child support and Father's counter-petition to modify legal decision-making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 This second special action followed after Father unsuccessfully moved to change the trial judge before the second evidentiary hearing under Rule 42.1(e). The superior court determined that Rule 42.1(e) did not apply because\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   did not reverse the court's relocation decision or require it to conduct a new trial. We accept jurisdiction and grant relief because Father's right to change the trial judge was renewed under Rule 42.1(e) after\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   granted relief requiring a new evidentiary hearing and decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Mother and Father divorced in 2008 with one minor child, Son. The superior court ordered joint legal decision-making authority over Son in the dissolution decree, but designated Father as the primary residential parent. Mother moved to Kansas in 2010 and the parties stipulated to a long-distance parenting plan. In July and August 2018, Mother filed a petition and emergency motion to modify parenting time and child support based on allegations that Son was engaging in dangerous behavior. Mother requested a \"role reversal\" in which Son would move from Arizona to Kansas and Mother would become the primary residential parent. Father responded and counter-petitioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The court treated Mother's emergency motion as one for temporary orders without notice under Arizona Rule of Family Law Procedure 48, and denied the motion after finding that Mother had not shown irreparable injury, loss or damage. The court set a limited evidentiary \"return hearing\" or \"emergency hearing,\" at which it would hear testimony, but only from the parties and with no exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The actual hearing was more expansive than forecast. The trial judge considered and relied on medical notes from the child's therapist in Kansas. The notes had not been disclosed to Father before the hearing, yet the judge questioned him about their contents and relied on his answers in deciding that Son should be relocated to Kansas. At hearing's end, the judge expressed concern about Son's safety in Arizona and doubt about Father's parenting skills before announcing that \"[Son] is going to Kansas\" based on the court's \"risk analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The superior court entered what it described as a \"temporary order,\" stating that \"[b]ased on testimony presented,\" Son \"shall reside with Mother in Kansas effective immediately pending further order of the Court.\" The court did not mention or include any specific findings on the relevant factors for parenting time under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403(A) or child relocation under \u00a7 25-408(I). The court did not address Mother's request to modify child support or Father's counter-petition to modify legal decision-making. A telephonic follow-up hearing was scheduled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Five weeks later, Father petitioned this court for special action relief to vacate the superior court's ruling on due process grounds and sought an order for Son's immediate\n   return to Arizona. This court accepted jurisdiction, concluded that Father was denied due process, ruled that the order \"cannot stand,\" determined that \"a new hearing [was] required,\" and thus \"direct[ed] the superior court to conduct an evidentiary hearing\" within 60 days \"that complies with applicable rules and statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Coffee I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205117110\">\n    2018 WL 5117110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-5, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5, 8, 20, 22. The decision also directed the superior court to address the relevant statutory factors when it ruled on \"the pending requests to modify legal decision-making, parenting time, and child support,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5, \u00b6 22, which meant revisiting the relocation question,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berrier v.

The court did not reverse the superior court outright and order Son to remain in Arizona because the child had already moved to Kansas by the time Father pursued special action relief.\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205117110\">\n    2018 WL 5117110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 After securing relief in\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   , Father moved for a change of judge under Rule 42.1(e). The superior court denied the motion, stating the court of appeals had not ordered a \"new trial\" but only asked the superior court to explain why it entered the temporary relocation order. The superior court stressed that the court of appeals \"did not reverse\" its decision and \"there is no evidence the trial court has any ill-feelings\" against the parties based on the special action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]here is nothing in the court of appeal's mandate that reverses this Court's decision or requires the trial court to try the pending issues anew. Instead, the appellate court requires this Court afford the parties an opportunity to have an \"appropriate\" evidentiary hearing and direct[s] this Court to make findings under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-403.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 At the same time, the superior court did not schedule the rapid evidentiary hearing (within 60 days) required under\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   , but instead asked the parties for input on how to proceed and requested amended pleadings while promising \"an evidentiary hearing [would be conducted] at an appropriate time determined by the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Father responded with a second petition for special action, asking this court to either reverse the superior court's denial of his motion to change judge, or to direct that the court comply with\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   and hold an evidentiary hearing within 60 days of October 25. We stayed all proceedings in the superior court on November 5, and then accepted jurisdiction and granted relief on November 26, issuing a brief order to grant a change of judge and conduct an evidentiary hearing. We advised a written decision would follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The superior court later raised concerns about its jurisdiction to hold the evidentiary hearing absent a mandate from the court of appeals that \"revest[ed] jurisdiction with [the superior court].\" In response, we reaffirmed our previous orders, addressed the superior court's jurisdictional concerns and lifted our November 5 stay. This decision explains our reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 We accept jurisdiction of this special action because it presents a pure legal question and \"the denial of a peremptory request for a change of judge is properly reviewed only by special action.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3998710\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/78/#p79\">\n    214 Ariz. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79, \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3998710\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/78/#p79\">\n    148 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (App. 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Before reaching that issue, however, we address the interplay between a special action in the court of appeals and the superior court's jurisdiction in the underlying matter. Unlike an appeal, jurisdiction never transfers from the superior court to the court of appeals in the special action context.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 24(a) (\"An appellate court retains jurisdiction of an\n   <em>\n    appeal\n   </em>\n   until it issues the mandate.\") (emphasis added),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), (4) (conferring \"[j]urisdiction [on court of appeals] to hear and determine petitions for special actions brought pursuant to the rules of procedure for special actions, without regard to its appellate jurisdiction\"). A special action represents a separate, original proceeding where an appellate court examines the action or\n   inaction of public officials and may issue orders (similar to a common law writ) affecting future proceedings in a case. Ariz. R.P. Spec. Act. 1(a) (combining writs of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition into the \"special action\" proceeding);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Hance v.

And even when a stay is entered, the superior court is only limited in its actions by the express language of the stay order. Although the superior court must comply with such orders, it does not lose jurisdiction as it would when an appeal is commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 In this special action, the superior court thus never lost jurisdiction of the underlying case, and any limitations set forth in the stay order were removed when that order was lifted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Rule 42.1(e) authorizes a party to obtain a new trial judge \"[i]n actions remanded from an appellate court\" if \"the appellate decision requires a new trial\" and the movant has not previously removed a trial judge in the action. Ariz. R. Civ. P. 42.1(e). Father has not previously sought or received a change of trial judge. As such, the only question is whether\n   <em>\n    Coffee I\n   </em>\n   \"remanded\" this matter for a \"new trial\" under Rule 42.1(e)(1).
