A federal agency may trigger implied obstacle preemption when it refuses to set formal equipment standards to advance a regulatory purpose or objective. At issue here is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (\"NHTSA\") refusal to set formal standards for advanced automatic braking technologies in light vehicles, and whether that refusal preempts Arizona common-law tort claims against Nissan for manufacturing the 2008 Nissan Rogue without these safety features. The superior court dismissed the lawsuit as preempted. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 This products liability case stems from an April 2015 car collision. Antea Dashi was driving her Honda Accord on a one-way street when she missed her intended exit. Rather than traverse side-streets to reach her destination, Dashi decided to turn around and return to the exit against oncoming traffic. A second vehicle stopped in the street behind Dashi as she performed an illegal U-turn, and a third vehicle followed behind the second vehicle, creating a backup. Unaware of Dashi's unfolding turn, the third vehicle, a 2008 Nissan Rogue, swerved around the second vehicle and crashed into Dashi's then-perpendicular\n   vehicle. Dashi suffered serious head injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Dashi sued Nissan in the superior court, asserting state common-law tort claims. As relevant here, she alleged the collision would not have occurred if Nissan had equipped the 2008 Nissan Rogue with then-available automatic emergency braking (\"AEB\") systems, including Forward Collision Warning (\"FCW\") and Crash Imminent Braking (\"CIB\"). FCW \"uses information from forward-looking sensors to determine whether or not a crash is likely or unavoidable\" and warns the driver to \"brake and/or steer to avoid a crash or minimize the force of the crash.\"\n   <em>\n    Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Automatic Emergency Braking\n   </em>\n   (\"FMVSS AEB\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%208391\">\n    82 Fed.

The superior court agreed and dismissed the lawsuit. The court found that NHTSA decided \"[vehicle] manufacturers [should have] options with regard to which [automatic braking] safety features to adopt,\" which \"preempts the state court tort action based on whether the lack of FCW and [CIB] technology renders the 2008 Nissan Rogue as defective.\" This timely appeal followed.
