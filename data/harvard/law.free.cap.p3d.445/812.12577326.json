At all times pertinent, Edward Jones was and is a securities broker or brokerage registered with the SEC under the 1934 Act ( 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(a)(1) ). As a means of similarly subjecting them to federal securities laws and regulations, the SEC and NASD/FINRA require approved registration (licensing) of broker principals and representatives\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a condition of employment with employing member-brokers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINRA Rules 0140, 1210; NASD Rules 0115, 1021, and 1031.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 In 1998, Bucy applied for NASD registration as a representative of Edward Jones. He submitted a signed NASD Form U4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration) for registration in association with Edward Jones.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NASD Rule 1013(a)(1)-(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time, NASD Rules applied to all NASD broker-members and associated persons and imposed on associated persons the \"same duties and obligations\" under the Rules as members. NASD Rule 0115.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, NASD regulations prescribed a comprehensive Code of Arbitration Procedure \"for the arbitration of any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection with the business of any [NASD] member or arising out of the employment or termination of\n   employment of associated person(s) with any member ... between or among members and associated\n   persons.\" NASD Rule 10101(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pertinent part, the Rules then generally required arbitration of any:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   dispute [or] claim ... between or among members and/or associated persons ... arising in connection with the business of such member(s) or in connection with the activities of such associated person(s), or arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person(s)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   NASD Rule 10201(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In accordance with NASD Rules 0115, 10101(b), and 10201(a)(2), Bucy's Form U4 included the following standard arbitration agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I agree to arbitrate any dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm ... that is required to be arbitrated under the rules, constitutions, or by-laws of [NYSE and NASD] as may be amended from time to time and that any arbitration award rendered against me may be entered as a [judgment] in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   NASD Rule 1013(a)(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b68 In 2003, Bucy relocated to work in the newly opened Edward Jones branch office in Missoula. Incident to the transfer, Bucy voluntarily executed a new employment agreement with Edward Jones to work as a registered \"investment representative.\" Bucy expressly agreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   that any dispute, claim or controversy arising under this Agreement or as a result of [his] employment with Edward Jones between [he] and Edward Jones or any present or former employee, agent, officer, director ... of Edward Jones shall be resolved by arbitration and without resort to litigation in court. Any arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules then in effect of the Boards of Directors of the [NYSE] or the [NASD]. This agreement to arbitrate disputes shall survive the termination of your employment with Edward Jones.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   You agree to ... strictly adhere to the rules and regulations of the SEC, NASD, NYSE and state securities regulators, and all other applicable rules and regulations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Directly above the signature line, the agreement further prominently\n   stated in bold script:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b69 In the spring of 2015, after twelve years as a successful financial advisor in Missoula,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bucy became \"disaffected by\" the \"culture\" at Edward Jones and \"began looking for new employment.\" Between April and June 2015, he was negotiating with LPL Financial (LPL), a \"Boston-based financial planning\" firm, to work as a registered LPL representative and financial advisor in the Missoula area. Bucy alleges that, at some point, Edward Jones \"intercepted [his] emails or phone calls and learned\" of his intent to leave for new employment with a \"competing financial planning business.\" He further asserts, and Edward Jones denies, that Edward Jones then had developed a \"corporate pattern and practice of blackballing 'breakaway' brokers\" to prevent them from working for competitors. On or about May 28, 2015, one of Bucy's Edward Jones clients filed a complaint with FINRA alleging that Bucy conducted an unauthorized transaction on the client's account. Bucy alleges that Edward Jones encouraged the client to file the complaint upon learning of his intent to leave the firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b610 The client complaint immediately triggered an internal review by Edward Jones and a separate licensing investigation by FINRA. Incident to its internal review, Edward Jones contacted and communicated with several of Bucy's existing Edward Jones clients, some of whom later testified that Edward Jones personnel told them that Bucy had given them bad advice and mishandled their accounts. While the Edward Jones review and FINRA investigation were pending, Bucy's negotiations with LPL Financial came to a successful conclusion in late June, resulting in his execution of a written contract, on July 19, 2015, for prospective employment with LPL. Bucy subsequently informed Edward Jones of his intent to resign, effective July 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b611 On July 30, 2015, the day before the effective date of Bucy's\n   resignation, a second Edward Jones client filed a FINRA complaint against him. As with the first client complaint, Bucy alleges that Edward Jones encouraged the client to file the complaint. On July 31, 2015, Bucy resigned from Edward Jones to take new employment with LPL Financial. Edward Jones subsequently circulated an internal memo notifying staff of Bucy's \"voluntary\" termination and that he had accepted a job at another financial services firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b612 Upon the termination of employment of a registered representative, FINRA regulations require former employers to file an electronic FINRA Form U5 terminating the representative's FINRA registration with that member-broker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINRA Bylaws, Article V, Section 3(a). The web-based electronic Form U5 prompts the reporting member to report the manner of termination, whether \"Deceased,\" \"Discharged,\" \"Permitted to Resign,\" \"Voluntary,\" or \"Other.\" If the member-broker reports the manner of termination as \"Permitted to Resign,\" \"Discharged,\" or \"Other,\" the form requires the member to \"provide\" further \"explanation\" of the reason for termination. Form U5 filings are publicly available by query on FINRA's internet website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b613 On August 4, 2015, Edward Jones filed a FINRA Form U5 reporting the termination of Bucy's employment. Contrary to its earlier staff memorandum stating that the termination was \"voluntary,\" Edward Jones' U5 filing reported that Bucy was \"permitted to resign\" under the following circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   MR. BUCY RESIGNED WHILE UNDER AN INTERNAL REVIEW THAT STARTED AFTER THE FIRM RECEIVED A CLIENT COMPLAINT ALLEGING UNSUITABLE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DISCRETIONARY TRADING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Three weeks later, on August 26, 2015, Bucy's new firm (LPL) rescinded its new employment contract with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b614 In the immediate wake of Bucy's departure from Edward Jones, his successor at Edward Jones contacted and consulted with a number of Edward Jones clients formerly served by Bucy. Six of them later filed FINRA complaints alleging that Bucy mishandled their accounts while at Edward Jones. Several of the new complainants subsequently testified that Edward Jones personnel encouraged them to file FINRA complaints against Bucy based on Edward Jones' assertions that he gave them bad financial advice and mishandled their accounts in violation of FINRA Rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b615 On June 27, 2016, Bucy filed a complaint against Edward Jones, et al., in the Montana Fourth Judicial District Court asserting claims for statutory blacklisting ( \u00a7 39-2-803, MCA ), statutory defamation ( \u00a7 27-1-801, MCA ), and common law tortious interference with his\n   prospective business relationship with LPL. On August 31, 2016, FINRA notified Bucy that it had completed its investigation and was closing his file without further action. On September 26, 2016, Edward Jones moved the District Court to dismiss and compel arbitration of Bucy's claims on the asserted basis that they were subject to arbitration under NASD/FINRA regulations, the arbitration agreement in his 1998 Form U4 application, and his 2003 employment contract with Edward Jones. In response, Bucy asserted that his claims were \"post-termination\" claims beyond the scope of the 1998 and 2003 arbitration agreements and that, even if not, they were in any event unenforceable as a threshold matter of law.\n   \u00b616 In January 2017, in a somewhat imprecise manner, the District Court compelled arbitration \"as to transactions occurring during [Bucy's] employment,\" but denied arbitration of \"post-employment claims\" without prejudice pending further discovery regarding the threshold arbitrability of those claims. In July 2017, following limited discovery, Edward Jones renewed its motion to compel arbitration of Bucy's post-termination claims. On August 9, 2018, the court denied the renewed motion on the asserted ground that Edward Jones had failed to develop any additional facts indicating that Bucy's post-termination claims were arbitrable within the scope of his 1998 and 2003 arbitration agreements. Edward Jones timely appealed. Bucy responded in opposition but did not cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b617 We review district court rulings on motions to compel arbitration de novo for correctness under the governing standards of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq., or Montana Uniform Arbitration Act (MUAA), \u00a7 27 -5-111, MCA, et seq., as applicable.\n   <em>\n    Lenz v.

As pertinent, the essential reciprocal consideration on the face of the arbitration agreement in Bucy's 1998 FINRA Form U4 filing was his agreement to arbitrate a specified scope of disputes, and thereby implicitly waive\n   available judicial remedies, in return for the necessary securities industry registration (licensing) required by federal law to work as a representative of a securities\n   broker or brokerage. Similarly, as pertinent, the essential reciprocal consideration on the face of the arbitration agreement in the 2003 employment agreement was Bucy's agreement to arbitrate a specified scope of disputes, and thereby implicitly waive available judicial remedies, in return for employment on other specified terms and conditions with a broker-employer prohibited by federal law from employing unregistered representatives as financial advisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b628 Whether as a consideration of unconscionability or a stand-alone formation defect, Bucy asserts that the 2003 arbitration agreement lacked mutuality because it required him to waive ordinarily available judicial remedies while unfairly preserving an injunctive relief remedy for Edward Jones.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Bucy's assertion fails to recognize that FINRA Rule 13804, like NASD Rule 10335 before it, authorizes\n   <em>\n    either or both\n   </em>\n   parties to a pending arbitration to seek limited preliminary or permanent injunctive relief as an adjunct to arbitration.

Then-governing NASD regulations dictated the terms of his 1998 Form U4 agreement and Edward Jones similarly dictated the terms of his 2003 employment agreement in accordance therewith. Bucy further correctly points out that he had no significant bargaining position in either case, he did not specifically initial the arbitration agreements in the larger contracts, and neither agreement included an explicit explanation or waiver of his Montana constitutional rights. Moreover, some significant degree of disparity in business experience and sophistication likely existed between Bucy and Edward Jones at the outset of his career in 1998 and, to a lesser degree, in 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b632 However, it is beyond genuine material dispute on the record that, in 1998, Bucy was a highly intelligent and educated person with a bachelors' degree in finance from the University of Montana who was knowingly seeking professional licensing and employment as a representative of a securities broker in the highly regulated securities industry. In 2003, after working for Edward Jones for four-plus years, he was at least similarly capable and knowledgeable, if not more, as he transitioned to Missoula to work as a licensed representative of a securities broker or brokerage. Bucy voluntarily signed the 1998 standard Form U4 licensing application and subsequent 2003 employment agreement and is thus presumed to have read and understood the meaning of their clear and unambiguous language.\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22 (internal citations omitted). The record is further devoid of any factual showing, or even allegation, of incapacity, mutual mistake, fraud, misrepresentation, or other tortious conduct affecting assent. \"A party to a clear and unambiguous written contract [language] cannot avoid its legal consequences simply by later claiming that [he or] she did not understand the legal consequences of the plain language of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Lenz\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22 (internal punctuation and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b633 In pertinent part, the 1998 Form U4 clearly and unambiguously stated that Bucy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   agree[d] to arbitrate\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   dispute, claim or controversy that may arise between me and my firm ...

Directly above the signature line, the agreement prominently stated in bold script, \"THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A\n   <em>\n    BINDING\n   </em>\n   ARBITRATION PROVISION WHICH MAY BE ENFORCED BY THE PARTIES.\" (Emphasis added). Bucy further\n   expressly \"agree[d] to ... strictly adhere to the rules and regulations of the SEC, NASD, NYSE and state securities regulators, and all other applicable rules and regulations.\" The language of the 1998 and 2003 arbitration agreements thus clearly and unambiguously indicated that Bucy agreed to resolve a broad scope of potential future disputes by arbitration rather than through the judicial legal system and process otherwise ordinarily available in the absence of such agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b634 There is no evidence or assertion that, if so inclined, Bucy did not have the opportunity or ability to consult with counsel prior to executing either of the arbitration agreements at issue. Nor is there any record indication that Bucy signed either of the arbitration agreements under extraordinary or undue economic, social or practical duress-the agreements were the requirement\n   or function of SEC-approved NASD regulations rather than independently compelled by a private party in commerce. Further, there is no evidence or assertion that, at the time of execution, the NASD or Edward Jones \"lulled\" Bucy \"into a belief\" that the arbitration agreements \"would not be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kortum\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b635 Finally, the lack of explicit reference in either of the agreements to Montana constitutional rights is insignificant in this case. The 1998 agreement was part of a standard form agreement conforming to SEC-approved NASD regulations executed incident to his new employment with Edward Jones\n   <em>\n    in Missouri\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b)(1), (c), as amended; NASD Rules 0115(a), 1013(a)(1)-(2), 10101(b), 10201(a)(2). The 2003 arbitration agreement similarly conformed to the same SEC-approved NASD regulations related to his anticipated employment in Montana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bucy has provided no authority or analysis for his implied assertion that Montana constitutional waiver requirements can in any event override SEC-approved regulations, authorized and promulgated under the 1934 Act of Congress. Consequently, in the federally-regulated securities context, whether federal securities laws and regulations require arbitration in a particular context is a significant, if not dispositive, consideration of whether a valid waiver of Montana constitutional rights has occurred, or is even necessary, in an arbitration agreement governed by federal law under the 1934 Act.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Credit Suisse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9176214\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/400/1119/#p1130\">\n    400 F.3d at 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SEC-approved SRO rules \"preempt state law when the two are in conflict\").

[and] is required to be arbitrated under [NASD]\" or succeeding Rules. In turn, NASD regulations required arbitration of any \"dispute [or] claim ... between or among members and/or associated persons\" either:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (1) \"arising in connection with the business of such [NASD] member(s)\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (2) \"in connection with the activities of such associated person(s)\"; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (3) \"arising out of the employment or termination of employment of such associated person(s)....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   NASD Rule 10201(a). Superseding FINRA Rules now similarly require arbitration of any \"dispute ... between or among ... Members and Associated Persons\" and \"aris[ing] out of the business activities of a member or an associated person. ...\" FINRA Rule 13200(a). Bucy's 2003 employment agreement similarly requires arbitration of disputes or claims between them \"arising under this [a]greement or as a result of [his] employment with Edward Jones. ...\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b646 Edward Jones is unquestionably a \"Member,\" as defined by and referenced in FINRA Rules 0160(b)(10), 13100(q), and 13200(a). At all times pertinent, Bucy was an \"Associated Person\" as defined by and referenced in FINRA Rules 1011(b), 13100(b), (u), and 13200(a). The currently governing FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Industry Disputes does not define the terms \"arising out of\" or \"business activities\" as referenced in Rule 13200(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FINRA Rule 13100. However, the plain meaning of those terms in ordinary usage is clearly and unambiguously broad. In ordinary usage, the phrase disputes \"arising out of the business activities\" of a specified person or entity simply means a dispute regarding or related to the activities in which the specified person or entity is or was engaged. At all times pertinent, both before and after the termination of Bucy's employment, Edward Jones was and is engaged in the business of providing securities investment and related financial management and planning services to clients through its authorized employees and agents in accordance with governing federal securities laws and regulations, including FINRA and NASD regulations, and pertinent industry standards of care. While employed as a registered representative of Edward Jones, Bucy was engaged in the business of performing and carrying-on the business of Edward Jones in accordance with governing federal securities laws and regulations, including pertinent FINRA and NASD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   regulations, under the direction of Edward Jones and the terms of his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b647 As stated in his District Court complaint, and subsequently prosecuted on the record in this case, the predicate factual allegations underlying Bucy's claims, and implicated legal duties and alleged breaches or violations, all directly regard and relate to\n   the conduct of Edward Jones' business activities, both before and after the termination of Bucy's employment. They similarly directly relate to Bucy's business activities as an employee of Edward Jones. Thus, as referenced in FINRA Rule 13200(a), all of Bucy's claims \"arise[ ] out of the business activities of a member or an associated person. ...\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As referenced in his 2003 employment agreement, they are similarly disputes or claims \"arising under this [a]greement or as a result of [his] employment with Edward Jones. ...\" We hold that Bucy's claims were and are mandatorily arbitrable pursuant to FINRA Rule 13200(a), within the scope of his 1998 NASD Form U4 application, and within the scope of his 2003 employment agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b648 Bucy did not waive his threshold enforceability challenge by failing to cross-appeal. The arbitration agreement in Bucy's 2003 employment agreement was not illusory, lacking in mutuality, or unreasonably one-sided or oppressive due to Edward Jones' retention of a limited right to seek injunctive relief. The 1998 and 2003 arbitration agreements were not illegal, void, violative of public policy, or otherwise unenforceable due to lack of an explicit explanation and waiver of Montana constitutional rights. Nor were they equitably unenforceable as unconscionable. We hold that Bucy's claims were and are mandatorily arbitrable pursuant to FINRA Rule 13200(a) and within the scope of the arbitration agreements in his 1998 Form U4\n   application and 2003 employment agreement. The District Court's August 9, 2018 judgment denying Edward Jones' motion to compel arbitration of Bucy's post-termination claims is hereby reversed and this matter is remanded for entry of an order compelling arbitration of all of Bucy's claims and dismissing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b649 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   BETH BAKER, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   INGRID GUSTAFSON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    \" '[S]ecurities laws' means the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C.
