He later sought to withdraw his guilty pleas, claiming that they were not knowingly and voluntarily made because he was under the influence of drugs at his plea hearing. The district court denied his motion to withdraw. Ciccolelli appeals, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 After receiving a welfare call on January 25, 2017, police officers found Ciccolelli in his car with drug paraphernalia in plain view. The officers searched the vehicle and found a stolen handgun in the center console. Ciccolelli also admitted to the officers that he had recently used marijuana and opioids and had been driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Ciccolelli was charged with theft by receiving stolen property, possession of a firearm by a restricted person, driving under the influence, and possession of drug paraphernalia. Ciccolelli was arrested and booked into jail on June 23, 2017, and a hearing was scheduled for July 3, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At the July 3 hearing, Ciccolelli pleaded guilty to the first three charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exchange, the State dropped the fourth charge. The district court conducted the following colloquy with Ciccolelli:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court: Okay. All right, Mr. Ciccolelli, are you thinking clearly right now?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Ciccolelli: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court: Have you been able to go over all of this with [your attorney]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Ciccolelli: Yes, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court: You're going to be giving up a lot of rights in this hearing today if you accept this offer because you're still at the early stages. Are you taking any medication or anything that would affect that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Ciccolelli: No, ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court: Are you ready to accept this offer, change your plea and move on towards the sentencing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Ciccolelli: Yes, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b65 To finalize the plea agreement, Ciccolelli was invited by the court to sign a statement (the Plea Statement). Under the heading \"Defendant's Certification of Voluntariness,\" the Plea Statement provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   I [Ciccolelli] am entering this plea of my own free will and choice. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I have read this statement, or I have had it read to me by my attorney, and I understand its contents and adopt each statement in it as my own. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I was not under the influence of any drugs, medication, or intoxicants which impair my judgment when I decided to plead guilty. I am not presently under the influence of any drug, medication, or intoxicants which would impair my judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I believe myself to be of sound and discerning mind and to be mentally capable of understanding these proceedings and the consequences of my plea. I am free of any mental disease, defect, or impairment that would prevent me from understanding what I am doing or from knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily entering my plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b66 Not one month later, Ciccolelli moved to withdraw his guilty pleas. In his written motion, he argued that \"he was not thinking clearly on July 3, 2017 as he was still under the influence of drugs or alcohol consumed prior to his booking on June 23, 2017.\" At the plea-withdrawal hearing, Ciccolelli again stated that he \"did not understand the thing [his] attorney had been explaining to [him] throughout that whole process due to the large amounts of drugs that [his] mind and body were coming off of.\" Ciccolelli did not identify what drugs he had consumed or when precisely he took them. He also did not present the court with any evidence to support his claim that his ability to understand the plea agreement was adversely affected by his prior drug use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b67 The district court denied the motion. It viewed Ciccolelli's motion to withdraw as being \"based on the fact that [he] believe[s] that [he was] still under the influence of drugs 10 days or so-many days after [he] had been arrested-and ... that, therefore, the plea[s] could not have been knowing and voluntary.\" The court then noted that before it accepted his guilty pleas, it \"asked [Ciccolelli] specifically if [he was] under the influence of any alcohol or drugs\" and \"if [he] understood what was happening.\" The court stated that \"at no time did [Ciccolelli] indicate that [he] did not understand\" the plea agreement and that Ciccolelli \"signed the statement\" after he \"went through it carefully, paragraph by paragraph and agreed before [he] entered the plea[s] that every paragraph was true.\" The court found that what Ciccolelli said during the plea hearing was \"more persuasive and more credible\" than what he argued in his motion to withdraw. Further, it found that there \"were no indications that [Ciccolelli was] under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time that [he] entered into the plea[s].\" Accordingly, the court denied Ciccolelli's motion to withdraw his guilty pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b68 After ordering a presentence investigation report, the court sentenced Ciccolelli to two concurrent prison terms not to exceed five years. Ciccolelli appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b69 Ciccolelli contends that the district court should have granted his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas because \"he demonstrated that he did not enter knowing and voluntary pleas.\" We will reverse a district court's \"ruling on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea only when we are convinced that the court has abused its discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ciccolelli confirmed at the plea hearing that he was \"thinking clearly\" and not \"taking any medication or anything\" that would affect his ability to understand the proceedings. And in the Plea Statement, he represented that he \"was not under the influence of any drugs, medication, or intoxicants which would impair [his] judgment\" and that he was \"of sound and discerning mind.\" Although \"the defendant's own assurances of his capacity are not conclusive, courts have commonly relied on the defendant's own assurance ... that the defendant's mind is clear.\"\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.
