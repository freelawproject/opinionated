(Cherry Creek) in Billings, Montana. Strauser paid $2,500 down and financed the remainder through an Installment Sales Contract and Security Agreement (Agreement), which Cherry Creek later assigned to RJC Investment, Inc. (RJC Investment). The Agreement required Strauser to make monthly payments of $482 with a variable interest rate over a fifteen-year period and to pay a $50 late fee for any late payments. Between 2009 and 2016, Strauser alleges that RJC Investment assessed $3,300 in late fees against her and failed to disclose the amount of the finance charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Strauser filed an action in District Court seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (UDJA), Title 27, chapter 8, MCA, clarifying her rights and obligations under the Agreement. Strauser further asserted that provisions of the Montana Retail Installment Sales Act (RISA), Title 31, chapter 1, part 2, MCA, (2007), barred RJC Investment from collecting fees under the Agreement because Cherry Creek and RJC Investment had violated RISA by failing to disclose the finance charge and collecting excessive late fees. RJC Investment moved to dismiss Strauser's complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). On March 29, 2018, the District Court granted RJC Investment's M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion on the basis that the 2009 version of RISA did not confer a private cause of action.

Specifically, Strauser alleges that RJC Investment has already unlawfully assessed $3,300 in late fees against her and refused to disclose the finance charge. She seeks a declaratory judgment to determine whether the Agreement lawfully requires her to continue to pay the fees in question. Strauser presents an existing and genuine dispute. Because Strauser and RJC Investment have existing rights and interests under the Agreement, and the District Court's judgment will clarify those legal rights and obligations, Strauser presents a justiciable controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

Without such a remedy, the purchaser under a retail installment contract would be forced to pay the assessed fees even if the assessed fees violated Montana law, or default and risk the loss of his or her home.

RJC took no legal action against Strauser pursuant to the Agreement, but Strauser nevertheless sued RJC for failure to comply with RISA. Strauser sought a declaratory judgment that RJC could not collect finance charges because RJC allegedly violated RISA; she wanted the court to determine what amount remained owing under the Agreement. Strauser's claims for relief arise solely from RISA's various administrative provisions. The Legislature set forth a remedy for alleged RISA violations in \u00a7 31-1-212(2), MCA, which provides, \"A retail buyer having reason to believe that [RISA] has been violated may file with the [D]epartment a written complaint setting forth the details of the alleged violation ....\" Strauser never filed a complaint with the Department. We clearly held in\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19, that the Legislature did not provide a private cause of action to determine whether alleged RISA violations had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b626 Nonetheless, following a misapplication of the UDJA and\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   , the Court orders the District Court to \"clarify whether the Agreement obligates Strauser\n   <em>\n    to pay the finance charge and late fees\n   </em>\n   assessed pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, which Strauser\n   <em>\n    may rely upon in the event of a default action filed against her\n   </em>\n   .\" Opinion, \u00b6 20 (emphasis added). The Court remands this case \"to the District Court to issue a declaratory judgment\n   <em>\n    construing the legal rights and obligations of the parties under the Agreement\n   </em>\n   .\" Opinion, \u00b6 22. Not only is it the Department's legislatively delegated authority to decide whether the parties violated RISA, i.e., whether the parties adhered to their legal rights and obligations under the Agreement, but the Court ignores the fundamental prerequisite to invoking the authority of a court: a justiciable controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b627 To begin, we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   that the purpose of RISA was to establish an administrative process which authorizes \"the Department to enforce its provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12, 15. We explained the Department, in order to carry out RISA's provisions, may: adopt rules necessary to implement RISA provisions; perform investigations it considers necessary to ensure compliance with RISA; require licensure to engage in the business of a sales finance company; and deny, suspend, or revoke licenses for failing to comply with RISA provisions, defrauding any retail buyer to the buyer's damage, or fraudulent misrepresentation. Thus, Strauser's claim that she may utilize a declaratory judgment to determine (1) her rights under RISA in the context of the Agreement, and (2) \"the validity of a contract\n   defense\" pursuant to RISA, should be seen for what it is: an attempt to bypass the Department's statutory responsibilities for enforcement of RISA and obtain an advisory opinion from this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b628 Aside from the Court's flawed attempt to distinguish an action under the UDJA from a complaint resolving an alleged RISA violation, the Court commits another, perhaps more fundamental, error. Before a court may exercise jurisdiction under the UDJA, a justiciable controversy must exist. \"Courts do not function, even under the [UDJA], to determine speculative matters, to enter anticipatory judgments, to declare social status, to give advisory opinions or to give abstract opinions.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston Lakeshore Tract Owners Against Annexation, Inc. v.

Finally, by ordering the trial court to render an opinion on the application of\n   various RISA provisions to the instant facts and Agreement, Opinion, \u00b6 22, the Court is ordering relief inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Somers\n   </em>\n   and instructing the trial court to issue a speculative advisory opinion.

The complaint alleges that she has paid $49,751.81 in principal and interest on the $47,500 initial balance and that RJC illegally has assessed late payments of $3,300 and continues to assess such fees unlawfully. Attached to her complaint is the Promissory Note she signed, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   If default be made in the payment when due of any part or installment of interest, then the whole sum of principal and interest shall become immediately due and payable at the option of [RJC], without notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b637 It also states that, in the event of default, the holder of the Note may recover necessary expenses incurred in collecting the balance, including reasonable attorney fees, \"whether incurred through\n   litigation or otherwise.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without notice or an opportunity to contest the legality of the alleged assessed late fees, Strauser could risk loss of her home and exposure to added fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b638 Strauser does, however, have the opportunity to contest the legality of the late fees through the administrative remedy provided by RISA.

Declaratory rulings under this section are subject to judicial review \"in the same manner as decisions or orders in contested cases.\" Section 2-4-501, MCA.

Ignoring them altogether, the Court does not distinguish or overrule any of the cases requiring administrative exhaustion, nor does it suggest how Strauser's complaint meets any articulated exception to the requirement or why its ruling will not permit other prospective declaratory judgment litigants \"to skip the administrative process.\"\n   <em>\n    Mt. Water Co.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Consistent with our precedent, I would hold that Strauser cannot file a declaratory judgment action until she first seeks administrative relief under RISA. If the Department refuses or fails to act on her complaint, she may file a declaratory judgment action in District Court; if the Department issues a ruling adverse to her, she may petition for judicial review. She has the ability to pursue relief without jeopardizing her home or waiting for RJC to issue a notice of default or take other action against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b643 On that basis, I would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Justice Jim Rice joins in the dissenting Opinion of Justice Baker.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    It is also clear that Strauser has changed her theory on appeal from what she raised in District Court. In District Court, Strauser sought a determination of what amount was owing under the Agreement, thus pleading a private cause of action under RISA. On appeal, Strauser pursues a theory that she is entitled to know her rights under the contract and, accordingly, whether she has a legal defense based on RISA violations. The Court errs when it adopts Strauser's circular and misguided reasoning. Whether Strauser pursues her allegations offensively or defensively, resolution of Strauser's claims is first committed to the Department.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
