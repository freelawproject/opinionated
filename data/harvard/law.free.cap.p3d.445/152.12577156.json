NATURE OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   Christopher T. Shanahan appeals from a district court decision denying his motion to correct an allegedly illegal sentence imposed in 1997. Shanahan argues that his indeterminate life sentence, with the first thirty-five years fixed, for a murder he committed as a\n   juvenile in 1995 is equivalent to a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Therefore, he asserts that under\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) and persuasive precedent from other states, he is entitled to a new sentencing where his youth and its attendant characteristics may be properly considered. Otherwise, he argues, his sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. The district court denied the motion on the basis that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable to Shanahan's sentence and, even if it applied, the sentencing court heard testimony regarding his age and mental health prior to sentencing him. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In the Fall of 1995, Shanahan and two friends devised a scheme to rob a convenience store in Grant, Idaho, and use the money to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada. Once there, they planned to join a gang and lead a life of crime. Shanahan was fifteen years old at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The day before the robbery was to occur, Shanahan explained the plan to other friends and said that, if necessary, he would shoot the store clerk. He apparently believed that killing someone would lend itself to his initiation into a gang. In an effort to dissuade him from his intended course of action, some of his friends offered him money for the trip to Las Vegas, but he refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The next day, Shanahan and two friends obtained guns, ammunition, gloves, and gas cans from their homes and Shanahan drove them to the store. Before entering the store, they discussed each person's role and Shanahan agreed that he would shoot the clerk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After waiting for two people to leave the store, Shanahan signaled to one of his friends to enter. His friend's role was to distract the clerk so that she would not activate any alarms. Shanahan then put on gloves, so as not to leave fingerprints, and entered the store with a .22 caliber sawed-off rifle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inside, he joined his friend who was in the aisle next to where the clerk, Fidela Tomchak, was stocking a beverage cooler. From there, Shanahan positioned himself behind a rack of potato chips approximately three feet from Mrs. Tomchak, lifted the rifle, lowered it briefly, and then lifted it again and shot her in the back of the head, killing her. Although he later denied that his action was racially motivated, he referred to Mrs. Tomchak as a \"Mexican bitch\" while talking with his friends the night before he shot her. After killing her, Shanahan went to where her body lay, looked at her, and then proceeded to scan the store for witnesses, whom he testified he would have also killed. Upon finding no one else in the store, Shanahan went to the cash register, removed just over $200, stole some cigarettes, and ran out of the store. The three boys then drove to Las Vegas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The boys' plan fell apart shortly after they arrived when one of them became homesick and they decided to return to Idaho together. However, while driving back, they were stopped in Utah and arrested. One of Shanahan's friends confessed to the crimes, and as a result, Shanahan was charged with first degree murder and robbery with a sentencing enhancement because he used a firearm in the commission of the crimes. Shanahan pled guilty to the charges in exchange for the State dismissing the enhancement, agreeing not to seek the death penalty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and recommending concurrent sentences. Shanahan then filed a motion seeking to be sentenced pursuant to the Juvenile Corrections Act. Given the egregious nature of his crimes, the\n   motion was denied. At sentencing, the trial court considered a presentence investigation report and heard testimony from Mrs. Tomchak's husband, daughter, step-son, and the lead investigator on the case, as well as from Shanahan's mother, sister, and friends. Additionally, two mental health experts testified about Shanahan's psychological profile, which included evidence that he was significantly immature for his age, struggled from his parents' divorce and his father's emotional absence, and was susceptible to peer influences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After extensive fact-finding, the district court \"focused primarily on the age of the defendant in determining the death penalty was not an appropriate sentencing option.\" In its analysis of the potential for Shanahan's rehabilitation, the district court found that due to his young age, there was hope that he could \"eventually become a contributing member of society.\" However, given the heinous nature of the crime committed, the district court sentenced Shanahan to concurrent unified life terms with thirty-five years fixed for the murder and ten years fixed for the robbery. Shanahan subsequently filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Idaho Criminal Rule 35. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On his first appeal, Shanahan argued that the district court abused its discretion in declining to sentence him as a juvenile, that his sentence amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, and that even if his sentences were not cruel and unusual, they were an abuse of discretion. The Court of Appeals rejected all of Shanahan's arguments and affirmed the district court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Shanahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"882670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/133/896/\">\n    133 Idaho 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"882670\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/133/896/\">\n    994 P.2d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ct. App. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2017, over twenty years after he was originally sentenced, Shanahan filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to I.C.R. 35(a) on the basis that his sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (as made retroactive by\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

The State objected on the basis that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   does not apply because Shanahan was not sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, or its functional equivalent. On November 28, 2017, the district court issued a memorandum decision denying Shanahan's motion. The court noted that, to the extent that the sentencing court considered Shanahan's age and mental health as factors weighing against imposing the death penalty, such consideration was improper, as Shanahan was not eligible for the death penalty as a minor. Nonetheless, it denied the motion on the basis that, even if\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies to Shanahan's indeterminate life sentence, the sentencing court heard and properly considered testimony regarding Shanahan's age and mental health before sentencing him. Shanahan timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This appeal presents an issue of first impression in Idaho: whether a juvenile offender convicted of homicide who receives an indeterminate life sentence with a long fixed term is entitled to a sentencing hearing at which the factors enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   are considered. This appeal also presents the issue of whether such a sentence, independent of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Shanahan argues that since he was sentenced in 1997, material changes in constitutional law concerning the sentencing of juvenile offenders render the fixed portion of his sentence unconstitutional. He also argues that, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he is\n   entitled to a hearing at which his youth and its attendant characteristics are considered when sentencing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether state sentencing schemes that mandate life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile homicide offenders violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    567 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After reflecting upon a line of cases in which the Court determined that \"children are constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing,\" the Court concluded that, \"[b]ecause juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform ... 'they are less deserving of the most severe punishments.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Specifically, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Graham, Roper,\n   </em>\n   and our individualized sentencing decisions make clear that a judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing the harshest possible penalty for juveniles. By requiring that all children convicted of homicide receive lifetime incarceration without possibility of parole, regardless of their age and age-related characteristics and the nature of their crimes, the mandatory-sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 489,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, before sentencing a juvenile to life without the possibility of parole,\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requires consideration of the defendant's \"chronological age and its hallmark features-among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, a sentencing court must \"tak[e] into account the family and home environment that surrounds [the juvenile] ... from which he cannot usually extricate himself-no matter how brutal or dysfunctional,\" as well as \"the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court also lamented the fact that mandatory life without parole sentencing schemes \"ignore[ ] that [the juvenile] might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth-for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    at 477-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to impose a categorical bar on life-without-parole sentences for juveniles convicted of homicide.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ct. App. Aug. 5, 2014) (thirty-five years fixed for a fifteen-year-old defendant not a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life sentence). In a case that closely resembles Shanahan's, the Supreme Court of Wyoming recently held that, because the defendant received life with a fixed term of thirty-five years for first degree murder, and is eligible for parole when he is approximately fifty years old, his sentence \"is not a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life sentence and does not violate the Eighth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Sen v.

Without any explanation or rationale as to why Shanahan would have an unusually short life expectancy, he argues that there is an \"unacceptably high risk\" that he will die in prison without being afforded an opportunity for release. However, even if he had provided any evidentiary\n   support for this argument, we are inclined to follow the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Sen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Null\n   </em>\n   and decline to consider \"specific projections of the defendant's life expectancy as a factor to be used in reviewing a juvenile's sentence,\" as we \"[do] 'not believe the determination of whether the principles of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ... apply in a given case should turn on the niceties of epidemiology, genetic analysis, or actuarial sciences in determining precise mortality dates.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12340900\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/390/769/#p777\">\n    390 P.3d at 776-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Null,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7055640\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/836/41/#p45\">\n    836 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   71 ). Although Shanahan will be middle-aged when he becomes eligible for release, he still has a meaningful opportunity to obtain release-and much of his life ahead of him-if he can demonstrate that he is sufficiently rehabilitated and qualifies for parole. The Court is not satisfied that such a result is unjust under the circumstances of this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For these reasons, we are disinclined to accept Shanahan's invitation to draw the line for a juvenile's fixed life sentence at thirty-five years or less. Accordingly, we hold that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   does not apply and, thus, Shanahan's sentence does not violate the Eighth Amendment under\n   <em>\n    Miller's\n   </em>\n   rationale. More importantly, because Shanahan did not receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole or the equivalent thereof, he is not \"similarly situated\" to those who have received such sentences, and thus, the alleged lack of consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors in his case does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Shanahan's claim that his sentence is grossly disproportionate and otherwise violates the Eighth Amendment also fails.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We next turn to Shanahan's argument that, even if he did not receive a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life sentence, his sentence is a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Shanahan argues that, regardless of whether his sentence equates to a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   life sentence, it violates the Eighth Amendment because it is \"disproportionate given the attendant characteristics of youth present in this case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, he asks the Court to extend the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   to all juvenile offenders who are prosecuted as adults, even where they are not sentenced to life without parole or its equivalent. The State alleges that Shanahan already raised similar arguments before the Court of Appeals in 1999, and therefore, he is barred under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   from arguing them again before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    \"Res judicata\n   </em>\n   consists of claim and issue preclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The district court also specifically noted Shanahan's life history-his parents' divorce, his lack of a role model and his low self-esteem. Finally, the district court noted\n    that, although Shanahan was suffering from depression at the time of the crime, he was capable of distinguishing between right and wrong and had the ability to conform his behavior to societal standards.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    Although the sentences in the instant case are severe, the Court cannot hold that they are excessive under any reasonable view of the facts.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <em>\n     Shanahan,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"882670\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/133/896/\">\n     133 Idaho at 901-02\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"882670\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/133/896/\">\n     994 P.2d at 1064-65\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Concerning the Eighth Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court explained in\n    <em>\n     Miller.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    The Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions. That right, we have explained, flows from the basic precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to both the offender and the offense. As we noted the last time we considered life-without-parole sentences imposed on juveniles, the concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment. And we view that concept less through a historical prism than according to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     567 U.S. at 469-70\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 2455\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal citations and quotations omitted).
