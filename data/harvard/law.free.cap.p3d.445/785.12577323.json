We address the following issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Issue One: Whether the District Court erred in its application of strict liability.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Issue Two: Whether the District Court erred when it allowed the Coveys to claim the full amount of damages for the increased cost to the driveway project.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Issue Three: Whether the District Court erred by allowing evidence regarding the diminution of the Coveys' property value.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Issue Four: Whether the Coveys made improper closing arguments regarding the Brishkas' alleged negligence.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Issue Five: Whether the District Court erred when it excluded evidence of other causes of the pond breach.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b63 In January of 2000, the Brishkas purchased property on Big Mountain Road in Whitefish. The Brishka property included a 4.5 million-gallon man-made fish pond built by a previous owner. In 2005, the Coveys purchased a plot of land on Whitefish Lake, downhill from the Brishka property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 In 2009, the Coveys commenced plans to construct a home on their property. They hired landscape architects, engineers, and excavators to design and build a driveway to access the property. Prior to beginning construction, and as part of their investigation, the engineers dug test pits, which revealed no water, and concluded the soils on the property were dry. The engineers noted a culvert existed uphill from a neighboring property, but the engineering investigation revealed water did not historically drain through it. The excavators similarly concluded the soil conditions were dry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 Due to the steep terrain, it was necessary for the driveway project to traverse the lots of adjacent property owners, Cora Belle and Patrick Montalban (the Montalbans). The initial driveway bid was $233,000. The Coveys contracted with all of the necessary parties and paid all of the upfront costs for the driveway construction. The Coveys testified that they had an informal agreement with the Montalbans to be reimbursed a pro rata share of the driveway project costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 During a large storm on August 2-3, 2013, the Brishkas' pond breached its banks and water flowed downslope. The water carried boulders, trees, and other debris downhill and carved large channels into the hillside. Following the pond breach, the Coveys conducted additional surveys. The engineers and excavators concluded the ground was saturated, water was flowing through the culvert that historically was dry, and measurements revealed historical drainage patterns\n   were greatly altered by the pond breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b67 On July 28, 2016, the Coveys brought suit against the Brishkas for negligence, nuisance, strict liability, and trespass. On September 8, 2017, the Coveys filed an amended complaint. Following the Brishkas' pond breach, the Coveys alleged the driveway construction bid was increased to $498,000. The Brishkas responded that they were not responsible for the damage to the Coveys' property and, as one of their asserted defenses, contended that another party was the cause of the Coveys' damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 In response to discovery requests, the Coveys described their damages as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [The Coveys] suffered damages in the amount of $265,512.87. This is the cost of the road construction, drainage features, engineering\n   and design to mitigate the groundwater and surface water flows resulting from the pond breach. The amount was calculated by subtracting the amount of the original competitive bid-awarded prior to the pond failure-from the final completed expense of the Project.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [The Coveys] also claim emotional distress damages for the interference with the use of their property. This is a claim for general damages that will be determined by a jury based on the evidence presented and thus no calculation has been made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Pretrial Order set forth the Coveys' damages as the increased cost of the driveway project and all damages \"allowed by law including economic, tort damages, damages to property, and emotional distress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b69 Both parties filed several motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   . The Coveys moved to exclude, among other things, evidence at trial regarding road construction by the Montana Department of Transportation (DOT) that allegedly affected the drainage into the Brishkas' pond. The Brishkas moved to prohibit the Coveys from claiming the entire amount of $265,512.87 for the increased cost of the driveway project. The Coveys opposed that motion and sought to preclude the Brishkas from arguing at trial that the Coveys had not suffered the entire amount of $265,512.87 for the increased cost of the driveway project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b610 From April 2-4, 2018, the District Court presided over a three-day jury trial. Immediately prior to the start of the trial, the District Court orally ruled on the parties' motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   . The District Court granted the Coveys' request to exclude testimony that would apportion any liability to DOT. The District Court also determined the Brishkas could not introduce evidence that the Montalbans were sharing the increased cost of the driveway project with the Coveys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 At trial, Michael Covey, over objection, testified that he was solely responsible for paying the entire amount of the increased cost of the driveway project. Michael Covey also offered testimony, over objection, speculating as to a decrease in the property value following the pond breach. The Coveys presented expert testimony that an outlet culvert that drained from the Brishkas' pond was obstructed by a berm on one side of the pond, making a pond breach more likely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 At the close of trial, the Coveys withdrew their trespass, nuisance, and negligence claims, preserving only the strict liability claim. The District Court analyzed whether the Brishkas' pond was an abnormally dangerous activity or condition such that strict liability should apply based on two lines of case law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It appears to me that there are two separate lines of cases that address the situation, one is embodied in\n   <em>\n    Dutton\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Rocky Mt. Phosphates\n   </em>\n   ... [a case that held] that impoundment of material on your property the property owner can be strictly liable for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Certainly in this case this was an impoundment of water on the property .... [Next,] the Montana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Matkovic\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil\n   </em>\n   ... adopted the Restatement Second of Tort's [d]efinition of Strict Liability stating: 'One who carries on an abnormally dangerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person, land or chattels of another resulting from the activity though he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm; two, the strict liability is limited to the kind of harm the possibility of which makes the activity abnormally dangerous.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    City of Helena\n   </em>\n   , ... the [C]ourt articulated the factors for determining whether an abnormally dangerous condition exists, the same ones as adopted in\n   <em>\n    Matkovic\n   </em>\n   and Restatement Second....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The District Court applied each factor from the Restatement (Second) of Torts to the condition of the Brishkas' pond and concluded that \"maintenance of the pond constitute[d] an abnormally dangerous condition\" warranting application of strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 During closing argument, the Coveys' counsel discussed testimony regarding the blocked outlet culvert and the berm on the Brishkas' property and used this testimony to cast doubt on Alexander Brishka's credibility as a witness. The District Court overruled the Brishkas' objection that the evidence about the blocked culvert and berm were no longer relevant for the only remaining claim: strict liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b614 The District Court instructed the jury that the Coveys brought a claim for strict liability, and that it had ruled that the Brishkas are strictly liable for any harm caused by the breach of their pond. The District Court then instructed the jury that it would be analyzing only the issues of causation and damages. The District Court instructed that if the jury found the Brishkas' pond caused the Coveys' harm, it \"must determine the amount of damages that will reasonably and fairly compensate the [Coveys] for the harm caused by the [Brishkas].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 The District Court gave the following instruction regarding assessment of damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   For claims involving damage to real property, you may award damages for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) the difference between the value of the land before the harm and the value after the harm, or at [the Coveys'] election in an appropriate case, the cost of restoration that has been or may be reasonably incurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) the loss of use of the land; and\n   (3) discomfort and annoyance to [the Coveys as occupants].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Neither party objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b616 After instructing the jury, the District Court submitted the following special verdict form to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) The Court has found the Brishka Trust strictly liable for all harm caused by a breach of its pond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) Did the Brishka Trust's liability cause damages to the Covey Trust?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (3) What is the amount of damages suffered by the Covey Trust?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (4) Did the Brishka Trust's liability cause damage to Mike and Stacey Covey?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (5) What is the amount of damages suffered by Mike and Stacey Covey?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b617 The jury deliberated and reached a verdict in favor of the Coveys. The jury found that the Brishkas' liability caused the Coveys to suffer damages. The jury awarded damages of $211,563.40 to the Covey Trust and damages of $101,667 to Michael and Stacey Covey. On May 18, 2018, the District Court entered its written judgment setting out the jury award and, additionally, awarded the Coveys costs in the amount of $2,053.82. The Brishkas filed a Motion for a New Trial, along with a supporting brief and response. The Brishkas' Motion was deemed denied in August 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b618 A district court's determination of whether an activity or condition is abnormally dangerous such that strict liability should apply is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Chambers v.

The District Court analyzed the application of strict liability to the pond under\n   <em>\n    Dutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Matkovic\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b626 The Brishkas argue the District Court erred by failing to apply the correct standard to strict liability for abnormally dangerous activities when it found that the Brishkas' negligence created an abnormally dangerous condition. The Brishkas also argue the District Court erred by failing to limit the scope of strict liability to the kind of harm which makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The Brishkas contend that the danger associated with having a fish pond on the side of a mountain is the potential that a \"swale of water\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   will impact downhill property owners should the pond breach. Instead, the harm caused-a change in historical drainage patterns on the mountain-was not the\n   type of harm strict liability for this abnormally dangerous activity was intended to protect against. Finally, the Brishkas argue that the District Court erred by failing to recognize and apply the Common Enemy Doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b627 The Coveys respond that the District Court correctly found the condition of the Brishkas' pond was an abnormally dangerous condition subject to strict liability.

The District Court correctly concluded: factor (a), \"existence of a high degree of risk\" to persons, property, or chattel of others weighed in favor of constituting an abnormally dangerous activity, as testified to by the Brishkas and other expert witnesses; factor (b), \"likelihood that harm results from it will be great,\" weighed in favor of finding an abnormally dangerous activity, as evinced by testimony at trial and the damage to the Coveys' and the Montalbans' properties; factor (c), \"inability to eliminate the risk by exercise of care\" was held in balance because \"through the exercise of care had the culvert not been obstructed ... or a spillway been installed, as was advised, the risk [of a breach] could have been eliminated at least to some extent\"; factor (d), whether the activity or condition was a matter of \"common usage\" or not, weighed in favor of finding an abnormally dangerous condition because retention and maintenance of a pond of this size was not of common usage; factor (e), \"inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it was carried on,\" was held in balance-although evidence regarding this factor was not presented, the primary purpose of the pond was for personal fishing by the Brishkas; and factor (f), \"value to the community,\" weighed in favor of finding an abnormally dangerous condition because the pond offered little, if any, community value and any value was outweighed by the dangerous attributes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 519 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b629 The Brishkas take particular issue with the District Court's analysis of factor (c): inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of care. However, in pointing out the culvert or spillway options, the District Court was merely stating that the risk from a pond-bank breach could be mitigated by the installation of such features. Regardless of any hypothetical mitigation, it is clear such care was not exercised. After weighing all of the factors and the risks of having a 4.5-million-gallon man-made pond on the side of a mountain, uphill from others' personal property, that had the potential to cause catastrophic damage if the walls were breached, the District Court concluded the pond was abnormally dangerous and presented a great\n   risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. Accordingly, the District Court applied the correct standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b630 Additionally, the discharge of water from an uphill pond breach that damages the downhill property owner's land is exactly the type of harm that makes owning a fish pond on the side of a mountain a potentially abnormally dangerous activity or condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16 ;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Dutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5252687\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/151/54/#p67\">\n    151 Mont. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5252687\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/151/54/#p67\">\n    438 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   680 ; Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 519.

Unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Dew\n   </em>\n   , the Montalbans were never party to the lawsuit, did not have a co-tenant or agency relationship with the Coveys, and were not in any danger of having their due process rights infringed upon when the Coveys sought recovery of the full increase in the cost of the driveway project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4582364\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/258/114/#p128\">\n    258 Mont. at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4582364\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/258/114/#p128\">\n    852 P.2d at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   jury instructions and verdict form all discussed general damages, and both parties in closing argument described \"three kinds of damages,\" including diminution of property value or \"damages to the property\" generally.

At trial, the District Court excluded testimony about the increase in drainage into the pond due to DOT road construction, concluding such evidence \"squarely place[d] responsibility on [DOT]....\" The District Court limited the Brishkas' expert testimony to: describing the outflow culvert, generally; the structural integrity of the pond redesign; methods for measuring flow rates; current rates; and types of precipitation and increased flow to the pond due to the storm.
