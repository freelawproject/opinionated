We affirm and address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Did the Water Court err by entering conclusions in contradiction to the pretrial\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    order and violate Fort Peck's due process rights?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Water Claim 40E 182897-00\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is a municipal water right claimed by Fort Peck, which lies on the northeast end of Fort Peck Reservoir, southeast of Glasgow, and has a present population of 251 people. Fort Peck came into existence in 1934, during construction of the Fort Peck Dam, when the town was built to house workers on the dam project. Fort Peck and the surrounding area then reached a population of over 10,000 people, and local amenities included a hotel, theatre, hospital, school, stores, dormitories, bunkhouses, as well as homes. Fort Peck's population dropped dramatically after the dam was completed, and the town no longer boasts a school, hospital or grocery store. Although evidence varied, it appears Fort Peck's population has also suffered a gradual decline since 1990. The town's hotel and theatre continue to open seasonally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Fort Peck originally claimed a volume of 1,500 acre-feet per year (AFY) based upon an assumed continuous, year-round diversion of 930 gallons per minute. During the claim examination process, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC) added an issue remark to the claim questioning the claimed volume. The Water Court ordered Fort Peck to meet with the DNRC to attempt resolution of the issue remark, and ordered the DNRC to file a memorandum with its recommendations for resolution. The parties were unable to resolve the remark, and the DNRC filed a recommendation that the volume on the claim be set at 206 AFY, based upon available evidence. The Water\n   Court joined the State of Montana pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-248(7)(a), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its order joining the State, the Water Court stated that \"[t]he prima facie status of Fort Peck's claimed volume has been overcome by evidence showing it has not used that volume for the last twenty-five years and has no plan to do so in the future,\" but reserved for trial a ruling on the presumption of nonabandonment for municipal water rights claims under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA. At the request of the parties, the Water Court stayed the case pending a decision by this Court in\n   <em>\n    City of Helena v.

The State of Montana agrees it has the burden of proof to show that the City of Fort Peck's volume is something other than the 1,500 AFY claimed on the Statement of Claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b66 The case proceeded to trial before the Water Court in July 2018, and the Court entered its Order Regarding Volume and Order Closing Case in October 2018. The Court therein summarized the parties' trial positions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Prior to trial, the parties filed a joint pretrial order. Although the parties disagree on the volume Fort Peck should receive, they agree Fort Peck is entitled to receive a volume equal to historical beneficial use plus reasonably anticipated future needs.

In the State's view, the amount is 206 AFY or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b67 The Court concluded that Fort Peck qualified for the presumption of nonabandonment, that the presumption was overcome by the State, and that Fort Peck was entitled to a volume of 171 AFY \"for current use and reasonably foreseeable future use.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b68 Fort Peck appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b69 We apply the same standards of review to decisions of the Water Court as we do the district court.\n   <em>\n    In re Crow Water Compact\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053185\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/382/46/\">\n    2015 MT 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053185\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/382/46/\">\n    382 Mont. 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053185\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/382/46/\">\n    364 P.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Civ. P. 16. It emphasizes the parties' joint contention that Fort Peck was entitled to a volume reflecting its actual historical beneficial use plus a volume for reasonably anticipated future needs, the agreed fact that Fort Peck's historical beneficial use was 223 AFY, and the State's contention that Fort Peck had abandoned the portion of its claim that\n   <em>\n    exceeded\n   </em>\n   its historical beneficial use and anticipated future needs. Fort Peck offers, \"[s]tated differently, the only issue at trial was how much additional water, over and above the 223 AFY volume, as agreed by the\n   parties, is necessary for Fort Peck's reasonably anticipated future needs.\" Fort Peck argues the Water Court also erred by basing the volume determination of 171 AFY on the town's\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   use, instead of actual\n   <em>\n    historical\n   </em>\n   use, in addition to its anticipated future use, as stated in the pretrial order. As relief, Fort Peck asks that we simply order the volume of its claim to be 223 AFY based upon the measure of the town's historical use, and call it a day. Fort Peck's argument is well-articulated, but there are additional governing principles at work here that persuade us to reject it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b612 Under M. R. Civ.

The stated issues of law included whether the State \"met its burden of overcoming the presumption of nonabandonment pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA,\n   <em>\n    for any portion\n   </em>\n   of\" Fort Peck's claim, and, correspondingly, whether Fort Peck had \"abandoned\n   <em>\n    any portion\n   </em>\n   of\" its claim (emphasis added). Although Fort Peck may well have read these phrases as limited to the portion of its claim in excess of a baseline consisting of its historical and future uses, given the joint contention, the Water Court read the pretrial order more broadly. In its order adopting the pretrial order, the Water Court clarified that Fort Peck was claiming that \"the correct volume for its right is 773 AFY,\" while the State had the burden to prove the volume was \"\n   <em>\n    something other than\n   </em>\n   the 1,500 AFY claimed on the Statement of Claim.\" (Emphasis added). Thus, in setting \"the subsequent course of the action,\"\n   <em>\n    Byrum\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 39, the Water Court clearly provided notice to the parties of a broader inquiry. Neither party raised concerns with the Water Court's\n   order. In its final order, while issued after trial, the Water Court reaffirmed this view of the proceeding, explaining the parties' trial positions as follows: \"In Fort Peck's view, 773 acre-feet per year fairly encompasses historical beneficial use plus reasonably anticipated\n   future needs. In the State's view, the amount is\n   <em>\n    206 AFY or less\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b614 Importantly, \u00a7 85-2-227, MCA, the statute establishing presumptive nonabandonment of municipality water rights, which is at the core of this case, provides that \"a water judge may determine all or part of an existing water right to be abandoned based on a consideration of all admissible evidence that is relevant, including, without limitation, evidence relating to acts or intent occurring in whole or in part after July 1, 1973.\" Section 85-2-227(3), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   This statute provides for a broader consideration in presumptive nonabandonment cases, gives notice of the contours of the issue before the Water Court, and is consistent with the interconnected nature of water rights on a common source and the general need to preserve the resource. Fundamentally, the Water Court cannot grant a volume that is greater than the beneficial use established by the evidence,\n   <em>\n    McDonald v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2502522\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/220/519/#p534\">\n    220 Mont. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534-35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2502522\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/220/519/#p534\">\n    722 P.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608 (1986), subject to, of course, in cases such as this, application of the presumption of nonabandonment provided to municipalities under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 85-2-227(3) - (4), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b615 This discussion also illustrates the flaw in Fort Peck's argument that the Water Court erred in considering the town's current use despite the pretrial order's reliance on historical use. The statute uniquely requires the abandonment inquiry to include, \"without limitation,\" consideration of uses that occurred after July 1, 1973, and\n   necessarily requires consideration of current as well as future uses. As the Water Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Ordinarily, a water user faced with a long history of nonuse of part of its right would be faced with rebutting a presumption of abandonment. The statute changes the starting position of a municipal claimant that has not used its water right for a prolonged period. A municipality meeting the statute's criteria is entitled to a presumption of nonabandonment.... Abandonment can still be proven if a preponderance of evidence shows that the amount of water claimed is more than the amount needed to satisfy the current use plus normal increases in population over a reasonable period.... [T]he growing cities doctrine embodied in \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA was intended to allow towns like Fort Peck to protect existing uses plus a reasonable amount of water for foreseeable needs....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    See also City of Helena\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 37 (purpose of the Growing Cities Doctrine is to allow municipalities \" 'to obtain appropriations of water that will satisfy the needs resulting from a normal increase in population within a reasonable period of time.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Denver v. Sheriff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2797113\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/105/193/\">\n    105 Colo. 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2797113\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/105/193/\">\n    96 P.2d 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (1939) ). Thus, as the State correctly argues, the statute does not \"make historical beneficial use the touchstone for municipalities,\" and historical use, standing alone, \"does not insulate a claim from a finding of total or partial abandonment.\" As the Water Court noted, this will be advantageous to the typical, growing, municipal claimant, whose claim would not be limited to demonstrable historical use. The difficulty presented for Fort Peck is that its population has been declining and its water use has been declining from historical levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b616 The Water Court held that Fort Peck qualified for the presumption of nonabandonment of its claim under \u00a7 85-2-227(4), MCA, by satisfying the statutory criteria, including obtaining a filtration waiver under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300(f), et seq. However, upon the State's evidentiary\n   showing, the Water Court held that the statutory presumption of nonabandonment of some portion of Fort Peck's claim had been overcome. In determining the correct volume for the claim, the Water Court noted that the town's population had not increased since the filing of its water reservation application in 1991, and that the population of the surrounding areas, including the City of Glasgow, has also been in decline. The town's expert forecasted a population growth rate increase of 1.07% per year beginning in 2020, which would result in a population of 382 by 2055, but the Water Court found \"no credible data indicating when the town's future population will exceed 1,200 people, if ever,\" which is the\n   population that could live in a \"full build-out of the town,\" including vacant platted lots and currently undeveloped space, predicating the town's claim to future needs of 550 AFY.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Water Court found the claim for future use was not credible, and that the town had never used more than one-third of its water treatment plant's capacity. Premised upon evidence it found to be credible of a growth in population to 384 people in forty years, and applying average per capital consumption rates, the Court determined that the claim required a volume of 154 AFY, plus 17 AFY for back-flushing filters of the treatment plant, for a total of 171 AFY.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b617 Fort Peck also argues that its due process rights were violated because it was not provided notice or an opportunity to present evidence concerning current use or abandonment of historical volume. Procedural due process requires both notice and the \"opportunity for a hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Eldorado Coop Canal Co. v.

As discussed above, notice of the issue before the Water Court was provided throughout the proceeding, and as a matter of governing law. Fort Peck was able to participate in every step of the process that resulted in the Water Court's order, including presenting testimony, exhibits, and objecting at trial. Moreover, the record reflects that several exhibits introduced at trial, which both parties stipulated to, demonstrated Fort Peck's current use of water. In addition, three witnesses were questioned about Fort Peck's current use during the trial. Thus, Fort Peck had both notice that their current use might be considered, and the opportunity to present evidence of their use and nonabandonment. We conclude that Fort Peck had adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Water Court entered its final order, both for purposes of the pretrial order and for due process, and that the Water Court's conclusions were correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b618 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   DIRK M.

On January 7, 2016, the Water Court consolidated claims 40E 182897-00 and 40E 165372-00.

R. M. 36.16.101, et seq.

This amount, when added to the 17 AFY for back-flushing the town's water treatment plant, made up 223 AFY. Although not specifically stated in the pretrial order, the State, during the proceeding, argued that 206 AFY should be \"the largest amount of water,\" and that there was evidence \"that would justify and warrant a finding below that figure.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    As the State notes, this claim presented a unique scenario because Fort Peck was formerly owned by the Army Corp of Engineers, and there are no records reflecting pre-1973 use for purposes of assessing \"existing water rights\" defined in \u00a7 85-2-102(12), MCA, as rights existing prior to July 1, 1973.
