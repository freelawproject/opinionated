Upon this appeal the defendants contend that there has been a denial of the right to a speedy trial. Under the circumstances it appears that a hearing should be held to determine what, if any, delay is attributable to the prosecution. Decision withheld and matter remitted to the trial court for a hearing. Greenblott, J. P., Kane, Main, Mikoll and Herlihy, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
