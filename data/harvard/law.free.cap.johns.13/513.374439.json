Coldsn, </em>and the heirs of <em>Abraham. Walton, </em>The first question that arises is, whether any title has be,en shown in the lessors, or any of them. The patent was granted in the year 1764,-to <em>Joseph Walton, </em>and twenty-three other persons, for twenty-four thousand acres of land; In the year 1765, a partition of the patent was made among the then proprietor^ ; and for the purpose of making the partition, a deed in trust was executed to <em>Abraham Walton, </em>who covenanted, on his part, to execute releases in . fee, to the respective owners of the lots, according to. such partition. This deed contained a recital, fhat the parties of the first part ha&amp; by sundry piesne cony\u00e9yances, become seised of the lands granted by the patent, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the proportions'therein mentioned, according to which lot No.; 15., including the premises ip question fell to <em>Cadwallader Colden, </em>who was a party to the deed, and from whom <em>Cadwallader R. Colden </em>derives his title. Eight of the original patentees were parties to this deed ; so that, as to eight twenty-fourth parts of the premises, the title was clearly conveyed to <em>Abraham Walton. </em>It was admitted upon the trial, that the patent was gene-, rally settled, and held underhand according to,.this partition, Thes\u00e9 facts,'after such a lapse of time, are sufficient t\u00f3 presume a title to th\u00e9 whole of the premises in the heirs of <em>Abraham, Walton, </em>or that he had executed the trust, and conveyed in severalty, to the respective owner's;; and in either case, the title would be thus proved in some of the lessors. The principles laid down and-adopted by this court, in <em>Doe v. Phelps, (9 Johns. </em>171.,) and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>(10 <em>Johns. </em>475.,) are. directly in point; and would fully warrant a judgment for the plaintiff, W\u00e9re itmot for the adverse'possession on the, part of the defendant.' The. lessor, <em>Cadwallader R. Colden, </em>can claim nobenefit'from his in* fancy; for the statute, if it has run at all,, began to run in the. lifetime of the ancestor, and the' facts. disclosed upon the tidal show a very strong case of' adverse possession. As. early a*, the year 1775, possession Was taken of one hundred acres of lot; No. 15. under a lease from <em>Anthony Farrington.;' </em>This lease was not produced upon the trial, but its,loss and contents were sufficiently proved, and appeared to be a lease in fee, at a nominal rent. And although- there -Was no legal transfer of the lease to <em>Perkins, </em>yet he, in the year 1778, look possession, claiming under it; and continued such possession, except while it, was interrupted by the war, until the year 1798, when he-sold and conveyed to <em>Solomon Williams, </em>who, in 1803, conveyed to <em>Comstock; </em>and in 1804, <em>Comstock </em>conveyed to the defendant. - These facts' show, very satisfactorily, such an adverse possession as will protect the defendant against the present action,, arid upon this ground alone judgment is given for the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Judgment for the defendant.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b526-6\"> In the .case of the same lessors <em>against John Parish, </em>the premises in question -Were \u00e1 \u2019part of the \u2019land-formerly held by <em>Perkin*\u00bb </em>and judgment was /also given\u2019f\u00f3r.the defendant., on thegr\u00f3und ofa'd ver se possession.
