The defendants' pleaded that they have not, nor at the time of the commencement of this suit, nor at any time before or since, had any lands, tenements, or hereditaments, by descent or devise, from the said <em>John Cantine, </em>deceased; and this they are ready to verify, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-12\">The plaintiffs replied, that they ought not to be barred, &amp;c., because they say that the defendants, after the deathrof <em>John Cantine, </em>and before the day of .exhibiting the bill of them, the plaintiffs had divers lands or tenements by descent or devise j and this they are ready to verify, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AB2\">To this replication the defendants demurred specially, showing for cause of demurrer, that the replication denies the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of the defendants1 plea, yet concludes with an averment and prayer of judgment for debt and damages, whereas it ought to have concluded to the country, &amp;c.

The defendants have demurred, specially, to the replication, because it concludes with an averment, when it should have concluded to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The defendants are sued as heirs and devisees of <em>John </em>Can-<em>tine; </em>under the statute. (1 <em>R. L. </em>316.) The plea states, \u201c that they have not, nor at the time of the commencement of this suit,- nor at any time before, Or since, had any lands, &amp;c., \u2022 by-descent or devise, from the said <em>John Cantine, </em>deceasedconcluding with a verification. The plaintiffs reply, according to the statute, \u201cthat the defendants, after the death of the said <em>John Cantine, </em>their father, and before the day of exhibiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>their bill against the defendants, had divers lands, &amp;e., by d\u00e9* gc-ehtj pr devise, from their fatherconcluding with a verifica-! lion.</p>\n<p id=\"AiY\">If the pl\u00e9adings were tested, by the principles applicable t\u00ae. pleadings iff other cases, the demurrer must prevail; (1 <em>Sound. </em>103. 106. 1 <em>Chitty, </em>615., and 1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>516.;) for it is a general-and established rule, that when there is an affirmative' on one side, and a negative on the other, the conclusion should be to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"ABB\">Cases of this description, however, seem' to be an exception. The 2d section of the act before referred to, is a, transcript \u00f3f the 3 and' 4 <em>W.. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>ch. 5. sect. <em>\u00a15.,. </em>and it renders heirs Who - alien the land before suit brought, liable for the value. The 4th section of .our statute,, which is a transcript of the 6th section of the same <em>British </em>statute, authorizes, the heir to plead <em>riens per descent, </em>at the time of the commencement of the action, and the plaintiff may reply, that the heir had lands,- &amp;e., from his \u00e1ncestor before commencement of such action. These \u2022statutes were intended to remedy the common-law rule, which was, that if the heir had <em>bona fide </em>aliened the lands, which he had by descent, before the commencement of the action, he might discharge himself by pleading that he had nothing by dfescent, at the time of s\u00fcing out the writ or filing the bill. A replication, under the statute, would not precisely meet a plea that'the heir had nothing by descent at the time of the commencement of the action ; wnd, consequently, it has been held, that such a replication, to such a plea, must conclude with a verification ; (2 <em>Saund. </em>n. 4.;) and so are the precedents. (2 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>473. 617.) In this plea it.is alleged\u00bb that the defendants had not, fit the time of the commencement of this suit, <em>'nor at any t\u00edme before or </em>since, any lands, <em>See., </em>by descent,. &amp;e.</p>\n<p id=\"AWe\">It would seem, that a replication that they had assets before the commencement \u00a9f the shit,'under the statute, though it negatives -ohe of the periods stated iffthe plea, must, nevertheless, /conclude with a verification'. ( The propriety of -this might Well \"be doubled^ <em>but it </em>is sanctioned by the most approved precedents, find We think it proper to adhere to those precedents*</p>\n<p id=\"ASnS\">Judgment for the plaintiffs, with leave to nmend oft payment \u00a9f -costs.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
