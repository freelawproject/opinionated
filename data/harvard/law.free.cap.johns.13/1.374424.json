(See 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>206.)</p>\n<author id=\"b13-10\">Yates, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyQ\">The question is, whether the appellants are entitled to a moiety of the intestate\u2019s <em>personal estate, </em>to the exclusion of two of his brothers, and the children of another deceased brother, who are admitted to be <em>alien enemies </em>at the time of the intestate\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-11\">The principle, that wars ought not to interfere with <em>thopersonal </em>property of an <em>alien, </em>in an enemy\u2019s country, or with the security and collection of debts, has, in modern times, gained ground in all civilized nations. The latest cases in the <em>English </em>courts concur in the opinion, that the ancient severities of war have been much mitigated by modern usages; this is to be attributed, in a great measure, to the more frequent intercourse between citizens of .different nations, by means off commerce, the successful handmaid in securing an interchange of sentiments, whereby more liberal and enlarged views are necessarily introduced, contributing, in a great degree, to soften the estranged and cold feelings of nations towards each other, and thus promoting the security and happiness of individual members of every civilized community. Mankind have'a relative connexion, and \u2018there ever must exist a dependence on each other, to which they are subjected by nature; and although nations may not be in the same situation with individuals, in that respect, yet, when there is an intercourse, they ought to be governed by the same common principles of moral obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-12\">In our country, .these enlightened and humane principles have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>been recognised, as appears by -the decisions of our courts\u00bb! founded on the authority of, the common law; and the law of nations. The principle is here- well understood, that an enemy\u00bb under the protection of our government, can sue and be sued; and that the prohibition to an <em>alien enemy, </em>not in the country-, ta-; do the same, is temporary\u00bb and continues only during th\u00e9 ex-, istenee of the war ; and it is' also a doctrine well established -in the <em>English </em>courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-4\">In a lace case, in chancery, <em>(ex parte Boussmaker, </em>13 <em>Vescy, 71.,) </em>Lord <em>Erskine </em>declared, that the alien\u2019s right of action, ipsuch case\u00bb was only, suspended by the wav; and'if the contract was originally good,'the remedy would revive op-th\u00e9\u2019return of' '.peace,</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">I shall not controvert--th\u00e9. correctness the principle laid down by. Sir <em>William Blackstone, </em>in his Commentaries, cited- by., the appellants ; (1 <em>Black. Com. </em>372.;) \u201c That alien' enemies have no rights, no- privileges, unless by the king\u2019s special favour, during the time of war.;\u2019.\u2019 -but, conformably to this, doctrine, I think it may well be urged, in this case, that the benefit of the Statute of distributions ought to be extended to the kindred of the deceased, notwithstanding- their ,alienage, as .a- -consequence resulting out of privileges granted to the,intestate by our.-government before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"AWs\">It does not .appear that <em>John Brad-well, </em>the intestate, had become a naturalized Citizen of the <em>United States, </em>but that he .was \u25a0 an <em>Englishman </em>by birth ; and that he, and his brother <em>Benjamin,. </em>moved from <em>England </em>to tlie <em>United States, </em>in 18Q2. The infer-, ence, therefore, is, that he continued an alien,-and that he resL ded in this country, before.the war, as an alien friend, and, after-wards,, during the war, as an alien, enemy, under the protection of government, .and in the enjoyment of privileges .guarantied to him by, the law of th\u00e9 land, <em>Vattel( </em>book iii. ch. iv. sect. 63.) gays, \u201c The sovereign declaring war, can neither detain the subjects-of the enemy who- are: .W-ith-in his dominions, at the time of the declaration, nor their effects\u2019;, they came into his country pn the public faith. By permitting them to enter Lis territories, and continue there, he tacitly promised them liberty and seen-a\u2019i-ty for their return,\u201d \u2019 And in ch. v. sect.\u201976., in the-same book, tie says, <em>u </em>War being now carried on with so much moderation And indulgence, safeguards ar\u00e9 allowed to houses and lands pos<em>mam\u00e1 </em>by foreigners in ah enemy\u2019s eountry. For the same rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>sans, he who declares war does not confiscate the immovable goods possessed in his country by his enemy\u2019s subjects ; in per-milting them to purchase, and possess those goods, he has, in this respect, admitted them into the number of his subjects,-</p>\n<p id=\"Auc\">In the case \u2019of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>72.,) it is Stated by the supreme court, that the evident construction of the act of congress, of the ;6th July, 1798, is, that where an alien comes to reside here during.peace, no letters of safe conduct are requisite, nor any license from\u2019 the president; that the-license, is implied by the law and the-usage of nations; that if he came here.eveii since the war, a license would be implied* and the protection to him would be continued, until the executive should think proper to order him out of the <em>United States,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">In this case, it does no.t appear that the intestate has ever,, in any way, been molested by any order of government, but has continued to reside here, by permission, as before stated, until his--decease, ^ 1 can see no reason-why t.he rights he enjoyed, as to the destination of his <em>pers.onal </em>property, if he had died during peace, should' not (while he thus continued) be secured to him during war. If his relations abroad were entitled'to a distributive share in the one case, .they ar\u00e9 equally entitled in the other. That they would have been permitted to take their shares before the war, in case of his death,- will not be questioned.- Every member of this court must know, that the benefit of that rule of law in <em>England </em>has frequently been experienced by citizens here. They ought not, perhaps, .to be allowed to recover the property while the war continues; and,, in that respect, ought to be placed on the footing of an alien <em>enemy, </em>who is a creditor, not resident here, and, consequently, incapable to prosecute for his debts. \u2022 But the permission given to the alien to remain, must, in. case of his decease, during that-period, secure to his alien relatives the ability to take, and, on the return of peace, to recover their shares of his <em>personal </em>property, according to the statute of distributions, in the same manner as if no War had' intervened. This cannot be deemed a violation , of the principles laid down in the books, that alien enemies have no rights, no privileges, unless by special favour of the'government of the country; because, it is a consequence necessarily attached to the special favour granted, of remaining in the country during the war. '</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">I am aware that this is extending the consequential right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>protecfion in tim\u00e9'of war further than appears heretofore to have been donefor, by the books, it is not carried.beyond the right 0f suing for debts; but it is probable that this question has never been brought up; I believe no case,, to that effect,.can be found; It is -not unreasonable, therefore, to infer, that no.claim like that of the appellants has ever before been interposed., . y</p>\n<p id=\"A_m\">Admitting, however,\" for a moment, that this reasoning is not-warranted by. the facts in the case, because it does not. appear; affirmatively and explicitly, that the intestate was an <em>alien enemy </em>at the time of his - death, nor that he remained here by perrnis-' sibn of government, (although there Pan be no doubt of it, ac-' cording to the. construction given to the act of congress, in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Morey, </em>before slated,) yet, in order to take a more full and satisfactory view of the subject, I shall proceed to examine\" the claims of the-appellants .on the' ground urged by their counsel. \u2018 . : y -. .</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">It hah been stated that \u00fch\u00e9 people have no right on. the ground of forfeiture,, and ought not to' interfere with thisi property, because- the claimants abroad having no privileges, being alien enemies, could not take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">It must be admitted, that the principles, .in relation \u2022 tb .reai estate, as to the alien\u2019s taking, and holding, until office found;,' cannot apply to the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">An alien can- take <em>personal </em>property with him* when ordered but of the country; but the soil is a portion of its dominion, and allegiance to the government, on the part of the owner, cannot he -dispensed with; they are inseparable, and the safety of ev.\u00e9xy community forbids the introduction of a measure which would inevitably .give a permanent influence to persons- not. interestcd in its destinies.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-10\"><em>Blackslone </em>(1 <em>Bl. </em>Com. 371.) says,, if an alien could acquire' a permanent properly in lands,.- he must-owe an allegiance equally permanent with that property, which would, probably' he inconsistent with that ..which he owes to-his. own: natural liege lord ^besides that, the nation might, in time) be subject to foreign influence. . ' . \" . ' .'</p>\n<p id=\"ALT\">The property in question is personal, and the- peculiar situation. of it arises out of a state of .hostility, and never can enure to the benefit of the appellants, so as to give them the exclusive right to it. The disability (if it exists at all) is created for %hi advantage and security, of the- government,. who \u00f3ught, per-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>baps, to retain it in the country during the existence.of the war. But, it is said, the court, in the decision of. this cause, ought to be governed by <em>policy ; </em>and the relative situation of the claimants has been adverted to, and the exclusive ability of the appellants to render essential services to the country,-while in a state-of war, has been urged in their favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">In <em>Cornu </em>v. Blackburne, <em>(Doug. </em>641.,) Lord <em>Mansfield </em>declared, that it was sound policy, as well as good morality, to keep faith with'an enemy in time of war, and-that a contract which \u2022 arises out of a state of hostility, ought to be governed by the \u25a0law of nations, and the eternal rules of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-5\">This, indeed, is not a contract; but, according to the view first taken of the subject, if. would be an advantage claimed, in consequence of - an implied permission given to the intestate, and could not, according to the rules of justice, be extended to the appellants, nor enforced by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">I believe it will be admitted, that the soundest policy of every government, in relation to questions of this kind, is to .observe good faith towards foreigners of every description; more especially, if they continue their residence by permission of government, during a war with their country, and not to \u2022 allow such permission to entrap them, or to produce a disposition of their property different from what would have taken place in \u00e1 state of peace, and .thus suffering manifest injustice to be exercised towards their representatives abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\">To encourage a foreigner to remain with us in time of peace, with an understanding that, according to the law of nations; in the event of his death,, his personal estate shall go to his representatives abroad, although aliens ; yet if,, unfortunately, a war intervenes, during which he dies, to deprive the same representatives of this- property, notwithstanding the permission of government to the intestate, to remain in the country until \u2019his decease, appears to me to be repugnant to justice and humanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-8\">It, assuredly-, must operate as a direct discouragement to that commercial intercourse, so requisite to. promote the happiness1 and prosperity of our country.. According to the view, then,' which I have taken of the subject, true policy would lead to a course, securing to the <em>alien </em>representatives, abroad, the ultima te enjoyment of the <em>personal </em>property of their deceased relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-9\">I am, accordingly, of opinion, that the next of kin of the intestate, residing in <em>England, </em>are entitled to their distributive shares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>of his personal estat e; and that the decree \u00f3f the court of chati\". eery ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"AsX\">Van Ness, j,, Spencer, J., and Thompson, .Ch. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AT9\">(Platt, J., being absent)' declared themselves to be.of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b18-6\">P. W. Radcliff, Stewart, Atwater, Tibbits,, Van; Schoonhoven, Vanbbyck, and Wendell,</author>\n<p id=\"AxS\">Senators,-were also of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b18-7\">Arnold, Bricknell, Bishop, BloodgoOd, Bloom, Can-tine, Clark, Prendergast, Ross,' Swift, and Tabor,</author>\n<p id=\"ANO\">Senators, Were of Opinion that the decree of the court of chancery ought to be reversed*</p>\n<p id=\"AG7\">The members of the court, who were present,- being thus equally divided in opinion, the President <em>(Lieut.
