No matter what was the character, -or extent of the aconveyanoe from <em>Reuben Van Gelder </em>to Thorne, if the defendant-purchased the fee of the whole lot, and held it as <em>tenant in </em>fee of the whole.

The grantor did not describe himself as heir at law, but only as administrator and heir. When a person having right enters into possession-of land,, the law intends that he entered according to .his right* Then, he insisted, the. character of the.possession of the defendant was that of a tenant in common of one ninth part; and so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>could not be adverse to the other heirs, or the tenants in common of the remaining eight parts. It appears from the <em>Nisi P.rius </em>record, that the process-was returnable in <em>January, </em>1812, so that the statute of limitations could not prevail. The court will go far to protect the rights of tenants in common from am <em>ouster </em>by an adverse possession under a co-tenant.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX57\">Again, <em>in Jackson, ex dem.

The defendant was bound to take notice of the deed t\u00f3 Preston; whatever is sufficient to put a party on inquiry is good notice.

It provides for a compensation for improvements made by settlers <em>under colour of title. </em>The possession is to be transferred to the true owner, on making payment for the improvements. This shows that the legislature intended to protect the titles to lands under deceased soldiers, and, at the same time, to protect those who entered under colour of title; thus doing justice to all parties, and giving fhe land to -its true owner.

The important inquiry in this cause is, as to the character, duration, and effect of the defendant\u2019s possession ; and it involves the following questions : 1st. Whether the premises have been held adversely for 20 years before suit brought ? and, 2d. If adverse, (although not for that period,) what the legal operation of such possession is, with regard to the conveyances introduced by both parties, as evidence of title ?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The deed of <em>September, </em>1791, from <em>Reuben Van Gelder </em>to <em>Stephen Thorne, </em>for the whole lot, cannot control the possession of the defendant, and of his father, so as to make it the entry and possession of a tenant in common, merely because it gave title to no more than one ninth part of the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The grantor in this deed states himself to be the heir of the patentee, and the conveyance is for the whole lot; and it may well be inferred, that <em>Thorne, </em>at the time, supposed that it gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>him title to that-extent, and, that he \u2022purchased accordingly* It afterwards appearing that Newieji was a younger son could not alter the natur\u00e9 of the defendant\u2019s possession,' If <em>Reuben </em>had: been the heir at law of <em>Jacob Van Odder, </em>the soldier, <em>Thorne, </em>would have held the whole lot- under the statute of the 5th of <em>April, </em>1803, as -a. <em>bona fide </em>purchaser*</p>\n<p id=\"AuD\">The conduct of <em>Reuben, </em>subsequently to the conveyance made by him, confirms, in a great degree,- what has been stated to have' been the intention of all the -parties when it was executed.The consideration, received was .divided, between all the children. They, therefore,., supposed the sale made by <em>Reuben </em>sufficient to pass the entire lot,. or\u2019 they never would have accepted of their proportion of the consideration received for it,; and <em>Thorne, </em>supposing himself to have obtained a good title, did not, hesitate to dispose of it to a person who entered as owner of the whole lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. If, therefore, it is conceded,'.that deed .conveyed, ones ninth part only to <em>Thorne, </em>and that if he had entered under it, suc-h. entry would have been according to his right ms tenant in-common, and that his co-tenants couldnot have been disseised,, because the possession would not have been adverse to their rights; still, this, cannot change the character of the defendant\u2019s possession, nor the previous possession of his -father*Neither of them had any, knowledge of this deed* The father-purchased, by warranty deed, from <em>Thorne, </em>who represented himself to be the sole proprietor of the lot^ As early as <em>July or August, </em>1792; while the defendant\u2019s father was on the lot,' <em>Thorne</em>went to view it, and avowed himself to be the owner, and sold it for 140b \u2022 From that period,'in strictness, the adverse possession.commenced, At all events, it commenced from, the date of <em>Thorne's, </em>deedto the elder <em>Smith, </em>Which Was in- <em>February^' </em>1794. it is evident, therefore, that the doctrine, in relation to the possession of tenants in common, does not -apply to this case.- It might as:weil be urged as applicable, to a conveyance made by a stranger, of any lands held in common. And it will not be questioned, that the possession of a purchaser under such a deed. given without right on the part of the grantor, would, notwithanding, be adverse to the rightful owners, although held by them in common. But, in the present-case,, ijo such tenancy did, in fact, exist. The patent had issued to a deceased soldier; and it .may well.be questioned, whether an equitable ,title, even&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>could pass to his children. The statute to regulate descents as to property, in that situation, was not passed until nine years subsequent to the sale made by <em>Thorne </em>to the father of the defendant; so that the possession taken by him must.be deemed adverse to all the world. <em>(Jackson v. </em>Wheeler, 10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>166. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>1.2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>490.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ark\">It is not stated in the case at what time this suit was commenced, but the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in the course of the-argument, mentioned, that it appeared from the files in the clerk\u2019s office, that the. declaration was, returnable in <em>January term', </em>1812. If that is so, the possession has not been adverse for a period sufficient to bar, the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover on that ground; for, before <em>Thorne </em>went to view the lot, it is not pretended that <em>Smith </em>claimed it, or that he held it in the right of any one.. He, doubtless, during that period, possessed it as a mere intruder; but the adverse possession, subsequent to <em>February, </em>1794, when he had purchased it from <em>Thorne, </em>who then assumed to claim the whole lot, and having taken his warranty deed, was sufficient to defeat the conveyances obtained by <em>William Preston </em>in 179,8. The conduct of <em>Thorne, </em>afterwards, could not alter the operation of this possession. There is no evidence that. <em>Smith-</em>had any knowledge of it; .and such conduct may well be attributed to the interference of <em>Preston </em>with the title, \u25a0 because the lot had been conveyed by a warranty deed to the elder <em>Smith,' </em>so that <em>Thorne </em>was interested in securing <em>Smith's </em>possession. The deeds, then, from <em>William Van Gelder, Jacob Van Gelder, </em>and \u25a0 <em>Elijah Van </em>Gelder, to <em>William Preston, </em>of the 15-th -of <em>March, </em>1798, and of the other children to. him, dated the preceding <em>February, </em>being rendered inoperative, the plaintiff, of course, cannot be benefited by the demises of <em>William </em>Preston, <em>John Matthews, Robert Morris, </em>and <em>Garrit Wendell, </em>and the-Conveyances, subsequently executed by all the-children to <em>Reuben, </em>must enure to the benefit of the defendant, who held under <em>Reuben, </em>through <em>Thorne ; </em>because the facts in the case sufficient-: ly show, that those conveyances were obtained.for the purpose-of granting or securing <em>Thorne's </em>tide under <em>Reuben ; .and. Smith' </em>being <em>Thorne's </em>grantee, he and those claiming, under him, .had a right to protect themselves, under a title thus obtained, in-the-same manner, as though he had purchased from\u2019 the children-himself. It is an established rule of, law that a party in possess Sion claiming title, may purchase in an outstanding -title. <em>(Jack- &gt; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>son, ex dem.

There, therefore, can be no recovery on the; d\u00e9* mise of the other children of the patentee, as, they have parted with their right in the premises-to <em>Reuben, </em>which, as before stated, enures to, the benefit of his grantee and those claiming under him.
