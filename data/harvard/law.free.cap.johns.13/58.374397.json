In thosb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>countries the copies may be evidence; but the <em>lex loci,, </em>though h may govern as <em>to the </em>contract itself, is <em>not </em>the rule of evidence. by which the contract is to be proved in th\u00e9 country where the . action is brought, and where the proof of the contract must be , given, Different countries and states 'may establish very diff, ferent rules of. evidence. .In <em>Massachusetts\u25a0 </em>and <em>Connecticut\\ \u25a0 </em>the oath of the party is received in an action of law, in support; of his demand. In Pennsylvania, the <em>protest </em>of a master, of a vessel, made before a notary, is received to prove the loss in am action on a policy of insurance. But such evidence is not admissible here, \\</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGc\">There-ought, then, to have been a commission taken out tq examine the notary,; and if the original contract could not be obtained, the copy should have been verified, by a comparison '\u25a0with the original, ad which might have been shown under a Commission, It appears, also, that the contract was executed by the plaintiff, by his attorney <em>Carhonel, </em>and the only evidence of any power of attorney, is the same notarial'cei\u2019tificate. The originals ar\u00e9 not exhibited, nor the copies verified, ' The notary certifies facts, lie does not set forth the contract <em>been </em>verba, He speaks in the past tense, and narrates facts.

The bond was no.t for any particular sum; and it was requisite tq show how the value of the tobacco was liquidated, fqr which- the surety was made liable, If the liquidation was. voluntary, on the part of the surety, he ought to show that it was fairly and honestly made. The only evidence of the decree is this same notarial certificate, without any oath qr verification whatever.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AS_M\"><em>Slosson, </em>and <em>Caines, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az2\">1, As to the admissibility of the documents offered in evidence. The powers are set forth <em>verbatim </em>in the notarial certificate, and which is, in fact, a copy \u00aer- exemplification of the record. The court must he satisfied1 of the genuineness of every paper offered in evidence, For. this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>object, it is enough to show, first, that the original cannot be pro-duped, and, next, that the paper or copy offered, as its substitute, is true, or properly verified. Though, when the paper is fifst offered, the court may have doubts of its authenticity, yet if, by the subsequent proofs in the cause, its verity is satisfactorily established, the court will not direct* a new trial. The granting a new trial is in the sound discretion of the court, and stands on different grounds from exceptions taken to the evidence, In countries where the civil <em>law </em>prevails, the contracting parties go before a notary, who takes down their declarations, and draws up the contract in form, which he keeps, and delivers copies to the parties, which are, in truth, originals and counterparts of the contract. The notary is the <em>proper officer </em>to give certified copies. This court has said, that the certificate of a clerk was equivalent to an affidavit,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> because he is the proper officer. In <em>Duncan </em>v, <em>Scott,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>held, that copies of depositions delivered by a judge\u2019s clerk, heing in the course of office, were <em>prima facie </em>evidence, without being proved to be examined copies. In <em>Miller </em>v. Livingston,<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> it was held that, where the originals could not be had, copies were admissible in evidenceit is true, such copies must be duly authenticated. Here we have the confession of the defendant himself, that the documents produced were genuine. This confession of the party is equivalent to the production of the subscribing witness to an instrument<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The admission of the copy implies the genuineness of the original, What higher evidence of the truth of these copies could have been obtained under a commission ? The defendant, having a notarial copy of the same contract, cannot allege that he is surprised by the copy produced at the trial,</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-5\">In <em>Walrond </em>v. <em>Van </em>Moses,<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark> it was decided, that a copy of an agreement registered in <em>Holland, </em>and attested by a <em>public notary </em>there, might be given in evidence for the defendant; especially as the plaintiff had taken out another copy of the same agreement, and would not produc\u00e9 it; for he would not be surprised, as he must have known of the agreement, having himself a copy of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">2. The deposition of Paccardus\u25a0 fully establishes the fact of the payment of the money, by the. judicial decision or decree of. the court at Caraccas,'</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ay7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>3. If the defendant intended to shelter- himself under the character of a mere <em>agent, </em>he ought to have'shown that he disclosed to the plaintiff, at the time the contract was made, the capacity in which he acted; and that he made known his principal, fully .and explicitly, so as to enable the plaintiff to resort to .the principal. The evidence is, that the defendant* in the case of the <em>Stranger, </em>was the agent of <em>Baker Sr Barker, </em>and', in thecaseof the <em>Catharine, </em>the agent of <em>Baker.8/ English.- </em>If the plaintiff had applied to <em>Baker Sr </em>Barker, they would have said, \u201cthis is pot our contract; Mr. <em>II. </em>has blended .the business of others, with whom we have no concern ;. you must look W him.\u201d The plaintiff could not sue one set of principals for on\u00a9 part, and another set of principals for another part of the cqn-, tract. But the evidence shows, that the defendant did1 not pretend to act as <em>agent </em>in this contract.' It was entered into-between him, as principal, and thq plaintiff as. his <em>surety. </em>Though a person is an agent, he may still assume individual and personal responsibility relative to the subject of his agen--, cy.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\">_ Where an agent, without disclosing his. principal, or, which is, the. same thing, does not disclose all his principals* where there are more than one, makes a contract, he. is himself to be treated as principal.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">Again, the authority and duty of a <em>supercargo </em>is to sell one cargo, and invest the proceeds in another, or return'cargo. The entry . of the cargo and'vessel, at the custom house, is the peculiar duty of the master. The. defendant having gone aside from his duty as supercargo, to enter into this arrangement of the. tobacco contract, in order to procure an entry, must be considered as having acted, in that respect, on-his own personal responsibility.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> .If the Question of the defendant's, acting as a mere agent, or hot, rested on facts, it was for the jury to decide; and they have determined the fact. If it depended on the written documents produced, those documents clearly show that he acted, as principal. - .</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-7\">Again, the factor arid principal, or owner, may each sue for the same cause.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> Where a contract operates on two parties, each may sue ; but if one sues, it is a bar to an action by the. other; andv if the owner, or principal, does not sue,, the factor may bring the' action. ' *</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>As to </em>the sale of the tobacco,.the plaintiff was compelled, <em>ex </em>necessitate, by the very act of the defendant, to become his \u25a0agent as to the tobacco, a perishable article, which he sold,'and gave the defendant credit for the nett proceeds. This cannot be considered as any waiver of his claims for indemnity under the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-4\">A surety is not bound to stand a Suit, but may pay the money ih the first instance, and then call on the principal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Wg\">The declaration, in this case, contains only the usual money counts. The plaintiff must show that he actually paid money for the defendant, not that another person paid it. Where owner and factor both have actions, they must be special actions on the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">To understand this case, it is necessary to examine the facts minutely. [Here the counsel examined and remarked on the facts at length.] The tobacco contract\u2019 was subsidiary to the other, and made in the name of the defendant, but, in truth, for the benefit of <em>Serra. </em>It was to facilitate the entry of the <em>Stranger; </em>and the plaintiff must have known that the defendant was' not acting on his- own account, or for his own benefit. The letter of the plaintiff shows this. It is said, the defendant did not disclose the names of his principals; but the plaintiff had the \u25a0 invoice of the cargo, and must have known them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\">It is true, in regard to foreign trade, that a <em>factor </em>may be sued, because he is on the spot, and his principal, or owner, being abroad, cannot be reached. This rule, however, founded on the convenience of trade, does not apply where both factor and owner reside abroad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\">Again,, according to the necessary course of this trade, carried on at Caraccas, agents there must act in their own names, and appear as principals, in order to keep others out of view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-10\">The confessions of the defendant amount to nothing. Thev are, in substance, this : \u201c I do not dispute the <em>items </em>of your account.; I put my defence on higher ground;. that I am not liable at all, having acted merely as the agent of <em>Baker, </em>to whom you must look.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-11\">All subsequent engagements, by letters, are <em>nude pacts, </em>or, if the defendant is to be made liable on them, it cannot be in this action, but on special counts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-12\">Again, the extent of the, obligation of the plaintiff, as surety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>was indefinite and unlimited. It was absolutely essential, tb\u00e9f\u00e9\u00bf fore, that he should show, by 'satisfactory evidence* how the amount was liquidated and ascertained. The decree of the court ought to have been produced, \u25a0 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkBn\">Further, there is no evidence that the' plaintiff has ever paid <em>F. </em>the money he swears he advanced. <em>F. </em>does -not say that the plaintiff ever paid him a cent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFt\">, Then, as -to the admissibility of the \u2022 documents, of notarial certificates* in evidence. In <em>Smith </em>v. Spinolla, the very point was decided, though the case does not appear to be reported.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In <em>Downes </em>v. <em>Mooreman</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is stated, that \u201c a copy of an agree-! ment between the abbot of <em>Quarrer </em>and the monks of <em>Lyra? </em>was produced in evidence; to which it was objected, for the plaintiff that, by the rules of evidence, it could not be read, being neither a record nor a public thing, But the defendant pro-duced a copy: of the statute of <em>Oxon. </em>that no, book, &amp;c. should go out of the <em>Bodleian </em>library; and the court gave leave to read the copy of the agreement in evidence; though they admitted it not to be within the general rules of evidence, but on the very particular circumstances of the ease.\u201d Here it was expressly shown that the original could not be obtained;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and it was admitted, that to allow a copy, even in such case, to be read, was against the rules of evidence. As to the case off <em>Walrond </em>v\u00bf <em>Van Moses, </em>it is remarkable that it has never been cited* to that point, in any abridgment of the law, or in any treatise on evidence; nor is there any subsequent case to be found'grounded bn its authority. Besides, in that case, each party had a .copy of the original.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMU\">It appears, in-this case, that a copy only, of the power was exhibited to the notiiry, and he gives a copy of a copy* without any verification by the original. Three citizens certify* that the person who gives the certificate is a <em>notary </em>*\u2022 there is nothing more. The original and the copy do not appear to have been compared. - '</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-12\">' Under a commission, the party could go into an examination .of all the circumstances attending the execution of the instrument. Biit if notarial certificates, or copies, are admissible, a \u2022party may be surprised at the trial, and have no opportunity to: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>khdw any circumstances attending th\u00e9 execution of th\u00e9 instru\u00ed inent, or that it was \u00e1 forgery;</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AkkP\"> <em>1 Caines, 59. 6 Johns.

Unnecessary tb examine miriutely th\u00e9 proof that was before th\u00e9 court at the time application was made for a nonsuit; for, admitting there Was ndt evidence enough,\u2019 at that time, to warrant a recovery, yet, if the deficiency was afterwards supplied, and there was proof sufficient to support the verdict when found, the present motion cannot prevail;</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">With respect to the instrument, by which it is alleged that the plaintiff became security for the defendant, the proof is abundantly sufficient to show that the <em>original </em>could not b\u00e9 produced Upon the trial. According tb th\u00e9 laws of the <em>Spanish </em>province. Where this instrument was executed, the original, or the one actually signed by the parties, remains with the notary before whom it was executed. Copies, certified- and signed by' the notary, are delivered to the parties ; .and such copies, thus authenticated, \u00e1re receiv\u00e9d in evidence in all the <em>Spanish </em>tribunals*</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">It is unnecessary definitively to say. whether the <em>lex loci </em>Ought So far tb prevail, as to require these notarial copies to be admitted in evidence here, in the sam\u00e9 manner as in the <em>Spanish </em>tribunals* I am inclined to think, however, they ought not to be received as sufficient, <em>per se; </em>but I cannot think they \u00e1re to be entirely disregarded, and treated as mere nullities; They ought to \u00ed?\u00e9 received as forming a part of the inferior evidence of the execution of the instrument, when the original cannot be prodbe\u00e9d and proved. It appears\" to b\u00e9 a part of the official duty of the notary to give copies; he is- specially intrusted with that power; and, in giving such copies, he acts under his oath of office. The instrument is executed- before him in his official capacity, and an official certified copy, necessarily implies that he saw the instrument executed., In what respect does this \u2019differ from an examination upon a commission? He Cat! only sWear he saw the instrument executed, and that the copy furnished by him is under oath. Besides, we ought tO.be cautious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>In declaring that we will receive' nothing short of the examina\u00bb1 tj0n 0f plc notary, under a commission, as, there is no mode; of enforcing such examination ; nor is a sworn copy, proved by a person who has compared it with the original, any higher or bet-' ter evidence than that furnished by the, notary, which is a .copy tinder his oath of office.. But the evidence furnished in the case -before us is mote satisfactory than either, arising out of the repeated, uniform, and uncontradicted confessions of the defendant, contained .in,- his.letters, and to witnesses,' whosetestimony was before the jury. ' Paccanius, who, in behalf of the plaintiff, applied to the defendant for payment, swears that he showed him the documents, given in evidence, which purported tQ.be notarial copies of the instrument, whereby the plaintiff became-security for the defendant; and the cancehnent of the contract, upon the payment of up wards of 20,000 dollars by the plaintiff, as security for the defendant, in conformity with a decree of the-<em>Spanish </em>tribunal; that <em>the defendant examined the papers, and, without any hesitationrecognised them as genuine </em>and <em>authentic. </em>In addition to this, he acknowledged to this witness,, that the plaintiff had entered into the obligation on- th'e.tobacco- contract, as security for him. This witness also exhibited; to him an \u00e1ccount, containing the charge of 20,518 dollafs' and 3\u00cd cents, paid to the' royal administration of tobacco at <em>Caraccas, </em>as security: for the defendant, and referring to the instrument executed on that occasion. The, defendant did not , dispute the justice of the,plaintiff\u2019s claim, nor-questfon the accuracy of any of the <em>items, </em>contained in the account,-but insisted only that he acted as agent,.' and in behalf of <em>Baker </em>; and that the plaintiff ought to look to-him for payment* To <em>Serra, </em>another Witness, the defendant acknowledged that the plaintiff Was bound as security for him-. This witness also confirms the testimony of Paccanius, ivith respect to the defendant not disputing any of the items contained i\u00bf the account presented to him. These acknowledgments furnish. evidence ..of an express admission that the- copies offered in evidence were genuine and authentic, copies of the original,. and'serve, to <em>identify </em>the instruments Beyond all dispute. If any thing more eould possibly be wanting, it- is furnished by the defendant\u2019s-letters., In the one of the 7th of <em>February, </em>1806, he' apprizes, the plaintiff that he should send a vessel for the rest of . the tobacco, and adds; .but,, at all events, I shall take <em>care </em>to <em>indemnify you for your </em>- <em>suretyship to the royal administration of* </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>tobacco. </em>Again, in his letter of the 6 th of January, 1808, he admits he entered into the tobacco contract, and tells the plaintiff <em>to </em>be under no apprehensions that-he shall in any manner suffer in the affair. And, as late as 23d'of <em>June, </em>18.1-0, he writes, that he had been made the victim in the affair of the tobacco, and wanted to be informed whether the plaintiff had to pay any thing, and how much; promising either to go himself, or send some person, for the purpose of settling the unfortunate affair. If the confessions of the defendant, either by parol or in writing, are at all to be received in evidence, they are amply sufficient, in this case, to show- a due execution of the instrument whereby the plaintiff became his surety. This instrument was not under seal; so that no objection on that account can be made. I see no objection, nor, indeed, was any made'on the trial, to the admissibility of such evidence. In the case of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>(2 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>452.,) it is said, that the confession of a party that he gave a <em>note', or any instrument precisely identified, </em>is as high proof as that derived from a subscribing witnessi</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">That- the plaintiff has paid upwards of 20,000 dollars on account of the breach of the defendant\u2019s contract with the <em>Spanish </em>government, is established, not only by the admission of the defendant, but by the positive evidence of <em>Paccanius, </em>who swears that he did, at the plaintiff\u2019s request, by his orders, and in his behalf, pay the money into the royal treasury, in pursuance of the decree. It was unnecessary to'prove the decree, as a breach of the contract which the defendant made with the <em>Spanish </em>government, is fully shown by the admissions of the defendant. In his letter of <em>February, </em>1806, he speaks of sending a vessel for the rest of the tobacco, if circumstances would permit; and he expressly admitted to <em>Paccanius </em>that he had not sent a vessel to take away the tobacco, being apprehensive she. would not be admitted on account of <em>Miranda?s </em>expedition. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">If-the contract was broken, it was not necessary for the plain\u00bb.\u00a1 tiff to stand a suit. If the liability of the surety, and a payment of the money by him, be shown, it will be sufficient to warrant a recovery against his principal.</p>\n<p id=\"And\">In answer to all this, it has been Urged that the plaintiff -was \u2022the agent of <em>Serra, </em>and, therefore, has no right to recover on his own account, even admitting the defendant\u2019s liability to <em>Serra; </em>and, also, that the defendant was acting as the agent of other persons, and cannot be made personally, responsible, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>recourse must he had to his principals. I cannot discover from the evidence in the case, any, thing to warrant, Or even to\u00a1 give colour, to the conclusion, that, with respect to the tobacco, contract, the plaintiff was acting as the agent of <em>Serra, </em>The allegation of the defendant, to that effecl, in his letter of <em>January, </em>M08, is top vague to deserve any consideration;: it is at variance with the contract itself, and with the general tenor of the defendant\u2019s conduct and Confessions, and might very well have, been an afterthought in th\u00e9 defendant, to endeavour tp shift the loss from his own shoulders. Nothing is to be collected from the contract itself, to show that the plaintiff,acted in behalf <em>of </em>Serra; nor is there any eyidenee that he represented himself to the defendant as such agent, when hp entered into the security, Jf such had been the fact, there can bp no dopht that it woulc| have appeared upon the fees of the contract, This the parties well understood, for they made the contract by their agents, as \u2022appears by the instrument, and the authority of the agents, as set out. It is not to. be credited that, if the plaintiff had authority from <em>Sersq </em>to become surety for the defendant, he would not have appeared in that character in the transaction. ' There is no doubt that the plaintiff was the agent of <em>Serra, </em>during his absence in <em>.Spain, </em>and there is considerable testimony tending to show that, in the sales of the cargoes of. the. <em>Catharine </em>and <em>Stranger, </em>be'acted in behalf of <em>Serra. </em>But these were \u2019mercantile transactions, altogether distinct from becoming security for the performance of a contract in which <em>Serra,, </em>from any thing that ap? pears, had no interest or concern. If the defendant has .procured the plaintiff to become security for him,-in his awn name, And he has been compelled to pay the money,, it very Illy be- . comes the defendant, now, to say he is responsible to <em>Serrq, </em>and mot to the plaintiff* Before the plaintiff is turned arpund to. <em>Serra </em>for indemnity, it ought very clearly to appear that hp has \u2022a, remedy against him. - If the plaintiff ever made the, aciaipwdedgment, stated by <em>JfPConehey, </em>as to his being the agent of <em>Serra, </em>it must have related to a mercantile agency, and not to an authority to become security on the tobacco contract. At all (events, this was matter for the consideration of the jury. <em>Ferro,, </em>who appears, from his examination, to have been well acquainted with the circumstances, in relatiou to the tobacco contract, and the payment of the money by the plaintiff, says he has no rea$pa to imagine that the plaintiff, when he becamesurety far Jhp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>.defendant, was acting in behalf of <em>Serrcc, </em>or that the money which the plaintiff was compelled to pay, as such surety, was paid out of the funds of <em>Serra, </em>or that the plaintiff was in any manner indemnified by <em>Serra; </em>nor is the evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant acted as the agent of any person, in making the tobacco contract. The contract, itself, does not recognise him in that character; nor does the evidence show that, at the time of making the contract, he represented himself as such agent. No power was shown, giving him authority to make any such contract. It is hardly credible that the plaintiff would have become security upon the credit of others, without seeing some authority in the agent to pledge their responsibility; The defendant has not, even now, furnished any evidence that he had authority to make such a contract for <em>Baker, </em>or any other person. He went out as supercargo of the <em>Catharine, </em>but that did not vest him with\u2019authority to make the contract for the tobacco. It was totally unconnected with his duties as supercargo. Indeed, it is very uncertain now, from the evidence in the case, who were his principals; whether <em>Baker </em>alone, or <em>Baker 8r English, </em>or <em>Baker 8? Barker; </em>and the plaintiff would be entirely at a loss to determine who are his principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\">The correctness of the legal position stated to the jury, and by which they were to test the evidence, has not been questioned, 'that if a party would excuse himself from responsibility, because he acted in the capacity of agent,, he ought to show that he communicated to the other party his situation as agent, and that he acted in that capacity, so as to give a remedy over against the person whom he represented as his principal. The testimony in this case furnishes no such evidence. The defendant, therefore, cannot excuse himself on this ground. It is unnecessary to travel through the various items of the accounts; for, if the defendant is at all answerable for the money .paid on the tobacco contract, he is, at least, liable to the amount of the verdict found by the jury. And that he is so answerable is, I think, very clear. The motion for a new trial must, accordingly, ]ae denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Jfotion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
