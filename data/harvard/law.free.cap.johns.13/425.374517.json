The <em>six th </em>section of the act (1 <em>N. </em>R. <em>L. </em>344.) declares, that in all actions of slander prosecuted in the supreme court, if the jury shall assess the \u25a0damages under <em>fifty </em>dollars, the plaintiff shall recover no more posts than damages\u00bb There is no saving here, as is to be found in the <em>fourth </em>section, with respect to causes removed froth inferior courts. Tt is probably a <em>casus omissus; </em>but as costs are only given by statute, We have no discretion to allow them against thp express provision pf the act $ nor can w\u00e9 construe the word <em>prosecute </em>as applying only to such suits as are originally epinmenced in this court. The same word is used; in' the <em>fourth </em>section,, yet the <em>saving, </em>was deemed necessary as to causes removed from the courts of common pleas. Besides, the last proviso of the fourth section declares, that nothing contained in that section, shall extend to certain actions, mentioned, among which is that pf s}ander; so 'that we must, construe the sixth section by itself, or as if the fourth section had not beeh insert-, pd in the act. If so, there Pan be no ground for any distinction. between \u00a1actions originally .commenced here, arid those removec} from an inferior court by <em>habeas gorpus, \u2022</em></p>\n<p id=\"ANTs\">MPtipn dpnied,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
