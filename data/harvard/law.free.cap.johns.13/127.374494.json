He does not say, in his return, that he has summoned the de\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>fondants, or even put them by pledges, &amp;c.; but that he has <em>al</em>them by certain pieces of money. The first <em>process, </em>or proceeding by original, is a summons, or warning to appear, according to the exigency of the writ, which, in personal actions, is by leaving a <em>copy </em>of the writ with the defendant, or at his usual place of abode. (1 <em>Tid.d's K. B. Pr. </em>103. 3 <em>Bl. Com. 279. Finch's Law, </em>305. 352.) If the defendant does not appear on the summons, before, or on the <em>quarto die post, </em>a <em>distringas </em>issues. (1 <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>111. 114. <em>Prec. in Chan. </em>129. 131. 2 <em>Hen. Bl.

This is, no doubt, the general rule, which has, however, some exceptions, one of which is the case of a <em>corporation, </em>in the suit against which, where the writsi <em>te fecerit securum, </em>&amp;c.,the com? mand is not, <em>pone per vadios et salvos </em>plegios, &amp;c., but to summon by good summoners, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-10\"><em>Anciently, </em>by the common law, the only process to compel appearance in actions unaccompanied by force, or a breach of the peace, was by <em>summons </em>and distress infinite. The person of the defendant was never taken. In later times, as commerce increased, the <em>capias </em>was introduced. <em>(Sellon's Pr. Appendix, </em>(C.) 646. <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>122. 3 <em>Co. </em>12. 3 <em>Bl.

A corporation is an artificial or political person, not a <em>physical </em>being, It cannot commit a breach of the peace. It cannot, therefore, be supposed to have committed a breach of the peace on which the process of <em>attachment </em>is founded. (5 <em>Com. Dig.

And the summons is served on the mayor or other head officer of the corporation\u00bb In all actions where the demand is certain, as account, covenant, debt, annuity, or detinue, the original Writ is called a <em>precipe; </em>the defendant being commanded to do the thing required; and unless he did so, and if the plaintiff made the sheriff secure, <em>si tefecerit secufum, </em>&amp; c. he was commanded to <em>summons </em>him, by good summoners, &amp;c., to show cause why he had not done it. And being in the alternative either to do the thing commanded, or show cause to the contrary, it wras called an <em>optional </em>writ. (3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>274.) In <em>assumpsit, case, trespass, trover, ejectment, </em>deceit, <em>conspiracy, </em>or actions for wrongs, wh\u00e9re the claims were for unliquidated damages, the writ is <em>peremptory, </em>and is called a <em>si te fecerit securum, See., </em>or <em>pone, </em>by which the sheriff is directed to put the defendant, by gages or safe pledges, to show cause, &amp;c. The writ of <em>si tefecerit securum, </em>is an attachment; that is, the sheriff might either take <em>gage or </em>certain goods of the defendant, or make him find sureties, or safe pledges, who might be amerced in case of his non-appearance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b141-16\">In proceedings against <em>peers, </em>the form of a <em>summons </em>is given by <em>Crompton; </em>(2 <em>Crompt. </em>137, 138.;) and he states the mode of obtaining a <em>summons </em>against a corporation, the next process \u2018to which is a <em>distringas. </em>(2 <em>Crompt. </em>145.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Are\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>So, in <em>Plowden,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we. find the proceedings on a <em>quart impedii, </em>in which the bishop of <em>Lincoln, </em>and the dean and chapter, were <em>Summoned, </em>\u00abfee.

In the books of entries and pleadings, we find various forms of <em>precipes </em>for declarations by original, on <em>promissory notes and bills of exchange, </em>which commence in the. following words: \u201c If E.

Attachments are either against the person or the goods. Though a corporation has no <em>body, </em>yet it may be attached by its <em>goods, </em>of-property. The command of the writ,, in this case, is to attach by sureties, or gages and pledges.

It is, also, an invariable rule of this-court,'that all writs issued Out of this court must be <em>tested </em>in term.- If a writ is tested- in vacation, or out of <em>term, </em>it is void. (20 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>264. <em>teste, </em>pl. 9, 10, 11. 13.) The defect, however, if the writ is erroneous, is amendable; and ought, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, to be amended.

They need not plead in abatement, but may avail themselves of the objection on <em>motion. </em>- The cases cited from Saunders, Douglas, and East, were those in which the parties had appeared and pleaded, and so were held to have waived the irregularity. In <em>Fitzkerbert, N. B., </em>will be found writs of <em>si te fecerit securum, </em>&amp;c., in which the proceeding was by summons, and others in which it is by <em>pone </em>or <em>attachment. </em>We contend, that the proper course against a corporation, is by <em>summons. </em>The writ said to be found in the <em>Register, (Regist. Brev. </em>94.,) was that against an <em>abbot, </em>or corporation sole. An <em>abbot </em>and monks form a corporation of a peculiar kind, where the abbot and his monks, though they are, as <em>natural persons, </em>dead in law; yet, the abbot, as head of the religious house, has a political capacity of s\u00faing and being sued <em>alone.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But let the plaintiiis show; il they can, an instance of a corporation aggregate, consisting of many persons, capable of being sued, -who have been sued by <em>pone </em>or attachment. <em>Kyd (on Corp. </em>222\u2014225.,) has examined all the cases in the <em>Year </em>Books,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> in which trespass was brought against a corporation, without any objection being made; and concludes, not withstanding, that an action of trespass will not lie against a corporation aggregate.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAtz\">In the case in 8 Hen* VI. 1., the action was trespass, but it does not appear what the process was. One of the judges, to show the impropriety of joining an individual with a corporation, observes, that in case of amercement, the process would be attachment and distress infinite, and against the individual, process of outlawry, which could not be joined. <em>Kyd</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, explicitly, that a suit against a corporation aggregate, must be by original out of chancery; and if the corporation do not ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>pear, the process to compel appearance, must be by <em>distringas, </em>against -the corporate property; and that an <em>attachment </em>will not lie, against them,, in their corporate capacity. If they have no ^anc^s&gt; or goods, there is no way to make them appear either in. a court #f law, or-equity.- .

It cannot be amended. The cases cited of amendments, are those of <em>mesne </em>process, not of original writs. A bad original, is not helped by the statute of jeofails. (11 <em>Mod. </em>2.) . Amendments cannot be made unless there is something to amend by ; and here is nothing but the <em>precipe </em>on file, and the writ does not vary from <em>theprecipe. </em>(8 Co. 156. <em>b. </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>49., 1 <em>Ld.

If this was an action against a private person, there can be no doubt, from the nature of the demand, that the form adopted in this case would be correct. The demand being uncertain; the general rule is, that where the demand is certain, the original writ is in the alternative, and is called a <em>precipe, </em>commanding'the defendant to do the thing required, or show why he has not done it; and this is the process by summons. Where the demand is uncertain, the writ is called a <em>si te fecerit securum, </em>and is peremptory, commanding the sheriff to cause the defendant to appear in court, without any option given him to do the thing required, as in the <em>precipe; </em>and this is the process by <em>pone, </em>which directs, the sheriff to put by <em>gages </em>and <em>safe pledges, </em>the defendant to show wherefore, &amp;c. No precedent of an original writ against a corporation has been shown. But in all the elementary writers, and in all the books of practice, which treat of the proceedings against corporations, it is laid down as the universal rule, that the process must be by summons, and not by attachment ; and such would not have been the language of the books, if the same form, in all cases, was to be pursued in proceedings against corporations- as against individuals. The alteration in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the writ is very plain and simple, instead of the words <em>\u201c then put </em>7 \u201e , 7 ,, \u201e . , , 7 <em>by gages and safe </em>pledges, \u2019 &lt;yc., insert, <em>then summon by good summoners, 8rc. </em>In this respect, therefore, the original writ is defective, and it is not amendable. There is nothing to amend by. It cannot be considered a clerical mistake. The writ is conformable to the precipe. (1 <em>Salk. </em>52.) The test of the writ depends entirely upon the construction to be given to the statute lately passed on that subject. (Sess. 38. ch. 38.) This statute declares, that all original writs which, according to any law,usage, or custom, have hereto issued out of the court of chancery, &amp;c.y shall hereafter issue out of, and under the seal of, the court in which such writ may be returnable, and be tested in the name of the chief justice, first, or senior judge, of such court, observing, in other respects, the form now in use ; and giving to this court the like power which the court of chancery had, to make and devise new writs. This statute is rather obscurely worded, and it is a little difficult to say what, precisely, was meant by the expression, \u201c observing, in other respects, the form now in use.\u201d There can be no doubt that, according to the established course of proceedings in the court of chancery, with respect to original writs, they must be tested after the cause of action arises, and the day they .are actually issued. Although the statute might well warrant the construction, that the original writ was still to have \u00e1 true test, in the same manner as when it issued out of chancery ; yet this is not the obvious and necessary interpretation to be given to the act; and it is much more fit and proper that it should be tested like other process issuing out of this court, and such was, most likely, the intention of the legislature. To assimilate it as nearly as may be to other process, in ma tters that may be considered in a great measure formal, is less liable to lead to mistakes in the issuing of the writ. And as it is the universal and established rule, with respect to all other process, that it should be tested in term time, we think it the most fit and proper construction to be.given to the statute, that it was intended to apply the same rule to the test of original writs. In this respect, therefore, the writ is correct, but must be quashed upon the first exception, taken.to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
