The 6th section of th.e statute (1 N. <em>R. </em>L. 98.) to prevent' forcible entries and detainers, enacts, that the a'ct \u201c shall extend as well to tenants for years, and guardians, as to such as have estates of freehold.\u201d The statute .of' 21 <em>Jac. </em>ch. \u2022 15., extended the remedy of the former statutes of forcible entry and detainer, to lessors for years and copyholders; and- in the case of the <em>Queen </em>v. <em>Taylor, (7 Mod. </em>123.,) where-the indictment was upon the statute of 8 <em>Henry </em>VI., ch. 9.,' it did not allege, that the party had been seised,'and disseised-by force! and, upon a motion to quash the indictment, <em>Holt, </em>Ch. J\u201e with the concurrence of the whole court, after stating, the extension of the Statutes, by the.statuie of 21 <em>James &gt; </em>ch. <em>1.5., </em>observes, V\u00a3 the present-case is upon the statute of <em>Henry: </em>VI., upon which you must always.allege a freehold and seisin in somebody,.and if it be an entry upon a lessee for y.Cars, you must, say, the-entry was made into the freehold of A., in the possession of 13.) and so he disseised A,; and, of necessity, there must be \u00e1 disseisin of the freehold laid,\u201d The genera! position of Lord <em>Holt </em>is warranted by all the cases, that- the- indictment -must set forth a seisin, Or possession, within th\u00e9 purview of the statute. &lt;\" The party must be shown to be dispossessed, of a freehold, ordo be disseised of a term of years, .yet to come and unexpired. Tenants at. will, of sufferance, are not protected \u2022by the statute, and yet, if it were not essential to allege the estate, and bring it within the reach of the statute, tenants of-that description might avail themselves of -the remedy afforded by the statute, contrary to its plain intendment. It is unnecessary \u2022 to cite further cases from <em>English </em>reports. The point has been. decided in this court repeatedly. <em>(Shaw </em>ads. <em>The People, </em>1 <em>Caines, </em>125., and <em>The People </em>v. <em>King, </em>2 <em>Caines., </em>98.) In .the last cas\u00e9, the late Chief Justice mentions, also,- the case of <em>Beebe \u25a0 </em>ads. <em>The People, </em>not reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">As to the second point, the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>(11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>509.,) decides, that the right and title of the defendant cannot be gone into ; that the statute was; made to prevent persons from doing themselves right by force. As it respects the relator\u2019s title, I do not mean to.be understood, that be is to give precise technical proof, that, he lia.s a- seisin of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>freehold, ora term for years\"; any evidence, from which eithef Qf tjjggg. estates may be inferred, would be sufficient, Hut, upon the traverse, he must show every material allegation in the iridictme\u00f1t to be true ; and the estate, we have seen, is material, andit,necessarily must be\u2018.proved. Whatever must be proved, may be disproved, and it follows, naturally, that, though the defehdant shall hot justify the force, by showing a title in himself, derived from an independent source, or even from the relator himself, he may Controvert the facts by which the relator attempts to make out his estate,, and may show that lie has riot such an est\u00e1te as1 would enable him' to riiaintain the prosecution. It was. urged, on the argument, that it' appearing: th\u00e1t <em>Merrick </em>had purchased the preinises, \u25a0 upofi <em>&amp;;fi. fa. </em>against <em>Brinkerkoff^ </em>he had: a right to enter under, that purchase,\u2022 aridvtah:e possession. Had the premises been-vacant, I agree that he might have entered, without any danger'from the. statute;; but they were not vacant; and, notwithstanding what fell from Mr. Justice <em>Livingston, </em>in <em>MMougall </em>v. <em>Siicker,:(1 Johns. Rep. </em>43.,) I am decidedly of. the opinion that the entry was unlawful. .</p>\n<p id=\"AeW_\"><em>Tidcl </em>says, speaking of the <em>el\u00e9git, </em>(vol. 2. p. 941.,)' it was formerly usual for the sheriff to deliver actual possession of a moiety of the lands, but that he now only delivers legal possession, and, in order to obtain actual possession,, the plaintiff must proceed by ejectment; and he states the practice-to be the samp upon an <em>extent. </em>(2 <em>Tidd's Pr. </em>950.) ' Our practice is,. not. for the sheriffi to deliver possession ; he has no authority for. doing so ; he' is commanded merely to sell; and the purchaser has .A\u00f3 inore right to \u00e9nt\u00e9r after his purchase than he has t\u00f3 ente? \u2022upon any other lands in the actual possession of another, and :tb-which-he. has\u2019title.,; ' .</p>\n<p id=\"AYsp\">Indictment qu\u00e1sh\u00e9di</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
