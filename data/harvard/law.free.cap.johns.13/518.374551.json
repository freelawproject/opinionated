The <em>onus prohandi </em>lies on the defendant to showth\u00e9 title to be in the person under whom he claims.;' It is no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim,, that.thefe is a- person of the same name with the lessor,-without s-howing-m title to the premises in such person.- Besides, how is it certain, that the person proved by. the defendant is. not, in truth, the- les-. sor of the plaintiff ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-12\"><em>\u25a0For the </em>defendant, it was argued, that on the- principles, ad* knitted in the case of <em>Jackson, </em>ex, dem. <em>Houseman, v.

The court there said the patent was conclusive,, that, the paten* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>tee named was the person intended by the legislature; and that where a person of a different name claimed the land, parol evidence was not admissible to explain that intention, it was agreed, however, that if there were two persons of the same name, it would be a latent ambiguity, and parol evidence was admissible to explain which of the two was intended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-4\">The lessor 'of the lessor, no doubt, on producing the patent, is, <em>prima </em>facie, entitled to recover; but the defendant having proved the existence of another person of the same name, the burden of proof, as to the identity of the patentee, is thereby thrown on the plaintiff; for the plaintiff in ejectment must, emphatically, recover on the strength of his own title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-5\">By the act of the legislature, a certain district of country was set apart for the two regiments of this state, serving in the army of the <em>United Sta\u00edet, </em>and no patents were to be issued to any other persons. This is a public act of which the court are bound to take notice. The patent in question was granted for a lot of land in the tract discribed in the act; and the intention of the legislature is thus made manifest by the act. The act and the patent are to be taken together; and it clearly appears from them, not only that a person of the name of <em>'Peter Shullze </em>was intended, but that he was a soldier; and if the defendant, on the trial, shows that the lessor of the plaintiff was not a soldier, that fact will be sufficient to prevail over the mere circumstance of a similarity of name.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAk5P\"> Jackson, ex dem, Mancious, v.

The grant under which the lessor deduces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>his-title was issued under the act to' carry into effect the concurrent resolution and acts of the'legislature: for granthig certain lands, promised to be given as bounty lands; and by reference to those resolutions and acts, it will be seen, that the objects of that bounty were the officers and soldiers serving in the army of the <em>United States, </em>in the line of this state, to wit', <em>Lamb's </em>regiment\u25a0 of.artillery and two regiments of infantry. \\ The letters patent to <em>Peter Shultze </em>Were,.undoubtedly, intended, to vest in him, as a soldier in one of those regiments, a.titl-fe to the lot,, in question, as a bounty for his services in that.capacity. It is-perfectly clear, that the lessor1 of the plaintiff cannot <em>ho. the Peter, Shultze\u25a0 </em>to whom the grant was made,, because the lessor' confessedly was-not a soldier in the revolutionary war. It is equally certain, 'that <em>Peter Shultze, </em>who resided, seven years before .the trial,' at Warre\u00f1, in <em>Herkimer </em>county, could not be entitled to military bounty for revolutionary services <em>\u2022 </em>for, according to the-case, he was born about the year 1777, and thfe war terminated in 1783, at which time he was about six years of age. I am of opinion, that, independently of the existence of <em>Peter Shultze </em>of Warren, it would have been-competent for the defendant to show that, the lessor of the plaintiff, <em>Peter Shultze </em>of <em>Rhinebeck, </em>was not, the patentee, and had no title?' merely from the adventitious circumstance of a similarity of pame with the patentee, to recover possession of fhe premises; this opinion, if appears to me, is warranted by the unanimous judgment of the court, in <em>Jackson v. Stanley, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In the subsequent case, of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>(12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>77.,) though \u00cd took no part in that decision, having been una-' voidably absent when it was, argued) I understand from the opinions expressed, thatf.it'iyas not intended to shake, much less to overrule, the prior decision in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley. </em>The identity, of a grantor, in many cases, is a latent ambiguity. The deed is, on the face of it, free from ambiguity ;,the extrinsic or collateral matter out of the instrument, produces the ambiguity. The case\u00ed- commonly put, is where there .are two persons of th\u00e9 same name, to both of whom the description in the deed is, equally applicable; parol proof is then resorted to) to show to which of the two. the deed was intended to be given. Lord <em>Cheneyes' </em>case (5 <em>Co. Rep. </em>68.b.) is the earliest case on the subject, and has never, been do\u00fabtedi I cannot think it was necessary for the defendant td prove that there were two persons, in existence, at the time sf the trial, of the name of <em>Peter Shultze, </em>jit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>order to be let in to show that the lessor of the plaintiff was not the patentee. There, undoubtedly, was such A man, who in the army of the <em>United States, </em>in the line of this state ; this is proved by the letters patent; then why was it not admissible to the defendant, to show that <em>Peter Shultze </em>of <em>Mhinebeck </em>was a different man ? It seems to me, that the proof that there was another <em>Peter Shultze </em>living at the time of the trial was making no progress in disaffirming the pretension set up by the plaintiff, that his lessor was the patentee, when at clearly appeared that this <em>Peter Shultze </em>could not possibly be the patentee; the only effect of this was to show, what required no proof, that there are many persons in the state of the same Christian and surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In this action, whenever the plaintiff introduces a deed conveying the premises to a person of the name of his lessor, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that the lessor is the real grantee ; \"the burden of disproving this, and repelling the presumption, is thrown on the defendant, and he may prove that the deed was granted to a different person of the same name. If it be not so, then any man who can find a deed on record, to a person of the same name, may use it for very mischievous purposes\u00bb' If the lessor of the plaintiff is not the patentee, then he has no title to the lot; and may not the defendant who is in possession, and can protect himself against every one but the true owner, show all the necessary facts to make out that the lessor has no title to the premises ? Such proof does not vary or contradict the deed, but is perfectly consistent with it. It admits the grant to have been correct, but shows that the lessor Is not what he assumes to be, the person to whom it was made, and that he has no right, not being the patentee, to'turn the defendant out of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Without being influenced at all by the evidence that there was another <em>Peter Shultze </em>in existence at the time of the trial, or a few years before, my opinion proceeds on the ground that the lessor of the plaintiff is proved not to be the patentee, and I hold that proof to have been correctly given\u00bb</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b533-7\">Thompson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT96\">I concur in giving judgment for the defendant. I had come to a different conclusion, supposing that this case could not be distinguished from the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>(12 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 77.) But, as I dissented from the opinion of the court in that case, and my brethren who were parties lo it, thinking it is not in the way here, I feel no hesitation in \u2019saying the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, I put it on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>ground, however, that 'neither <em>Peter .\u2022 Shultze, </em>the lessor of tita plaintiff, nor the other <em>Peter .'Shultze </em>mentioned in the case, was the person'intended as the patentee. it appearing, by the. case\u00bf without \u201centering particularly into the .testimony,, that the latter \u25a0was not born at the commencement, of. the revolution, and the former-not, coming within the description of the persons'-men* tioned in the act of the legislature, under which the'patent was issued, and <em>to which it refers. </em>That-the identity -of'\u2018the patentee, is a matter that may be inquired ipto in this 'collateral, way, is settled by the case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>136.,) and which\u2018cas\u00e9 I understand it.was not intended ,to'overrule by the decision in <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hart. </em>An inquiry asto the idea* tity.of.the patentee, dpes noty in ,any manner, contradict, or make void, the patent; nor does it imply.that there is not a person <em>in es.se </em>capable of taking under the grant, ft only goes to show that-the person claiming to be the .patentee was not. such person. If it should appear that he was the .person in\u00bb tended, \u2019 the- inquiry must there'stop.If the C.ommissionei\u2019s of the land office had mistaken their powers, and made a grant to a person not coming within the description in the act, and the patent was sought to be vacated on that .ground, there; can be no doubt that it must be done by some direct judicial pro* eeeding. But an inquiry into the-identity of a patentee, would not come within the scope' of a' <em>scire facias. ' </em>This can- only arise when some person comes forward to assert a right und'\u00e9r' the patent; it is then, and then only, that it can be objected to him, that he is not- the patentee, although he may have the same name. It is altogether a mistake that such, an inquiry Is an attempt to vacate the patent.' It leaves it in full force and effect, according .to its original intention and operation. This is not a naked grant to <em>Peter Schultze. </em>The .patent refers to-the act under which it was issued, containing a description of-the persons'intended to be embraced within the bounty of the legislature. This may be considered as matter of description adopted by the patent, and which necessarily opens the door to let in the inquiry,- whether the -person claiming to be the patentee answers such description ? The identity Of the-grantee. as well as of the thing granted, must, generally speaking, partake, more, or less, of a latent ambiguity, explainable by testi* mp\u00e1y, <em>dehors </em>the grant.; It cannot be that this inquiry, is restricted to the single case of ambiguity occasioned, -by there-appearing to be- two persons bearing the name of the patented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>1 can discover no sound reason for such restriction, and I am persuaded that the rule, thus understood, is too limited to meet all the cases that may arise, necessarily requiring its applieation. It is, therefore, upon the broad ground that it is always open to a defendant in ejectment to show that the lessor of the plaintiff is not the person intended by the patent under which he sets up his claim, although he may bear the same name, Shat I concur in the judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ2\">Judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
