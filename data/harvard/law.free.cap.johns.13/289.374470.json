This certificate <em>Mooney, </em>for the consideration of 50 dollars, assigned to the defendant, in fee, on the 17th of <em>April, </em>1814. The south half of the said lot was levied \"upon\" and sqld, under a judgment and execution against <em>Mooney, </em>to one <em>Job Williams, </em>and the deed from the sheriff was dated the 5th of <em>Movember, </em>1807. <em>Williams </em>permitted <em>Mooney </em>to remain, in possession after the sale, for about one year, on his promising to surrender the possession to <em>Williams, </em>and deliver him the certificate. He delivered the possession, but retained the certiiicate. On the 4th of <em>September, </em>1810, <em>Williams </em>conveyed to one <em>Foot, </em>in fee, and <em>Foot </em>conveyed to the plaintiff, and <em>Samuel, </em>his son, by d\u00e9ed, which was not dated, but which was proved to have'been delivered in the fall of 1813. After the plaintiff\u2019s purchase, the defendant, by threats to dispossess the plaintiff, obtained from him a judgment bond for 200 dollars, as a con, sidetation for relinquishing the certificate to him, and the like sum from one <em>Peck, </em>the owner of the north half of the lot. It was provea that the defendant, at the time he took the assignment from <em>Mooney, </em>was fully, aware of the nature of his title.

It is material to observe, that, long before the defendant\u2019s purchase, <em>Mooney </em>voluntarily surrendered the possession of the land to <em>Williams, </em>under whom the plaintiff claims, after having been <em>Williams\u2019s </em>tenant for a year. Two questions arise upon the merits of this case. 1st. Whether the purchase by the defendant was of a pretended right or title within the statute ; and, 2nd. If it is, what shall be the amount of the recovery, 400 dollars, or 1,000 dollars ? -</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">1st. The words of the statute are, that no person shall buy or sell any <em>pretended right or title, </em>or make, or take, any promise, grant, or covenant, to have <em>any right or title </em>of any person to any lands, &amp;c. Under this statute, it is well settled that it is immaterial whether the right or title purchased, or sold, be good or bad; for if it be ever so good, if the vendor is not.in possession, nothing passes by the deed, and the case comes within the statute. It has also been held, that the sale of a copyhold estate, or giving a lease for years, when the vendor or lessor is not in possession, is within the- statute. Lord <em>Coke </em>says, 4f the words of the statute be, <em>any pretendedright, </em>and, therefore, a lease for years is within the statute; for the statute saith not <em>the right, </em>but <em>any right, </em>and the offender shall forfeit the whole value of the land.\u201d\u2019 And again: \u201c Also the, statute speaks of <em>any </em>right or title to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>land. A customary.right, or a pretence thereof to lands hold'en by 'copy,, is within this, statute^\u2019 (Co. LittJ369. \u00e1. and b.) The statute intended to prohibit the-sale of pretended rights, by which the possession of another-might be disturbed. And- it \u00a1appears'-tame -that a purchase like the present is fully within the meaning and, spirit, as it indisputably is\" within the words of, the act\u00ab The defendant, by getting possession of the surveyor-general\u2019s certificate, and the assignment of it by <em>Mooney, </em>had. it in his power, perhaps, to defeat th'e plain tiff\u2019s, right, or, at all events, to. give him great -trouble and vexation in perfecting his title\u00bb It was a dormant and abandoned claim of <em>Mooney, </em>which the defendant bought .for the express purpose of harassing the plaintiff, and to disturb his right and possession. The case Shows,'.that, by virtue of this very, purchase the.defendant extort* \u00e9d a considerable sum, of money from the plaintiff by threatening to dispossess him. , ,</p>\n<p id=\"AnMv\">' '2d- W\u00e9 have more than once decided that when.a persbn enter* ed, and was in possession, under an agreement- to phrchase-aii: entire lot or piece'of land, and cultivated and improved a part,, claiming the whole as his own, that he was to-be deemed to be in the actual possession of the whole, and that a deed,given by a stranger, though he had a good title, was inoperative. The assignment in this case is of&gt; the whole lot described in the sur* yeyor-general\u2019s certificate,' and there is no. pretence for saying that <em>Mooney </em>Was in possession of any part of it. He had,-in\u2019 fact,, actually surrendered\u2019 the possession <em>m Williams, </em>long be*, fore the defendant, purchased from him his pretended; right\u00bb. The\u2019 defendant was fully apprised of \u00a1the actual, situation of the. lot, \u00bf.ild bought \u25a0 it with full knowledge of the plaintiff \u2019s . sights. I do not see,, therefore, upon what;ground it can, be contended that the defendant is not liable for the value of the - entire Jot, if he is liable at all. I am of opinion, therefore, fhat the- plaintiff is entitled to judgment for 1,000 dollars, being tjje value of the whole lot, as found by the jury,</p>\n<p id=\"AXl\">Thompson, Ch. J.? and Yates, J\u201e were of the same opinion,</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-10\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Ag2\">Spenceb, J\u201e</author>\n<p id=\"Ahv8\">dissented, observing, that the case presented iacts establishing a fraud, rath\u00e9r than an offence against the. statute. It is conceded, that be the title ever-so valid, if th\u00e9 lands lb.e held adversely- to that, title, it wrpuld; b,e champerty to pur*. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>chase such valid title; but if the title purchased be valid, and the land is held under, or subservient to, that title, it would not be champerty. It is held not to be sufficient to show that the seller had not been in possession a year before, without averring that he had a pretended right or title, because that is the point of the action. (2 <em>Hawk. </em>b. 1. ch. 86. s. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The intent of the statute was to prevent any person, having a disputed title, from conveying it-to strangers. <em>(Bac. Abr. Maintenance, </em>E.)</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Here we are warranted in saying, that the plaintiff knew that the lands had been taken up by <em>Mooney, </em>under the surveyor-general\u2019s certificate, and that it was sold under the <em>fi. fa. </em>against <em>Mooney, </em>in subserviency to that right; and we must say, that the plaintiff acquired, by his purchase, the bare right of possession, subject to the right of the state. This is, then, not a case within the purview of the statute ; the right of the state was not a pretended right; for the plaintiff held under the state without any title, and not having acquired by his purchase a right to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Again, the defendant taking an assignment of the surveyor-general\u2019s certificate was not taking a <em>promise, grant, or </em>cove<em>nant to have any right or title; </em>the operation of law might be, that he would obtain a grant by the production of the certificate and the payment of the price of the land, yet it- was not in itself a <em>promise, grant, or covenant, </em>that he should have the land. This is a penal statute, and to bring the defendant within it, he must be brought within the very terms. I cannot view the case as within either branch of the statute, and, therefore,., think the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\"><em>Platt, </em>J., was of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
