Then, were not <em>Petion </em>and <em>Christophe </em>foreign princes, or sovereigns, and their territories foreign states, within the meaning of this act ? It is notorious that the whole island of <em>Hispanioia, </em>or <em>St. </em>Domingo, has been independent of <em>France </em>and <em>Spain </em>for above 19 years. The mother countfy has not, during that period, exercised dominion over that island. It is enough that there was a regular government, <em>defacto, </em>exercised there, independent of the mother country, to bring the case within the mischief intended to be prevented by the statute. No matter the form of the government, or the extent of the territory, might be, so long as it is a sovereign and independent state\u00bf Petion,or <em>Christophe, </em>in consequence of this ship being sent to the one or the other, might have deemed it an act of hostility \u00cd and have fitted out cruisers to capture the vessels of the <em>United States, </em>an evil which the act of congress was intended to prevent. Nations; or states, according to <em>Vattel,* </em>are societies of men united together for their mutual safety/ and advantage. \u25a0 The island of <em>Hayti </em>contains near a million of inhabitants. The present governments are as regular and enlightened as most of the boasted governments of the world. That of <em>Petion </em>is modelled after that of the <em>United States; </em>and the wisdom and moderation of <em>their\"president </em>have been highly extolled. <em>Christophe </em>is a king, and the monarchy is hereditary, and is supported by orders of nobility and officers of state. Each government maintains a regular army of 40,000 men. Parochial schools are established throughout the. whole island of <em>Hayti $ </em>an institution superior to any to be found in <em>Europe.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is impossible to regard them any longer as colonies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">For the objects of the statute, it is not essential that the goverriment of the <em>United States </em>should recognise and publicly acknowledge the independence of the government of either of these sovereigns; the mischief intended to be prevented might equally exist. It was a measure of policy in our government^ When, at the instance of the <em>French </em>government*, in 1805, <em>tit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>1806;, it prohibited all intercourse with that part of the island of S\u00ed.- <em>Domingo, </em>formerly'subject to <em>France. </em>.It was-,dicta ted by, the fear of occasioning a rupture with <em>France. - </em>That act, therefore, .furnishes no evidence of the real opinion of this government a!s \u2022to-the independence of <em>St \u00bfDomingo, </em>The <em>British </em>government, though-it made no- positive declaration on the subject, has r\u00e9cognised ports -or places in <em>St. Domingo, </em>as <em>not under the dominion of France </em>j and on that ground vess\u00e9ls, carrying on, trade' to <em>St- Domingo, </em>have been acquitted in the court of admiralty, as ...not subject to the penalties .of trading from an <em>enemy'*s colony;.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> j </em>i _ \u00b0 <em>u </em>When- a- nation becomes divided,^5 s\u00e1ys <em>Vattel</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>into two . , <em>\" </em>.parties-absolutely independent,, and no longer acknowledging a -common superior,, the state is dissolved, and the war between the two parties, in every respect, is the-same with that of a {public war between two different nations.\u201d ' They are. to be regarded;by foreign nations,-as equally independent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOnc\">- - Though the court gave judgment against -the. plea, on the de-m-urrer.

But it will be said that the decree of the district court of the <em>United States </em>is conclusive, against the justification set up by. the:.defendants. The .defendants'were not parties, to that decision, either in name or interest. The libel was in the name of the-<em>United. States,, </em>against the ship called the <em>dlmeric'an Eagle,; </em>her tackle, fee.,, and the prosecution was carried,-on by the attorney of the <em>United States. </em>It is the duty of the attorney of the <em>United Stales </em>to,prosecute, all offences against the laws; and the .revenue officers are required to make seizure pone half-of the,penalty goes to, the informer ;, biit jt is not. stated in..the bill of except-i.orls, and -it nowhere appears, that tfae.defehdant-s were, the informers', if the decree of the district court is to be held conclus-ive, it will violate -the well-known principle, that no- man shall be condemned unheard. But, admitting the general rule to be that, the sentence of a court of exclusive jurisdiction,, dir\u00e9,etl.y on. the ' point,, is conclusive, upon the, same matter coming incidentally in question in a civil case, in another court; yet there-, is an acknowledged distinction between a sentence of conviction; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>or condemnation, and a judgment of <em>acquittal.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An acquittal does not ascertain any precise fact; it may be that sufficient evidence was not produced on the part of the public prosecutor. <em>\u201c </em>A conviction is conclusive evidence of the fact, but an acquittal, as <em>Bulhr </em>observes, is no proof of the reverse.\u201d A-verdict on a criminal proceeding, as an indictment for an assault and bat-A \u00b0 . . . . tery, libel, &amp;c., is not conclusive in a <em>civil </em>suit for the private injury. The case of <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shearman and </em>others,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> will be cited on the other side, as to this question; but it will be seen, that Mr. Justice <em>Blackstone, </em>who gave the reasons for the decision, puts it on the ground that the plaintiff was a party in interest in the proceedings in the court of exchequer. Lord <em>Coice, </em>in <em>Bunting </em>v. <em>Lepingwel,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>gives a very quaint reason for regarding the sentence of the <em>ecclesiastical </em>court as conclusive, namely, <em>cuilibet in sua arte perito est credendum ; </em>it is a reason that would hardly be admitted at the present day. The truth is, that this notion has grown up in <em>England, </em>from respect paid to the decisions of certain courts of peculiar jurisdiction ; as, in regard to their <em>ecclesiastical </em>courts, Lord <em>Coke </em>observes, \u201c the judges of our law ought (although it be against the reason of our jaw) to give faith and credit to their proceedings and sentences, and to think that their proceedings are consonant to the law of holy church.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b157-6\">But, we contend, that this whole doctrine, as to the conclusiveness of the sentences of courts of peculiar jurisdiction, has been broken down by the decision of the <em>court of errors, </em>in the case of <em>Vandenheuvelv. The United Ins. Co.</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The same reasons, and the same authorities, were urged by the judges of the supreme court, in that case, in favour of the conclusiveness of foreign sent\u00e9nees, as are stated in support of the conclusiveness of the decisions of courts of peculiar jurisdiction; nay, there were other and stronger reasons brought forward in favour of the former, which cannot be applied to the latter. If, then, by the decision of the court of last resort^ in this state, the whole doctrine as to the conclusiveness of foreign sentences is done away, a <em>fortiori, </em>must the rule, as to the conclusiveness of the decrees of courts of <em>peculiar </em>jurisdiction, be deemed as abrogated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-7\"><em>Colden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArEg\">1.

Thus, these defendants could blow hot and cold, as best suited their purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">But we contend, that the question of forfeiture or not, has been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, and all parties are now concluded by that decision. It is a settled rule of law, that where a court proceeds <em>in rem, </em>its decision, as to the property, is conclusive; and the right cannot be tried over again.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It is said, however, that a sentence of acquittal is not equally conclusive ; but <em>Peake, </em>in the third edition of Ills treatise on <em>Evidence,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>takes further notice of this distinction, and recognises the case cited from <em>Finer, </em>before Baron <em>Price, </em>that an <em>acquittal </em>in the exchequer was conclusive; and the case of <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Dig-bey, </em>cited by <em>Buller, (N.

They never intended, as has been suggested, to subvert the whole law on this subject. It would be attended with most oppressive and mischievous consequences, if courts of justice, of distinct and competent jurisdictions, were not to respect the judgments of each other, directly on the same subject, between the same parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-6\">If this court now admit the evidence offered, it will be contrary to their judgment pronounced on the general demurrer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the plea.

The bill of exceptions, taken- at the trial, presents two points for the consideration of the-'court': \u2022 '/</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">- -Iv Was there sufficient evidence of property in the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. 3. Ought the\" evidence, overruled at the trial, to have been admitted either in mitigation of damages, or as a bar to the suit ?</p>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">With respect- to the first point, the bill of exceptions states,, that the plaintiff gave in-evidence, that, at the time of the seizure of the ship <em>-American Eagle,-by- ike </em>defendants, she was in the ac-; tual, full, and peaceable possession of the plaintiff ; and that, on. the acquittal of the vessel in 'the district court, it Was decreed that she should be restored to the plaintiff the claimant of the vessel in that court; and the plaintiff th\u00e9ri gave.in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>dence the proceedings in the district court, by which the above facts fully appeared. In this stage of the cause, and after the plaintiff had proved the seizure of the ship by the defendants, and her value, a motion was made by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that the plaintiff should be nonsuited, on the ground that there was not sufficient evidence to entitle the plaintiff to a verdict, no right or title having been shown in the plaintiff to the ship. We are of opinion that the motion for a nonsuit was correctly overruled. It is a general and undeniable principle, that possession is a sufficient title to the plaintiff in an action of trespass, <em>vi et armis, </em>against a wrong doer. (1 <em>East\u2019s Rep. </em>244. <em>3 Burr. </em>1563. <em>Willes\u2019s Rep. </em>221. <em>Esp. Dig. </em>403. <em>Gould\u2019s </em>edit, part 2. 289.) The finder of an article may maintain trespass against any person but the real owner; and a person having an illegal possession, may support this action against any person other than the true owner. (1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Pl. </em>168. 2 <em>Saund. </em>47. <em>d.) </em>If these principles are applied to this case, it will appear, at once, that the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s right to the ship was very ample. He was not only in the actual, full, and peaceable possession of this ship, but he was the claimant of her in the district court; and she has been awarded to him by a sentence of that court. The defendants make this objection without a pretence of right, on their part, as they stand before the court in the character of <em>tort-feasors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">In the progress of the cause, the plaintiff proved himself to be the owner of the ship; and even if it was admitted that the proof before given was. insufficient, a new trial ought not to be awarded on the ground of want of proof of title in the plaintiff, when that very proof was befoi\u2019e the jury, and is now spread on the record. In no point of view have the defendants entitled themselves to a new trial on this part of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Under the second exception, it has been urged, that the matters set forth in the notice ought to have been admitted in mitigation of damages, and as a bar to the suit. They were overruled in both respects; first, because they formed no bar to the suit; and, secondly, because the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had distinctly stated and admitted, that the defendants had not been influenced by any <em>malicious </em>motives in making the seizure, and that they had not acted therein with any view or design of oppressing or injuring the plaintiff. The presiding judge held that such admission precluded the plaintiff from claiming any damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>against the defendants <em>by way </em>of punishment or smart money, arid that after such admission the plaintiff could recover only the actual damages sustained, and he gave that direction to the jury*</p>\n<p id=\"Arvm\">The defendants have no cause of complaint, that the facts set out in the notice were not admitted' in mitigation of damages; for the admission made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, was held t\u00f3\u00a1 \u25a0preclude him from recovering any thing-beyond the actual damages sustained. If the matters- contained irt' the notice do not'bar the plaintiff\u2019s recoyery, he was entitled, at all events, to recover his actual damages ; and it is not pretended that he has recovered beyond that amount*</p>\n<p id=\"AFf\">The-question, then,, presents itself, and it is the only grave one in the case, whether the matters contained in the notice, if proved^ would operate as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s /right; of action.. -This question, in the st\u00e1te -of the present record; w\u00e9 should be justified in refusing to hear discussed.' The pleas in bar embrace the same matters insisted on in the notice. These pleas have .been.-demurred to, and have been adjudged to be bad* It is true . there <em>was </em>not an argument Upon them, but it was hot a judgment oy'default. When the cause was called, the defendants5 counsel' appeared, and declined to arg\u00fce them, whereupon judgment was given-, for the plaintiff, on the defendants\u2019 counsel declining the argument. This act can be viewed in no other light than as-evincing a consciousness, on the part of the counsel, that the pleas were not to be supported.; and it is a well-settled principle of practice, -that no court will hear the merits of a case discussed after judgment. Virtually, we have -already declared the pleas bad, -and we should be justified in refusing to hear counsel tell us that a. decision in the same cause is incorrect. We \u2018were disposed, however, as it had been suggested that this cause wbuld not probably rest here, to hear <em>the </em>points argued; and; oil two grounds, w\u00e9 are' decidedly of opinion, .that. the facts stated in \u2018the notice, ifp\u00edov\u00e9d, ought not to preclude the plaintiff\u2019s recoyery. We believe that the sentence of r'esti-' tution, in the district court, is final and conclusive; that sentence not having been appealed'from; and still remaining in full force*</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It appears that this ship \\vaslibelled, as forfeited, to the <em>United States, </em>on the ground that she was fitted out at <em>New-York, </em>with the intent that She should be employed in the service of a foreign state, to wit, that part of the island of <em>St. Domingo </em>which was-tinder the government of <em>JPetion, </em>to commit hostilities upon the - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Subjects of another foreign state,\"with which the <em>United State's </em>of <em>America </em>were then at peace, to wit, that part of the island \u00f3f <em>St. Domingo </em>which was then under the government of <em>Christ'ophe, </em>contrary to the statute in th\u00e1t case provided. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AOi\">The plaintiff appeared before the district court, as fclaimant of the ship, and filed his answer to the libel; and, on full hearing; the libel was dismissed,- and the ship was decreed to be restored to the plaintiff; and a Certificate of reasonable cause for the seizure was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">It would seem, at once, to be unjust and improper, in an action brought to recover damages for the seizure of property, after it has been restored by the sentence of a court of competent jurisdiction, for any other court, and, especially, a common-law' court, to rehear the case, and to examine again into the propriety \u00f3f the sentence, in a collateral manner.. It would impugn a very salutary maxim, <em>nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa ; </em>and it would overturn the well-settled principle, that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, proceeding upon a: tnatter of which it had cognizance, cannot be impeached collaterally, but that it stands firm until vacated or reversed. But Upon authority, without regarding the unreasonableness of the principle contended for, the sentence in this case is conclusive* In <em>Scott v. Shearman and others, </em>(2 <em>Wm. Bl. Rep. </em>977.,) trespass was brought against custom-house officers for breaking and entering the plaintiff\u2019s house, and taking away his goods. The defendants gave in evidence a copy of the record.of condemnation of the court of exchequer, condemning \u00e1 quantity of geneva, (the goods taken from the plaintiff,) and the principal question was, whether this was Conclusive. Justice <em>Bladkstone </em>delivered the unanimous opinion of the court, that the condemnation was conclusive evidence to all the world that the, goods were liable to be seized, and, therefore, the action would not lie. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In <em>Henshaw </em>v. <em>Pleasance and others, </em>(2 <em>Wm. Bl. Rep. </em>1176.,) <em>Le Grey, </em>Ch. Justice, <em>Gould </em>and <em>Nares, </em>Justices, referring to the case-of <em>Scott Shearman, </em>say, it has been uniformly held, for above a century, that a condemnation of goods, in the exchequer, is conclusive evidence against all the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">It has been suggested, by <em>Peake, </em>that a judgment of acquittal does not seem to have so strong an operation-in favour of the party; but, in reference to a case like the present, we perceive no reason for thedistinction, nor can such a distinction-be sup\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ported by authorities. In an action \u25a0 of <em>trover </em>for a parcel of\u201d brandy, before Baron <em>Price, Trinity </em>vacation, 1716, an information in the name of the attorney general, in the exchequer,- and an acquittal thereupon, and a judgment were given in evidence, the brandy being seized, Sec.; to which the other side objected ; but the judge refused to admit any evidence against this determination, or to let the parties in to contest the fact over again which had been tried on the information. (12 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>95. <em>A. </em>b. 22. pl. 1.) In <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Sholl, </em>(5 <em>Term Rep. </em>255.,) Lord <em>Kenyon, </em>unhesitatingly, declared, that a judgment of acquittal, in the exchequer, being a judgment <em>in rem, </em>was conclusive as to the question of the illegality of the caption. In <em>Meadows and wife </em>v. <em>The Dutchess of Kingston, (Amb. </em>756.,) a bill was filed in chancery, stating the will of the Duke of <em>Kingston, </em>the devise by him of his personal estate to the defendant and his wife; that it ivas founded on fraud committed by the defendant, in imposing herself on the duke as a single woman, thereby inducing him to marry her, when at the- time she was the wife of a Mr. <em>Hervey, </em>and incapable of becoming the wife of the duke, praying an account of the personal estate of the duke, &amp;c. &amp;c. The defendant, among other things, pleaded a suit in the <em>consistorial court of London, </em>instituted <em>by\u00a1 </em>her against <em>Mi'. </em>Herveyv for jactitation of marriage, and a cross allegation by Mr. <em>Hervey, </em>that he was married to her; and that, upon hearing the cause, the judge, by his definitive and final sentence, declared that the defendant then was a spinster, and free from all matrimonial contracts or espousals, more especially with <em>Hervey. </em>This plea was argued, and Lord Chancellor <em>Apsley </em>held the sentence of the <em>corisistorial </em>court to be conclusive; and he laid down the rule to be, that whenever a matter comes to be tried in a collateral way, the decree, sentence, or judgment, of any court having competent jurisdiction, shall be received as conclusive evidence of the matter so determined. The only distinction he admitted was, where the sentence is not <em>ex directo ; </em>if it be not, it seems not to be conclusive. <em>(Peake, </em>3d edit. 76\u201480., and notes, where other cases are cited.) In the present case the question was direct; was this ship forfeited for the causes set forth in the libel ? The answer of the district court is, \u201c she was not.\u201d We, therefore, have no hesitation to say, that, in a case like the present, the sentence of acquittal is conclusive that the seizure was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>It was suggested, on the argument, that the decision in the district court is to be regarded as the sentence of a foreign court, and is, therefore, examinable; but that court cannot be so considered. It is a court held in and for the district of <em>New-York, </em>It is a court constituted under the constitution and laws of the <em>United States, </em>and it is just as much a <em>domestic </em>tribunal as this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">If, however, the question of the legality of the seizure could be inquired into, we are equally clear that the matters relied on by the defendants cannot avail them. The supposed ground of the forfeiture of this ship has been already stated; it was that she was fitted out within the <em>United States, </em>with intent that she should be employed in the service of a foreign state, to wit, that part of <em>St. Domingo </em>which was under the government of <em>Petion, </em>to commit hostilities upon the subjects of another foreign state with which the <em>United States </em>were then at peace, to wit, that part of <em>St. Domingo </em>which was then under the government of <em>Christophe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">To work a forfeiture of this ship under the act of congress, <em>(L. U. S. </em>vol. 3. p. 88.,) it was incumbent on the defendants to make out that that part of <em>St. Domingo </em>which was under the government of <em>Petion, </em>as also that part -which was under the government of <em>Christophe, </em>were, respectively, independent states, within the meaning of the act. On this part of the case, this court adopt the opinion expressed by Chief Justice <em>Marshall, </em>in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Himley, </em>(4 <em>Cranch, </em>272.) \u201c The colony of <em>St. Domingo, </em>originally belonging to <em>France, </em>had broken the bond that connected her with the parent state, and declared herself independent, and was endeavouring to support that independence by arms. <em>France </em>still asserted her claim of sovereignty, and had employed a military force in support of that sovereignty. A war, <em>defacto, </em>then, unquestionably existed between <em>France </em>and <em>St. Domingo. </em>It has been argued that .the colony having declared itself a sovereign state, and having thus far maintained its sovereignty, by arms, must be considered and treated, by other nations, as sovereign in fact, and as being entitled to maintain the same intercourse with the world that is maintained by other belligerent nations. In support of this argument the doctrines of <em>Valid </em>have been particularly referred to; but the language of that writer is obviously addressed to sovereigns, not to courts. It is /or government to decide whether they will consider <em>St. Do</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>mingo </em>as an independent nation ; p\u00fcd until such decision shall be made, or <em>France </em>shall relinquish her claim, courts of justice must, consider, the appien-t state of .things \u00e1s, remaining unialter.ed, pnd 'the sovereign powqr of France..oyer that colony as still sub? sisting.\u201d ......</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Op the trial of this cause it was proved that, under the non* intercourse act, as Iqte as 1809, vessels and cargoes were libelled, on the seizure of the defendants, for. holding intercourse with <em>St. Doirdngo,. </em>as a dependency of. <em>France jr </em>andthat our government have sq considered that island is a matter of public, notoriety* if (these courts are to consider the sovereign power, of' <em>France </em>as still subsisting over that colony, the fitting out of this ship, as stated in the .pleas and .notice, .was not an infraction pf the statute; for'neither <em>Petio\u00ae </em>nor <em>Christ'ophe </em>were sovereign princes or states; and it was not, therefore, a fitting out with art intent, that this ship should be employed in the service of any foreign- prince or state, to- cruisp op commit, hostilities upon the-subjects,, citizens,or property of apy other foreign ppipce Or, statq^ with <em>whom-$\\&lt;s, United States, </em>were, at peace., . ,. . ;</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">Fop these reasons.
