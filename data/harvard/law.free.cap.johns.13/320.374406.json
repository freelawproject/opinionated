Upon examining the bill of exceptions, it purports to have been sealed by only two judges. This we think is not sufficient. Not less than three judges can form a court of common pleas. And as the bill of exceptions is not a part of the record, the decision complained of should at least appear to be made by a number which we can judicially notice as constituting a court. To permit a bill of exceptions to be sealed by one judge only, would be liable to great abuse; for although, regularly, a bill of exceptions must be tendered at the trial, yet it is, in practice, usually reduced to form, and sealed after-wards, and often in vacation. We think, therefore, that this is not such a bill of exceptions as we can notice, so as to justify the granting of the motion..</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
