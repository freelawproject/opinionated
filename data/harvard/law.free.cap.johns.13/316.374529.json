There can be no discontinuance,: unless it creates an adverse possession, so as to render an actual entry necessary, which was clearly not the case here. When the statute says the wife may enter, it means that her right of entry is saved, and she may enforce it by an action of ejectment. The notion of an actual entry by her is obsolete. ,</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-14\">As to the principal point raised in the cause,, whether the deed to <em>Blanchard </em>is an estoppel, we contend that the cases cited do not rest on the strict doctrine of estoppels,' The principle is, that a party h\u00e1ving no interest \u00e1t the time Of his conveyance, but acquiring a title afterwards, shall not be allowed to say he had no title when he first conveyed.. It does not appear how the tide was vested in <em>Samuel Stevens.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-15\">The deed from <em>E. Stevens </em>to <em>j.
