The declaration con- . i \u00b0 . 1 . . , tamed two counts; in the first it was alleged, that the deiendant had charged the plaintiff with stealing his shingles; and in the second count, that he had said that the plaintiff and one <em>Tucker </em>had stolen his shingles. The defendant below pleaded the general issue, and gave notice therewith that he should give in evidence on the trial, that he, the defendant, \u201c on leaving a house in <em>Whitestown, </em>demised to the plaintiff and <em>Joseph Tucker, </em>left on the premises two thousand shingles, with direcuon to one <em>John Mills </em>to sell the same; that afterwards the plaintiff solely, or with the said <em>Tucker, </em>without any authority x <em>J </em>_ 7 <em>\u00bb J </em>of the defendant, sold the shingles, and on the defendant\u2019s inquiring for the shingles, denied that he knew any thing about them, or what had become of them, and refused to account therefor; wherefore the defendant, on coming to the knowledge of the said facts, related the same, stating the circumstances, as he was warranted in doing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMO\">The cause was tried at the <em>March </em>term, 1816, of the court below, and, the plaintiff having made out his case, the defendant offered to prove, as a justification under the notice, that the <em>i 7 J 7 </em>charge of theft was true, and that the plaintiff had, in fact, been guilty of the charges made, which being objected to, the court overruled the testimony as a justification, op the ground that no notice, to that effect, had been given. The defendant then offered to prove the same fact in mitigation of damages, which the court also overruled. He then offered to prove the fact contained in the notice annexed to his plea, as an explanation of the charge, but offered no evidence whatever to show that any such explanation was given when the charges were made, which being objected to, the court overruled the same, and the jury found a verdict for the defendant in error.

Notice, under the statute, must apprise the opposite party of.every ma* terifil fact intended to be given in evidence. The statute (1. <em>N. R. L. 515.) </em>authorizes a defendant to plead the general issue, -and to give any special matter in evidence which, if plead* ed,, would he a bar to the action, giving notice with the plea', of the matter, pr s everal matters, so intended to be given in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-20\">The true way to test the sufficiency of a notice,, is to inquire whether the matters contained in it, if pleaded specially, would be good On general demurrer,* Applying that test to this case, the answer is obvious. The declaration alleges that the defendant below -charged the plaintiff below With- \u00e1 theft,'; and .tfi\u00e9 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>notice states that the plaintiff below sold the defendant\u2019s shingles, without authority, and that he, afterwards, denied that he knew any thing about the shingles. This, by no means, imputes a larceny, but rather the telling a lie. It is not stated that the, shingles were taken privately, or feloniously; and if they were not, a subsequent denial of taking them would not make the taking felonious. A notice need not partake of the form and strict technicality of a special plea, but it must contain the substance of \u00e1 plea; or, otherwise, what was intended for the ease and accommodation of one party, would operate most injuriously to the other, by surprising him with facts which he could not expect to meet. The ease of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Knies, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>142.,) contains the principle which I have endeavoured to elucidate.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">No principle is better established, than that the truth of slanderous words cannot be given in evidence under the general issue, either as a defence, or in mitigation of the damages..</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The facts offered to be proved on the trial of this case, under the notice, and in mitigation of damages, were irrelevant, and, therefore, correctly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
