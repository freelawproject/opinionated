On the 10th of <em>June, </em>she was boarded by an <em>English </em>privateer, and carried into <em>Portsmouth, </em>in <em>England, </em>where the master made his.protest: and being released by an order of the court of admiralty, he. sailed on the lllh of <em>July, </em>and arrived in <em>Flushing </em>roads on the 14th of <em>July, </em>when they took On board a pilot. An armed force was put on board, which, continued-on board until the ship reached <em>Antwerp, </em>and until the cargo was landed. There were two or three ships of war lying in <em>Flushing </em>roads at the dme-the , <em>J\\Iary </em>entered. there \u00bf and- she could not have gone to sea again without <em>being </em>boarded by some of them*. The armed force which came on board, inquii\u2019ed of the master, whether he had been in <em>England, </em>and he answered, that he had'been captured and carried in there,. Nothing was said about-his.being allowed Jo enter. and land his cargo at <em>Antwerp; </em>nor was he warned not to go there, or to any other port. The master stated, that he had no control over his ship, nor the power of directing where she should go, until after the cargo Was landed. That when the ship arrived at Antwerp, the custom-house officers, in consequence of the ship having been carried into <em>'England, </em>kept the firmed force on board of her, and, Refused to give permission to \u00ed\u00e1nd the cargo, until the.25th of <em>August, </em>when permission was received, as he Understood, from <em>Paris, </em>to land the cargo, on condition that- it should be deposited in the stores of the custom . house, Which was, accordingly, done. The armed force on bohrd he\u2019believed to be iVenc?imm,buthe neither understood nor .spoke <em>French </em>or <em>German. </em>On his cross exa mination, he verified a protest made by him fit <em>Antwerp, </em>and stated, that several <em>American </em>ships, were at <em>Antwerp, </em>in the same' situation, none of . which left that place with their cargoes. -He never inquired of,the consignee, or- any other' person, whether he could depart with, his cargo,, but waited for orders for landing it, and did land it, in pursuanee of orders received from the consignee, bn the ,25th' of <em>August, </em>and returned to <em>New-Yorkc </em>with the .ship in ballast.

He knevv nothing of any arrangement between the consignees and the <em>French </em>government about landing the cargo, nor of the. terms or conditions on which it was landed. That he did n\u00f3t know the reason why he did not state, in his protest, that the vessel was taken possession Of by an armed'forc\u00e9 in <em>Flushing </em>toads, but supposed, that he did not think it necessary.

The whole of their cargoes were put into <em>depot, </em>or the stores of the custom house, and were, afterwards, sold by the special order of the emperor, and the proceeds placed in his <em>caisse d\u2019amortissement, </em>or sinking fund.' That the <em>Mary </em>was consigned to <em>Parish Sr Co., </em>and he did not believe that she could have departed without a special order from the emperor, and he did not believe that any such order could have been obtained; and his impression was that the consignees did endeavour to obtain such permission, through the agents qf the gqvernment. The cargo of <em>the Mary </em>was placed, by the order of the director of the customs, in the <em>depot, </em>or custom-house stores, and under the dires<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of- the officers of the customs.

For, if the <em>French </em>government .refused permission to land the cargo, the legal consequence was, that the vessel had a right to depart with her cargo, and seek another market; arid if permission for landing the cargo was: granted, with a full knowledge that the vessel had come from art; <em>English </em>port, such consent '(by, the emperor himself, as in this case) would be a revocation of that decide, in.regard to that particular ship and cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The 8th article of the <em>Berlin </em>decree provides, accordingly, that, \u201c every yessel'.contravening the above clause,, by means of a '.false'declaration, shall be seized j and the Vessel and cargo confiscated,'as if they were <em>English </em>property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7qD\">I can, therefore, see no ground to suppose that the cargo of the J/ary was seized and condemned fora violation of the <em>Bertin </em>decree ; especially as the decree of c\u00f3nd\u00e9mnation does not allege <em>that </em>\u00e1s th\u00e9 cause. If the assured had committed an infraction, of the <em>Berlin </em>decree, why was the <em>ship </em>permitted to depart? The penalty of that decree.was a fiprfeiture of the <em>vessel, </em>as well as her <em>cargo. </em>\u00a1 ' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"A-pr\">It is observable, that the <em>condemnation </em>of this cargo was not until <em>after </em>the <em>Milan </em>decreeof the 11th of <em>November, </em>1807,. although the <em>sequestration </em>was long before that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">The, <em>Milan </em>decree declares all foreign vessels' <em>lawful </em>prize\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>which have submitted to be searched by an <em>English </em>ship, or have come from an <em>English </em>port. '</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The fair presumption is, that, in condemning this cargo, the emperor exercised a special arbitrary power, <em>ex post facto, </em>inasmuch as the case of the <em>Mary </em>was exactly within the policy of the <em>Milan </em>decree, although she came into the <em>French </em>port fifteen months before the date of that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">There is, therefore, no evidence of \u00e1 breach of warranty,' on the part of the assured, against \u201c <em>illicit </em>.and <em>prohibited trade.\u2122</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\"><em>. </em>But if the landing of the cargo were the voluntary and unconstrained act of the consignees, having the free election, either to send away the cargo, or to land it, then it is clear that the defendants are not liable, because their risk terminated upon the safe and unrestrained landing of the goods insured, at the port of destination. &lt;</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">That the cargo was sequestered, and, afterwards, sold by order of the <em>French </em>government, is Undeniable ; and the only material inquiry is resolved into a question of fact, viz. Was the seizure, or sequestration, in this case, <em>before the landing of the cargo ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The testimony of <em>Richards, </em>the master, upon his direct examination, is clear and explicit, that when <em>the,Mary </em>arrived in <em>Flushing </em>roads, there were two or three ships of war there ; that an armed force was put on board the <em>Mary; </em>.that they inquired of him whether he had been in <em>England; </em>that he informed them he had been captured and carried in there; that the armed force continued on board until the arrival of the ship at <em>Antwerp, </em>and until the landing of the cargo ; and that he never had the control of the ship, nor the power of directing where she should go, until after the cargo was landed ; that, on the 25th 6f <em>August, </em>1807, (he understood,) permission was given to land the cargo, on condition that it should be deposited in the stores of the custom house ; and it was landed and deposited accordingly. . \u2022 -</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The credit, of the master is in some degree impeached by his Confused and incoherent answers to the cross interrogatories ; but it is strongly corroborated by the testimony of <em>Jacob Ridge-way, </em>then <em>American </em>consul residing at <em>Antwerp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">He swears, that, at the time when the <em>Mary </em>lay at Antwerp, with her cargo on board, there' were six other <em>American </em>vessels, with their cargoes, also lying there, all having, like the <em>Mary, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>touched ai an <em>English </em>port on their <em>voyage to Antwerp ; </em>that four of those vessels were consigned to himself; and the other three, including' the <em>Mary, </em>were consigned to <em>David Parish 8r Co. </em>He further swears, <em>*i </em>that the said vessels* which came addressed to his house, and which had touched' at <em>English </em>ports in their passage out, were not permitted to depart with their cargoes ; that he demanded permission for the departure of their cargoes j the .first demand w.as made to the director of the customs,, and afterwards to the emperor of <em>France, </em>through the medium of his -minister,, <em>all without </em>effect.\u201d 'He further testifies,.that,' &lt;?.to the best'of .his \"knowledge and belief, the whole of-the cargoes of those, seven vessels were put into the depot, or custom-house stores, and were, afterward's, sold by a <em>special order at </em>the emperor, and the funds arising from-the sales placed in his <em>caisse d'amortissemsnt.'' \u25a0 , ' '</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU_\">With regard to the ship Mary,. he says, \u201c I do. not believe it was possible for her to have departed from <em>Antwerp, </em>with her e,argo* for any other port, without the special, permission of the emperor of France... I do not believe that any such permission could have been obtained ; and the impression on my mind is, that the consignees (of the Mary) did make efforts to obtain such, permission.\u201d, <em>Mr. Ridgeway </em>further testifies, that \u201c the caigo of the A\u00edary was deposited by Order of the directors of the customs in the depot* or custom-house stores, and under the control of the custom-house officers. The consignees could not, to the best of;his knowledge and belief, either sell or deliver said cargoand \u201c this cargo' was sold by <em>special order </em>from the empeior;\u201d that the reason assigned by the custom-house' officers}for not permitting <em>American </em>vessels that.had either, been boarded- by <em>British </em>ships of war, or touched at <em>British </em>ports, to depart with their cargoes, was, that they could not do it without the special permission of the emperor,\u201d He further adds, that e the cargoes of the seven vessels' were all landed and put into the depot, under -sequestration,, as; he believes, contrary to the wishe.s-ofthecpnsigne.es.\u201d \u25a0 . '</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">' <em>Ridgeway's </em>official station afforded, him the best means-of knowing,, and it was his duty, as <em>American </em>consul, to ascertain the truth on that point. He swears, that on inquiry' at. the proper, office, he was-told, that \u201c <em>American vessels </em>haying touched in <em>England''' </em>could not be permitted to depart with-their cargoes, without special permission of the emperor. I consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>this declaration as strong evidence, in itself, of \u201c restraint,\u201d upon this vessel, to which the language of the public officer was expressly applicable. *' Arbitrary restraint of princes\u2019\u2019 is often exercised in an equivocal and insidious manner; and it may not be the less certain, although the evidence of it be not frankly and palpably addressed to our senses. The testimony of <em>Ridgeway, </em>although less positive and direct* in regard to the <em>Mary, </em>is positive proof, to show that.the three cargoes consigned to him were under arbitrary restraint; and that fact alone greatly strengthens the credibility of Captain <em>Richards, </em>who swears, positively, as to the like restraint upon the cargo of the <em>Mary ; </em>all those cargoes being in the like predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The extracts of letters from <em>David Parish &amp; Co., </em>to the plaintiff, are not inconsistent with the testimony of Captain <em>Richards, </em>and that of Mr. <em>Ridgeway. </em>These letters do not expressly state when, and how, the seizure of this cargo was made ; but they speak of it as \u201c <em>under </em>sequestration,\u201d before the decree for its sale; and, if <em>sequestered, </em>when did that take place ? It remained in the depot, under the entire control of the government, from the moment of its landing until the decree of sale; and whether the sequestration took place as soon as the vessel arrived in the <em>Scheld, </em>or at Antwerp, as may be in\u00bb fei\u2019red from the testimony of <em>Richards </em>and of <em>Ridgeway, </em>or whether the cargo was sequestered while in the very act of landing, it was equally covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It is worthy of remark, that the letters of <em>David Parish </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>were written while they were within the reach of the strong and despotic arm of <em>Napoleon ; </em>and that all their letters were liable to his inspection; which may account for their writing as <em>little, </em>and as <em>seldom, </em>as possible, of the violent acts of the <em>French </em>government. Especially, as they were, during all that time, most humbly supplicating the clemenhy of <em>Napoleon, </em>in regard to this very cargo. It would, therefore, have been impolitic and unsafe to have written the plain truth, that these goods -were seized as soon as they came within the power of the <em>French </em>government; not for the violation of any law, but as an act of capricious and arbitrary despotism. From the whole tenor of their letters, however, I cannot entertain a doubt, that, if interrogated expressly upon the point, they would have sworn, in accordance with the other witnesses, that the cargo was held under the control of the government, so that it could neither be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>landed .nor exported, by the owner, at any tim\u00e9 after its Arrival at <em>Antwerp..</em></p>\n<p id=\"AX3e\">It- appears that the cargo was landed upon the express application and request of the consignees, under a,condition that it should remain in <em>th\u00e9.d\u00e9pot, </em>under the control of t;he custom house, Until the emperor\u2019s decision should be made. But if the carg\u00f3 was under <em>arrest </em>or <em>sequestration </em>while it remained on board the Ship, in port, the benefit of this policy was not waived, nor lost, -by consenting to the landing 'of the cargo under the restriction imposed.. The; petition to land the goods, under such circumstances, was a request merely to <em>modify the restraint, </em>already imposed by the government, by removing the sequestered carg\u00f3 from the ship to the store housfe ,; both equally within the territory and control of the <em>French </em>government.. The fair and legitimate object of that modification,- undoubtedly) was, that the <em>ship might depart;; </em>to which there was then no impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">1 think the decided weight of evidence establishes the fact; that the cargo of the <em>Mary </em>was lost to the, assured, by the \u201c <em>arrest, </em>restraint, or detainnient\u201d of the <em>French </em>government, without any breach of warranty Against <em>\u201cillicit or- prohibited trade)'1 </em>on \u2022 the part of. the assured1; And, therefore,'the plaintiff is entitled tb recover. '</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Yates, J., and Van Ness, J., were of the same opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"AnHB\">Thompson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATN\">The decision of this case depends entirely upon the <em>question of fact, </em>whether there was A voluntary landing of. the cargo, ot whether it was landed under the 'coercion of the force stated by the master to have been put On board. If the facts in the case will warrant the conclusi\u00f3n, that the <em>Mary </em>was seized by a military force, and the cargo landed under such constraint,' And against the consent of .the consignees, I should entertain, no doubt <em>but that </em>the underwriters were liable for thfe loss;-. This was not a seizure, or detention for, or \u00f3n account of, any illicit or prohibited trade. ' TheVe was no attempt whatever to trade, or to do any act in contravention.of any municipal regulation, A mere entry into the port of <em>Antwerp </em>was no breach of -that; warranty. Nor could there be any pretence tb charge the assured with-\u00e1 violation of <em>\\hh Berlin Decree. </em>. - . .</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">That decree declares, that no vessel coming directly from <em>England) </em>or her coloides, or having been there since the publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>cation of the decree, shall be admitted into any port of the <em>French </em>dominions; and that every vessel that, by a false declaration, contravenes the foregoing disposition, shall be seized, and the ship and cargo confiscated as <em>English </em>property.\u201d There was no pretence that there was any attempt, on, the part of the assured, to obtain an entry in violation of this decree. If, therefore, this cargo was forcibly taken from under the control of the master and consignees, it was a lawless and arbitrary act, and the loss, would come under the general peril of arrests and deten-; tion of princes. But if, on the contrary,, the conclusion tp be drawn from the facts in the case is, that the consignees, finding that the <em>Mary </em>came within the <em>Berlin Decree, </em>and that they could not procure an unconditional entry and landing of the cargo, voluntarily consented to have the same deposited in the stores of the custom house, for the purpose of procuring a dispensation of the decree, and permission to sell the cargo, the underwriters are not responsible for the subsequent loss. If the consignees chose to speculate upon the chance of obtaining a relaxation of the decree, they must do it at the risk of the assured, and not of the underwriters. And, with respect to this question of fact, very considerable doubt may well be entertained. Much depends upon the credibility of the master, who certainly appears, in the case, to have exposecj himself to very considerable suspicion; and I very much regret that such a case is presented to the court for decision; it more properly belonged to the determination of a jury. This is enforced by the circumstance, that there is a provision for turning the case info a special verdict, which certainly cannot be done, if my understanding of the point on which the cause will turn be correct. The jury must find that fact; and not merely state the evidence of the fact. The conclusion is to be drawn by them, and not by the court. But, as the parties have seen fit to submit the case to the eourt, \u00a1n its present shape, it becomes necessary to weigh the evidence, and draw such conclusion as, in my judgment, it. will warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The testimony of the master, and -the inference to be drawn from the letters of the consignees, would certainly seem to warrant very opposite conclusions. The master states, that on the <em>Mary\u2019s </em>being moored off the city of <em>Antwerp, </em>an armed force was put on board, and continued there until after the landing of the cargo ; that th.e control of the ship was entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>taken from him ; and that this armed force was kept ombbard by-the custom-house officers,, in consequence of the <em>Mary's </em>having been carried into <em>England-. </em>He states nothing of this; however/ in. his protest, and gives no satisfactory explanation why he did not. An attentive, examination of the testimony of <em>Ridgeway, </em>would seem to,warrant the conclusion, that the custom-house officers would not permit vessels that had touched in <em>England </em>to depart, without the special permission of the emperor ;he, as consignee in several cases, had failed in obtaining .such permission. There is no evidence, however, that such1 permission was asked,.in this case, until some time in the, year 1808. But none of the letters, from the consignees, seem even to hint,-that there Was any compulsion in landing the cargo;. and it is hardly conceivable, if that.had been the cas\u00e9, that.the consignees would not have mentiqned so important a circumstance,. The drift of all their letters, is to show that they , were using every exertion to obtain <em>permission </em>to land the cargo. The <em>Mary </em>arrived oil the 21st of <em>July, </em>and the cargo was not landed 'until the 25th of <em>Ait-gust.' </em>Qn the 23d <em>pi July </em>the consignees write,. \u201c-We are' going to send all her papers -to <em>Paris, </em>to obtain leave to land her cargo,\u201d \u25a0. And cn the 10th of <em>August </em>they again write, that they, had not yet obtained leave to land-the <em>Mary's </em>.cargo; not an intimation of any difficulty of sending .away vessel and cargo; or of asking leave for that purpose,\u2022 . On the. 11th of <em>September, </em>they enclose a printed note, announcing the determination of the <em>French </em>governmeht to enforce the execution of the <em>Berlin Decree, </em>although the vessel might have been, forcibly carried into <em>Eng- </em>, <em>land; </em>and that a <em>Portuguese </em>vessel had already been sent a way. They then say, \u201c not long after we wrote you last, we had,/ease - to land the <em>Mary's </em>cargo, which was done in three days,, without any <em>molestation </em>;\u201d and they go on to state/that\u201c something, is still to be determined in regard to vessels whose cargoes have been landed <em>bj. permission-pi- </em>the director general of the customs.\u201d In the letter of the 14th of <em>April, </em>1808, after speaking of seizures under, the <em>M\u00fcan Decre\u00e9, </em>they say, there will be an exception made in favour of those which, <em>like yours.,. </em>have, previously to those decrees, been <em>.admitted provisionally </em>by the minister of finance.\u201d And in this letter, for the first time,, they speak of having made application to be permitted to re-expor-t the cargo. Prom an examination of thesedelte'rs, it is difficult'; if. not-impossible, to resist the conclusion, that' thp cargo of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>\u25a0Mary </em>was landed, at the earnest and pressing solicitation of \u2022the consignees, who, finding that they could not obtain an unconditional entry, procured the cargo to be admittedprovisionally, as they term it; to remain in custody of the custom-house officers, until the determination of the emperor should be known on the subject; and this may account for there having been put on board a military force, by the custom-house officers, for its safe keeping. The captain says it was landed on condition that it should be deposited in the stores of the custom house; and <em>was landed in pursuance of orders from, the consignees, </em>who gave him a receipt for the same. A clerk of the consignees and a custom-house officer both attended to take an account of the cargo. All this shows, very evidently, that the landing was under, and pursuant to, some arrangement made by the consignees, and not by any compulsion; the consignees, probably, calculating upon their exertions and influence to obtain a relaxation of the decree; and that it would be better to procure a provisional landing than to s\u00e9nd back the cargo at that time, thinking, probably, that this course might be resorted to after every other attempt should fail. For, in their speculations on the result, with respect to cargoes in this situation, they, in their letter of the 11th of <em>September, </em>consider them in one of three predicaments; either to be admitted unconditionally, or under certain restrictions, or to be sent back. And thus we see the reason why no mention is made of an application to re-export the cargo until <em>April, </em>1808; all attempts, probably, to effect any thing better had failed, and this was resorted to as the last alternative. If I were setting as a juror to weigh the evidence in this cause, and draw inferences from the facts stated, I should be bound to say the weight of evidence is in favour of the conclusion that the cargo was landed voluntarily, under an arrangement between the consignees and the officers of the <em>French </em>government, with a view to some future negotiations with the emperor; and that, of course, the underwriters were not responsible for the loss. But I think, as I suggested upon the argument, that it is a cause which belongs to a jury to decide, and ought to be sent back for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Spencer, X, was of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
