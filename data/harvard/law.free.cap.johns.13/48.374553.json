That it is not expressly averred that the timony spoken of. was upon a <em>point material </em>in the Gause. Herfe is a colloquium; The words,.\u201c what <em>he has sworn to, is a damned lie,\u201d </em>are averred to have been maliciously spoken in a discourse, \u201c of and concerning the trial of a Certain 'cause between <em>David Munn </em>and <em>John Wilson, </em>then lately had before testimony of <em>Niven </em>was in a cause in which the justice <em>had jurisdiction ; </em>and, 2dly.

The discourse to which the words related, was sufficiently explanatory to effect the purposes of slander and such as could leave no reasonable doubt that it was intended, by the. defendant, to accuse the plaintiff of <em>perjury. </em>Besides, the averments are to be construed less strictly <em>after Verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
