Here, the defendants regularly appeared and went to trial; and it is a settled principle, that a defendant cannot take advantage of . any defect or irregularity in the process,-after he has appeared and pleaded.

If all the words of Smith, as stated by1 the witness, <em>Livingston, </em>are taken together, and fairly understood, they do not amount to an admission of the debt, but merely of the; existence \u00a9f certain judgments in <em>Comiecticut. </em>A person acting in a representative capacity, does not stand in the same situation as a person acting in his own right. He has no personal interest in the question. He may be unable to decide, whether he ought to pay or not; and may very w\u00e9ll say, \u201c I would- pay the debt, if I could do it properly and safely.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am6\">There ought to, be evidence sufficient tb authorize a jury to infer a promise to pay.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The statute of limitations is a very beneficial statute, and ought to be favoured..

The object of. those statutes is. to enable a creditor to obtain execution against the goods or property of an absent and absconding debtor.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b211-10\">It is admitted, that the domicil of the defendants has always been in this state.

He may\u2019appear and defend the action throughout. Such a judgment could not be enforced in <em>Connecticut; a fortiori, </em>it could not be enforced here. The judgment given on the <em>scire facias </em>against, the garnishees, shows it could not be enforced there; \u2019 that amounts to;.a reversal of the original judgment. We have a right to show the judgment to be irregular, or unduly obtained, op illegal and unjust, or to impeach it, for error on the face of the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATNb\">But it is said, the appearance of the defendants hap cured all irregularities. Appearance cures matters of form only, not of substance. The want of an original writ is not. cured by an appearance. An appearance cannot alter the nature of the action or process, or convert a proceeding <em>in-rent, </em>into a general action <em>in . rent el personam. </em>It w\u00e1s necess\u00e1ry for the defendants to' go into <em>Connecticut, </em>to, protect -the goods or property, attached there, in the hands of their debtor or attorney.' The court of that state could have no jurisdiction against their persons ; and the principle of the decisi\u00f3n of CIi. J., <em>Parsons, </em>in <em>Bissell </em>v. <em>Briggs,</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the whole doctrine, as to the effect of judgments in other states, is considered, applies. No faith or \u2018Credit is to be given to a judgment where the court had no jurisdiction. The want of jurisdiction is a radical defect, which cannot be cured by appearance, and may be taken advantage of, or given in evidence, under the general issue, in an action on the\" judgment.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azk\">Again, the \u00edudgment m <em>Connecticut was </em>illegal and unrust.

The law cannot coerce a par\u00e9nt to do more than keep his child from becoming\u2019a charge on-the town.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The moral obligation of a father to support his children furnishes no ground for an <em>assumpsit. </em>The mother cannot be said to have been the agent of,the father; for she was, by the law of <em>Connecticut, </em>constituted the guardian'of the children,: and, had the care arid custody of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The toother, morally and legally, is equally bound as the father, to take care of and maintain the1 children.

The record states; that ei the defendants' appeared by <em>Seth P. </em>Beers, their attorney,\u201d and pleaded, &amp;c&gt; phut, in the absence of all other evidence on that point, this must be construed to mean, that an appearance and plea were entered by virtue of the power expressly given to' the garnishees for that purpose, by the statiite. An* \u201c <em>attor</em>ney',on whom process may be served under that statute, means a general agent, or a person employed by the defendants to conduct other suits; not an attorney previously appointed by 'the defendants to appear for them in the particular suit, .whenever it might be commenced against them. There is no evidence that the defendants ever interfered or took any notice, of those proceedings, until the <em>scire facias </em>against the garni* shees. . Then, and not before; it appears by the testimony of Mr. <em>Beers, </em>they employed an attorney, and conducted the de* fence for the garnishees.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>I \u00e1m, therefore, of opinion, that the. judgment against the defendants,, <em>in personam,, </em>was without jurisdiction, and, therefore, void. So that this ree.ord on which the plaintiffs rely, is not even <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a debt. - \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\">Whether, as a proceeding <em>in rent, </em>it was authorized by the statute of <em>Connecticut </em>(now before us) against executors or persons sued in <em>autre droit, </em>in any case, is very questionable. <em>(M'Coombe </em>v. <em>Executors, of Hudson, </em>(2 <em>Dallas, </em>73.) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Walsworth, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Besides, it appears that judgment was finally rendered in the superior court of <em>Connecticut, </em>in favour of the garnishees, on the very ground that they were <em>not debtors, or trustees, </em>of these defendants. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The' provisions of the statute of <em>Connecticut, </em>are analogous to the proceedings by attachment against absconding debtors, according to the custom of <em>London: </em>and ip the case of <em>Masters </em>y. <em>Lewis, </em>(1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>56.,) it was decided that \u2018\u2018 garnishment can only be where the garnishee is liable to the action of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Can it be possible, therefore, that even in <em>Connecticut </em>these defendants would be held, in <em>any respect, </em>liable, on the ground of those judgments ? It has there been judicially determined, and the records expressly show it, that the defendants were out of the jurisdiction of that state; that the process was served on the garnishees only: and will'it be contended that those proceedings can have any validity anywhere, for any purpose; when it also appears, by these very records, that neither of the persons proceeded against, as garnishees, did, in fact, stand in the relation of <em>\u201c </em>attorney, factor, agent, or trustee\u201d of the supposed absconding' debtors ?</p>\n<p id=\"AiE\">Such a doctrine would be unworthy of the enlightened jurisprudence of that respectable state : and, <em>a fortiori, </em>it would be unjust to allow such proceedings, under a foreign jurisdiction, to form the basis of a legal claim in our own courts. .</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">If the defendants had actually appeared in the suit against them, as absconding debtors, it would not, in my judgment, have altered the character of that r\u00e9cord. Such appearance and defence must be deemed to have been made merely to <em>protect the pledge, </em>which was the legitimate object of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">But, admitting the record to be valid in Connecticut, as a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>c\u00e9e\u00e1i\u00f1g in persoham; </em>Other important questions, have arised opon \u25a0 the evidence- disclosed in this case. ^ .</p>\n<p id=\"AvU\">Are we to acknowledge the validity of the divorce in <em>Con- \u25a0 mbticut, </em>between <em>John Bird </em>an&lt;I hi$ Wife; they being, at that time,- domiciled in this state? For, if <em>they </em>were not legally divorced, it follows, that the wife could riot sue her husband, nor the executors of her husband, upon any promise, express or implied, betwen the husband and wife. . - ' '</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">In the ease of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>(1 <em>Johns. </em>Rep. 424.,) a citizen of this state married a wife in this state, and after living here together about a year, the wife left her husband, went into the state of Fermora\u00ed, and there obtained a decree of divorce, aecordirig to the law of that state, on the ground of cruel treatment, the husband continuing to reside in this state, \u2022 This court decided that the wife could not acquire a domicil distinct from that of her husband; that the proceeding, on the part of the wife, was an evasion of the law of this state, which does not allow of a divorce, except for adultery; and that no actiomco.uldbe maintained for alimony on such decree.</p>\n<p id=\"AE8\">The rule has since been recognised in the case of <em>Tovey </em>v. <em>Lindsay,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> (1 Dow's Rep. </em>117.,) in the <em>English </em>house of lords. In that cas\u00e9 the ffiarriage was contracted at <em>Gibraltar, </em>\u201c with iff the pale of <em>the English </em>law:\u2019\u2019 the. parties were, afterwards, domiciled in <em>England; </em>-and then Went to <em>Scotland, </em>arid were there divorced <em>a vinculo. </em>Though the {louse of lords remitted the cause foi a review on the whole matter, y\u00e9t they, evidently, admit the principle, that an <em>English </em>marriage could not be any-where dissolved, except by an act of parliament; and Lord <em>E'ldon </em>observed that'it bad been so decided, lately, by the unani-. mohs opinion of the <em>twelve </em>judges of <em>England;</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>though the parties, therefore, may have been, .\u00e1t the time of the divorce, in <em>Scotland, </em>and domiciled there <em>bona fide, </em>yet such a divorce would not dissolve, a contract of marriage made in <em>England. </em>(See, <em>also, Harg. </em>Co. litt. 79, <em>b. </em>n. 44. <em>Hub. de conflictu legum, Opinion of Eyre, </em>Ch. J., 2 <em>H. Bl. </em>410. 3 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">But this case - is distinguishable from that of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>424.,) in one strong feature. Here the marriage (as may fairly be inferred from the evidence) was contracted in <em>Connecticut; </em>and both the parties, although, domiciled in this state at the time of the divorce, appealed'and litigated the question of divorce, in <em>Connecticut. </em>In the, cage of <em>Jackson. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>v. <em>Jackson, </em>the parties were not only domiciled here, but the contract of marriage was made in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">The investigation of this cause has led me to examine thus far the question of divorce; but whether the <em>Connecticut </em>decree of divorce, in the case of <em>John Bird, </em>is obligatory here, appears to me to be a question not necessarily involved in the decision of this cause. I, therefore, forbear to express an opinion on that difficult and important point, until a case shall require our decision upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">But if the validity of the divorce be admitted, then, in judgment of law, the obligation to support the children of that marriage was equal upon both the parents; there being nd special com-tract between the parties, nor any provision om that subject in the statute granting the divorce. The only provision in regard to the children (and that was made upon the express application and request of Mrs. Bird) was, that the father should be devested of the custody and control of them, and that the mother should be their sole guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The mother being under equal natural obligation with the father to maintain her offspring, and no positive law of <em>Connecticut </em>being shown on that subject, I can see no legal ground to authorize a recovery by the mother against the father, for the maintenance of the children. At most, she can have a right tq sue him for <em>contribution </em>only.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Upon the whole case, I am of opinion,, that the judgment is not even <em>prima facie </em>evidence of a debt, being without jurisdic\u00bb. tion, as a proceeding <em>in personam: </em>and,</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">2dly, Admitting the jurisdiction of the superior court of <em>Connecticut, </em>and admitting, also, the validity of the divorce, yet the judgment in favour of the divorced wife against the executors of her former husband, for the whole maintenance of their common children, was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The defendants, are, therefore, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Judgment for. the, defendants,</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em> May, </em>1813.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\"> Lolly's case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
