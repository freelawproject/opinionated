Bristol, </em>who had been discharged under the- insolvent act, was sworn as a witness for thp defendant. He testified that he made the purchase of the premises-of <em>Foster, </em>in the name of <em>Leonard, </em>and for his benefit, for 2,000 dollars that,, previous to the purchase, <em>Leonard </em>viewed the lot. while <em>Patter </em>was in possession. The witness stated\u2019to <em>Foster </em>that <em>Leonard </em>had sent, By him, the 2,000 dollars for the land, and he paid <em>Foster </em>1,000 dollars, and gave a bond conditioned to pay .1,000 dollars, due on the mortgage to <em>Potter, </em>who was then in possession of the premises; retaining, the other 1,000 dollars, which was unknown to <em>Leonard. </em>The reason assigned for retaining the 1*000 dollars, by the witness, was, that he was in treaty with <em>Potter </em>for the sale of 300 acres of land in <em>Pompey, </em>at 9 dollars per acre.; being part of 600. acres - which the witness had contracted to purchase of <em>James Sackett ; </em>and <em>Potter </em>proposed that the 1,000 dollars', due from <em>Foster, </em>should be applied towards the first payment for the' land in <em>Pompey, </em>which was, accordingly, agreed to be done. <em>Potter </em>removed from the premises, and went into possession of the land in <em>Pompey, and </em>the witness took possession of the premises for <em>Leonard. </em>The agreement was not in writing, though intended to be sp. <em>Potter </em>was to discharge the mortgage. The witness was unable to \"fulfil' his contract \"with <em>Sackett, </em>and gave it up, relinquishing what he had paid, about 350, dollars, at the instance of <em>Potter, </em>who said he could make another contract with <em>Sackett; </em>and it was.not until after he had made a contract with <em>Sackett </em>that <em>Pottet </em>said any thing about the mortgage money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Foster, </em>also, was a witness for the defendant, and testified, .that he made the contract for the sale of the land to <em>Leonard, </em>with <em>Bristol, </em>for 2,000 dollars, 1 and executed- the deed to Ireonard. That <em>Bristol </em>paid ] .000 dollars in, cash,: and gave his bond, conditioned to pay <em>Potter </em>the amount of the mortgage, and-to indemnify the- witness: against it; that it was; in consequence of the advice and-request <em>of.Potter </em>/that 'he took thebond. <em>Potter </em>told him that he was about making' a purchase from <em>Bristol </em>of land in <em>Porripey, </em>apd in that way he was to be paid the 1,000 dollars, and the witness to be discharged from it. That, not long since, he was surprised by being told by <em>Patter-, </em>that something had taken place between him and <em>Bristol, </em>in consequence of which he should have to come back to the wit-; ness for the 1,000 dollars. \u25a0' * ' \" ; - '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-15\"><em>Randall, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdJ8\">contended, <em>1. </em>That <em>Bristol, </em>the agent, haying notice of the mortgage to <em>Potter, </em>it must be deemed equivalent as notice <em>to Leonard, </em>his principal'.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And having such notice of the existence of the pr-ipr mortgage, he'is equally bound as if the mortgage liad been duly registered.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-16\">2.

Can this agreement be void, as it regards third persons who are to be affected by it ?. 'Will not the colift consider that as done-which ought'to have been done'?'\u25a0 .</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-18\">Again, here was a part'performance of the contract, which takes it out of the statute. <em>.Potter </em>went into possession of, the <em>land.I\u00f1.Pompey </em>,}Under the agreement, which, was so far executed as, to render the payment-complete. How can\u2019 it be said that <em>Potter </em>received no consideration ? <em>Leonard </em>furnished the naoney to pay off the mortgage. <em>Potter </em>was to remain in possession, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>lieu of receiving the interest; and when the mortgage was paid off, he was to give ap the possession. He did deliver up the possession to <em>Bristol </em>for the use <em>of-Leonard ; </em>and the inference is irresistible, -that the mortgage was paid,- A mortgage may be discharged by parol.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Suppose it had been given up; the possession by the mortgagor is, <em>prima facie, </em>evidence of the mortgage having been paid. That a certificate of the payment is necessary, to cancel the registry, is quite \u00e1 different thing. As it respected the rights of the parties, the mortgage was discharged.. ,</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> <em>4 Cruise's Dig. </em>353. <em>32. 9 Johns.

It has been urged, that <em>Potter\u2019s </em>agreement with <em>Bristol, </em>that the 1,000 dollars advanced by <em>Leonard </em>to <em>Bristol, </em>for the purpose of discharging the mortgage, should be retained by <em>Bristol, </em>and that the amount due on the mortgage should be paid by <em>Bristol, </em>by the contemplated conveyance by <em>Bristol </em>to. <em>Pjotter,. </em>of land contracted for with <em>Sacket-t, </em>was such an interference on the part of- <em>Potter, </em>and operated so injuriously and fraudulently towards Leonard, that <em>Pptter </em>cannot now insist on his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It cannot be doubted, that, in consequence of <em>Bristol\u2019s </em>ap'pfopriating, to his own use, the 1,000 dollars placed in his hands by <em>Leonard, </em>to pay off the mortgage, the latter has been defrauded of that amount; but the question still returns, who has been the culpable cause of the loss ? I cannot perceive' that-Patter is chargeable with any direct or constructive fraud. He knew, indeed, that <em>Leonard </em>had sent to <em>Bristol </em>2,000 dollars; fialf of which was to be paid to <em>Foster, </em>for his right to the equity of redemption, and the other half in discharge of the mortgage. The agreement between <em>Potter </em>and <em>Bristol </em>may have operated to prevent the latter from paying off the mortgage ; but it does not appear that <em>Potter </em>expressly agreed that <em>Bristol </em>should retain the 1,000 dollars int\u00e9nded. to be applied to the payment of the mortgage, nor does it appear that <em>Potter </em>\u00a1mew that this retainer was concealed from <em>Leonard* \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u2018The fact is, that the injury to <em>\u00a1Leopard </em>is. entirely .attributable to the conduct of his own agent, <em>Bristol '; </em>and it'would 'be unj,ust that this loss should be sustained by iPo\u00ed\u00bfe*y whose-conduet ap-. pearsfohave been fair, \u25a0candid, and; upright. . \u25a0' 1 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">If it could be made- out, that <em>Potter </em>deiiyhd some \u00bfbenefit from <em>Bristol's </em>renouncing Ms contract with <em>Sackett; </em>it. 3o.es not occur to me -that the defendants can avail themselves-of that to invalidate <em>Potter's </em>mortgage.. Nothing can produce that effect but.a direct and .positive'fraud on the par-tbf. ,P.o(i\u00abr,. or.nir .aeT t\u00fcal payment- of\" the'mortgage; Of the latter there is nopre-5 tenc\u00e9, and I see no evidence to warrant us irrsaying that Pot\u00f3er. has been guilty of such a fraud as to. be estopped from setting up his mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">It is very qu\u00e9stionabl\u00e9 whether <em>Potter </em>derived \u00a1any \u2019 benefit from the. contract between <em>Sackett </em>and <em>Bristol. Sackett </em>testifies, that he-made .no agreement\u2019with Potter, nor-made hint.bny offer of the landi before <em>Bristol </em>relinquished his contract..</p>\n<p id=\"AWT\">There\u2019 is nothing that can affect <em>Potter's, </em>right \u00a1underhis- mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Judgment foi? the \u00bfplaintiff</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
