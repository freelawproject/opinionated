On the trial in the court below, one <em>Barber </em>testified, that, on the sale of a farm by the plaintiff to the defendant, the defendant applied to the plaintiff for the purchase of a set of grist-mill stones, which it was understood did not pass with <em>the 1 </em>and; that the plaintiff informed the defendant that he had bargained with one <em>Tifft </em>for the sale of the stones, but agreed, that, if <em>Tifft </em>would relinquish the bargain, the defendant should have them at the price agreed to be given by <em>Tifft, </em>which the witness understood to be about 70 dollars; that the defendant solicited the plaintiff to obtain <em>Tifft\u2019$ </em>relinquishment, and agreed to pay for that purpose, if demanded, a sum' not exceeding five dollars. The witness stated, that he understood from the conversation, that, if the plaintiff procured <em>Tifft\u2019s </em>relinquishment, the defendant was to take the stones according to. the agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-11\"><em>Powell, </em>another witness, testified as to a conversation between the parties at the time of executing the deed for the premises above mentioned, in which the plaintiff asked the defendant if he intended to take the mill stones ; that the defendant answered he would rather not; but that it was then agreed that the plaintiff should procure <em>Tifft\u2019s </em>relinquishment of the bargain, for which the defendant should pay, in addition to the price- of the stones, which was declared to be 75 dollars: that the defendant agreed to accept a horse in payment, provided the horse suited him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-12\"><em>Brewer, </em>another witness, testified, that in the spring subsequent <em>to </em>the autumn in which the defendant purchased the plaintifi\u2019s farm, the defendant requested the witness to inquire of the plaintiff whether he had obtained <em>Tifft\u2019s </em>relinquishment of the bargain; that the plaintiff informed him that he had obtained it, which the witness mentioned to the defendant, who expressed his satisfaction; that the defendant, afterwards, requested the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>witness to ask the plaintiff whether he was willing to receive payment in a horse.

The evidence that the negotiation had been closed, and that the defendant had agreed to purchase, is pretty strong, and the jury would have been warranted to have found for the plaintiff. The greatest difficulty in the case is, whether it appears sufficiently that the plaintiff had procured a relinquishment from <em>Tifft, </em>who had previously agreed to purchase the mill stones. From the testimony of <em>Brewer </em>it appears, that at the defendant\u2019s request he inquired of the plaintiff whether he had procured such relinquishment, who said he had; and that when he informed the defendant of it he \u201c expressed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>satisfaction with the same,\u201d 'The fact that the mill stones have remained continually Ih^the plaintiff\u2019s possession, without any claim on the part of <em>Tifft,. </em>or any other person,: affords a strong presumption' that <em>Tifft </em>had renounced' any pretensions he might have had to them. The agreement between the plaintiff and T\u00ed\u00bff\u00ed, in fact, presented no legal obstacle to the sale to the'-defendant, because there is no evidence.of any delivery to <em>Tifft, </em>nor that .he fever paid any.part of the consideration money. ' Indeed, from the bill of exceptions, it is evident there- was neither delivery nor payment. These remarks, s\u00e9rye ip show-the-propriety of submitting, all the evidence, to the jury, in order that they, might '\u2022'have, drawn the proper conclusions from .it. If there was an: absolute contract on the part of the plaintiff to sell, and ion. the part of the defendant to buy, the delivery .was abundantly sufficient, 'The articles sold w\u00e9\u00bfe ponderous, apdithere has been th\u00f1 pnly delivery of them which was practicable. They were left on the land purchased by the defendant, which .was in his possession, \u00e1n&amp;&gt; \u2022there they have since remained, in his power, and subject to be used by him whenever he pleashd. . The presumption, perhaps, is, that he has kept them in pursuance of the purchase made by himff\u00f3r ifbe did not, why did he, shortly, after the time he sent <em>Brewer </em>to the plaintiff to inquire <em>about.Tift's </em>relinquishment' of . his purchase, request. <em>Brewer </em>to asl?: the plain tiff whether he was willing to receive payment for the stones in a horse; ? The court are, therefore,, ;of opinion, that- the judgment below ought to be \u25a0reversed, and that a <em>venire de novo </em>be Ssued by the court below,</p>\n<p id=\"AA-B\">Judgment below reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
