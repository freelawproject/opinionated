The former ejectment related to the same property, and was against <em>Eddy, </em>under whom the defendant holds. That judgment gave the plaintiff, as against <em>Eddy </em>and those claiming under him, a term of 14 years from 1790. If a single link in the chain of possession be broken, the whole effect of it is defeated, as it regards the statute of limitations, and there must be a new commencement of possession.

It 'seems, to- be the meaning of the act, that the suit should be commenced in one year, its object being to make parties vigilant in regard to, their rights. Here there was a lapse of 22 years before the suit was</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9Zm\"><em>Em\u00f3tt, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au5\">said that the statute of champerty did not \u25a0apply to this case..</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-14\">Again, the earliest commencement of adverse possession was in 1765 ; from that time to 1790, when the ejectment was commenced, deducting seven years for the period of the revolutionary war, there were only 18 y ears. The demise was laid in 1788, for 14 years, and, until after the end of that term,, the statute would not begin to run. It makes no difference that the. judgment was not perfected,. or roll signed, Until 1811. The roll is only evidence of the judgment by default,. in 1790.*</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The books of practice, it is true, differ as to the necessity of executing a writ of possession, and the reason of the difference it is not easy to understand. The effect of a judgment by default is precisely the same as that of a judgment after appearanee. In the one case, the defendant, by his default, admits .the right of the plaintiff- In the other, it is found for him by the verdict of a jury. After the term has expired the plaintiff may bring his action for the mesne profits.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAVa\"> 2 <em>Burr. </em>1009. <em>Co.

The plaintiff deduces a regular chain of title under the patent of <em>Kayaderosseras, </em>granted the 2d of November, 1708, to <em>John Tatham </em>and 12 others ; and the defendant also shows a regular deduction of title under the patent of <em>Queensbury, </em>granted the 20th of <em>May, </em>1762,-to <em>Jacob Haviland </em>and others. Each of the patents (by reason of an interference) cov\u00e9rs the premises in question. On this general view, the plaintiff claiming under the <em>oldest </em>patent would, of course, be entitled to recover. But the defence is rested on two grounds ; 1st. That the conveyance from <em>George Clark </em>to <em>Dirclc Lefferts </em>and <em>Peter Remsen, </em>dated the 14th of <em>March, </em>1768, under which the plaintiff derives title, was void, as it regards the premises in question, by reason of an <em>adverse possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">2d. That the plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In support of these objections, the defendant proved, that, oii the 9th of November, 1762, a deed of partition was executed by the patentees of <em>Queensborough, </em>whereby lot No. 102., of that patent, (including the premises in question,) was released to <em>Jacob Haviland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The defendant further proved, that, in 1765, or 1766, <em>Jacob Haviland </em>put a tenant <em>(Asaph Putnam) </em>on that lot, containing 250 acres; that <em>Putnam </em>continued on the lot. for 10 or 12 years, occupying and improving it as tenant under <em>Jacob Haviland; </em>and that the farm has ever since (with the exception of a few years during the war) been successively occupied by <em>Abraham Wing, </em>one <em>Martin, John Eddy, </em>and the defendant, under the title of <em>Jacob Haviland; </em>that there was a log house and barn built by <em>Asaph Putnam, </em>and 40 or 50 acres of the lot were cleared and reduced to cultivation before the revolutionary-war.</p>\n<p id=\"AWn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>- 0n the part of the plaintiff, it is contended,, that his title <em>is </em>protected from the operation of the statute of limitations,- by the judgment in ejectment against <em>John Eddy., . </em>It appears that, in 1788, or 1789, an ejectment suit was commenced in this court .for <em>Dirck Lefferis, </em>\u00e1s .lessor of the plaintiff, upon a demise of 14 years, from the. lOtli of January, 1788, against <em>John Eddy? </em>then in possession of the premises ; that, <em>in April </em>term, 1790, a rule for judgment by default, against the casual ejector, was entered ; and that, on the 27th <em>\u00f3f May y </em>1811, a judgment roll was entered up and signed, in that.suit, being nine years after the demise in the declaration had expired. ' .The plaintiff must fail on both points, .</p>\n<p id=\"A-r-\">The. possession of <em>Asaph Putnam, </em>on the 14th of <em>March? </em>1768, (the date of the conveyance to <em>Lefferis </em>and <em>Remspn',). was . </em>\u00f3f the whole lot No. 102., in the allotment of <em>Queensbury </em>patent, containing 25Q- acres, as tenant under <em>Jacob </em>Baviland, one of the patentees of <em>Queensbury. </em>He- occupied; <em>exclusively, </em>under that title. No question.had. then arisen as; to the interference \u00f3f the patent lines \u00f3# <em>K\u00fcy.aderosseras-and </em>Queensburyand I think it would be absurd, as well- as unjust,1 to consider <em>Putnarh, </em>in 176:8,'as a tenant in common with George <em>Clark; </em>There ex-* Isted between them-no-privity of contract or estate, and they claimed under separate and independent titles., I, therefore, consider -it- immaterial; whether <em>George Clark </em>attempted to convey <em>the'whole title in </em>severalty, or only an <em>undivided [share f </em>because no act which he could do towards <em>LefferM </em>and <em>Remsen, </em>could change the character of <em>Putnam\u2019s </em>possession. If that possession were <em>adverse </em>against the <em>whole title </em>of <em>Kayaderosseras, </em>it must be equally so against an undivided share of that title. I. am, also, clearly of opinion, that the proceedings and judgment in the .ejectment suit against <em>John Eddy </em>afford n\u00a9 support to the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The action of ejectment- is only <em>a possessory remedy </em>in favour of a person having a right of entry <em>\u25a0 </em>it does not-establish and conclude the question of title, as in real actions.- \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">- It .is true, the. lessor in ejectment may enter after judgment, without a writ of possession ; and the judgment is evidence of his right of- entry,- as between- the parties and privies, so as to protect him, against an action of trespass, <em>so long as the effect off the judgment continues. </em>But here the lessor of the plaintiff has . waived his. right of. entry under the judgment against <em>.Eddy? </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>lias slept until the term of the demise has expired ; and, I think, he now stands in the same relation to the defendant as if he had never attempted a legal remedy by the former suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">In the case of <em>Aslin </em>v. <em>Parkin, </em>(2 <em>Burr. </em>667, &amp;c.,) Lord <em>Mansfield </em>says, \u201c a judgment in ejectment, like all others, only concludes the parties as to the subject-matter of it; and, therefore, beyond the time laid in the demise, it proves nothing at all.\u201d <em>1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><em>A </em>party having title may enter, <em>peaceably, </em>without the aid of the law ; that is, without judgment or suit; and having so entered without force, his possession enures according to his title. The remedy, by ejectment, is intended merely to enable a party having title to enter, <em>by force, </em>under a writ of possession, which he could not lawfully do without such writ. In this case, there has been no <em>actual entry </em>with, or without, writ of possession. The lessor of the plaintiff might have availed himself of the arm of the law to put him in possession ; but he neglected to do so, until the authority for that purpose expired ; and he is now in the same predicament as if that authority had never existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">I have no doubt, that the possession of the defendant, and those under whom he claims, has been <em>adverse </em>ever since its commencement. On every ground, therefore, the defendant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
