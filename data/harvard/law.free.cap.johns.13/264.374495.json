R. Shepherd, </em>in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGmA\">contended, that the averments in the replication were not supported by the award. The plaintiff has endeavoured to support the award by averring facts <em>dehors </em>the submission. An award is in the nature of a judgment, and must be expounded by itself.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It cannot be aided by the averment of matters extrinsic.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-4\">Again, if any part of the award is bad, it is fatal on demurrer, though the plaintiff, in his replication, assign breaches to the whole.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The award, in this case, is neither certain nor final. It does not appear what land, or how much, the tenants respectively held, so that it could be known how much was to be given up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-11\">The award imposes a duty on the defendant which he cannot lawfully perform, namely, that he should cause the tenants to quit the possession. The arbitrators first award, that the defendants have no right to the land, and, next, that they should turn the tenants out of possession. An award, that a stranger to the submission shall do an act, is void.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> On the same principle, an award that the party shall cause a stranger to do an act, must be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6b\">Again, the award directs the defendant to pay the costs of a certain suit brought by them against <em>Pratt, </em>but it ought to ap. pear that the plaintiffs had some interest in the thing awarded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJv\"><em>Crary, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABP\">contended, that the averments in the replication were merely to render that certain in the submission, or award, which might, otherwise, be uncertain. They go to support the award, and do not contradict it; and the rule is, that an averment may, in some cases, be admitted to support an award.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> It is enough if there is any thing in the submission .to justify the averment. Even if the averments are not supported by the submission and award, it is very questionable whether the defendant can take advantage of it. He ought to have craved oyer, and, after setting them forth, he may have demurred.<footnotemark>\u01c1</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-16\">In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Willoughby,</em><footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court said, that if in an action of covenant some of the breaches were well assigned, and some not, and there was a demurrer to the whole declaration, the plaintiff shall have judgment for the breaches which were well assigned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-17\">Though things in the realty may be submitted to arbitration, they cannot be recovered on the award.<footnotemark>\u2020\u2020</footnotemark> But the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>will recover damage's on the assignment of the breaches; find'\" the value of the land is the , measure of damages,</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-11\">If one person submit for another, he is bound by the submission.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-12\">The award that the suits shall be no further prosecuted is final, and a perpetual baivt.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-13\"><em>Shepherd, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABq8\">said, that a party could not. pay a sum in lieu of the duty awarded. The award ought to have been in the alternative, either to give possession of the land, or to pay so much money, being the value of it.. The case of <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Brett</em><footnotemark><em>\u2021</em></footnotemark><em> </em>supports the position, that ; where fin award in any part is void,so that one of the parties cannot have the benefit intended, the fiward is void in the whole., - ' \u25a0</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em> Bac Ab Arbit. and Award, </em>(E.) <em>9 Johns Rep </em>38. <em>2 Johns.

' \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">It will not be necessary to discuss or consider, with gjeaf minuteness, several of the points insisted on. . If it be conceded that the award is void, so far as respects the defendant\u2019s causing <em>Webster </em>and <em>Wood </em>tpr deliver up possession of the lands they held, on the ground - of uncertainty . in regard to the extent of their possessions, and o.n the ground.that the defendant is required to cause strangers to the award to do acts ; still it dofifi pot follow that the whole award is bad, or that the demurrer is w\u00e9ll taken. It is a principle thoroughly settled, that if a declaration contain good and bad counts; and there is a general de? murrer to the whq\u00ed\u00e9, \u2022 judgment must be for the plaintiff. (3 <em>Caines\u2019 Rep. </em>89.) Again; if \u00e1 plaintiff, in his-declaration, assign-preaches, and some of which are well assigned, and some not, on. a. demurrer to the whole declaration, the pl\u00e1intiff shall llave judgment for- the breaches which fire well assigned. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>6 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>65.) This latter rule is strictly applicable to this case; for the plaintiffs had fheir election, either to bring an action of debt on the award, or to pursue the method they have adopted ; in' which case <em>Kyd (on Awards, </em>280.) says, the whole question firises on the replication \u201c. as on an original declaration.\u201d The principle that a replication bad in part is pad. in whple, is not applicable to suep fi case. \u25a0 That principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>means substantial, constituent parts of a replication, and does not reach a case where the question relates merely to the damages a party is entitled to recover. Testing this replication by these rules, it is clearly good; the recitals preceding the submission, and the very object of the submission, show, satisfactorily, that the parties were respectively claimants, as owners of the 200 acres of land stated in the submission. The suits, in relation to which the arbitrators awarded, were distinctly submitted; the subject matter of these suits, the profits of the land, and all differences, contentions, and demands concerning them, and the costs of those suits. It was not'necessary to aver, that the persons mentioned to be in possession were the tenants of the defendant; that is to be inferred from the recitals and submission; but if they were not tenants, the defendant, claiming to be the owner of the land, saw fit to submit the title, the mesne profits, and the costs of the specified suits, and he is bound by the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">It was urged, that if the award were void in requiring the defendant to dispossess the tenants, then, inasmuch as that part of the award which directed the suits to cease, would also fail, the award would be void <em>in </em>toto, for want of mutuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The delivery of possession is whplly\u2019 disconnected with the cessation of the suits; they are terminated by the award, and, consequently, this award does not fall within the principle that that part of the award which is void is so connected with the rest as to affect the justice of the case between the parties; and, therefore, the award is void only <em>pro tanto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We are of opinion that the award is void as respects the delivery of possession by the tenants, for it does not appear that the defendant has the right or power to dispossess them; he is, therefore, required to cause strangers to the award to do .acts which he cannot control.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Judgment foy the plaintiffs, accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
