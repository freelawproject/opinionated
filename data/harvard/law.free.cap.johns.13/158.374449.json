The justice, in his return, stated the service to have been by delivering the notice in writing to the person against whom the complaint was made ; but it appeared, from the affidavit of the person who served the notice, and which affidavit it was agreed should be considered as part of the return, that \u201c he, the deponent, did not find <em>Forbes 8r Nelson </em>on the premises, at the time of serving the notice, but he put up the same on the house, in a conspicuous place, and gave notice to a woman, then in the house, and on the premises, of the said notice.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-4\"><em>I.

The act (sess. 11. ch. 6. s. 3. 1 <em>N. R. L. </em>96.) directs, that a notice in writing, of the time and place of the return of the precept of inquiry, should be \u201c affixed up in some public and suitable place, upon the lands or tenements,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c or be delivered to the party against whom such complaint is made, if such party be on the premises.\u201d The true construction of the act is, that the service must be on some public and suitable place on the premises, or personally on the party. It should appear that every thing had been done, in the power of the party, to bring the notice home to the person who was entitled to receive it, according to the intention and direction of the act. The affidavit, in this respect, is defective. If it had stated that the notice had been affixed on the front door of the house, or in a public and suitable place, it would have been sufficient; but we can intend nothing but what is expressly stated in the affidavit. The proceedings, therefore, must be set aside, and the posses-* sion restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The following rule was accordingly entered. \u201c Ordered, that the conviction of forcible entry and detainer, in this cause, be set aside, or quashed, for irregularity ; and that the said <em>James Forbes </em>and <em>James Nelson, </em>be restored to the possession of the lot and messuage of which they have, been dispossessed by means of the said conviction.?\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
