The declaration commenced by demanding 1,000 <em>J </em>\u00a9 5 dollars, which the defendant owed to, and unjustly detained from, the plaintiffs: it then set forth the penalty of the bond, with the condition, in which the defendant\u2019s, covenant was contained; and, having assigned breaches of- the covenant, con-\u2022eluded thus: <em>\u201c </em>Therefore, the said <em>Thomas O7 Brian, </em>his covenant with the said <em>James Gale </em>and <em>Ashbel Stanley </em>hath not kept, i although often requested so to do, but hath broken the same ; wherefore the said <em>James Gale </em>and <em>Ashbel Stanley </em>say they are injured, and have sustained damages to the value of 1,000 dollars, and thereof they bring suit,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-15\">To this declaration there was a general demurrer and joinder In demurrer.

The attorney of the plaintiff, in drawing the declaration, appears to have followed the precedent in 2 <em>Chitty on Pleadings, </em>154., except the conclusion, which, in that precedent, is in <em>debt </em>instead of covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b199-19\">This is a misjoinder, which renders the declaration bad in substance.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b199-23\"><em>Powers, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQz3\">The court (12 <em>Johns.
