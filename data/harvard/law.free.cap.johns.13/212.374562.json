Unless, then, <em>Qasparus Brouck, </em>in his lifetimej elected a-place on which to erect the mill and darn, or to exercise the right, it was for ever at his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APB\">But, admitting that this privilege could descend, or be transferred with the land, it gave rio right to overflow the plaintiff-\u2019^ land. It is evident, that the grantor' intended that\u2019 <em>C. Brouck </em>should elect a place where he might erect a mill, without injury' to others; there were several mill-seats cm the stream ; it could not be intended that he should have the control of the whole, \u00f3r might overflow all the adjacent land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-12\">The deed to <em>II. B., </em>of the 20th of <em>October, </em>1734, contains several restrictions. The right is limited to\" the erection of on\u00a9 mill, and in a particular place, , :</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag_C\">Again, the defendant derived no title to this fail through <em>Casparus.

No esiate in fee, in the mill-seat, was granted, because no place was designated. And, where nothing passes to a grantee before election, there the election must- bp made in the lifetime of the parties.*</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pACP\">Again, admitting the right to have originally existed, yet, a release;, or extinguishment of it is to be presumed from the long and uninterrupted possession, without, any claim or exercise of the right.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-8\"><em>Van Vechten, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvmY\">contended, that the right of erecting a mill, or mills, on the premises, was connected with the freehold granted. The grant operated as well on the mill-seat, or ground on which the mill was to be erected, as on any other part of the premises conveyed. Every grant is to be construed according to the. subject matter and intent of the parties. That is certain, which may be made certain by the election of the party capable of enjoying the right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-10\">But, it is said, that the right of election was lost by the death of the grantee.. But there is a distinction; as where the interest vests immediately by the grant, there the election may be made by the heir or executor of the grantee.!</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-11\">As to the doctrine of presumptions : The court must look at the right as it is, and the principle on which the doctrine of presumption rests. It is founded on the supposed acquiescence of a. party in the usurpation of -another, for a certain length of time. The possession from \"which the presumption arises, is in collision with the right. There must be an acquiescence in acts done in hostility to the. right, to afford the legal presumption of a release or extinguishment of it. Here, nothing of that kind ispretended or shown. The situation of the property, ana the facts, do not afford any such presumption. The court, in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>did not say, that such a grant would be inoperative and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-12\">But, it is said, the deed of <em>Casparus Brouck </em>gave no right to overflow the adjacent land. Where,, a thing is granted, eyery thing necessary to its enjoyment passes. If the right to erect a.mill could be., of no use without the, privilege, of overflowing-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the land,'it must be considered that this privilege was intended' to be given.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b226-8\"><em>Van Hyclc\u00a1 </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Apx\">was stopped by the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pAgRq\"> 5 Com.

This is \u00e1ri action oil the case for overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s land, by means \u00f3f a mill-d\u00e1m erected by the defendant on the <em>Cocksackie </em>creek.</p>\n<p id=\"ALO\">The defendant claims A right to maintain the dam, and t\u00f3 dd the acts teomplained of, partly under a conveyance, in fee simple; from <em>-John Brouck </em>(one of the patentees) to <em>Caspdru'c Brouck, </em>dated the 29 th of <em>June, </em>1734, for an undivided moiety; and partly under \u00e1 conveyance, in fee simple, from <em>Henry Van Bergen </em>and others to <em>Anthony Van Bergen, </em>dated the 20lh of <em>October, </em>1784, for the other undivided moiety,</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The first deed conveys a saw-mill on the <em>Cocksacki\u00e9 </em>creek, \u25a0 with the ground and water stream thereto belonging,\u201d \u201c <em>and full liberty and license to erect and build another mill on any other place at, or on,, the same creek, with like liberty of ground and stream ofwaterM </em>The latter of said deeds conveys (referring to another deed)' \u201c an.undivided moiety of, in, and to, a certain fall, situate, lying, and being in a tract of land granted to <em>Martin. Garritse </em>and <em>John-Brouck, </em>in a certain creek or kill, known by the name of the <em>Cocksackie kill,-and privilege of'erecting a mill thereonwith the\u25a0 ground and water stream of the said kill; and, also, one acre of ground adjoining s\u00e1id fallM </em>'</p>\n<p id=\"Aq4u\">The defendant deduces all the interest and estate granted by\" the said' deeds, by a chain of conveyances down to himself; and. it appears that about 4 or 5 years ago he erepted the mill-dam, n\u00f3w complained of, upon his own land, at a fall On said creek Vrhere no mill or dam had ever before been built.</p>\n<p id=\"AGm\">The plaintiff proves a continued and uninterrupted possession of his farm for the last GO years, derived from <em>Mantis Brouck, </em>a daughter of the patentee.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-16\">I am of opinion that the defendant has failed in Bis attempt to show a right to overflow the plaintiff\u2019s land.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">The deed from the <em>Van Bergens </em>(dated the 20th of <em>October, </em>1784,) for their moiety, does not, in the terms of' it, profess to-grant any privilege in the water <em>beyond the limits </em>of the mill-site, or falls, intended to be conveyed by that deed. The right of building a dam at that place must be exercisedm such a man\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u00f1er as riot to injure the previous rights of other persons. Besides, the grant of ah <em>undivided share </em>in a stream of watgf would riot authorize the grantee to appropriate or modify tfie stream to the injury of others, who have a joint interest in it. The property in a stream of water is <em>indivisible. </em>The joint proprietors must Use it as an entire stream, in its natural channel. A severance would destroy the rights of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">As to the right claimed under the deed to <em>Casparus </em>Broubk, in 1734, it was a.\u201c liberty and license\u201d to-erect a mill on any part of the creek, and.to Use and convert the stream of writer in a reasonable manner for that purpose; and it does not appear that the present dam is unreasonably high, or unusually con* structed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\"><em>Casparus Brouck </em>himself would, undoubtedly, have had a right to do the very act now complained/of, against any person claiming title under a subsequent conveyance from <em>John </em>Brouck, The question, therefore, is, whether the privilege granted, or the license given, by the deed'to <em>Casparus </em>Brouck, has expired os been extinguished.. According to <em>Co. Litt. </em>145. A., and <em>Vin. </em>tit. Election, <em>(Com. Dig. </em>tit. <em>Election,) </em>\u201c where an interest vests immediately by the grant, election may be made by the heirs,\u2019\u2019 &amp;c. So, \u201c where an election is coupled with an interest, such election is descendible.\u2019\u2019 But, \u201c if nothing passed or vested in the grantee before his election, it ought to be made in the life of the parties.\u201d \u201c When <em>election </em>creates the interest, nothing passes till election.\u2019\u2019 \u201c A feoffment of a house and 17 rieres of land, parcel of a waste, the <em>feoffee, </em>and not his heirs, must elect,, or else the 'grant is void..\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Tested by these rules, I am clearly of opinion, that the grant or license to build a mill anywhere on the <em>Cocksackit </em>Creek, with the land and water necessary for that object, vested no interest or estate absolutely in the grantee, at the time of executing the deed. The right was <em>potential </em>merely; it could', vest only upon the location and election to be made\u2019by the-grantee. It appears there Were, at least, four mill-sites on that creek. It is certain that <em>Casparus Brouck, </em>in his lifetime, was not actually vested with the title to any'particular mill-site, by. Virtue of that general grant. His election and location was necessary to consummate the title'. He never exercised his right , and by his death it became extinct.</p>\n<p id=\"Azr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>The-election, </em>in this case, was not \u201c coupled with an interest,\u201d jn \u00bfjjg sense of Lord <em>Coke. </em>He <em>means-an-election </em>coupled with an <em>interest which vests absolutely at the time of the grant. ,As </em>if there had been a grant of a definite mill-site coupled with the privilege of'-flowing. Then the.interest in the. principal subject of the grant Would have vested immediately; and the. appurtenant-right of flowing would have followed it to the heir, who might' elect to exercise the privilege of . flowing whenever he' pleased* The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.
