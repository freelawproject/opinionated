The lessors claim, as his heirs at law, six sevenths of the premises in question, and the defendant claims the whole, under the will of <em>John Henry </em>Moyer; and the only question is, whether the devise to the defendant extends to the premises. The words of the devise are, \u201c I give and bequeath unto my son, <em>John Henry, my farm whereon I now live, </em>&amp;c. The premises, as appears by the testimony, are about 15 or 20 acres of land, with a dwelling-house thereon separate, and apart from the farm of the testator which he occupied, and not used by him as a part of the farm, but had, for 40 years, been let out as a separate and distinct lot. Under these circumstances, the premises could, in no sense, be considered a part of the farm whereon the testator lived, and, of course, not embraced by the devise. This is, a case very analogous to that of <em>Jacksons. Sill, </em>(11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>201.,) and the principles then settled must govern the present decision. The plaintiff must have judgment for six sevenths of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
