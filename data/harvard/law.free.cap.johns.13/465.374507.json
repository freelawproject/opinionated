Brooks, </em>and in <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Vanderlyn </em>which came before the court at the last term, the question arose how far, and in what cases, attorneys were liable for costs, when parties in a suit. Many of the cases heretofore decided on that question, are inapplicable, as the law now stands. Attorneys, like other persons, are liable to be arrested on <em>mesne </em>process, (except during the actual sitting of the court,) and held to com* mon or special bail. (1 <em>N. R. L. </em>418.) Their privilege, therefore, is substantially,, taken away; and being put on the. same footing with other persons, as to arrests, th.ey ought fo. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>stand on the. sanie'ground in regard to costs.
