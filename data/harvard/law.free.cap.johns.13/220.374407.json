The . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>plaintiff offered to prove that at the time of the execution of the .covenant, and of entering the judgment, the plaintiff owned property of the value of 4,000 dollars; but the evidence was! objected to'on the ground that the Only proper inquiry wras for wh^t the property sold under the execution, and the judge being of that opinion rejected it.

A. Foot, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ap9n\">contended, that the defendants\u2019 testator, being a trustee, could not, himself, become a purchaser. It is a settled principle in equity, that if a trustee-become a purchaser of the trust estate, the <em>cestuy que trust </em>has.a right to set aside the sale, and have the property resold. Should it be said that this was <em>a judicial </em>sale, it may be answered that the trustee cannot avail himself of the benefit of such sale, for he can derive no profit or advantage whatever from his trust; and if it is for the interest of the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>a court will always avoid the sale.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"pAKR\">The only question is-, whether the plaintiff can avail himself of this principle in a court of law ? The testator, by his covenant, stipulated to perform certain duties as a trustee, and he is here called upon to answer for a breach of that covenant, or, in other words, for a violation of his trust. In a court of equity the <em>cestuy que trust </em>might either set aside the sale, or call on the trustee to account for the profits. Now, the trustee, in this case, has purchased, for 1,600 dollars, property worth 4,000 dollars, and he is called on to account, or pay the difference.

This is distinguishable from the ordinary case of a sale and purchase by a trustee. No third person was ever interposed in this case.

The principle rests on.a deeper and'broader foundation. It is the danger of temptation from the facility and advantages afforded by the situation, that creates the disability \u2018 The wise policy of the Iaw,V say the learned counsel, 'in the case of the <em>York Buildings </em>v. <em>M'Kenzie, </em>(8 Bro.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGH\">delivered the opinion , of the coiirt. The first question which arises, upon the motion to set Aside th\u00e9 non-, suit granted in this cas\u00e9 is,, whether the' testator, <em>Joseph </em>Shetdcm, could legally purchase the property sold under the execution, in his. fay our,, against the plaintiff in this cause. The objection which has teen urged against this right is* that he was a trustee for. the plaintiff, of the, property' sold, and, therefore, disqualified from-becoming a purchaser. It would be a sufficient an-' fewer to this objection, that it forms no part of, the breaches assigned in the declaration; But it is- not true,'in point of. fact,: that the testator stood in the character of trustee to the plaintifE Neither the legal nor equitable title to the - property was transferred to' him,' It remained, entirely in the plaintiff, and was under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>his absolute control until the sale, made under the execution, The testator only covenanted that he would sell the property under the execution, to be issued upon the judgment confessed, and apply a sufficiency of the money arising therefrom to the payment of the plaintiff\u2019s honest debts, and account to him for. the, remainder. Under. such circumstances there could be no possible objection to the t\u00e9stator\u2019s becoming a purchaser, at a public sale made by the sheriff. And, indeed, it may well be questioned* whether the rule applies at all to such public sales, there being no chance of practising any' fraud upon the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>by purchasing the property under its real value. \u25a0 (11 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>455.) But the rule itself is not as broad as was Contended for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. In <em>Whichcote </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>(3 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 750.,) the Lord Chancellor says, the rule'is laid down, not very correctly, in most cases where you find it. Jt is stated as a proposition, that a trustee cannot buy of the <em>cestuy que trust; </em>certainly, says he, that naked proposition is not correctly true ; the real sense of the proposition is not that the sale is, <em>ipso jure, </em>null, but that he who undertakes to act for another., in any matter, shall not, in the same matter, act for himself. Therefore, a trustee to sell, shall not, gain <em>any </em>ad= <em>vantage </em>by being himself the person to buy. And, in <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>(cited 1 <em>Cruise, </em>551.,) Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, the court of chancery will not suffer a trustee to purchase the estate of the <em>cestuy que trust, </em>during his. minority, though the transaction be fair and honest; but that the rul\u00e9 against trustees purchasing did not extend to trusts for persons of full age. And where there is a decree for sale of the <em>cestuy que trust\u2019s </em>estate, and an open bidding before the master, then the Court has permitted the trustee to purchase; for that is &gt;an open auction of the estate. x</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The next question is, whether the testator was bound to account to the plaintiff for more than the amount produced by the auction sale. The decision of this point is, necessarily, involved in the answer given to\" the first question. For, if the testator might legally become a purchaser at the auction, the avails of the sale thus made must be the amount for which the testator was accountable ; and the plaintiff can surely have no reason to- complain of such sale, as it was made according to his own agreement and stipulation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>covenant upon' which the present \u00e1cti\u00f3n is f\u00f3unti\u00e9ff provides, \u2022 that- the real and personal estate of the plaintiff sho\u00fcid be. Sold under the judgment; and if that was a fair, <em>bbh\u00e1fidb </em>s\u2019al\u00e9', Which, indeed, has riot been at' all questioned, there'can be no ground, for calling, on the. defendants to account for more than the avails of such. sale.
