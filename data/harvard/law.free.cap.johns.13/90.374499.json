That the indictment was defective in not setting forth the notes more at large, with proper averments of the authority of the bank to issue such notes; so that it might appear that these were valid and existing securities. This objection, he said, applied to both counts. The act of the legislature, authorizing this corporation to Issue notes, gives authority to issue them only in a particular manner; and it does not appear, from the indictment, that the notes in question were issued according to the statute. It is necessary that the thing charged to be stolen should be of some value.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-8\">2. The indictment does not state the notes to be the <em>property </em>of any person; it merely says, being the <em>goods and chattels </em>of <em>P.

In <em>Milne\u2019s </em>case,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was held, that an indictment, stating that the defendant stole \u201c a promissory note for one guinea,\u201d was good.

It'has been repeatedly decided in the courts of Common pleas, and king\u2019s bench, in <em>England, </em>that, in an action of <em>trover </em>for bond and notes, no notice to produce the thing sought to be recovered was necessary.. (1 <em>Camp. N. P. Cas. </em>143. 3 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>143.). Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>in <em>How </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>(14 <em>East, </em>274.,) put the decision on this strong and irrefragable ground,that where the form of the action gives the defendant notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>be prepared to produce the instrument, if necessary, to falsify the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, it is not necessary to give the defendant notice to produce the instrument. This reasoning applies with equal forc\u00e9 to an indictment for stealing an instrument; it supposes it to be in the hands of the defendant, and he is apprized, by the indictment, to produce it, if necessary, to falsify the proof against him. And Lord <em>Ellenlorough </em>mentions a Case before Justice Butler, where parol evidence of the contents of a note \u25a0was permitted, without notice, upon an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We think the notes sufficiently set forth; being.in the <em>hands </em>of the defendant, it was impracticable to state them <em>in hcec verba, </em>and the analogy between <em>trover </em>and an indictment for instruments, again arises ; a general description is all that is required in <em>trover. Milne's </em>case (2 East's, <em>Crown </em>Law,. 602.) warrants this indictment. He was indicted for stealing a promissory note for the payment of one guinea, and, also, one other promissory note for the payment of five guineas; after conviction, a question was reserved for the opinion of the judges, whether the notes were sufficiently described'in the for dictment; and all the judges held the indictment well laid, and the conviction proper. It is true that <em>Craven's </em>case, (2 <em>East, </em>601.,) where the question again arose, was determined differently by all the judges; but we think the former decision more reasonable and sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The remaining question is, whether the notes were well described <em>as the goods and chattels of Peleg Clark. </em>The statute (l <em>R. L. </em>174.) enacts, \u201c that if any person shall steal, &amp;c., any bill of exchange, bond, order, warrant, bill, or promissory note, for payment of any money, &amp;c., being the property of. any other person, &amp;c., it shall be deemed and construed to be felony, of the same nature, and in the same degree, and in the same manner, as it wou)d have been if the offender had stolen, &amp;c., any other goods of the like value, with the money due on such bill, &amp;c., or secured thereby and remaining unsatisfied, and such offender shall suffer such punishment as he, or she, ought to have done, if such offender hqd stolen, &amp;c., other goods of the like value as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">In the case of <em>Sadi </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>(2 <em>East's Crown Law, </em>749.,) it was held,'by a majority of the judges, to be improper to lay bank notes to be <em>chattels ; </em>and the statute of 2 <em>Geo. </em>II. c. 25., is like our statute. The dissentient judges thought that the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>having made -it feloriy to steal bank notes,'in like manner as if (.jjg party had stolen goods of the like value, the receivers of such property stood in the like predicament as the receivers'of other goods and chattels; and <em>East </em>considers.the opinion in <em>Sadi </em>and <em>Morris\u2019s </em>case as shaken, by the resolution of all the judges in <em>Dean\u2019s </em>case, and other cases, wherein bank notes, ,by the operation of -the statute of 2 <em>Geo. </em>II., were h\u00f3lden to .be within the statute of <em>Anne, </em>against stealing money, goods, &amp;c. -.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Blackstone, (2 <em>Com. </em>385.,) says, \u201c that things personal,, by our law, no.t'only include things moveable, but also something inore; the whole of which is comprehended under .the general \u00f1ame of <em>chattels, </em>which. Sir <em>Edward Coke </em>says, is a <em>French </em>word, signify ing goods. \u2022 \u2018 In the grand <em>coustumier </em>of <em>Normandy, </em>(he observes,) a <em>chattel </em>is described as a mere moveable, but at the same tim\u00e9 is s\u00e9t in opposition to a <em>fief </em>or <em>feud, </em>so that nob only goods, but whatever was not a feud, Were accounted chattels ; and it is in this latter more -extended negative sense, that .our law adopts it; the idea of goods, or moveables only, being not sufficiently comprehensive to take in every thing that the few considers as a chattel interest.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">,. We are of the opinion that, since the statute, it is sufficient to lay in an indictment that the notes or instruments, mentioned in the statute, are the goods and chattels of any person who is entitled, to them; and that the word <em>chattels </em>denotes and signifies, when applied as in this case, property and ownership; and that, consequently, the conviction is right.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
