The witness then told the defendant that the plaintiff had found the order among the papers of his testator, which the.^ witness had understood from, the testator, before his death, hadfoeen lost some time ; that he had called upon <em>Eldred, </em>who said .that he had not paid it; and who wanted to know whether the defendant had paid it, and if not, he wished to have it settled. The witness further stated to the defendant that the reason why Eldred'had not paid^the order was, probably, because the bond and mortgage had been assigned about the time that the order was given ; to which the defendant replied, that he supposed that that was the reason. The witness then asked the defendant if he had any recollection of paying'it, but the defendant answered that he had not; and on the witness asking what should be. done about it, the defendant said that he was in great haste, but that he would examine his papers on his return to <em>New-York, </em>and that if he found that he had paid the order, he would write to the witness; but the witness testified that he had never received any letter or communication from the defendant- upon the subject; and that the defendant did not pretend but that the money was justly due to the estate of the plaintiff\u2019s testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-5\">The jury, by the direction of the judge, found a verdict for. the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-6\">A motion was now made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-7\"><em>Mitchill, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A51s\">contended; 1, That die plaintiffs were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-8\">2.

The order drawn by the defendant- upon <em>Eldred, </em>irt favour of <em>vBriggs-, </em>the t\u00e9st\u00e1tor, was, as it imports upon the face of it, to-be/credited upon a bond and mbrtgage, given by <em>Eldred </em>to the defendant and <em>Jesse Potter. </em>'This bond and mortgage was given to them, as the administrators <em>oLJoJvn .-Potter,, </em>'deceased, .for lands belonging to bis estate; and sold under an order of the surrogate ; and the order drawn by the defendant was in part payment \u00f3f a debt due from- <em>John Potter </em>to the testator,' <em>William Briggs. </em>It is very evident, that- this order never was paid by <em>Eldred, </em>nor credited upon the bond and mortgage, as was intended at the time it was .drawn ;, and -the defendant afterwards transferred this bond'and mortgage to <em>Sampson </em>and <em>Warren, </em>and received the full amount thereof, without deducting the order; and in the account subsequently, rendere/1 f\u00b0j and settled before, the surrogate by the defendant,:of .his administration of <em>Potters </em>estate, he received a credit for the debt due <em>to-Briggp,. </em>in- part, payment of which.the order was drawn. These facts show conclusively, that the money has -come into -the defendant\u2019s hands, and will warrant the conclusion, that he. received it to the use of <em>William Briggs. </em>The settlement of his account, and claiming a credit for the. debt paid to <em>Briggs, </em>shows that the defendant considered the money appropriated to the use of <em>Briggs, </em>and not as money in his hands, for the benefit of the'creditors of <em>Potter </em>generally. The plaintiff is, therefore,-entitled ;to. recover, unless barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the statute of limitations; and, in the opinion of the court, the evidence is sufficient to take the case out of the statute. In the conversation stated to have taken place between the defendant and Brown, it was not intimated by the defendant that he intended to avail himself of the statute, but the only question in his mind seemed to be, whether the order had not been paid; and he promised to examine his papers, and if he found he had paid the order, he was to write to the witness; but, as the wit-. ness testified, he never has written. This was sufficient to raise an implied promise to pay the money, unless, on examination, it should be found that the order had been paid, and there is no evidence whatever of any payment. The motion for a new trial must, accordingly, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
