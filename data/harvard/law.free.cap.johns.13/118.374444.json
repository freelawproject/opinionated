The cause was. toied <em>before </em>Mrs. <em>J:.'Spencer, </em>at the Otsego\"circuit;- '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At5\">Both parties claimed under <em>Theobald </em>Young, w;ho, on the 13th <em>June, </em>IT <em>7 </em>1, granted the premises in-question to <em>Frederick Young:; </em>under this .conveyance, and as representatives of- <em>Frederick </em>Young, it appeared that the plaintiff\u2019s lessors sought to -recover, It was proved that,, about twenty-five-years before the trial, <em>John D.

Garlock </em>and wife-went into possession one or two years after, and lived on the lot until about 12 years ago, when they sold and conveyed it to one Walradt, since dead, to whom the defendant, <em>Bilis, </em>was tenant. The conveyance from <em>Garlock </em>to <em>Walradt </em>was dated-the 7th of <em>March, </em>1800, and, on the 11th of <em>March, </em>1800, <em>John D.

That there had been an adverse possession for above 20 years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-9\">2. That <em>F, </em>and <em>A. Young </em>were convicted under the act of \u00a1attainder of 1779 ; and that these convictions (the judgments on which were signed in <em>April, </em>1783) were valid, notwithstanding the preliminary treaty of peace of <em>November </em>30, 1782,</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-10\">3. That all the lessors, on whose demises the plaintiff claims, as well as those under whom the lessors claimed title, are <em>aliens ; </em>and, under this point, two propositions were laid down; <em>first, </em>That all persons, wheresoever born, who were not within the jurisdiction of the <em>United States </em>at the declaration of independence, are <em>aliens, </em>excepting such persons as were absent from necessity, or with intention of returning; <em>second, </em>That all persons who, previous to the declaration of independence, had made their election to continue subjects of the king of <em>Great </em>Britain, and did, within a reasonable lime thereafter, leave the <em>United States, </em>and fly to the <em>British </em>dominions, and who have not since returned to this country, but have claimed to be <em>British </em>subjects, are, in this state, to be considered <em>aliens.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-11\">4.

Rep. 418.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-4\">On the first point, the defendants\u2019 counsel cited 9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>180. <em>Cowper, </em>207.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">The second and third points were argued at- great. length j but as the court have decided the cause on the first point only, it is unnecessary to state the arguments. ;</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A4il\"><em>In the </em>argument of this ease, several very important questions have .been raised, which it becomes unnecessary, however, to notice; because, in.the opinion of the court, such an adverse possession has been shown, as to protect the defendants against this form of action.. It was admitted upon the trial, that <em>Theobald Young, </em>under whom both parties claim, was seised of the premises in question, - It appeared in evidence, that <em>J ohn D. Ypung, </em>son of <em>Theobald, </em>and who claimed the premises as his own, by descent, from his-father, did, about,25 years ago, give: the same to his sister Caiy, the wife of <em>Jacob Garlock. </em>That one or two years afterwards, and at least 22 years since, <em>Garlock </em>and his wife went into possession-under this gift, That, in the year 1800, J. <em>D- Young </em>gave <em>Garlock </em>a deed for the same,,and <em>Garlock </em>sold to <em>Walradt, </em>under whom the defendants hold. It has been repeatedly ruled, in this court, that an entry under claim and colour of title; is s,ufficient to .constitute an adverse holding, . It is not necessary, for .this purpose, that the title, under which such entry is made,, should be a good and valid title. (2 <em>Caines, </em>183. 9 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>174.) 'Taking this to be the rule of law, there can be. DO doubt that the possession taken by <em>Garlpck </em>was tinder claim and colour of title. Although <em>Garlock </em>entered under a parol gift, it must be deemed to be either a possession taken -in his own right, and for his own benefit,- or - in behalf of <em>J. D. Young, </em>who clairrved the premises by descent from his father ; and,, in-either .point of view, the nature of the possession will be the same. If-the deed, subsequently given <em>by Young </em>to<em>Garlock, </em>relates back to the original entry,'then the adverse possession commenced in <em>Garlock </em>himself. If it does not, then. <em>Garhck, </em>under the parol gift, .became a tenant . at will to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Young, and his possession will be deemed the possession of <em>Young. </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>36.) So that, in whatever point of view the case is considered, the original possession taken by <em>Garlock, </em>must be deemed adverse. The defendants are, accordingly, entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Judgment for the defendants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
