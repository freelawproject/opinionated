Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283, 1290 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005). That is where we said that because Camacho\u2019s argument was that there was <em>Booker </em>constitutional error and as a result he should be resentenced without the extra-verdict enhancement, we would, not force upon him a remand on <em>Booker </em>statutory grounds which would involve resentencing with the enhancement and might lead to a higher sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-8\">According to his rehearing petition, Camacho prefers a remand for resentencing on <em>Booker </em>statutory grounds to none at all. In light of that, we vacate our prior opinion in this appeal and substitute for it the following discussion, which is different only in that it deletes footnote four, inserts a new part IV, and adds a sentence to the newly re-numbered Part V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-9\">Except in this regard, Camacho\u2019s petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-10\">Elvis Fredy Camacho-Ibarquen, a Columbian citizen, appeals from his seventy-seven-month sentence for attempting to re-enter the United States after a previous deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). He contends that the district court erred by imposing a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because he entered the United States after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for a crime of violence. Specifically, Camacho argues that \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) applies only to offenses for which the conviction occurred within the previous ten years and that, because the previous crimes for which he was convicted occurred more than ten years ago, he should have received only an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). Camacho also contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We hold that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) has no time limit with regard to the date of conviction and that Camacho\u2019s sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-15\">In July 2003, Camacho boarded the vessel MTV MENDIONDO in San Andres, Colombia as a stowaway in order to gain entry into the United States. Prior to the ship\u2019s arrival at the Port of Miami, agents from the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection boarded the ship and took Camacho into custody. Camacho, a citizen of Colombia, had been deported from the United States to Columbia on three previous occasions \u2014 twice from Miami, Florida and once from New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-16\">A federal grand jury issued a two-count indictment. Count one charged Camacho with being a stowaway on board a vessel in the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2199. Count two charged Camacho with knowingly and unlawfully entering the United States after having been previously deported, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7' 1326(a), (b)(2). In exchange for Camacho pleading guilty to count two, the government agreed to dismiss count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-17\">In the course of being sentenced, Camacho was assigned a base offense level of eight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), but he received a sixteen-level enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>based on two previous convictions that were considered \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). With a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a criminal history category of VI, the guidelines produced a sentencing range of seventy-seven to ninety-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-5\">The first conviction that the district court found to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) occurred in 1985, when Camacho was convicted in Florida for resisting an officer with violence, battery of a law enforcement officer, and carrying a concealed weapon. The other \u201ccrime of violence\u201d occurred in 1988, when Camacho was convicted in Massachusetts for carrying a firearm without a license, possession of a firearm without a firearm identification, and assault and battery by a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-6\">Camacho objected to the sixteen-level enhancement during the sentencing hearing. He argued that his convictions are not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) because a conviction over ten years old is not counted as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and his convictions occurred over ten years prior to his current offense. The district court overruled Camacho\u2019s objection, finding that \u201cthe clear language of the Guidelines\u201d required imposing \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement. Camacho now appeals from the district court\u2019s ruling, renewing his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) applies only to offenses for which the conviction occurred no more than ten years before the current offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-8\">\u201cWe review purely legal questions concerning use of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 sets the base offense level for \u201cUnlawfully Entering or Remaining in the United States\u201d at eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Section 2L1.2(b)(1) then directs the district court to:</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-11\">Apply the Greatest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-12\">If the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-13\">States, after\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-14\">(A) a conviction for a felony that is (i) a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months; (ii) a crime of violence; (iii) a firearms offense; (iv) a child pornography offense; (v) a national security or terrorism offense; (vi) a human trafficking offense; or (vii) an alien smuggling offense, increase by 16 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-15\">(B) a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less, increase by 12 levels;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-16\">(C) a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 8 levels;'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-17\">(D) a conviction for any other felony, increase by 4 levels; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-18\">(E) three or more convictions for misdemeanors that are crimes of violence or drug trafficking offenses, increase by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-19\">Neither the text of \u00a7 2L1.2 nor the application notes that follow state that \u201ca conviction\u201d must have occurred within a particular time period before the current offense for the relevant enhancement listed in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)-(E) to apply. The application notes do explicitly state that two of the terms used in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1), \u201csentence imposed\u201d and \u201caggravated felony,\u201d apply without regard to the date of the underlying conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application nn.1(B)(vii), 3(A). As with many other terms used in \u00a7 2L1.2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>the definitions of those two terms are imported from other provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Application Note l(B)(vii) to \u00a7 2L1.2 states that: \u201c \u2018Sentence imposed\u2019 has the meaning given the term \u2018sentence of imprisonment\u2019 in Application Note 2 and subsection (b) of \u00a7 4A1.2 ..., without regard to the date of the conviction.\u201d Section 4A1.2 is located in the criminal history section of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">Similarly, Application Note 3(A) to \u00a7 2L1.2 states that \u201c\u2018aggravated felony\u2019 has the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)), without regard to the date of conviction for the aggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">Camacho asks us to apply the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alteri-us. </em>He contends that, because two terms in \u00a7 2L1.2 have explicit language directing that they apply without regard to the date of the conviction, the remainder of the operative terms have an implied restriction on the time period from which convictions can be considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further contends that the method for calculating this implied age limit on convictions should be borrowed from the criminal history section of the sentencing guidelines. If we agreed, the only convictions that could be used to enhance under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) would be those that occurred within ten years of committing the current offense and those that explicitly direct that they are applicable without regard to the date of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">According to Camacho, \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), which does not explicitly state that any conviction can be used regardless of the date, was improperly applied to him because the convictions on which the enhancement was based occurred more than ten years ago. He contends that his convictions qualify only as \u201caggravated felonies\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), which directs an eight-level enhancement and has language in the application notes stating that aggravated felonies are considered without regard to the date of the conviction. Camacho concludes by arguing that, at the least, \u00a7 2L1.2 is ambiguous and the rule of lenity requires this Court to apply the less harsh eight-level enhancement for \u201caggravated felonies\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-12\">With regard to the principle of statutory construction that the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another, or <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>its application has been described as \u201c \u2018an aid to construction, not a rule of law. It is not conclusive, is applicable only under certain conditions, is subject to exceptions, may not be used to create an ambiguity, and requires great caution in its application.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Castro, </em>837 F.2d 441, 443 n. 2 (11th Cir.1988) (quoting 73 Am.Jur.2d <em>Statutes </em>\u00a7 212, at 405-06). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e will not read into the guidelines and their commentaries requirements that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>not stated, or at least fairly implied, in them. And that is especially true where doing so would produce questionable results.\u201d <em>United States v. Olshan, </em>371 F.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">The application of <em>expressio unius </em>in the way suggested by Camacho would produce \u201cquestionable results.\u201d The most obvious problem is that if the Sentencing Commission had intended \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)-(E) to mean what Camacho argues, there is no reason the Commission would not have written an explicit time restriction into that guideline. The Commission obviously knew how to explicitly limit the application of certain convictions, as it did so with regard to convictions that occurred when the defendant was a minor. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application n.1(A)(iv). Other guidelines sections, such as \u00a7 4A1.2(e) in the criminal history section, also include explicit time restrictions on the application of certain convictions. We are more inclined to find that, because other guidelines sections have explicit time restrictions on the application of convictions, the omission of such a restriction in \u00a7 2L1.2 means that none was intended for that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">Another \u201cquestionable result\u201d would follow from reading a time restriction into \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See Olshan, </em>371 F.3d at 1300. Section 2L1.2 gives no guidance as to what time-period limitation we should read into the otherwise unrestricted terms. We find it highly unlikely that the Sentencing Commission intended that \u00a7 2L1.2 should have a time period restriction of unspecified length. Camacho argues that the time period limitation provisions from the criminal history section of the guidelines should be imported into \u00a7 2L1.2. But there is no reason to choose these provisions over any others. <em>See United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez, </em>112 F.3d 1325 (7th Cir.1997) (refusing to apply the criminal history section\u2019s 15-year limitation on foreign convictions to the aggravated felony enhancement under former \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">There is another reason to conclude that there is no time limitation that applies to all of the \u00a7 2L1.2 provisions without explicit language to the contrary. Recall that the definitions of \u201csentence imposed\u201d and \u201caggravated felony,\u201d the two terms in \u00a7 2L1.2 with the \u201cdate of conviction\u201d language, are imported from provisions outside of \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application nn.1(B)(vii), 3(A). Each of those provisions has language limiting the time period in which certain kinds of convictions can apply. It is entirely possible, indeed likely, that the Sentencing Commission wanted to import into \u00a7 2L1.2 the substantive., definitions from these other provisions, but not the time limitations they contain, and that' is the reason it added the \u201cwithout regard to the date of conviction\u201d language in the application notes defining \u201csentence imposed\u201d and \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">Application Note 1(B)(vii) of \u00a7 2L1.2 imports the definition of \u201csentence imposed\u201d from U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, which is part of the criminal history section of the guidelines. In addition to giving a substantive definition, \u00a7 4A1.2 limits the convictions that can be used in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. Under \u00a7 4A1.2, if the sentence imposed for a conviction was over one year and one month, then the conviction is counted if it occurred within fifteen years; all other convictions are counted if they occurred within ten years. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e). In drafting \u00a7 2L1.2, the Sentencing Commission chose to import \u00a7 4A1.2\u2019s definition of \u201csentence imposed,\u201d but not to import \u00a7 4A1.2\u2019s time restriction on applicable convictions. It accomplished that with language explaining that the definition of \u201csentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>posed\u201d is imported from the criminal history section but \u201cwithout regard to the date of the conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application n.l(B)(vii). In other words, the Sentencing Commission imported that portion of the criminal history section\u2019s definition that it wanted to apply, which is the substantive definition, and it expressly ruled out that portion it did not want to apply, which is the time-period restriction. <em>See United States v. Stultz, </em>356 F.3d 261, 268-69 (2d Cir.2004) (rejecting the argument that because some definitions of terms in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s application notes do not have the \u201cwithout regard to the date of conviction\u201d language, \u201cthis omission means that the date of conviction is fair grounds for downward departure for any felonies listed in subsections (A) and (B)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Similarly, \u00a7 2L1.2 imported the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d from the Immigration and Nationality Act. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application n.3(A). Under the INA\u2019s definition of \u201caggravated felony,\u201d the applicability of foreign convictions is limited to those where the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous fifteen years. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Because it wanted only the substantive definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d to apply to \u00a7 2L1.2, the Sentencing Commission included express language stating that the conviction was to be counted regardless of the date when it occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-9\">No other definition of a term in \u00a7 2L1.2 that was imported from a different statute had attached to it a provision that, if not explicitly addressed, might suggest that only convictions occurring within a particular time-frame would be applied in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, there was no need to include language in any other application note stating that a particular conviction was to be applied without regard to the date of conviction. <em>See Stultz, </em>356 F.3d at 269 (finding that \u201cthe clause referring to dates of conviction was unnecessary with respect to drug trafficking crimes, and such omission is not an invitation to consider the period of time between offenses as grounds for departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">The language in Application Notes 1(B)(vii) and 3(A) stating that the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>are applied without regard to the date of conviction was included not to distinguish them from the rest of \u00a7 2L1.2, but to distinguish them from the statutory context from where the terms came. The \u201cwithout regard to the date of conviction\u201d language in those two application notes was included to keep those two terms in accord with the rest of \u00a7 2L1.2; it was done to make clear that \u00a7 2L1.2 contains no restriction on the time period from which convictions are applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">Camacho also argues that the rule of lenity should be applied to reduce the sixteen-level enhancement he received under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) to an eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). We will apply the rule of lenity only if the provision being construed is still ambiguous after application of normal rules of construction. <em>See United States v. Jeter, </em>329 F.3d 1229, 1230 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Holloway v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 1, 12 n. 14, 119 S.Ct. 966, 972 n. 14, 143 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (\u201cWe have repeatedly stated that the rule of lenity applies only if, after seizing everything from which aid can be derived, we can make no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\u201d (internal quotation and marks omitted)). Based on \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s language, a comparison of the provisions at issue with the rest of \u00a7 2L1.2 and with the rest of the Guidelines, and the purpose of the provisions in \u00a7 2L1.2 that have express, time limitations, it is clear that \u00a7 2L1.2 contains no general time restriction for applicable convictions. Therefore, we have no occasion to apply the rule of lenity. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>318 F.3d 1257, 1264 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that \u201cthe interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is governed by traditional rules of statutory interpretation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-8\">Camacho next contends that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014 , 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Camacho argues that his guilty plea encompassed only conduct that was sufficient for the district court to apply the eight-point enhancement for a previous \u201caggravated felony\u201d pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). He asserts that by applying the sixteen-point enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by applying facts that were neither found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt nor admitted by him in his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">Because Camacho failed to raise this issue before the district' court, we review only under a plain error standard. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-10\">Camacho\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement was based solely on the fact that he had previous convictions.. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. <em>Id.; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number><em>see also United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThis conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not violate Camacho\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement based on his previous convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">Although the district court did not commit a Sixth Amendment violation in sentencing Camacho, it did commit a statutory error under <em>Booker. </em>As we stated in <em>Shelton, </em>the district court commits a statutory error by sentencing a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d 400 F.3d at 1330-31. By sentencing Camacho under a mandatory guidelines scheme, the district court committed a <em>Booker </em>statutory error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1342-6\">As we stated before, because Camacho did not raise this argument before the district court, our review is only for plain error. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Because the district court treated the guidelines as mandatory, it committed an error that is plain. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Despite meeting the first two prongs of the plain error test, Camacho has failed to fulfill his burden on the third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">Meeting the third prong of the plain error test \u201crequires that an error have affected substantial rights, which almost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299 (quotations and marks omitted). To determine whether an error has affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, \u201cwe ask whether there is a reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-11\">Camacho\u2019s only argument in this regard is the blanket contention that the district court imposed the guideline sentence it did \u201csolely\u201d because of the mandatory nature of the guidelines. As we said in <em>Shelton, </em>\u201c[t]o establish the third prong takes something more than showing the district court sentenced within the Guidelines range and felt bound to do so, especially given that the Guidelines range remains an important factor in sentencing.\u201d 400 F.3d at 133. Furthermore, a review of the sentencing transcript in this case indicates that, if anything, the district court was contemplating imposing a longer sentence rather than a shorter one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-12\">As a result, Camacho has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion by the sentencing judge in this case.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-14\">Because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) covers convictions without regard to their date, the district court committed no error in finding that Camacho\u2019s previous convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>tions warranted the application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii)\u2019s sixteen-level enhancement for \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d Furthermore, the district court did not violate Camacho\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker </em>by imposing a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) based on his prior convictions. Finally, Camacho did not carry his burden of demonstrating that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>statutory error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">. Camacho also argues that the 2003 amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2, which added language in an application note clarifying that the term \"sentence imposed\u201d is to be calculated without regard to the date of conviction, is a substantive change and, as a result, cannot be applied to him. The sentencing guidelines commentary makes clear that the 2003 amendments to \u00a7 2L1.2 made no substantive changes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. amend. 658, app. C, vol. II at 401 (stating that the reason for the 2003 amendments was to \"clarify[] the meaning of some of the terms used in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)\u201d). Because the 2003 amendments are not substantive, i.e. they do not lead to the imposition of harsher penalties, we apply \u00a7 2L1.2 as it existed when Camacho was sentenced on March 2, 2004. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). In any event, whether the application note clarifying the term \"sentence imposed\u201d made a substantive change has no impact on the determination of whether \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) has a time period restriction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1340-5\">. Although there are two terms other than \"sentence imposed\u201d and \"aggravated felony\u201d in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s application notes that import terms from statutes that have within them an age limitation for applicable convictions, there was no need to include express language in the application notes to make it clear that the convictions they are referring to are applied in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) without regard to the date of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\">Like the application note defining \"aggravated felony,\" the application note defining \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d imports the definition from INA \u00a7 101(a)(43). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, application nn.1(B)(i), 3(A). However, unlike an \"aggravated felony,\u201d an \"alien smuggling offense,\u201d by definition, cannot be a violation of the law of a foreign country. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a). Because the time limitation in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43) only applies to convictions for violations of foreign law, there was no need to include express language disregarding INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)'s age limitation on foreign convictions in \u00a7 2L1.2's application note defining \"alien smuggling offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-12\">Similarly, Application Note 4(B), like the application note defining \"sentence imposed,\u201d imports the definition of a term from the guidelines\u2019 criminal history section. Application Note 4(B) of \u00a7 2L1.2 states that \" \u2018[t]hree or more convictions' means at least three convictions for offenses that are not considered 'related cases', as that term is defined in Application Note 3 of \u00a7 4A1.2.\u201d Application Note 3 of \u00a7 4A1.2 directs that offenses are not related if they are \"separated by an intervening arrest.\u201d Because the determination of whether cases are related has nothing to do with whether there is a time restriction on particular convictions and the definition imported from the criminal history section into \u00a7 2L1.2 is limited to determining whether offenses are related cases, including an explicit reference dismissing the criminal history section's time bar for certain convictions would have served no purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1342-8\">.
