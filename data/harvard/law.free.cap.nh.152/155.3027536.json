Richmond, receive a six-month suspension from the practice of law. We referred the petition to a Judicial Referee <em>(Temple, </em>J.) for a hearing. The referee found by clear and convincing evidence that Richmond violated New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1(a), 1.1(b)(1), 1.1(b)(5), 1.7(a), 1.7(b), 1.8(a), 7.1(a) and 8.4(a), and recommended suspension for six months and assessment of costs. We adopt the referee\u2019s recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The record reflects the following facts. Richmond was admitted to the practice of law in New Hampshire in May 1996. This professional conduct matter arose from Richmond\u2019s representation of Seaton Gras and his later involvement with Gras in the formation of an Internet start-up company, Environmental Showcase, Limited (ESL). Richmond first represented Gras in 1997 in an action against Gras\u2019 former employer to collect his judgment on a wage claim. During the prior year, Gras had been terminated from his position at Global Environmental Solutions (GES), a company he formed along with three other co-venturers in 1994. Richmond collected approximately $6,000 of the $36,000 owed to Gras.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Two years later, in April 1999, Richmond represented Gras and Graham Bunce, a co-venturer in GES, in an involuntary bankruptcy action against GES. Richmond testified that he discussed the potential conflict of interest created by his joint representation of Gras and Bunce and they orally waived the conflict. Richmond, however, did not obtain a written waiver of the conflict from either client.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">While representing Gras and Bunce on their bankruptcy claim, Richmond also represented Bunce in a lawsuit brought against him by Stephen Barnes, another GES co-venturer, on an unpaid promissory note. In November 1999, Bunce, without Richmond\u2019s assistance, agreed to settle the matter with Barnes. The settlement agreement required Bunce to withdraw from the bankruptcy petition against GES and cease assisting Gras in that litigation. Although Richmond did not aid Bunce in the settlement negotiations, he reviewed the settlement agreement and gave Bunce his approval, even though the settlement terms were adverse to Gras. Shortly thereafter, Richmond filed a motion for leave to withdraw from representing Gras in the bankruptcy action. The bankruptcy court permitted Richmond\u2019s withdrawal over Gras\u2019 objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">During the same period of time in 1999, Gras and Richmond formed ESL based upon an idea that Gras developed to provide a web portal to the environmental industry. Gras was the majority shareholder and chief executive officer of ESL, while Richmond was a member of the board of directors and the Chief Operating Officer (COO). Acting as COO and corporate counsel, Richmond filed ESL\u2019s articles of incorporation, drafted corporate by-laws and advised ESL on securities matters. Over the course of his involvement with ESL, Richmond never disclosed the potential conflict of interest stemming from his roles as COO, corporate counsel, board member and shareholder. Richmond failed to obtain the board members\u2019 written consent to serve as corporate counsel and did not advise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the board to seek the advice of independent counsel regarding the potential conflicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In August 1999, on ESL\u2019s behalf, Richmond filed a form U-7 disclosure document with the New Hampshire Bureau of Securities Regulation (Bureau) in order to conduct a sale of up to one million dollars of common stock. The web site for Richmond\u2019s law firm suggested that he had experience in helping small businesses file direct public offerings, although Richmond had only drafted offerings that had never been filed. The Bureau completed an initial review of the form U-7 and commented on at least eighty-four items that required correction or additional disclosure. After further discussions with the Bureau, Richmond later withdrew the form U-7 on ESL\u2019s behalf. The Bureau conducted an investigation that resulted in a consent order in which Richmond, Gras and ESL admitted violating State securities laws by selling unregistered securities and selling securities without a license. <em>See </em>RSA 421-B:6 (Supp. 2004); RSA 421-B:11 (Supp. 2004). ESL agreed to pay a $7,500 administrative fine and Richmond and Gras were ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Based upon these facts, the referee found that Richmond violated Rules of Professional Conduct 1.7(a) and (b) in representing Gras and Bunce without adequately identifying the conflicts of interest and obtaining both clients\u2019 consent to the representation despite the conflicts. The referee also found that Richmond violated Rules 1.7(a) and (b), 1.8(a) and 8.4(a) by forming and operating ESL while serving as corporate counsel without disclosing the potential conflict of interest and obtaining a written waiver. Finally, the referee found that Richmond violated Rules 1.1(a) and (b), 7.1(a) and 8.4(a) by issuing unregistered securities, inadequately preparing the form U-7 and misrepresenting his firm\u2019s legal services. The referee recommended that Richmond receive a six-month suspension from the practice of law and assessment of all expenses incurred by the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Richmond argues that the referee applied an improper standard in evaluating his competence in securities law and in determining that his web site advertisement was false and misleading. <em>See </em>N.H. R. PROF. Conduct 1.1, 7.1. Although Richmond does not dispute the referee\u2019s findings of conflict of interest violations, he argues that we should impose a lesser sanction than the referee recommended based upon the severity of the offenses and the presence of several mitigating factors. The committee argues that we should adopt the referee\u2019s findings and recommended sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>In professional conduct matters, we defer to the referee\u2019s factual findings if supported by the record but retain the ultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, the appropriate sanction. <em>Shillen\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. 132, 136 (2003). We review the referee\u2019s factual findings to determine whether a reasonable person could reach the same conclusion as the referee based upon the evidence presented. <em>Id. </em>However, we review <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the referee committed errors of law. <em>Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. 19, 22 (2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 815 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We first address Richmond\u2019s argument that the referee incorrectly applied a \u201cspecialist\u201d or \u201cexpert\u201d standard when evaluating his conduct under Rules 1.1(a) and (b). He argues that under the correct standard, a \u201cgeneral practitioner\u201d standard, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that he violated these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Rule 1.1(a) states, \u201cA lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.\u201d N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 1.1(a). Rule 1.1(b) establishes the minimum requirements for legal competence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">(1) specific knowledge about the fields of law in which the lawyer practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">(2) performance of the techniques of practice with skill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">(3) identification of areas beyond the lawyer\u2019s competence and bringing those areas to the client\u2019s attention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">(4) proper preparation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">(5) attention to details and schedules necessary to assure that the matter undertaken is completed with no avoidable harm to the client\u2019s interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-12\"><em>Id. </em>1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">Richmond argues that the referee erred in relying upon the report and testimony of Alan L. Reische, the committee\u2019s expert witness on securities law, in evaluating Richmond\u2019s competency and in doing so applied the knowledge and skill of a securities law specialist in judging Richmond\u2019s conduct. We agree with Richmond that expertise in a specific area of law generally is not required in order to meet the minimum standards for competency under Rule 1.1. The ABA Model Code comments to Rule 1.1 state that \u201c[i]n many instances, the required proficiency is that of a general practitioner____A lawyer need not necessarily have special training or prior experience to handle problems of a type with which the lawyer is unfamiliar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1.1 ABA Model Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Comments. However, \u201c[expertise in a particular field of law may be required in some circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rule 1.1 mandates that a general practitioner must identify areas in which the lawyer is not competent and acquire sufficient knowledge about the specific area of law in which the lawyer is practicing in order to avoid harm to the client. <em>See id. </em>1.1(b)(1), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In his report, the referee noted that Richmond \u201clacked needed knowledge and skill concerning the operation and interplay with state and federal securities legislation\u201d and \u201cfailed to ... acquire the needed knowledge from other sources.\u201d Likewise, Reische testified that, in his opinion, Richmond did not have specific knowledge about securities law, failed to identify areas beyond his competence and bring these to the client\u2019s attention, and failed to pay sufficient attention to detail to avoid harm to ESL\u2019s interests. Although Richmond argues that he made reasonable efforts to learn the requirements for filing the form U-7 by contacting a staff attorney at the Bureau, Reische noted \u201cexamples throughout the form that reflect an unfamiliarity with disclosure standards and securities practice.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the referee applied the correct standard in evaluating Richmond\u2019s conduct and that the record supports the referee\u2019s finding that Richmond violated Rules 1.1(a), (b)(1) and (b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Richmond also argues that the referee erred in finding that the content of his firm\u2019s web site violated Rule 7.1. Rule 7.1 prohibits a lawyer from making a \u201cfalse or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer\u2019s services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>7.1. A communication is false or misleading if it \u201ccontains a material misrepresentation of fact or law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>7.1(a). The referee found that Richmond\u2019s web site advertised his expertise in financing and raising capital even though \u201che did not have any special training or experience in securities law.\u201d Richmond testified that he had previously drafted, but never filed, a registration statement for the issuance of stock with the Bureau. Thus, the record supports the referee\u2019s finding that Richmond presented a material misrepresentation of fact in violation of Rule 7.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Having found that Richmond violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, we next consider the appropriate sanction. Richmond argues that his violations warrant lesser sanctions than those recommended by the referee. In exercising our authority, we are mindful that discipline is not intended as a mode of inflicting punishment for an offense. <em>O\u2019Meara\u2019s Case, </em>150 N.H. 157, 159 (2003). Rather, its purpose \u201cis to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The sanction we impose must take into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating circumstances appearing in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Although we have not adopted the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1992) (Standards), we look to them for guidance. <em>Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. at 28. The Standards set forth the following factors for courts to consider in imposing sanctions: \u201c(a) the duty violated; (b) the lawyer\u2019s mental state; (c) the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct; and (d) the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3.0; <em>see Kersey\u2019s Case, </em>150 N.H. 585, 587, <em>cert. denied, </em>125 S. Ct. 97 (2004). In the case of multiple charges of misconduct, the ABA recommends that the sanction imposed \u201cshould at least be consistent with the sanction for the most serious instance of misconduct among a number of violations; it might well be and generally should be greater than the sanction for the most serious misconduct.\u201d American Bar Association, Compendium of Professional Responsibility Rules and Standards 341 (1999 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">We first examine the recommended sanction for lack of competence. The Standards provide that suspension is appropriate when a lawyer \u201cengages in an area of practice in which the lawyer knows he or she is not competent, and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.52. Richmond counters that a reprimand combined with probation would adequately address the purposes of discipline in this case, including preserving the integrity of the profession. <em>See O\u2019Meara\u2019s Case, </em>150 N.H. at 159. The referee found, and we agree, that Richmond lacked the skill and knowledge needed to practice securities law. Richmond\u2019s numerous errors in conducting ESL\u2019s stock offerings and filing the form U-7 demonstrate his lack of knowledge about securities law practice. Furthermore, Richmond violated Rule 7.1 by misrepresenting the extent of his experience in this practice area on his firm\u2019s web site. Throughout these proceedings, Richmond has maintained that he made reasonable efforts to educate himself about the regulatory process prior to filing the form U-7. The record, however, provides clear and convincing evidence that Richmond\u2019s lack of competence harmed ESL, resulting in withdrawal of the form U-7 and an administrative fine for violations of State securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In addition to violating Rules 1.1 and 7.1, Richmond admitted violating Rules 1.7 and 1.8 through his joint representation of Gras and Bunce in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>bankruptcy litigation and his role as corporate counsel for ESL. Commitment of multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct is an aggravating factor that justifies an increase in the degree of discipline imposed. Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9.21, 9.22; <em>cf. Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. at 29. We also consider a prior disciplinary offense, including Richmond\u2019s reprimand in 1999 for an unrelated violation of the Rules, as an aggravating factor. Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Before we determine what disciplinary action we will take, we must also consider mitigating factors. <em>Kersey\u2019s </em>Case, 150 N.H. at 588. The referee found no substantial mitigating factors and recommended that Richmond be suspended for six months. Richmond argues that the following mitigating factors support a more lenient sanction: (1) his lack of a dishonest motive; (2) his good faith effort to remedy the effects of his misconduct; (3) his cooperation with the committee; (4) the fact that he has already suffered financial loss; and (5) his remorse for his actions. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32. We consider the evidence and weight of each of these factors in turn. <em>See Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">First, Richmond points to his lack of a dishonest or selfish motive, coupled with his belief that he participated in the formation and operation of ESL as a co-venturer. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32(b). We find, however, that Richmond acted dishonestly in misrepresenting on his web site the extent of his experience in securities law. Thus, we do not find this mitigating factor to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Second, Richmond argues that by withdrawing from his representation of Gras in the bankruptcy litigation, he made a timely and good faith effort to rectify the conflict of interest that developed. However, mitigation considers whether there was a \u201ctimely good faith effort to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct.\u201d Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32(d). Richmond\u2019s withdrawal did not \u201crectify consequences\u201d but merely satisfied Rule 1.16, which requires the termination of a professional relationship after a conflict of interest causes harm. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Prof. Conduct 1.16(a)(1). Thus, there is no mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Third, Richmond argues that he has been cooperative with the committee and was forthcoming in his testimony before the referee. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32(e). Although we agree that Richmond cooperated with the committee\u2019s inquiries and ensuing hearings, we do not ascribe significant weight to this factor because a lawyer has a professional duty to cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation. <em>See Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Fourth, Richmond argues that suspension is too great a sanction because he already suffered financial loss due to his involvement with ESL and suspension from practice would terminate his means of earning a livelihood. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32(1) (recognizing \u201cimposition of other penalties or sanctions\u201d as a mitigating factor). However, we do not regard Richmond\u2019s financial losses resulting from his poor investment decisions as the type of penalty or sanction that would warrant mitigation. <em>See Wholey\u2019s Case, </em>110 N.H. 449, 450 (1970) (noting fact that attorney had been subjected to fines and probation in criminal proceeding \u201cis a circumstance to be considered but does not provide absolution from the charges made by [the] complaint\u201d); <em>see also Jones\u2019 Case, </em>137 N.H. 351, 359 (1993) (noting prior sanction and penalty under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Finally, Richmond argues that he feels sincere remorse for his violations. <em>See </em>Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 9.32(m). The committee acknowledges that Richmond expressed remorse and admitted the conflict of interest violations. The referee, however, found that \u201cMr. Richmond has shown little appreciation for the conflicts that could arise from his multiple representation of parties\u201d and that \u201c[a] risk of harm is presented by Mr. Richmond\u2019s position that he may continue to offer legal services in areas in which he is not competent.\u201d Therefore, we do not find a level of remorse adequate to merit mitigation. <em>Cf. O\u2019Meara\u2019s Case, </em>150 N.H. at 159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Because our review of the record reveals aggravating factors but no substantial mitigating factors, we agree with the referee\u2019s recommendation of a six-month suspension from the practice of law. In addition, we adopt the referee\u2019s recommendation that Richmond surrender his client files for inventory by a court-appointed attorney, reimburse the committee for the costs of investigating and prosecuting this matter and disclose the jurisdictions where he is admitted to practice law. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(14)(a) (2003; amended 2003); 37(16) (2003; amended 2003); Standards, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 2.8. Furthermore, we note that Richmond must satisfactorily complete the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination in order to be reinstated. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(12)(e) (2003; amended 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Richmond is hereby suspended from the practice of law for six months. We remand to the referee to determine the costs associated with this case. The suspension shall begin thirty days from the date of this opinion or upon issuance of a decision based upon any motions for rehearing or reconsideration, whichever is later. Richmond shall have the right to resume the practice of law after the expiration of the suspension period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>upon compliance with all the terms and conditions of this order. We order that Richmond may be reinstated pursuant to the procedure set forth in Supreme Court Rule 37(14)(f) (2004) regarding reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Dalianis and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
