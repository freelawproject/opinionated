The plaintiffs appeal an order of the Superior Court (Hollman, J.) dismissing their petition for declaratory judgment. We affirm the result, albeit on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-18\">The plaintiffs, judicial branch employees working for the New Hampshire Superior Court, brought this petition for declaratory judgment seeking a determination that the defendants, the New Hampshire Administrative Office of the Courts and the New Hampshire Supreme Court, be equitably estopped from terminating their employment except for just cause based upon poor individual job performance or misconduct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The superior court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for specific performance of an alleged oral contract for continued employment and, further, dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The plaintiffs appealed and this court ordered briefing and oral argument on the two issues upon which the case was dismissed by the trial court. Following oral argument, we requested supplemental briefing on the issue of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\">On appeal, we do not reach the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because we hold that they are barred by sovereign immunity. Pursuant to that immunity, neither the superior court nor this court is vested with subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See LaRoche, Adm\u2019rv. Doe, </em>134 N.H. 562, 566 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In New Hampshire, the State is immune from suit in its courts without its consent. <em>Sousa v. State, </em>115 N.H. 340, 342 (1975). \u201cSovereign immunity is a jurisdictional question not to be waived by conduct or undermined by estoppel.\u201d <em>LaRoche, </em>134 N.H. at 566 (quotation omitted). \u201cIt is not a defense which must be affirmatively pled.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Sovereign immunity rested on a common law basis until the enactment in 1978 of RSA chapter 99-D, which adopted sovereign immunity \u201cas the law of the state,\u201d except where a statute might provide an exception. <em>Tilton v. Dougherty, </em>126 N.H. 294, 298 (1985) (quotation omitted); <em>see LaRoche, </em>134 N.H. at 566 (\u201c[o]ur decisions have found express or implied consent to suit only in the acts of our legislature\u201d). The plaintiffs concede that the defendants in this case \u201care included within the scope of the sovereign immunity doctrine as applied in New Hampshire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">New Hampshire courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear an action against the State unless the legislature has \u201cprescribe[d] the terms and conditions on which it consents to be sued, and the manner in which the suit shall be conducted.\u201d <em>Sousa, </em>115 N.H. at 344 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). The doctrine \u201cserves two general public policy considerations: the protection of the public against profligate encroachment on the public treasury, and the need for the orderly administration of government, which, in the absence of immunity, would be disrupted if the state could be sued at the instance of every citizen.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Raduazo, </em>148 N.H. 687, 692 (2002) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 942 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The plaintiffs argue that the State waived its immunity from this suit by enacting RSA 491:8 (1997). In addition, the plaintiffs argue that there is no prohibition of declaratory judgment actions against the State and that the instant action, \u201cwhich seeks only a declaration that termination of the plaintiffs\u2019 employment ... would breach the promises made to [them],\u201d should be permitted to proceed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Jurisdiction has been conferred upon the superior court \u201cto enter judgment against the state of New Hampshire founded upon any express or implied contract with the state.\u201d RSA 491:8. This statute, however, has been interpreted to limit relief to suits seeking money damages for breach of contract. <em>Wiseman v. State, </em>98 N.H. 393, 397 (1953). \u201c[RSA 491:8] contains no reference to redress in equity and therefore requires <em>a fortiori </em>an interpretation which limits the consent given <em>to </em>actions for the recovery of damages.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\">As the trial court recognized in this case, \u201c[t]he appropriate remedy ... is by way of an action for damages for breach of contract.\u201d The plaintiffs, however, have not brought a suit seeking money damages for breach of contract and, therefore, the case does not fall within the limited waiver of immunity established by RSA 491:8.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">We also disagree with the plaintiffs that because this action is one for declaratory judgment, it should be allowed to proceed. The plaintiffs cite <em>Raduazo </em>as \u201c[d]ireetly on point.\u201d In <em>Raduazo, </em>however, the State invited jurisdiction by entering a claim in probate court over certain funds. <em>Raduazo, </em>148 N.H. at 688. As this court recognized, sovereign immunity does not apply when the State itself asserts a claim over another\u2019s property. <em>See id. </em>at 692. The case does not support the plaintiffs\u2019 position that any citizen may file a declaratory judgment action against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The declaratory judgment statute, RSA 491:22 (1997), \u201chas long been construed to permit challenges to the constitutionality of actions by our government or its branches.\u201d <em>Grinnell v. State, </em>121 N.H. 823, 825 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">When a law is challenged as unconstitutional, the claim is that the law is void and hence that no law has been enacted. It follows that if the legislature has not acted under authority, no action has been taken by the State, and hence when suit is brought to restrain those representing the State from carrying the void legislation into operation and enforcing it, it is not a proceeding to which the State is a party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\"><em>Conway v. Water Resources Board, </em>89 N.H. 346, 348 (1938). Accordingly, where the plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that actions taken by the State are unconstitutional, \u201cthe court ha[s] jurisdiction to grant equitable relief.\u201d <em>Claremont School Dist. v. Governor (Costs and Attorney\u2019s Fees), </em>144 N.H. 590, 593 (1999). The plaintiffs here, however, do not challenge the constitutionality of the actions taken by the defendants. In the absence of specific legislative consent, they are barred by sovereign immunity from bringing this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Furthermore, although the plaintiffs assert that they are only seeking a declaration of their legal rights to continued employment, the plaintiffs affirmatively seek to prevent the defendants from firing, laying off, or ehminating their employment and seek to void an administrative order issued by the New Hampshire Supreme Court authorizing the plaintiffs\u2019 layoffs. Although the plaintiffs amended their original petition for protective injunction to one for declaratory judgment, the requested relief remained essentially the same. As the trial court stated, \u201c[R]egardless of how the petitioners have styled their suit in equity ... [they] are effectively proceeding upon the theory that they are entitled to specific performance of promised employment for life____[S]uch a promise is not enforceable in equity by specific performance or injunctive relief,\u201d or, may we add, by declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Although a contract action for damages is expressly allowed by RSA 491:8, the plaintiffs have not brought such an action. Because the plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of the defendants\u2019 actions and the State has not consented to be sued in equity for the claims presented by the plaintiffs, this action is barred by sovereign immunity. The petition is dismissed <em>ab initio. </em>The order of the trial court is vacated, except as specifically approved herein. This decision does not bar a future action for damages consistent with RSA 491:8 as interpreted in <em>Morgenroth &amp; Assoc\u2019s, Inc. v. Town of Tilton, </em>121 N.H. 511 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\n<em>Vacated and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b662-7\">Temple and Dickson, JJ., retired superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred; Pappagianis and Dunn, JJ., retired superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b662-8\">Pappagianis and Dunn, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADX\">retired superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, dissenting. We would grant the plaintiffs\u2019 second motion for restraining order and/or extended/further stay of execution of career termination efforts, a motion that sought to enjoin the April 8, 2005 supreme court administrative order laying off all court reporters/stenographers; withdraw the majority\u2019s September 7, 2005 order denying that second motion; rule that the supreme court\u2019s April 8, 2005 administrative order and the defendants\u2019 April 21, 2005 notice of employment termination are not effective in the present circumstances because of a July 28, 2004 trial court order; and remand the case to the trial court with an order to permit the plaintiffs to conduct discovery within a reasonable time period to be set by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The majority rejects the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the State waived its immunity from the present suit by enacting RSA 491:8 (1997), saying that RSA 491:8 limits relief to suits seeking money damages for breach of contract and makes no reference to redress in equity. The majority opinion overlooks the oft-stated position of the plaintiffs that termination of their employment would breach promises made to them, entitling them to pursue their rights by equitable estoppel <em>or </em>pursuant to RSA 491:8. \u201cIn the event of a [declaratory judgment] ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, they would be entitled to enforce their rights, if necessary, pursuant to RSA 491:8.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\">Quoting <em>Grinnell v. State, </em>121 N.H. 823, 825 (1981), the majority states that the declaratory judgment statute, RSA 491:22, \u201chas long been construed to permit challenges to the constitutionality of actions by our government or its branches.\u201d The majority then concludes that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs here, however, do not challenge the constitutionality of the actions taken by the defendants,\u201d and are therefore \u201cbarred by sovereign immunity from bringing this petition\u201d for declaratory judgment. The majority\u2019s rationale that cases holding that the declaratory judgment statute, RSA 491:22 (1997), is used to challenge the constitutionality of governmental action also inexplicably means that the statute can be used solely for that purpose is without merit.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">The plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is based upon principles of contract and equitable estoppel. At this point they seek <em>only </em>a declaration that they <em>have </em>such a cause of action; and that <em>if </em>the defendants were to continue to take steps to terminate their employment, and professional careers, it would be a breach of contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">\u201c[The declaratory judgment act] is designed to prevent not only threatened wrongs, but also uncertainty and misunderstandings in the assertion of rights.\u201d <em>Beaudoin v. State, </em>113 N.H. 559, 562 (1973). \u201cAs a consequence, declaratory relief may be sought prior to an actual invasion of rights____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\"><em>A </em>purpose of the declaration of judgment act is to encourage identification and resolution of disputes before they cause harm and is accordingly given a liberal interpretation. 5 R. Wiebusch, New Hampshire Practice, Civil Practice and Procedure \u00a7 36.02, at 124 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The trial court expressly stated in its decision granting the motion to dismiss that the plaintiffs had a cause of action for damages because of breach of contract. Until the majority raised the question of sovereign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>immunity, the defendants, in several filings, expressly stated that the plaintiffs had a cause of action for damages for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\">Given the issue of sovereign immunity, the defendants denied that the plaintiffs had the right to damages for breach of contract, asserting that the contract alleged by the plaintiffs in this case was one implied in law, whereas RSA 491:8 provided for breach of contract claims only for contracts implied in fact. The defendants argue that written and oral assurances by superior court and supreme court justices assuring court reporters that their employment was not threatened, that their reliance on those assurances inducing them not only to spend considerable amounts of money to maintain their equipment in as modern a condition as possible, but also to continue in their employment without seeking other employment to ensure their livelihood, was an implied contract in law, not an implied contract in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A contract implied in fact is based on a promise manifested in language, conduct, silence or by implication from the circumstances, including a course of dealing or course of performance. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 4, at 3 (1981). Contracts implied in law are quasi-contracts, lacking an apparent intention of the parties to continue the performance in question. <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">At an April 22, 2004 hearing, the plaintiffs\u2019 lead counsel informed the trial court that he may need to depose former Superior Court Chief Justices Joseph Nadeau and Joseph D. DiClerico, and perhaps Supreme Court Chief Justice John Broderick, so that he could respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss by making the appropriate factual statements. The defendants objected, saying that the plaintiffs should be required to respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss within ten days and that only if the court denied the motion to dismiss should the plaintiffs have the right to conduct discovery. The trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 positions, ruling that the plaintiffs had ninety days to respond to the motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Objection to Second Motion for Restraining Order and/or Extended/Further Stay of Execution of Career Termination Efforts by Defendants at 13-14. The parties agreed at the hearing that the defendants would be required to give ninety days\u2019 notice of their intention to terminate the plaintiffs\u2019 employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The ninetieth day from the date of the court order concerning discovery would have been July 21, 2004. But the trial court granted the motion to dismiss on June 28, 2004, twenty-three days short of the ninety days, thereby ruling on the motion to dismiss before the plaintiffs deposed prospective witnesses. The plaintiffs complained about being denied discovery. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>On July 7,2004, the plaintiffs moved for stay of execution of employment termination \u201cexcept for misconduct and good cause shown ... during the pendency of this matter, ... including any appeal from the Court\u2019s final order on the Petitioner\u2019s Amended Petition for Declaratory Judgment.\u201d Appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 35. On July 28, 2004, the trial court ruled that, \u201cIf the plaintiffs exercise their right to appeal the court\u2019s order on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss within the time prescribed by law, then the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for stay of execution of employment termination will be considered as granted.\u201d Appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 38. The plaintiffs appealed as prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The ninety-day layoff order, if any, was to be issued after the supreme court had decided the case. Despite this trial court order staying execution of employment termination pending appeal, the defendants issued a Notice of Employment Termination dated April 21, 2005. By order dated September 7, 2005, the majority of this court ruled that acting on the plaintiffs\u2019 second motion for a restraining order and a stay of execution of career termination efforts was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and denied the motion. The majority did not mention the trial court\u2019s order of July 28,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The collective bargaining agreement does not authorize the immediate effectiveness of the layoff order or the notice of employment termination at this time. In negotiating the agreement, the plaintiffs refused to agree to terminate their appeal to the supreme court or to waive any right respecting their employment. The defendants stopped trying to insert language to the contrary in the agreement. The following is an excerpt from the December 9,2004 Bargaining Session referring to the controlling effect of the trial court\u2019s July 28,2004 order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">LH (Lorri Hayes, Esq.): [T]here is an order that says you can\u2019t conduct the layoff during the time the suit is in place, even if we made an agreement, you couldn\u2019t conduct the layoff while the suit is in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">HZ (Howard Zibel, Esq. General Counsel, NH Judicial Branch): While the suit is still in place. We\u2019d have to get relief from the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">LH: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-16\">HZ: A question of what the order is. It does become somewhat\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>LH: That\u2019s why my suggestion that you go to Attorney Nixon is important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">HZ: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Objection to Motion to Dismiss at 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In filing after filing, the plaintiffs argued that at least three former chief justices of the superior court (Richard Dunfey, Joseph Nadeau, Joseph DiClerico) had the authority to assure them, and did assure them, that their jobs were secure and that they would not be replaced by electronic devices, whereas the defendants argued that the chief justices of the superior court did not have such authority, and that only the supreme court had that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Written reassurances to court reporters are to be found in a June 24, 1985 memo from Chief Justice Dunfey that \u201cthe members of the Court are committed to retaining all current stenographers\u201d; a March 11,1992 memo to court reporters from Richard Dore reporting that Chief Justice DiClerico \u201chas continually assured us that no Court Reporter who is presently working with the Superior Court will lose his or her job as a result of being replaced by a monitor\u201d; a January 21, 1994 letter from Chief Justice Nadeau citing Chief Justice Dunfey\u2019s position that the jobs of the court reporters \u201cwould not be in jeopardy because of replacement by alternative recording methods\u201d; and an August 81, 1994 \u201cMinutes of Justices/Court Reporters Meeting\u201d reporting Chief Justice Nadeau\u2019s statement that \u201cthe Supreme Court for budgetary reasons leans to the monitors <em>but have left it up to the Superior Court, unthin reason, </em>to make the decisions to hire Court Reporters.\u201d Appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 40-42,46 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">If the plaintiffs had conducted discovery, there would have been a resolution of the question whether the superior court chief justices considered their reassurances to be their right to give as superior court chief justices, or whether they considered their reassurances to be a reflection of the policy of the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">In November 2003, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant, in its audit of the judicial branch, stated that: \u201c[T]he Judicial Branch has in place a long-standing plan to eliminate court reporters\u2019 positions and replace them with court monitor positions as <em>court reporters resign or retire from </em>office____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5 (quotation omitted; emphasis added). \u201c[T]he Judicial Branch expects to reassess the need for stenographers in the New Hampshire Judicial Branch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">In a February 27, 2004 e-mail, Superior Court Chief Justice Robert Lynn reported to the court reporters that remarks by Judicial Branch General Counsel Howard Zibel to a lawyer for the State Employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Association that the court reporters were going to be terminated on or before June 30, 2005 \u201cshould not be interpreted as meaning that the Supreme Court has made any firm decisions or established any timetable\u201d regarding replacement of court reporters. He said he had checked with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and was assured that \u201cno such decisions have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\">In its March 12, 2004 Administrative Order 2004-02, the supreme court \u201creluctantly decided\u201d to accelerate the phase-out of court reporters and replace them with court monitors. <em>Id. </em>at 52. \u201cIt is anticipated that layoffs will occur throughout and be completed during the current biennial budget cycle ending on June 30, 2005.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the record supports that the decision to lay off the plaintiffs had been made in October 2003.
