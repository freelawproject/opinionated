The plaintiffs cross-appeal a ruling of the trial court granting F &amp; R an award of lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>profits due to that injunction. We affirm in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">This case returns to us after remand to the trial court. <em>See Mahoney v. Town of Canterbury, </em>150 N.H. 148, 155 (2008). We set forth the background of this case in <em>Mahoney </em>and need not restate it here. In its July 2002 order, from which both parties originally appealed, the trial court awarded F <em>&amp; </em>R $33,450.60 in lost profits, and $46,065.63 in operating expenses. After we vacated the award of damages and remanded the case to the trial court, the trial court reinstated its original award of lost profits, but denied F &amp; R\u2019s request for overhead expenses, awarding only $2,564.00 for costs and expenses uncontested by the plaintiffs. F &amp; R now appeals, contending that the trial court erred by denying its request for overhead expenses incurred as a result of the injunction. The plaintiffs cross-appeal, arguing that the trial court erred by simply reinstating its original award for lost profits, which plaintiffs claim reflects an erroneous calculation, without a further evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We first address F &amp; R\u2019s issue on appeal. F &amp; R alleges that the trial court erred in failing to award damages for the expenses that were directly attributable to the injunction. In <em>Mahoney, </em>we held that F &amp; R could not \u201crecover all of its overhead expenses for its entire company during the five month delay.\u201d <em>Mahoney, </em>150 N.H. at 154. On review, we understand how the trial court could have reasonably construed this holding to signify that F &amp; R could not recover <em>any </em>overhead expenses. We thus clarify that F &amp; R <em>may </em>recover any overhead expenses that were \u201cspecifically attributable to the interruption of its logging operations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Next, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal. The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred by reinstating its original award of lost profits without a further evidentiary hearing, even though we specifically vacated the award of damages in <em>Mahoney. See id. </em>They also contend that the trial court erred in calculating the differential between the price that F &amp; R could have received had it harvested and sold the pine but for the delay caused by the injunction, and the price F &amp; R ultimately received when it harvested and sold the pine after the trial court lifted the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Although we vacated the original award of damages in <em>Mahoney, </em>we pointed to nothing erroneous in the trial court\u2019s original award of lost profits. Instead, we simply reiterated the well-established principle that lost profits must be reasonably foreseeable, ascertainable, and unavoidable, and we further acknowledged that F &amp; R was entitled to lost profits that may have resulted from a lower sale price of the timber. <em>See id. </em>In reviewing damage awards, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, and will overturn a damage award only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>we find it to be clearly erroneous. <em>Klar v. Mitoulas, </em>145 N.H. 483, 487 (2000). We see no clear error in the trial court\u2019s reinstatement of its original award for lost profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Accordingly, we remand to the trial court for the limited purpose of determining which of F &amp; R\u2019s overhead expenses, if any, were specifically attributable to the interruption of its logging operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in pari; vacated in pari; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b669-7\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
