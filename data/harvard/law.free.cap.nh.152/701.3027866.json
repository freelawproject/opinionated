She argues that the Salem District Court <em>(Korbey, </em>J.) erred in failing to inform the parties whether it had suppressed the results of a breath test administered following an alleged violation of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant contends that if the results were admitted, the trial court improperly relied upon them, and that if they were not, then the evidence was insufficient to convict her. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The record supports the following facts. At approximately 3:00 p.m. on April 1, 2004, New Hampshire State Trooper David Kane, while patrolling Interstate 93 (1-93), came upon an automobile parked at an angle on the southbound shoulder of the highway near Exit 1 in Salem. He observed that the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle appeared to be covered in mud and vomit.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Trooper Kane found the defendant seated in the driver\u2019s seat. She appeared \u201cdazed or confused\u201d and her eyes were glazed over. Trooper Kane noted a strong odor of vomit in the immediate area. He requested that the defendant produce her license and registration, and then asked her what had happened. She replied that she did not know. He then asked her where she was coming from; she replied that she had been skiing at Bretton Woods, Massachusetts, before changing her answer to Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Trooper Kane noticed that the defendant\u2019s speech was slurred. He asked if she had been drinking, and she replied that she had not. She was then taken to an ambulance that had arrived at the scene. While she was being treated, Trooper Kane examined her vehicle and observed a \u201cclear glass\u201d containing a brown liquid in the driver\u2019s cup holder. While retrieving the registration from the car, he smelled the contents of the glass and recognized the smell of Kahlua, a liqueur.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Trooper Kane approached the defendant in the ambulance and asked her a series of questions regarding her physical condition and the contents of the glass. At no time did he provide the defendant with <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See generally id. </em>He then asked her to submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT). After administering the test, he informed her that she was under arrest for driving while under the influence. Trooper Kane placed the defendant in his cruiser and brought her to the Salem Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Trooper Kane learned that the breath analysis machine at the Salem Police Department was inoperable. He asked the defendant if she was willing to submit to a breath test. She stated that she was, so he brought her to the Windham Police Department. Upon arrival, Trooper Kane read the defendant an administrative license suspension (ALS) rights form, which she signed. He then performed the breath test, the results of which showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The defendant was charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor under RSA 265:82. Prior to trial, she filed a notice demanding formal proof that 1-93 is a \u201cway,\u201d a required element of this offense. <em>See </em>DlST. Ct. R. 1.22 (\u201c[A] party shall notify the opposing party or counsel at least ten days prior to trial if said \u2018way\u2019 or public highway must be formally proved[.]\u201d). The State responded with a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting that the trial court take judicial notice that 1-93 is a \u201cway\u201d as defined in RSA 259:125 (2004). The defendant objected, asserting that the State was obligated to formally prove that element of the offense at trial and in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The defendant also filed a pre-trial motion to \u201csuppress and preclude the State from the use and/or comment on evidence seized from the defendant.\u201d The motion contended that Trooper Kane\u2019s questioning of the defendant at the scene violated her rights under the State and Federal Constitutions. The trial court did not address the motions prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">At the August 10, 2004 trial, the State conceded the inadmissibility of the PBT results. The defendant argued in support of her motion to suppress, again invoking the State and Federal Constitutions, and the trial court suppressed the inculpatory statements elicited by Trooper Kane while the defendant was in the ambulance. Relying upon that ruling, the defendant then objected to the admission of the breath test taken at the Windham Police Department (the Windham breath test) on the grounds that it constituted \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d The trial court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">After taking the case under advisement, the trial court issued an order on August 12, 2004, finding the defendant guilty. On August 18, 2004, the defendant moved for clarification and/or reconsideration, requesting that the trial court specify whether or not it had suppressed the results of the Windham breath test. She further urged the trial court to reconsider its verdict based upon the State\u2019s purported failure to establish that 1-93 was a \u201cway\u201d for the purposes of RSA 265:82 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">The trial court heard argument on the motion at the sentencing hearing on September 29, 2004, and denied it. The order explained that the defendant had failed to object at trial to the court\u2019s taking of judicial notice that 1-93 is a public way. It further noted that the trial court found \u201con the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>basis of all the evidence presented at trial\u201d that the defendant was guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to inform the parties, either during or after the trial, whether it had suppressed the results of the Windham breath test. She asserts that if the results were admitted, they constituted inadmissible \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d But, if the results were suppressed, she contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. Finally, the defendant argues that the State failed to formally prove that the alleged offense occurred on a \u201cway\u201d as required by RSA 265:82 and District Court Rule 1.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The defendant, citing RSA 491:15 (1997), asserts that the trial court erred in failing, both during and after trial, to \u201cprovide findings of fact and law adequate for proper appellate review.\u201d Assuming without deciding that RSA 491:15 applies, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">At trial, neither party submitted a request for findings of fact and rulings of law pursuant to RSA 491:15. <em>See </em>RSA 491:15 (\u201cThe court or justice ... shall, if either party requests it, give his decision in writing, stating the facts found and the rulings of law----\u201d). It was not until after the trial court issued its order finding the defendant guilty that she requested an explication of the court\u2019s findings in her motion for clarification and/or reconsideration. This request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">We will uphold a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for reconsideration absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Mt. Valley Mall Assocs. v. Municipality of Conway, </em>144 N.H. 642, 654 (2000); <em>see also Smith v. Shephard, </em>144 N.H. 262, 264 (1999). We find no unsustainable exercise of discretion in the trial court\u2019s denial. Absent a request pursuant to RSA 491:15, a trial court is not required to issue findings of fact and rulings of law. <em>See Hardy v. State, </em>122 N.H. 587, 590 (1982). The trial court\u2019s order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for clarification and/or reconsideration without further explanation was, therefore, not error. <em>See Town of Merrimack v. McCray, </em>150 N.H. 811, 814 (2004) (trial court\u2019s order denying motion for clarification was sufficient because neither party requested findings of fact or rulings of law under RSA 491:15). The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments on this issue are without merit and do not warrant further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Though we find no unsustainable exercise of discretion, we do note that written findings provide a clear basis for appellate review and, as such, are helpful to this court. Nonetheless, because the trial court declined to specifically suppress the results of the Windham breath test and based its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>verdict upon \u201call the evidence presented at trial,\u201d we proceed upon the assumption that the results of the breath test were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The defendant contends that the statements suppressed by the trial court and the inadmissible PBT results are inextricably tied to the Windham breath test, and, thus, admitting the results of the Windham breath test violated the State and Federal Constitutions. When a defendant invokes the protections of the New Hampshire Constitution, we must first address those claims, relying upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-38 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept its factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Hight, </em>146 N.H. 746, 748 (2001). Our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, is <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The defendant first contends that the results of the Windham breath test should have been suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d We disagree. The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine is one of constitutional application. <em>See, e.g., Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471 (1963); <em>State v. Cobb, </em>143 N.H. 638, 650 (1999) (The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine requires that evidence derivatively obtained through a violation of Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution be excluded from trial). We note that even if we assume that the PBT results were inadmissible at trial, they were inadmissible only because of a <em>statutory </em>violation. Therefore, we decline to consider the results in our \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine was initially developed in the search and seizure context, with the primary illegality being a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 484-88; <em>see also Cobb, </em>143 N.H. at 649-50 (where the \u201cprimary illegality\u201d was a purported violation of Part I, Article 19 of New Hampshire Constitution). The Supreme Court of the United States later suggested that the doctrine could be extended to cases where the \u201cpoisonous tree\u201d was a Fifth Amendment violation. <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 446-47 (1974); <em>but see United States v. Patane, </em>124 S. Ct. 2620 (2004). This court, construing Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution, has specifically interpreted the doctrine to apply in the <em>Miranda </em>context, holding that certain physical evidentiary fruits derived from a <em>Miranda </em>violation are inadmissible at trial. <em>State v. Gravel, </em>135 N.H. 172, 180-84 (1991). The defendant now urges us to apply our holding in <em>Gravel </em>to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">In <em>Gravel, </em>police elicited information from a defendant in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, then used that information to procure a search warrant that ultimately yielded cocaine and related paraphernalia. <em>Id. </em>at 174-75. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of cocaine, we concluded that because the search warrant was tainted by the <em>Miranda </em>violation, the subsequent search was illegal and all evidence seized thereby was inadmissible at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\"><em>Gravel </em>is inapposite to the case before us. In that case, we were \u201cfaced with the inanimate evidentiary products of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, <em>items seized under authority of a search warrant founded on statements obtained without a waiver.\u201d Id. </em>at 182 (emphasis added). Essential to our reasoning in <em>Gravel </em>was the fact that no act of free will on the defendant\u2019s part intervened between the primary illegality and the subsequent search. <em>Id. </em>The stated rationale for our holding was the deterrence of initial unlawful police conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 182-83 (\u201cAn officer more concerned with the physical fruits of an unlawfully obtained confession than with the confession itself might reasonably decide that the benefits of securing admissible derivative evidence outweighed the loss of the statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In this case, the defendant voluntarily consented to the Windham breath test after being advised of her right to refuse under RSA 265:87 (2004). Unlike the appellant in <em>Gravel, </em>the defendant here was presented with the option of refusing to provide the physical evidence at issue. <em>See State v. Cormier, </em>127 N.H. 253, 258 (1985) (\u201c[A] defendant may suppress [blood alcohol test] evidence ... but in return he will lose his license for a time and his decision to suppress that evidence may itself be considered in determining whether he is guilty or civilly liable.\u201d). By electing to proceed with the test after being informed of her rights, the defendant engaged in an intervening act of her own free will. Were we to hold that a breath test, otherwise lawfully administered pursuant to RSA 265:87, is inadmissible simply because it follows an earlier <em>Miranda </em>violation, we would curtail the ability of the police to perform an important law enforcement function, while doing little to further the intended deterrent effect of <em>Gravel. See Gravel, </em>135 N.H. at 182 (\u201c[D]eterrenee of police misconduct by ascribing taint to and excluding [a] later confession [is] difficult to justify when the derivative second confession [is] a product of the defendant\u2019s own free will.\u201d). We therefore decline to apply the <em>Gravel </em>\u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The defendant next argues that when she assented to the Windham breath test, \u201cthe proverbial cat was out of the proverbial bag\u201d because of her incriminating statements and the PBT results. Believing her guilt to be firmly established, she continued to cooperate with Trooper Kane. She contends that despite the intervening ALS warnings, the results of the Windham breath test were not \u201csufficiently attenuated from the earlier and inadmissible evidence to be independently considered by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>We disagree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the earlier, inadmissible evidence precludes independent consideration of the Windham breath test. First, assuming that the PBT was inadmissible (and therefore never proffered by the State), it was inadmissible only because Trooper Kane did not advise the defendant, as required by RSA 265:92-a, that \u201cher failure to take the test or... her taking of the test [would] not be construed to prevent or require a subsequent test pursuant to RSA 265:84.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 265:92-a, I (2004). However, RSA 265:92-a, I, also states that \u201cnothing contained in this section shall be construed to prevent or require a subsequent test pursuant to RSA 265:84.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>RSA 265:84 (2004). The fact that Trooper Kane did not provide the mandated advisory did not preclude the administration of the second test.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">As to the inadmissible statements, New Hampshire\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law, RSA 265:84, states that \u201c[a]ny person who drives a vehicle upon the ways of this state shall be deemed to have given consent to physical tests and examinations for the purpose of determining whether such person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d RSA 265:84; <em>see also Saviano v. Director, N.H. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>151 N.H. 315, 319 (2004). We have, accordingly, held that the act of submitting to a breath test \u201cis voluntary because the very act of driving on New Hampshire\u2019s public roads implies consent to take the test.\u201d <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>128 N.H. 672, 675 (1986). It is therefore immaterial whether the defendant\u2019s decision may have been influenced by the earlier, inadmissible exchanges with Trooper Kane. <em>See id. </em>at 674-75 (rejecting a due process challenge brought under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution alleging that a defendant\u2019s decision to submit to a blood-alcohol test was not made \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d). By driving her vehicle on the roads of this State, the defendant impliedly assented to the breath test prior to her encounter with Trooper Kane.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Moreover, because the protections of Part I, Article 15 of our State Constitution apply only to evidence that is testimonial in character, it is settled law that a driver arrested for driving while under the influence has no constitutional right to refuse to provide a sample for a blood alcohol test. <em>See Zyla v. Turner, Director, </em>134 N.H. 259, 262 (1991); <em>see also Cormier, </em>127 N.H. at 255, 257 (1985) (\u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination does not require the State to obtain the defendant\u2019s permission---- Neither does the guarantee of due process.\u201d); <em>South Dakota v. Neville, </em>459 U.S. 553, 554 (1983) (\u201c[A] State [can] force a defendant to submit to a blood-alcohol test without violating the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\u201d); <em>Schmerber v. California, </em>384 U.S. 757 (1966). The State therefore imposes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>as it is constitutionally permitted to do, a qualified obligation to provide such a sample. <em>Cormier, </em>127 N.H. at 258. Though it also grants a qualified right to <em>refuse </em>to provide a sample, it is not constitutionally obligated to do so. <em>Id. </em>Thus, even if the defendant consented to take the Windham breath test under the belief that the inadmissible statements already established her guilt, she was not deprived of any protection under our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Because the Federal Constitution affords no greater protection in the context of the defendant\u2019s arguments, we reach the same conclusions under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution. <em>See State v. LeCouffe, </em>152 N.H. 148, 152 (2005); <em>see also Patane, </em>124 S. Ct. at 2629-30; <em>Schmerber, </em>384 U.S. at 760-64. We further note that the defendant does not contest that the statutory prerequisites for the Windham breath test were met. Based upon the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err as a matter of law in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the Windham breath test. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict her.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the State failed to formally establish that the alleged offense occurred on a \u201cway,\u201d a required element of the crime, and that her conviction must, therefore, be reversed. <em>See </em>RSA 265:82 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The defendant contends that her pre-trial notice pursuant to District Court Rule 1.22 placed an obligation upon the State to formally prove, <em>in her presence, </em>that 1-93 was a \u201cway\u201d for the purposes of RSA 265:82. We disagree. Nothing in the language of District Court Rule 1.22 gives rise to such an obligation. <em>See </em>Dist. Ct. R. 1.22. Moreover, there is nothing in the language of the rule that precludes a trial court from taking judicial notice of a fact and thereby satisfying the \u201cformal proof\u2019 requirement of the rule. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">A trial court may take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute. N.H. R. Ev. 201(a). Such a fact must either be generally known within the jurisdiction of the trial court or capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned. N.H. R. Ev. 201(a)(1), (2). It is mandatory that a court take judicial notice if it is requested by a party and the court is supplied with the necessary information. N.H. R. Ev. 201(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The State responded to the defendant\u2019s notice requesting formal proof of \u201cway\u201d with a motion <em>in limine </em>requesting that the trial court take judicial notice of 1-93 as a \u201cway\u201d as defined in RSA 259:125. In its motion, the State informed the trial court that \u201cInterstate 93 is generally known within the jurisdiction of this court to be such a \u2018public highway or street\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>and is capable of ready determination by simply verifying the same through the records that are maintained by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation.\u201d The status of 1-93 as a \u201cway\u201d is generally known and not subject to reasonable dispute. Therefore, on the State\u2019s proffer, the trial court should have taken mandatory judicial notice that I-93 was a \u201cway\u201d for the purposes of RSA 265:82. Thus, that element of the offense was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b736-6\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
