Dugdale, appeal the order of the Superior Court <em>(Conboy, </em>J.) denying their summary judgment motion and granting the cross-motions for summary judgment filed by the respondents, the Manchester School District (MSD) and the Bedford School District (BSD). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The trial court accepted the following facts as undisputed, many of which were derived from our opinion in a related appeal. <em>See Bedford Chapter </em>\u2014 Citizens <em>for a Sound Economy v. Sch. Admin. Unit #25, </em>151 N.H. 612 (2004). Historically, BSD has not had its own high school. <em>Id. </em>For more than seventy years, it has sent its students to Manchester high schools. <em>Id. </em>at 612-13. The school districts of Auburn, Candia and Hooksett have also traditionally sent their students to Manchester high schools. <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">In the spring of 2001, MSD gave BSD and the other school districts two-year notice that the existing twenty-year tuition contract between MSD and these school districts would terminate at the conclusion of the 2002-2003 school year. This meant that, absent a new agreement, BSD could no longer send its students to Manchester high schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">MSD and the school boards of BSD and the other school districts began negotiating the terms of a new twenty-year tuition agreement. <em>Id. </em>These negotiations were completed in 2002. In spring of 2003, the school boards submitted a proposed new twenty-year agreement to their respective school districts at their annual meetings. <em>Id. </em>Although Auburn, Cand\u00eda, Hooksett and Manchester voters approved the agreement, BSD voters did not. <em>Id. </em>Because BSD voters rejected the proposed twenty-year contract, BSD had no contract or any other arrangement for the education of its high school students at the end of the 2002-2003 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">MSD and the school board of BSD then began negotiating a three-year agreement. <em>Id. </em>The school board and MSD entered into such an agreement in July 2003. <em>Id. </em>Under this agreement, BSD agreed to enroll and MSD agreed to accept all BSD public high school students for the 2003-2004, 2004-2005, and 2005-2006 school years, in exchange for a per pupil tuition payment. <em>Id. </em>The per pupil tuition payment had an operating expense component and a capital expense component. <em>Id. </em>The agreement provided that if BSD voters ratified the proposed twenty-year tuition agreement by June 1, 2004, the twenty-year agreement would supersede the three-year agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The BSD school board executed the three-year agreement on July 1, 2003. The State Board of Education approved it on July 16,2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">At the BSD\u2019s March 2004 annual meeting, BSD voters approved a warrant article to raise a $1.8 million deficit appropriation for the 2003-2004 school year to fund the capital component of the first year\u2019s tuition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>under the three-year agreement. <em>See id. </em>BSD voters also approved a general budget that included the entire tuition payment for the 2004-2005 school year. This tuition payment included a $4.4 million appropriation to fund the capital component. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">In June 2004, the petitioners brought the instant action against BSD and MSD challenging the validity of the three-year agreement and the validity of the March 2004 votes. In addition to seeking a declaration that the three-year agreement was void, the petitioners sought an injunction to bar BSD from paying the capital component of the tuition payment in the future and an order requiring MSD to return to BSD capital expenses already paid, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The petitioners moved and the respondents cross-moved for summary judgment. The trial court denied the petitioners\u2019 motion and granted the respondents\u2019 cross-motions. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">On appeal, the petitioners argue that the school board was required to receive voter approval before it could enter into the three-year agreement. Absent prior voter approval, they contend that the agreement was invalid, which, they assert, entitles them to an injunction barring payment of the capital component of the tuition payment in the future and entitles BSD to restitution of the capital expenses already paid. They concede that even if the agreement is void, payment of per pupil operating costs was lawful. <em>See </em>RSA 194:27 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The petitioners rely upon RSA 194:22 (1999), RSA 194:21-a, :21-b (1999) and RSA 82:6, :8 (2000) to support their arguments. We address each statute in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Blackthorne Group v. Pines of Newmarket, </em>150 N.H. 804, 806 (2004). We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Bedford Chapter, </em>151 N.H. at 614. We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>When the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>We refuse to consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to incorporate in the statute. <em>Blackthorne Group, </em>150 N.H. at 806. Moreover, we interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>Id. </em>By so doing, we are better able to discern the legislature\u2019s intent and to interpret statutory language in light of the policy or purpose sought to be advanced by the statutory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\n<em>A. RSA 194:22</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The petitioners first argue that RSA 194:22 required the BSD school board to obtain prior approval from BSD voters before entering into the three-year agreement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">RSA 194:22 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">Any school district may make a contract with <em>&amp;[]... </em>high school ... located in this ... state, and raise and appropriate money to carry the contract into effect. If the contract is approved by the state board the school with which it is made shall be deemed a high school maintained by the district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">As we recognized in <em>Bedford Chapter, </em>151 N.H. at 617, \u201cRSA 194:22 is silent as to the procedure the school district must follow to raise and appropriate money to carry the contract into effect.\u201d RSA 194:22 likewise is silent as to the procedure the school district must follow to make the contract in the first place. Nothing in RSA 194:22 requires voter approval before the contract may be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The petitioners argue that RSA 194:22 requires prior voter approval because they interpret the term \u201cschool district\u201d to mean the voters -within that district. In support of this assertion, they mistakenly rely upon <em>Kondrat v. Freedom School Board, </em>138 N.H. 683, 685 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\"><em>Kondrat </em>concerned the interpretation of RSA 194:10 (1999), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">At its annual meeting each school district shall determine the salaries of its school board and other district officers, and the district clerk shall certify the same to the selectmen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">We held that the \u201cplain language of the statute designates the \u2018school district,\u2019 <em>ie., </em>the voters, as the body responsible for determining the salary of the auditor, and the annual meeting as the proper time for making such determination.\u201d <em>Kondrat, </em>138 N.H. at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">The petitioners argue that because in <em>Kondrat </em>we held that the term \u201cschool district\u201d in RSA 194:10 referred to the district\u2019s voters, the term must have the same meaning in RSA 194:22. In RSA 194:10, however, the term \u201cschool district\u201d is modified by the phrase \u201c[a]t its annual meeting.\u201d In context, therefore, the term \u201cschool district\u201d as used in RSA 194:10 refers to district voters who meet annually \u201cfor raising and appropriating money for the support of schools ..., for the. transaction of other district business and... for the choice of district officers.\u201d RSA 197:1 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">The petitioners also contend that in <em>Bedford Chapter, </em>we held that the term \u201cschool district\u201d in RSA chapter 194 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2004) means the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>voters of the district and not the school board. The petitioners misconstrue our holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">At issue in <em>Bedford Chapter </em>was whether a warrant article presented at a special meeting of the BSD involved a vote to raise and appropriate money. If the warrant article involved such a vote, then the article could not pass unless the votes cast at the special meeting equaled at least one-half of the number of BSD voters entitled to vote at the BSD 2004 annual meeting. <em>Bedford Chapter, </em>151 N.H. at 614; <em>see </em>RSA 197:3 (1999). If the warrant article did not involve such a vote, then it could pass by a simple majority of voters present. <em>Bedford Chapter, </em>151 N.H. at 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The warrant article at issue asked BSD voters to authorize the BSD school board to enter into a new twenty-year tuition agreement with MSI). <em>Id. </em>We held that asking for prior voter authorization to enter into the tuition agreement was akin to asking for an appropriation and, thus, the warrant article involved a vote to raise and appropriate money. <em>See id. </em>at 615-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The only argument regarding RSA 194:22 that we directly addressed in <em>Bedford Chapter </em>was the appellants\u2019 assertion that the tuition agreement required approval only by the State Board of Education. <em>Id. </em>at 617. In rejecting this argument we construed the plain language of RSA 194:22 to permit the school district, not the State Board of Education, to raise and appropriate money to carry an agreement under RSA 194:22 into effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The petitioners\u2019 arguments misapprehend the nature of school districts. RSA 194:2 (1999) provides that all legally organized school districts are \u201ccorporations, with power to sue and be sued, to hold and dispose of real and personal property for the use of the schools therein, and to make necessary contracts in relation thereto.\u201d Like other municipal corporations, each school district consists of a legislative and a governing body. RSA 21:47, :48 (2000). The legislative body is the school district meeting. RSA 21:47. The governing body is the school board. RSA 21:48.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Generally, the authority to make contracts on behalf of the school district rests with the school board, as the district\u2019s governing body. <em>See </em>56 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Municipal Corporations, Etc. </em>\u00a7 449 (2000); <em>see aJ,so </em>RSA 21:29 (2000) (school board is \u201centrusted with the hiring of teachers and the management of the prudential affairs of the district\u201d). The school board is thus \u201cthe managing board of the school district.\u201d <em>Ashley v. School Dist., </em>111 N.H. 54, 55 (1971). The authority to raise and appropriate money, on the other hand, rests with the school district meeting as the district\u2019s legislative body. <em>See </em>RSA 197:1, :3 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>With this understanding of the term \u201cschool district,\u201d it becomes clear that, as used in RSA 194:22, the term refers both to the district\u2019s school board and to its voters at a district meeting. The school board \u201cmay make a contract with a[ [\u00b6]... high school... located in this state,\u201d and the district voters at a district meeting may \u201craise and appropriate money to carry the contract into effect.\u201d RSA 194:22. This interpretation comports with our holdings in both <em>Kondrat </em>and <em>Bedford Chapter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\n<em>B. RSA 194:21-0, -b</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The petitioners next assert that prior voter approval was required by RSA 194:21-a and RSA 194:21-b. RSA 194:21-a and RSA 194:21-b follow RSA 194:21 (Supp. 2004), which pertains to \u201cJoint Maintenance Agreements.\u201d Joint maintenance agreements are contracts between \u201c[t]wo or more adjoining districts ... for establishing and maintaining jointly a high school or other public school\u201d for the benefit of district pupils. RSA 194:21,1. RSA 194:21-a provides that the term of such an agreement may not exceed \u201c20 years from the date of the contract.\u201d RSA 194:21-b provides that contracts under RSA 194:21-a may be adopted by the school district at its regular annual meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The petitioners\u2019 reliance upon RSA 194:21-a and RSA 194:21-b is misplaced. These statutes, by their express terms, apply only to joint maintenance agreements. RSA 194:21-a provides, in pertinent part, that school districts may \u201ccontract with each other for the establishing and maintaining jointly a high school for the benefit of their pupils.\u201d RSA 194:21-b pertains only to contracts \u201cprovided for by RSA 194:21-a.\u201d As the petitioners concede, the three-year agreement \u201cclearly is not\u201d a joint maintenance agreement. It is not an agreement between BSD and MSD to establish and maintain jointly a high school, but is rather an agreement by MSD to enroll BSD students in high schools that MSD has established and maintained. The agreement gives BSD no control over MSD high schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The petitioners argue that \u201ca contract may be a long-term contract under [RSA] 194:21-a without also being a joint maintenance agreement.\u201d We disagree. The only long-term contracts to which RSA 194:21-a pertains are those \u201cfor the establishing and maintaining jointly a high school.\u201d RSA 194:21-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">\n<em>C. RSA \u00a72:6, :8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">The petitioners next contend that prior voter approval was required by RSA 32:6 and RSA 32:8. RSA 32:6 requires that municipal appropriations be made only \u201cby vote of the legislative body of the municipality at an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>annual or special meeting.\u201d RSA 32:8 precludes a school board from paying or agreeing to pay \u201cany money, or incur any liability involving the expenditure of money, for any purpose in excess of the amount appropriated by the legislative body for that purpose, or for any purpose for which no appropriation has been made, except as provided in RSA 32:9-11.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The petitioners assert that the three-year agreement itself was an \u201cappropriation\u201d within the meaning of RSA 32:6. They also contend that the three-year agreement was unlawful because it required expending more money to educate BSD high school students than BSD voters approved at the March 2003 meeting. Because we hold that the BSD voters ratified the BSD school board\u2019s actions, we need not decide whether the school board violated either RSA 32:6 or RSA 32:8, or whether, if it had, the three-year agreement would be void. <em>See </em>RSA 32:12 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\u201cRatification by a municipal corporation can be express or implied.\u201d <em>Appeal of Sanborn Regional School Bd., </em>133 N.H. 513, 520 (1990). Implied ratification \u201carises out of the principal\u2019s conduct,\u201d while express ratification occurs \u201conly... where the municipality embraces the acts of its agent in a manner provided by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether express or implied, \u201cratification by the principal, in this case the school district voters, requires full knowledge of the financial terms of the [contract].\u201d <em>Id. </em>A legislative body of a municipal corporation is bound by a multi-year contract \u201conly if it knew about the cost items for <em>each </em>year of the [contract] at the time it voted to appropriate money for the contract\u2019s <em>first </em>year.\u201d <em>Appeal of Franklin Education Assoc., </em>136 N.H. 332, 334 (1992). \u201cAlthough voters are often apprised of the financial consequences of their actions through language in warrant articles,\u201d warrant articles are not the only mechanism for sufficiently apprising voters \u201cof subject matter upon which favorable action will bind the district to monetary obligations extending over a term of years.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Rye, </em>140 N.H. 323, 327 (1995) (quotation omitted). \u201cTherefore, we will review all evidence that tends to establish such knowledge to see if the cost item was properly ratified.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Here, the undisputed evidence is that the BSD school board sent a letter to essentially every registered voter of record in Bedford before the March 2004 BSD meeting. This letter informed BSD voters about the financial impact of each year of the three-year agreement before they voted to approve the deficit appropriation necessary to fund the capital component of the first year\u2019s tuition payment. <em>See id. </em>Before the March 2004 meeting, BSD voters thus were informed that the three-year agreement \u201crequires a capital payment of $10.6 million \u2014 $1.8 million to be paid this year and $4.4 million to be paid in each of the next two years.\u201d The voters were also informed that one of the warrant articles asked for approval of a \u201cdeficit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>appropriation of $1.8 million, owed to the Manchester School District for the 2003-2004 school year\u201d and that this money had not been part of the 2003-2004 budget \u201cbecause the contract was not negotiated and signed until after [the previous] March\u2019s election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">BSD voters were informed about not only the fact and extent of the financial burden, but also its implications. <em>See id. </em>For instance, the letter told BSD voters that if they did not approve the deficit appropriation, the school district would have to \u201cdefault on the contract or ... make very, very severe cuts\u201d to its operating budget. They were further told that budget cuts would \u201crequire laying off staff and increasing class sizes in grades K-8\u201d and would negatively affect education quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Because the evidence is that BSD voters knew of the financial consequences of each year of the three-year contract before they approved the deficit appropriation to fund the first year\u2019s tuition payment fully, we hold that they ratified the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The petitioners contend that any such ratification was invalid because the wording of the warrant article asking for the deficit appropriation was misleading in that it told voters that BSD was \u201cobligated\u201d to pay MSD $1.8 million for its share of capital costs. The petitioners rely upon precedent developed in the election law context. They assert that because the warrant article\u2019s wording allegedly was misleading, the intent of BSD voters is \u201cin doubt\u201d and voids their adoption of the article. <em>Appeal of Soucy, </em>139 N.H. 110, 117 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">To invalidate the results of the March 2004 school district meeting, the petitioners must \u201cprove either fraud which leaves the intent of the voters in doubt or irregularities in the conduct of the election of such a nature as to affect the result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). The petitioners have failed to meet this burden. <em>See Board of Selectmen v. School Bd., </em>113 N.H. 598, 603 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The petitioners have not alleged election fraud. <em>See Soucy, </em>139 N.H. at 117-18, <em>see also Appeal of McDonough, </em>149 N.H. 105, 114 (2003). At best, they allege \u201cirregularities.\u201d <em>Soucy, </em>139 N.H. at 117. We will not void votes at the school district meeting \u201cbecause of mere irregularities or technicalities in the form of a ballot, election or vote.\u201d <em>Appeal of McDonough, </em>149 N.H. at 112. The party challenging a warrant article, after its passage, bears the burden of establishing that in all likelihood, its defects affected the outcome of the vote. <em>Neville v. Highfields Farm, </em>144 N.H. 419, 427 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">It is our consistent practice to construe votes passed at town and school district meetings liberally. <em>Lamb v. Danville School Board, </em>102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>N.H. 569, 571 (1960). If such votes \u201cfall within the authorized powers of the town [or school district], ingenious distinctions will not be unnecessarily resorted to when the effect would be to defeat the apparent intention of the voters in a matter admittedly within their legislative province.\u201d <em>Amey v. Pittsburg School District, </em>95 N.H. 386, 388 (1949) (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The disputed warrant article read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">Article Y. [Deficit appropriation to pay 2003/2004 capital costs to Manchester unanticipated at the March 2003 Annual School District Meeting.] (Special Warrant Article) Shall the school district raise and appropriate the sum of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,800,000) as a deficit appropriation for the 2003/2004 fiscal year to fund the first year of the district\u2019s share of the capital costs which the district is obligated to pay to the City of Manchester over 3 years under its current high school tuition arrangement and for which no appropriation was made at the 2003 Annual School District Meeting? (The school board recommends a \u201cyes\u201d vote on this question.) (Majority ballot vote required).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">When liberally construed in its entirety, we hold that this warrant article sufficiently described the situation \u201cfor voters to make a rational decision.\u201d <em>Neville, </em>144 N.H. at 427. The evidence here does not \u201ccompel the conclusion that a different result would have been reached\u201d had the warrant article been differently worded. <em>Leonard v.
