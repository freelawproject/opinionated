We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">The family division found the following facts. The mother and father were married on June 17, 1994, in Austin, Texas. The parties have three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>children. In June 2001, the mother moved with the children to Plymouth. On September 10, 2001, the mother contacted the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) to allege that the father had sexually abused the children while they were living in Texas-. DCYF initiated an investigation. The father subsequently filed for divorce in Texas. On September 8, 2003, a Texas court issued a final divorce decree and awarded the father permanent physical custody of the parties\u2019 children. Between September 23 and December 4, 2003, DCYF filed eight abuse and neglect petitions against the father in the family division. Prior to the commencement of trial, the children were placed in foster care under the supervision of DCYF. The family division held three days of trial on DCYF\u2019s petitions in February and March of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">On April 21, 2004, the Family Division <em>(MacLeod, Jr., </em>J.) issued an adjudicatory order dismissing all eight abuse and neglect petitions against the father based upon DCYF\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof. The mother appealed the order to the superior court pursuant to RSA 169-C:28. At the mother\u2019s request, the family division suspended the adjudicatory order pending the outcome of the appeal. All three children were to remain in foster care in New Hampshire during the appeal. RSA 169-C:28,1 (2002) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-6\">An appeal under this chapter may be taken to the superior court by the child or the child\u2019s authorized representative or any party having an interest ... within 30 days of the final dispositional order; but an appeal shall not suspend the order or decision of the court unless the court so orders. The superior court shall hear the matter de novo____For purposes of this chapter, a \u201cfinal dispositional order\u201d includes a dismissal of a petition for abuse and neglect by the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">RSA 169-C:3, XXI-a (2002) defines a \u201cParty having an interest\u201d to mean \u201cthe child; the guardian ad litem of the child; the child\u2019s parent, guardian or custodian; the state; or any household member subject to court order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">On August 5, 2004, the superior court held a hearing at which DCYF withdrew its abuse and neglect petitions against the father. The superior court ruled that the mother was entitled to bring an appeal pursuant to RSA 169-C:28 as a \u201cparty having an interest.\u201d Nonetheless, the superior court granted the father\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the superior court \u201cno longer ha[d] a petition over which the appeal [could] further proceed.\u201d The superior court also directed the mother to file her own petition against the father in the family division. Later that day, the mother filed three abuse and neglect petitions against the father with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>family division. The children returned to Texas with the father and remain there today.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">On August 20, 2004, the Family Division (MacLeod&gt; <em>Jr., </em>J.) dismissed the mother\u2019s petitions, stating, \u201cThe [mother] has not exhausted her appellate remedies in these cases in the Superior Court or the Supreme Court.\u201d The family division denied the mother\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and she did not appeal the dismissal of her own petitions to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">On August 25, 2004, the superior court denied the mother\u2019s motion to reconsider the dismissal of her <em>de novo </em>appeal of the adjudicatory order. On September 21, 2004, the mother appealed to this court to review the superior court\u2019s dismissal of her appeal of the adjudicatory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the superior court erroneously granted the father\u2019s motion to dismiss the mother\u2019s appeal. The superior court dismissed the appeal on the ground that it \u201cno longer ha[d] a petition over which the appeal [could] further proceed,\u201d as DCYF had withdrawn its underlying petitions. On appeal, we will sustain the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are unsupported by the evidence or tainted by error of law. <em>In re Thomas M., </em>141 N.H. 55, 57 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The superior court ruled that the mother was entitled to bring an appeal pursuant to RSA 169-C:28 as a \u201cparty having an interest.\u201d The father does not challenge this ruling. We have held that the statutory mandate under RSA 169-C:28 that \u201c[t]he superior court <em>shall </em>hear the matter de novo\u201d leaves no room for the exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 59 (quotation omitted); <em>see also In re Robyn W., </em>124 N.H. 377, 379 (1983) (\u201cshall\u201d denotes a mandatory statutory prescription). Therefore, the superior court <em>must </em>conduct a hearing <em>de novo </em>on the family division\u2019s dismissal of DCYF\u2019s abuse and neglect petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">The father argues that notwithstanding the mother\u2019s statutory entitlement to a hearing, the superior court\u2019s dismissal was proper as there was \u201cno case or controversy\u201d before the superior court once DCYF withdrew its petitions. That argument is unsupported by the plain language of RSA 169-C:28, I, which requires the superior court to \u201chear the matter de novo.\u201d We have defined a \u201chearing <em>de novo\u201d </em>in the context of RSA 169-C:28 to mean: (1) A reviewing court\u2019s decision of a matter anew, giving no deference to a lower court\u2019s findings; (2) A new hearing of a matter, conducted as if the original hearing had not taken place. <em>In re Juveniles 2002-511-A, </em>149 N.H. 592, 594 (2003) <em>(citing </em>BLACK\u2019S LAW Dictionary 725 (7th ed. 1999)). Applying this definition here, we hold that the superior court was required to hear <em>de novo </em>the merits of the abuse and neglect petitions filed by DCYF and determine whether the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>division properly dismissed the petitions. It is, thus, irrelevant that DCYF withdrew its petitions after the mother appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The father also argues that the superior court could not have conducted a hearing <em>de novo, </em>as contemplated by RSA 169-C:28, without the same parties who appeared in the family division. The father cites no authority to support this contention, and we decline to read that requirement into the definition of \u201chearing <em>de novo\u201d </em>above.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">We, therefore, conclude that the superior court erred by granting the father\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal. The superior court, however, cannot, and properly did not, force DCYF to go forward with its case against the father on appeal. Thus, upon remand, the mother must assume the role of petitioner, and present the case in the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The father argues that even if the mother prevails here, the family division\u2019s dismissal of her own petitions and her failure to appeal that dismissal will bar any hearing in the superior court upon remand pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata. The essence of the doctrine of res judicata is that a final judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive upon the parties in a subsequent litigation involving the same cause of action. <em>Brzica v. Trustees of Dartmouth College, </em>147 N.H. 443, 454 (2002). Res judicata precludes the litigation in a later case of matters actually litigated, and matters that could have been litigated, in an earlier action between the same parties for the same cause of action. <em>Id. </em>For the doctrine to apply, three elements must be met: (1) the parties must be the same or in privity with one another; (2) the same cause of action must be before the court in both instances; and (3) a final judgment on the merits must have been rendered on the first action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">The family division dismissed the mother\u2019s petitions on the ground that she had not \u201cexhausted her appellate remedies in these cases in the Superior Court or the Supreme Court.\u201d Thus, the family division did not dismiss the mother\u2019s abuse and neglect petitions on their merits. Accordingly, we conclude that the family division\u2019s dismissal of the mother\u2019s petitions will have no res judicata effect upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Finally, we briefly address the custody and placement of the children upon remand. On April 21, 2004, the family division granted the mother\u2019s motion to suspend the adjudicatory order pending the outcome of the appeal to the superior court. All three children were to remain in foster care in New Hampshire during the pendency of the appeal. On August 5, 2004, the superior court dismissed the appeal. The next day, the children returned to Texas with the father and remain there today. The mother did not challenge the father\u2019s actions in that regard. Nothing in this opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>requires the trial court to take any action concerning the present custody of these children pending final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b835-4\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
