We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">The record supports the following facts. The plaintiff served as the Chief of Police from 1994 until 2001, when he was placed on administrative leave while away on active military duty. When the plaintiff was reassigned to Pease Air Force Base in 2002, he was allowed to perform part-time shift patrol for the Town. In August 2002, Acting Police Chief Sobel suspected that the plaintiff had, without permission, given ammunition belonging to the Town to Park, owner of a local car repair garage. Sobel notified the Town selectmen of his suspicion and went to Park\u2019s garage to retrieve the ammunition. Park acknowledged that he had recently received ammunition from the plaintiff. He agreed to return the four boxes of .45 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>caliber ammunition to Sobel, who noted that they had the same lot number as that of the ammunition at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The Town selectmen met with the plaintiff on September 18, 2002, and asked him about the apparent theft of ammunition from the police station. The plaintiff initially denied having taken any ammunition. When the selectmen asserted that the ammunition could be traced, the plaintiff changed his story and said he might have taken some ammunition but it was old ammunition from his house. After the selectmen said, \u201cLook, we can pinpoint this ammunition as coming from here,\u201d the plaintiff admitted that it might have come from the Town. The plaintiff was then placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation by the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">When interviewed by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the plaintiff admitted to providing Park with ammunition that belonged to the Town, but alleged that it was old and unfit for police use. He also alleged that he never denied to the selectmen that he gave ammunition belonging to the Town to Park. In a letter to the selectmen on May 6, 2003, the Attorney General\u2019s Office stated that the plaintiff\u2019s actions \u201clikely constituted the crime of theft by unauthorized taking,\u201d and that the plaintiff\u2019s inconsistent conduct during the investigation \u201craise[s] serious questions about the truthfulness of [the plaintiff\u2019s] statements ... in connection with this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The Town subsequently dismissed the plaintiff because he had failed to uphold an appropriate standard of behavior for his position by committing theft by unauthorized taking, showing lack of candor, and exercising \u201cegregiously poor judgment.\u201d The plaintiff appealed the Town\u2019s decision to the trial court pursuant to RSA 105:2-a (2001). The trial court ruled that the Town satisfied its burden of establishing that there was substantial cause to terminate the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The plaintiff makes the following arguments on appeal: (1) the Town did not have \u201csubstantial cause\u201d to terminate him; (2) the trial court\u2019s admission of the Attorney General\u2019s investigation file as evidence was erroneous and prejudicial; and (3) the trial court improperly concluded that, consistent with <em>State v. Laurie, </em>139 N.H. 325 (1995), the plaintiff\u2019s credibility problems would impair his ability to function as Chief of Police. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">We first address the plaintiff\u2019s argument that his actions did not constitute \u201csubstantial cause\u201d for termination under RSA 105:2-a. We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless it is unsupported by the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Sandford v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>152 N.H. 1, 3 (2005). Our standard is not whether we would have ruled differently, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>whether a reasonable person could have reached the same decision as did the trial court based upon the evidence before it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"> RSA 105:2-a provides that an appointed Chief of Police shall be subject to dismissal only for cause. We have stated that the cause for removal under the statute must be substantial and requires a demonstration of unfitness or incapacity to discharge the responsibilities of the position. <em>Perron v. City of Somersworth, </em>131 N.H. 303, 306 (1988). This precludes reliance upon such factors as \u201cpersonal dislike, political disagreement, or reasons of that nature.\u201d <em>Ingersoll v. Williams, </em>118 N.H. 135, 137 (1978). Rather, a ground for dismissal must specifically relate to and affect the administration of the office, \u201cdirectly affecting the rights and interests of the public.\u201d <em>Perron, </em>131 N.H. at 306. In addition, the ground for removal must be of substantial significance, \u201csuch as corruption or inefficiency in office, infraction of the rules governing the police force, the commission of an infamous crime, or the conviction of a misdemeanor and sentence to imprisonment for a term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">First, the plaintiff argues that his inconsistent statements resulted only in \u201cpersonal dislike or disagreement\u201d with the Town selectmen and were not a substantial cause for termination. <em>See Ingersoll, </em>118 N.H. at 137. We disagree. In <em>Perron, </em>we found sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that there was substantial cause to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s position as Chief of Police where there was evidence of misadministration of public funds and dishonesty. <em>Perron, </em>131 N.H. at 307-08. Specifically, the evidence indicated that the plaintiff was \u201ceither lying\u201d or \u201centirely unconcerned to make an accurate report\u201d when confronted with questions about unreported profits from the police department\u2019s soda machine, and the plaintiff admitted to lying to his officers about the status of police funds for controlled drug purchases. <em>Id. </em>at 308. We found sufficient evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s overall behavior rendered him incapable of holding a position \u201cdemanding honor and integrity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Here, the plaintiff initially denied having taken any ammunition. When the selectmen asserted that the ammunition could be traced, the plaintiff changed his story stating that he might have taken some ammunition but that it was old ammunition from his house. After the selectmen confronted the plaintiff with the fact that the ammunition recovered from Park matched the lot number of the ammunition at the police station, the plaintiff admitted that maybe some of it did come from the Town. When interviewed by the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the plaintiff then asserted that he never denied that he gave ammunition from the police department to Park. The plaintiff now contends that he initially denied taking Town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ammunition only as an angry response to the selectmen\u2019s accusations that he was stealing from the Town.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Based upon this trail of inconsistent statements, the plaintiff created grave doubts as to his capability of holding a position \u201cdemanding honor and integrity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Moreover, where the Town\u2019s police department policy requires officers to \u201ctruthfully state the facts ... before any judicial, departmental or other official investigation,\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s lack of candor was an explicit violation that caused more than personal disagreement with the selectmen. In this case, the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that it affected the \u201crights and interests of the public.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 306; <em>see also Blake v. Town of Pittsfield, </em>124 N.H. 555, 561 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The plaintiff also contends that the ammunition that he gave to Park was only worth $44.80 and was unfit for police use because it was \u201cgreen and corroded.\u201d In addition, he points out that the Attorney General declined to prosecute him due to the <em>de minim,is </em>value of the items. Thus, he argues, the Town lacked substantial cause for his dismissal given the value of the ammunition. We disagree. First, the plaintiff\u2019s argument is misplaced. The selectmen\u2019s conclusion that he had violated the public trust was not based on the monetary value of the ammunition alone. Instead, the selectmen found that the act of taking Town property without authorization demonstrated \u201cegregiously poor judgment,\u201d which cast doubt upon his capability of holding a position demanding integrity. <em>See Perron, </em>131 N.H. at 308. Second, the Attorney General\u2019s investigation concluded that the ammunition given to Park was \u201cnot green or corroded\u201d and that the plaintiff likely committed theft by unauthorized taking. Third, the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in response to the allegations was less than forthright. In light of the findings of the trial court regarding the plaintiff\u2019s improper taking of the ammunition and the circumstances surrounding it, the trial court had sufficient evidence to affirm the Town\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff acted \u201ccounter to the role and duties of a Police Chief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> Finally, the plaintiff contends that the Town lacked substantial cause to dismiss him because he was neither charged with a misdemeanor in this matter, nor did his actions involve corruption or inefficiency of office. <em>See id. </em>at 306. We disagree. While removal may be justified by corruption, criminal conviction, or inefficiency of office, <em>see id., </em>the definition of \u201csubstantial cause\u201d is not limited to those specific acts. To the contrary, we have also included \u201cinfraction of the rules governing the police force\u201d as an example of substantial cause. <em>Id. </em>Here, the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>lack of candor was a violation of the police department\u2019s policy of truthfulness in an investigation and fell below the standard of behavior appropriate for his position. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s actions understandably eroded the Town\u2019s trust and were sufficient evidence for the trial court to find substantial cause for his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Next, the plaintiff argues that the Attorney General\u2019s file on its investigation of the plaintiff was inadmissible hearsay. At trial, the court admitted the Attorney General\u2019s file for the limited purpose of reviewing one of the bases for his removal. Significantly, the contents of <em>the file </em>were summarized in a <em>report </em>from the Attorney General\u2019s Office, which was admitted as evidence without objection by the plaintiff. We have held that the admissibility of evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and such a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>In re Antonio W., </em>147 N.H. 408, 414 (2002); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). To demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion reversible on appeal, the plaintiff must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See In re Brittany L., </em>144 N.H. 139, 144 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We turn first to the issue of whether the plaintiff was prejudiced as a result of the admission of the file. The plaintiff argues that the Town relied heavily on the file at trial beyond its limited evidentiary purpose. He contends that, therefore, the admission of the file as evidence prejudiced his case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In the report, the Attorney General\u2019s Office stated that Sobel\u2019s observations \u201cconclusively establish\u201d that the plaintiff gave ammunition from the police department to Park, and that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct \u201clikely constituted the crime of theft by unauthorized taking.\u201d The report also detailed the plaintiff\u2019s inconsistent statements to the Town and to investigators, raising \u201cserious questions\u201d about his truthfulness about the matter. We find that the Attorney General\u2019s report, which was admitted without objection, provided a sufficient basis to support any material conclusions that were reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The plaintiff argues that he was prejudiced by the admission of the Attorney General\u2019s file because the trial court relied upon it. He contends that the trial court relied upon the file to find that: (1) according to Sobel, Park stated that the plaintiff owed him ammunition for work done on the plaintiff\u2019s car; (2) Park stated that the plaintiff said he was giving him \u201cold ammo that [the plaintiff] had kicking around his house;\u201d and (3) the Attorney General\u2019s Office made \u201ca serious attempt\u201d to investigate whether the plaintiff had improper possession of Town property. The plaintiff argues that all three findings were unsupported by the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Even assuming that the admission of the file was error, the trial court\u2019s specific findings were supported by evidence other than the Attorney General\u2019s file. First, without objection by the plaintiff, the trial court admitted into evidence a report from Sobel that attests to the first two examples of Park\u2019s statements regarding the ammunition. Next, the record shows that the Attorney General\u2019s Office reviewed documents and interviewed numerous witnesses in the course of its investigation. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to find that the Attorney General\u2019s Office made \u201ca serious attempt\u201d to investigate the plaintiff. Lacking any other specific examples from the plaintiff, we find that he has failed to show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. Thus, he has failed to demonstrate reversible error. <em>See In re Brittany </em>L., 144 N.H. at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a <em>Laurie </em>issue would hinder the plaintiff from effectively carrying out the duties of Police Chief. <em>See State v. Laurie, </em>139 N.H. 325, 333 (1995) (holding that the prosecution\u2019s failure to inform defendant of the credibility issues of a police officer significantly involved in the case violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Here, the trial court ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccourse of conduct in this entire matter\u201d rendered him unfit for the position of Police Chief. Because we conclude that this evidence compelled the trial court\u2019s finding of substantial cause for the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal, we need not address the <em>Laurie </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
