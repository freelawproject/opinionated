The State timely filed a notice of intention to seek the death penalty, as well as life without parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 25 September 1998, Appellant pled guilty to the charges in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but elected a jury for the sentencing phase. The sentencing proceeding began on 9 November 1998 and, four days later, the jury sentenced Appellant to death based on its apparently unanimous finding of the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while Appellant was committing a robbery. The trial judge imposed the death sentence and a concurrent sentence of ten years in prison for the robbery conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Execution of Metheny\u2019s death sentence was stayed pending appellate review. The case is before us pursuant to the mandatory review provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 1999 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 414<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 8-306(c)(l).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Appellant advances four issues, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">I. Did the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant robbed Ms. Magaziner?</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">II. Did the evidence support the jury\u2019s finding of an aggravating circumstance under Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute or was the death penalty imposed upon Appellant under the influence of an arbitrary factor?</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">III. Did the trial court commit plain error in its instructions to the jury regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance that Appellant murdered the victim while committing or attempting to commit robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">TV. Did the jury\u2019s verdict sheet reveal a lack of unanimity as to the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstance, thus requiring that the death sentence be vacated?</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Although we affirm the convictions, we shall vacate the sentence of death as to the murder conviction, and remand that matter to the trial court for a new sentencing proceeding. The sentence for the robbery conviction is affirmed. Furthermore, because we reverse on Issue II, we need not address Issues III and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Appellant admitted to murdering and robbing Ms. Magaziner after he was arrested as a suspect in the unrelated murder of Ms. Kimberly Spicer. He agreed to plead guilty to the murder and robbery of Ms. Magaziner, but prayed a jury for the sentencing phase. As part of his guilty plea, Appellant and the State agreed to and signed a Statement of Facts<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that was read into the record during the acceptance of the guilty plea proceeding and later disclosed to the jury during sentence consideration. The agreed facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">If this case were tried, the State would present the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">On December 15, 1996 at approximately 1:40 a.m., members of the Baltimore City Police Department and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Federal Bureau of Investigation Task Force arrested the Defendant Joe R. Metheny, in an unrelated matter in the 1700 Block of Inverness Street, in Baltimore City.<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark> A Baltimore City Police Officer transported him to the Homicide Unit of the Baltimore City Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">During the course of the unrelated investigation, the Defendant gave several statements to detectives of the Baltimore City Police Department Homicide Division. A review of those statements would indicate that the Defendant met the Victim, Catherine Magaziner[,] one night in July 1994, and he took her to his trailer located at Joe Stein &amp; Son Pallet Company. While in his trailer, he had sex with Ms. Magaziner while she was partially clothed. Ms. Magaziner had been in his trailer approximately one hour when the Defendant strangled her, and robbed her of her purse and clothing. Then the Defendant buried Catherine Magaziner in a shallow grave and buried her purse and clothing in a separate location.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Joe Stein &amp; Son Pallet Company is located at 3200 James Street, which is in the southwest corner of Baltimore City. The Company is situated on a lot, which is adjacent to a wooded area. The Company has a locked entrance gate and is surrounded in part by an eight-foot high chain link fence with barbed wire on top. The lot is approximately the size of a square city block. There is a warehouse/office building that is surrounded by literally thousands of wooden pallets, which are stacked at varying heights throughout the lot. There is no business conducted at this Company or surrounding companies during the evening hours. James Street is a dead-end street where there is very little to no pedestrian traffic. The closest main thoroughfare is Washington Boulevard. The Defendant lived in a small one-room trailer located on the south fence. The nearest residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>development to the Pallet Company is approximately two blocks away.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">At approximately 3:05 p.m. on December 15, 1996, Defendant Metheny was advised of his rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(hereinafter referred to as Miranda rights) by Detective Homer Pennington and Detective Sergeant Michael Newton, whereupon he waived same. In this statement the Defendant stated that he met a person approximately two years earlier (1994). As detailed later, she was subsequently identified as Catherine Magaziner. He persuaded Ms. Magaziner to go to his trailer at Joe Stein <em>&amp; </em>Son Pallet Company, which is located in the 3200 Block of James Street in Baltimore City. He described Ms. Magaziner as possibly having brown hair; her build was \u201ca little thin;\u201d and, she was a \u201clittle tall\u201d in stature. The Defendant stated that he strangled Ms. Magaziner and buried her body. He drew a diagram indicating the location where he buried the body. The Defendant stated that he buried Ms. Magaziner in a shallow grave, approximately two feet deep. He further stated that when he buried Ms. Magaziner, she was not dressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On December 17, 1996 at 3:05 p.m., the Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights, and waived same. The Defendant gave an audio taped statement where he acknowledged that Detective Pennington escorted the Defendant to the 3200 Block of James Street for the purpose of pointing out where he had buried the female victim. The Defendant reiterated that he had strangled and buried the victim. Additionally, the Defendant indicated that after the body had been buried for about six months, he went back to the burial location and dug up and removed the skull. Afterwards, he threw the skull in a trash box. The box containing the skull was later removed to Oxford, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>^ ^ ^ ^</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The search team was unsuccessful in locating the body at that time. Due to the defendant\u2019s error in pointing out the location of the body, in addition to the topography of the area in question, and the attendant rain drainage, the cadaver dogs picked up the scent of the remains in the wrong locations. Consequently, Detective Pennington obtained a writ and again removed the Defendant from the Baltimore City Detention Center. Detective Pennington transported the Defendant back to Joe Stein &amp; Son Pallet Company to assist in locating the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">This time, after some hesitation, Metheny indicated to Detective Sergeant Lehmann an area approximately ten feet from the previously identified burial location. Additionally, Metheny indicated to the detectives the area where he had disposed of the buried woman\u2019s clothing and pocketbook. However, neither Detective Pennington nor other members of the investigation team were able to locate the Victim\u2019s purse or any of her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">William C. Rodriguez, III, Ph.D., and the assembled excavation team conducted an excavation in the area that Metheny pointed out. The team used standard excavation techniques to carefully unearth the remains. [ ] It is notable that at the excavation site, Dr. Rodriguez discovered that the cranium was missing. The skeletal remains of Catherine Magaziner were recovered from a very shallow grave and transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Dr. William C. Rodriguez is an expert in forensic anthropology. In his report dated February 10, 1997, he indicated the following: [ ] \u201cthe absence of the cranium, and position of the mandible and right humerus is indicative of the remains having been disturbed prior to this excavation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">In Dr. Rodriguez\u2019s expert opinion, the morphology exhibited by the mandible and the postcranial skeleton is consistent with that of an adult female, and a craniometric analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sis indicated that the race is consistent with a Caucasoid. Ms. Magaziner was a Caucasian adult female.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Furthermore, he concluded \u201c(A)dvanced environmental weathering exhibited by the remains are suggestive of a postmortem interval of approximately two to three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Dr. Rodriguez\u2019s excavation did not reveal any remnants of clothing. According to Dr. Rodriguez, the deterioration of clothing depends largely on the type of clothing, i.e. whether it is cotton or synthetic, as well as the soil composition. Clothing items such as rivets, zippers, seams of jeans, and elastic bands have a longer life span. He would have expected to find such clothing items as previously listed if clothing had been buried with the Victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On December 18, 1996, the Defendant provided an audio taped statement at approximately 3:50 p.m. wherein the Defendant acknowledged having been transported to the 3200 Block of James Street where he did in fact indicate the exact burial location of the female victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In the December 18th statement, the Defendant admitted taking the Victim to his trailer at the 3200 Block of James Street around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. and having sex with her. There are no details regarding this sexual act in this statement or any other statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Within an hour of taking Ms. Magaziner to his trailer, the Defendant used his hands and an extension cord to strangle Ms. Magaziner. When Detective Pennington asked Methe-ny, \u201cHow did you strangle her? Did you strangle her with your hands or ...\u201d Metheny responded: \u201cWith my hands.\u201d Detective Pennington further questioned, \u201cDid you use anything else?\u201d Metheny answered, \u201cI used an extension cord. I took the end of the cord, strangled her, she was ... passed out and I put a rope around her neck, ah, an extension cord, and killed her.\u201d The Defendant remarked that he then \u201cdrug her back into the woods and buried her.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Months later, he returned to where her body was buried and removed the skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">When questioned about when he strangled the Victim, the Defendant initially indicated that \u201cit was around July 3rd, \u201994.\u201d Detective Pennington asked, \u201c(W)hy does July 3rd come to your attention?\u201d The Defendant responded: \u201cCause I knew the 4th of July was right around that area. It might have been ... it might have been a couple ... It is, it\u2019s the first two weeks of July. I know that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Defendant gave identifying information to include that he believed that the Victim\u2019s first name was Cathy, the Victim was approximately 5\u20196\u201d\u20145\u20197\u201d, about 120 to 130 pounds, had brunette hair, and was missing a couple of upper front teeth. She was wearing cut off jeans, white tennis shoes, socks, with a white pullover sweater and she had a purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Metheny also advised Detective Pennington that Ms. Ma-gaziner was partially clothed when he, the Defendant, killed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In response to Detective Pennington\u2019s questions, \u201cWell what, what, what happened to the clothes?\u201d the Defendant stated: \u201cI think I buried them with the purse.\u201d The Defendant reiterated that he had previously directed the Detectives to the area where the clothing and purse were buried. The Detective then asked: \u2018What color shoes did you say he had?\u201d The Defendant responded: \u201cI believe it was white tennis shoes.\u201d The Detective responded: \u201cWhite tennis shoes? (Pause). Did you, did you bury\u2019em af ... her clothes after you buried her or ...\u201d The Defendant responded: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">In this interview the Defendant explained what he meant when he said he buried the clothes and the purse. He said, \u201cI buried \u2018em but it was very shallow. It was more like kickin\u2019 dirt over top of \u2018em.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">\u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756 \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Upon questioning on two additional occasions (when represented by counsel), December 31, 1996 and January 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>1997, the Defendant stated that regarding the buried female he assisted in the recovery of, he killed her in July of 1994. And, more specifically, on January 3, 1997, the Defendant said that he killed the Victim on July 3, 1994. And when asked why did he kill the girl, the Defendant replied: \u201cSense of power. I don\u2019t know. Vulnerable. I dreaded, just ... I got a very ... got a rush out of it, got a high out of it. Call it what you want. I had no real excuse why other than I <em>like </em>to do it. (Pause). I don\u2019t know how to describe it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">A review of the Defendant\u2019s statements regarding the evidence of robbery is as follows: when the Defendant met the Victim she was fully clothed and was carrying a purse; when he had sex with her, she was partially clothed; after he strangled her, he buried her with no clothing and finally he indicated that after he buried her, he buried her clothing and purse at a separate location.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In an effort to learn the identity of the skeletal remains recovered on December 18, 1996 from the 3200 Block of James Street, dental records of Catherine Magaziner were obtained and compared to the existing teeth in the lower mandible of the remains. Dr. Bernard Levy, who is an expert in forensic dentistry, [ ] He concluded that in his expert opinion the teeth in the lower mandible are that of Catherine Magaziner.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Dr. Margarita Korell, M.D. is an Assistant Medical Examiner in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. On December 19, 1996, Dr. Korell performed a postmortem examination of the skeletal remains of Catherine Magaziner. [ ] As an expert in forensic pathology, Dr. Korell concluded that the autopsy findings and circumstances surrounding the victim\u2019s death as related to her by Detective Pennington indicate that she most probably died of asphyxia. Asphyxiation can result from strangulation or choking.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Detective Pennington would identify the defendant seated at the trial table as the individual that he knows to be Joe R. Metheny.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The robbery and murder of Catherine Magaziner did occur in Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">(Quotations and emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The State produced other evidence before the jury during the sentencing phase, including the four statements Appellant made while being questioned by the police and additional scientific evidence confirming that the victim was indeed Ms. Magaziner. The defense presented evidence bearing on Appellant\u2019s family background, difficult childhood, his history of substance abuse, his military service, continual employment, and his status as a father, as mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The judge directed the jury to complete the mandatory verdict sheet as it deliberated Appellant\u2019s fate and to sign the verdict sheet at the end of deliberations. The verdict sheet required the. jurors to answer a set of questions as part of their sentence consideration. In Section III, the jury was asked to determine whether the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant murdered Ms. Magaziner while committing or attempting to commit a robbery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The trial judge instructed the jury on the death penalty and the statutory aggravating circumstances as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">Now, before a death sentence can be considered by you, the first degree murder must have been accompanied by the aggravating circumstance alleged by the State. Now, the only aggravating circumstance which you may consider is described in paragraph (10) of Section III [of the written verdict sheet], namely, the robbery allegedly committed during the commission or attempting to commit first degree murder of Cathy Magaziner. You should skip and not consider any of the other paragraphs of Section III. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>State has alleged this robbery as its only aggravating circumstance and must prove this aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, as I have already described this to you. Now, a finding that the aggravating circumstances as alleged by the State in this case exists must be unanimous by you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\">You are instructed that robbery is the taking and carrying away of the property of another from their person or from their presence by force or by threat of force and with the intent to permanently deprive that person of that property. In a robbery, the value of the property taken is not an essential element of the offense, so long as the proof shows that something of value was taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">For the offense of robbery, the robbery need not be completed until after the victim\u2019s death, and the killing alone may constitute the element of force. You are instructed that, for the offense of robbery, the intent to steal or take the property of another permanently need not be formed until after the force. Even if the force results in death, a taking after death may nevertheless be robbery. You are further instructed that property is taken from the victim\u2019s presence if it is within the victim\u2019s control, so that the victim could have prevented its taking had the victim not been killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">Now, as I have indicated to you, an intent to kill is necessary for first degree murder and an intent to permanently deprive the person of the property is an element of the offense of robbery. You are instructed that intent is a state of mind and ordinarily cannot be proven directly, because there is no way of looking into a person\u2019s mind. Therefore, a Defendant\u2019s intent may be shown by surrounding circumstances. In determining the Defendant\u2019s intent, you may consider the Defendant\u2019s acts and statements, as well as the surrounding circumstances, and you may, but are not required to infer, that a person ordinarily intends the natural and probable consequences of their acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">You are further instructed that motive is not an element of first degree murder or robbery. However, you may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>consider the motive or lack of motive as a circumstance in this case. You should give the presence or absence of motive, as the case may be, the weight you believe it deserves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">Now, in determining whether the aggravating circumstance alleged by the State under Section III exists in this case, you must consider whether the State has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, as I have already defined that for you, that Joe Metheny committed the murder of Cathy Magaziner while committing or attempting to commit robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">Actually, at one point in my instructions I think I said robbery while attempting to commit murder. It is the other way around. It is as I have just described to you, ladies and gentlemen. It is whether you are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that Joe Metheny committed the murder of Cathy Magaziner while committing or attempting to commit robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not find beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder occurred during the commission or attempt to commit robbery, the aggravating factor alleged by the State, then you must check not proven as to this item under Section III. If you do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factor exists, that is, that Joe Metheny did commit the murder of Cathy Magaziner while committing or attempting to commit robbery, then you must check proven as to Subparagraph (10) in Section III. Now, if this Subparagraph (10) is checked not proven, you must then proceed directly to Section VI and state that conclusion in writing by filling in life imprisonment in the space at the end of Section VI. If life imprisonment is entered in Section VI, then you must proceed directly to Section VII.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">No objection to these instructions was lodged.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">\u25a0 The jury found the aggravating circumstance to exist. In Section IV of the verdict sheet, the jury was asked to consider whether mitigating circumstances existed that may warrant Appellant receiving life imprisonment rather than the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Responding only to the catch-all query in Section IV regarding \u201cadditional mitigating circumstances,\u201d one or more, but fewer than all of the members of the jury found that Appellant\u2019s life history and drug history constituted mitigating circumstances. The same query, however, also elicited the following unelaborated response: \u201cThere is some concern that the circumstances of the robbery constitute sufficient aggravating circumstances.\u201d Despite finding the articulated mitigating circumstances and some apparent confusion over whether the sole aggravating circumstance properly existed, the jury unanimously determined in Section V of the verdict sheet that the gravity of the murder outweighed the mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The jury then, in Section VI of the verdict sheet, unanimously determined that the sentence should be death.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The trial judge imposed the death sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Having done so, however, the judge subsequently expressed his personal reservations about the sentence, noting in particular, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>apparent concern of-some of the jurors as to the sole aggravating circumstance stated in its response to the mitigating circumstances in Section IV of the verdict sheet.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the sentencing report filed with this Court, the trial judge stated, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">The only reservation this Court has with respect to the death penalty in this case involves the circumstance that this defendant was only eligible for the death penalty because of the robbery. The robbery involved the taking of the victim\u2019s clothing and pocketbook after the defendant had killed the victim, and burying those items in a location different from where the naked body of the victim was buried. Another person who had killed their victim as the defendant did, but buried the victim in her clothes would not qualify for the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">Some of the jurors in the sentencing proceeding seemed concerned about whether the circumstances of the robbery was a sufficient aggravating factor in this case. The Court is likewise concerned that this defendant qualified for the death penalty when another defendant who performed the same acts but buried the victim in her clothes would not qualify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Appellant asks us to reverse his robbery conviction because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that he robbed Ms. Magaziner. He states that the trial court did not have enough \u201cfactual basis in support of the guilty plea to robbery.\u201d We find no merit in his argument because the record is replete with facts sufficient to find an adequate factual basis for the plea.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Before analyzing whether the Circuit Court had before it an adequate factual basis to accept the plea of robbery, we are compelled, in light of Appellant\u2019s argument, to examine the nature of guilty pleas generally and the mandatory inquiries necessary to support a valid guilty plea. In particular, we must settle on the proper analytical framework to be employed by the trial court in assessing a factual basis for a guilty plea and what standard of appellate review should be applied to that factual basis determination. Because we apparently have not decided squarely these issues before, we shall look for guidance, in part, to the decisions of the federal courts and the appellate courts of our sister states that have dealt with these questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\"> At the outset, we dispose of Appellant\u2019s argument that the factual basis for the plea must satisfy the standard of proof that, beyond a reasonable doubt, he robbed Ms. Magaziner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The State carried no such burden during the guilt phase of this case. Appellant\u2019s argument is premised on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>fundamental right that \u201c[t]he Constitution prohibits the criminal conviction of any person except upon proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 309, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2783, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 567 (1979)(discussing <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970)). By pleading guilty to the charges, Appellant waived several fundamental rights including the one advanced here, namely \u201cthe right to insist that the prosecution\u2019s proof at trial establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See People v. Lesh, </em>668 P.2d 1362, 1367 (Colo.1983). <em>See also Jefferson v. State, </em>556 So.2d 1016, 1019 (Miss.1990). The trial judge made it perfectly clear when addressing Appellant during the guilt phase of the proceedings that this right would be forfeited by pleading guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-5\">THE COURT: Do you understand the most important right that you are giving up is the right to make the State prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>that you are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the burden of proof that the State has when you plead not guilty, but the State does not have that burden of proof as to guilt or innocence when you plead guilty. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">THE COURT: Do you understand that you are really giving up your right to a trial as to guilt or innocence before a court or before a jury because, as I just said to you, because you are pleading guilty the State does not have the burden of proving that you are guilty? In fact, your guilty plea alone is going to be sufficient to convict you provided it is supported by the statement of facts from the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney. You already know what they are and the court already knows what they are, and they are sufficient to support your guilty pleas. So, you are really giving up your right to a trial. Do you understand that? [APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Guilty pleas save judicial resources and are often willingly entered into by the parties to avoid unnecessary financial and emotional expense. <em>See </em>1A Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 171.1, at 131-32 (3d ed.1999). Applying the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d proof standard would \u201creplicate the trial that the parties sought to avoid.\u201d <em>United States v.

The fact that no jury or bench trial is conducted does not make a guilty plea any less functional as a conviction. <em>See Sutton, </em>289 Md. at 364, 424 A.2d at 758. Generally, it \u201cplaces the defendant in the same position as though he had been found guilty by the verdict of a [fact finder].\u201d <em>State ex rel. Warren v.

For the federal courts, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure sets forth the procedure for the acceptance of a guilty plea. It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">(c) Advice to Defendant. Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">(d) Insuring That the Plea is Voluntary. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or the defendant\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Federal Rule 11 \u201cis substantially a restatement of existing law and practice\u201d namely, the \u201cduty of [the] court to ascertain that [a] plea of guilty is intelligently and voluntarily made.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 11 (advisory committee note 1)(1944) (citations omitted). In addition to the knowing and voluntary mandates, Federal Rule 11(f), initially adopted in 1966 with subsequent modifications, requires a factual basis for the plea. It states, in present form, that: \u201c[notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. Pro. 11(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Maryland Rule 4-242(c) closely parallels Federal Rule 11. <em>See Priet, </em>289 Md. at 282, 424 A.2d at 857(analogizing former Rule 731 c, now Rule 4-242(c), with the Federal Rules). It states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The factual basis determination serves several purposes, but mainly as a safeguard that the accused not be convicted of a crime that he or she did not commit. In <em>McCarthy, </em>the Supreme Court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">Requiring this examination of the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed is designed to \u201cprotect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d at 426 (citation omitted). <em>See also </em>1A Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 174, at 197-99 (3d ed. 1999). It also serves as a significant buffer against collateral attack or reversal on direct appeal by providing a more adequate record for review; it reassures the trial judge and the appellate court that the defendant entered the plea competently and willingly; and it can aid the trial court at the sentencing stage. <em>See </em>3 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, 14-1.6 (1986); 5 Wayne R. LaFave, et al., Criminal Procedure \u00a7 21.4(f), at 181 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">A trial court has broad discretion as to the sources from which it may obtain the factual basis for the plea, including a statement of facts agreed to by a defendant and the government, testimony from a defendant, inquiry of the prosecutor or defendant\u2019s counsel, and any other appropriate source. <em>See </em>1A Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 174, at 204-05 (3d ed. 1999)(discussing the Advisory Committee Note to the 1975 amendment of Rule 11). The Supreme Court has held that a judge satisfies the requirements of Rule 11(f) when he or she \u201cdetermine[s] \u2018that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or information or an offense included therein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Libretti v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 29, 38, 116 S.Ct. 356, 362, 133 L.Ed.2d 271, 282-83 (1995)(citing <em>McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d at 426) (footnotes omitted)(citing to Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f), Notes of Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules (1966)). <em>See also United States v. Partida-Parra, </em>859 F.2d 629, 631 (9th Cir.1988). <em>Libretti </em>interprets <em>McCarthy </em>and the Rule 11(f) determination as requiring nothing more than for the judge to apply the facts in the record to the law. By parity of reasoning, therefore, under Maryland Rule 4-242(c), when facts are admitted by the defendant and are not in dispute, the judge need only apply the facts to the legal elements of the crime charged to determine if an adequate factual basis exists. We see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>factual dispute in this case. Appellant does not challenge that, in open court, he admitted committing the crime of robbery, the accuracy of the Statement of Facts to which he assented, or the confessions made to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We shall review the judge\u2019s application of the facts to the law under the abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 225, 721 A.2d 662, 672 (1998). Other state courts and the federal courts of appeal apply the abuse of discretion standard to the review of the factual basis determination as well. <em>See Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d at 652; <em>Higgason, </em>984 F.2d at 208; <em>United States v. Bernaugh, </em>969 F.2d 858, 865 (10th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>907 F.2d 1096, 1100 (11th Cir.1990); <em>Butler, </em>658 N.E.2d at 77. We have previously defined the abuse of discretion standard as a \u201c \u2018reasoned decision based on the weighing of various alternatives.\u2019. There is an abuse of discretion <em>\u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court </em>\u2019....\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312, 701 A.2d 110, 118 (1997) (citations omitted)(emphasis added). We hold, therefore, that a trial court has not abused its discretion in determining that there was a factual basis for the guilty plea if the court had facts from which it reasonably could determine that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Accord Lopez, </em>907 F.2d at 1100 (holding that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>standard for evaluating challenges to the factual basis for a guilty plea is whether the trial court was presented with evidence from which it could reasonably find that the defendant was guilty\u201d); <em>Rhoades v. State, </em>675 N.E.2d 698, 702 (Ind.1996)(holding that \u201c[a] trial court may find a sufficient factual basis to support a guilty plea \u2018when there is evidence about the elements of the crime from which a court could reasonably conclude that the defendant is guilty.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>People v. Barker, </em>83 Ill.2d 319, 47 Ill.Dec. 399, 415 N.E.2d 404, 408 (1981) (holding that \u201c[a]ll that is required to appear on the record is a basis from which the judge could reasonably reach the conclusion that the defendant actually committed the acts with the intent (if any) required to constitute the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty.\u201d), (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">With this standard in mind, we now turn to the common law definition of the crime of robbery and whether the trial court had an adequate factual basis to accept Appellant\u2019s guilty plea to that crime. Robbery is \u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from his person by the use of violence or by putting in fear.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 792, 490 A.2d 1277, 1280 (1985). We have further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">It is clear that there can be no robbery without a larcenous intent.... Therefore, as larceny is an ingredient of robbery, we look to the components of the former to ascertain the requisite mental element of the latter. Larceny is the fraudulent taking and carrying away of a thing without claim of right <em>with the intention of converting it to a use other than that of the owner without his consent. </em>Because an intent to steal, the <em>animus furandi, </em>must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>present, it follows that larceny, and therefore robbery, is classed as a specific intent crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 30-31, 553 A.2d 233, 236 (1989)(em-phasis in original) (citations omitted). Furthermore, we have held that the intent to steal must occur at the time of the taking and not necessarily at the time the force is applied to neutralize the victim prior to the robbery. <em>See Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 353, 473 A.2d 903, 914 (1984). Indeed, we have adopted the view, also reached by a majority of other states, which holds that robbery does not require \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s violence-or-intimidation acts be done for the very purpose of taking the victim\u2019s property ... [it is] enough that he takes advantage of a situation which he created for some other purpose ...\u201d <em>See Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353-54, 473 A.2d at 914 (citing W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 94, at 701-02 (1972)). We elaborated in <em>Stebbing </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">If the force precedes the taking, the intent to steal need not coincide with the force. It is sufficient if there be force followed by a taking with intent to steal as part of the same general occurrence or episode. Even if the force results in death, a taking and asportation after the death is nevertheless robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">299 Md. at 356, 473 A.2d at 915. <em>Stebbing </em>is an exception to the general requirement that the intent to commit a crime accompany a forbidden act. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 602, 728 A.2d 180, 182-83 (1999). This exception, however, is justified, in part, because a felon who applies force to neutralize a victim should be held responsible for that action if the felon later decides to take advantage of the situation by robbing the victim. In essence, we have allowed, in such circumstances, for a constructive concurrence of the force and intent to steal at the time of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">In this case, Appellant argues that his conduct, as admitted in the Statement of Facts, was inadequate to satisfy the elements of robbery. Appellant strains to convince us that the sole factual basis relied on by the State to prove robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>was contained in one paragraph in the agreed Statement of Facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">A review of the Defendant\u2019s statements regarding the evidence of robbery is as follows: when the Defendant met the Victim she was fully clothed and was carrying a purse; when he had sex with her, she was partially clothed; after he strangled her, he buried her with no clothing; and finally, he indicated that after he buried her, he buried her clothing and purse at a separate location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">He further states that these facts do not prove \u201can intent to steal at the time of the taking\u201d and \u201c[t]he fact that he buried the victim\u2019s clothing and purse a short distance from the body, rather than in the same grave, fails utterly to demonstrate an intent to steal.\u201d Moreover, Appellant claims that he \u201cnever appropriated anything belonging to the victim to his own use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao7\">The trial judge was not constrained solely to consideration of the facts contained in the above paragraph. The record contains other unchallenged information, not only in the Statement of Facts, but also from Appellant\u2019s own testimonial responses to the court\u2019s questions. The paragraph exclusively spotlighted by Appellant is merely a summary of the facts in the Statement of Facts used to support the factual basis determination. Appellant\u2019s admission that Ms. Magaziner was not clothed when he buried her is consistent with the fact that her clothing and purse (or any indicia of them) were not found with her remains. The facts also suggest that Appellant removed at least part of the victim\u2019s clothing which she had been wearing during sex with Appellant, and buried that property, along with her other clothing and purse, in a separate location than her body. The Statement of Facts details how Appellant tried to help the police locate the purse and clothing and how he indicated to the police that he buried them in a different location. Indeed, Appellant described the clothing in some detail. Moreover, Dr. Rodriquez, the State\u2019s forensic anthropologist, stated that had Ms. Magaziner been buried wearing any clothes, he would have expected to have found long-life span articles such as rivets, zippers, seams of jeans, and elastic bands with the body. All of these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>corroborate Appellant\u2019s statements that he removed Ms. Ma-gaziner\u2019s clothing and purse to a separate location with the specific intent permanently to deprive her of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The trial judge secured additional facts by inquiring from Appellant, in open court, whether he committed the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWq\">THE COURT: Do you understand that you are charged with and pleading guilty to the first and only count in 98-CR-0233 and to the first count of 98-CR-0234. [sic] Count one or the only count in 98-CR-0233 charges you with between May 27th of \u201994 and December the 18th of 19\u201996 [sic] with willfully and deliberately and with premeditation and intentionally killing Cathy Ann Magaziner; and the first count of 98-CR-0234 charges you between those same dates of May 27th, 1994 and December the 18th, 1996 with unlawfully robbing Ms. Magaziner and violently stealing from her certain items; namely, money and her clothing? Do you understand that that is what you are charged with and pleading guilty to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">THE COURT: Do you know how somebody commits the crime of premeditated murder and the crime of robbing somebody else? Have you discussed how those crimes are committed with your lawyers? Do you know how the crimes are committed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">THE DEFENDANT: I committed them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">THE COURT: I understand that. Do you know what you have to do in order to commit those crimes? Do you know how somebody commits first degree murder of another person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes. He thinks about it, plans it, does it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">THE COURT: What about the crime of robbing somebody else? Do you know how that crime is committed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes. It was committed during the premeditated murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-13\">THE COURT: By doing what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>THE DEFENDANT: By stealing her clothes and stealing her purse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We note further that the unchallenged interrogation statements obtained by the police from Appellant substantiate and are consistent with the Statement of Facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in finding an adequate factual basis to support the guilty plea to robbery, including Appellant\u2019s specific intent to rob Ms. Magaziner. Based on the record, the trial judge easily could have made a reasonable determination that Appellant was guilty of robbery with the intent to rob Ms. Magaziner arising subsequent to the murder. Removing and discarding portions of \u201cclothing supports a finding that it was taken and carried away with the intent permanently to deprive the owner of its possession.\u201d <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 352, 473 A.2d at 913. Furthermore, we find Appellant\u2019s assertion that he did not use the clothing or purse for his own use to be irrelevant. \u201cThe felonious intent element of robbery is not limited to an intent to acquire benefit of a pecuniary nature for oneself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not concern ourselves with whether Appellant personally used the victim\u2019s purse or clothing. \u201cAn intent to steal need not include an intention to convert the property to one\u2019s own use; it is sufficient that there is an intention to permanently deprive the owner of the property.\u201d 2 Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 8.11, at 442 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Next, we must determine whether the evidence supports the finding of the statutory aggravator of robbery under Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 413(d)(10) sufficient to support capital murder. Appellant presents us with three reasons why the evidence does not support the sentencing jury\u2019s finding of the robbery aggravator. First, Appellant argues that the facts of this case do not establish that he ever robbed Ms. Magaziner. Second, he suggests that he is ineligible for the death penalty absent a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>felony-murder conviction. Third, Appellant argues that the evidence in this case fails to establish that he committed the murder of Ms.' Magaziner in the commission of the crime of robbery. We already have rejected Appellant\u2019s first argument and need not address it further. Appellant\u2019s other contentions merit further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Appellant cites <em>Stebbing </em>for the proposition that: \u201c[u]nder the legislative scheme, \u2018the commission of certain felonies, <em>underlying a felony murder conviction, </em>is to be considered an aggravating circumstance in the capital sentencing proceeding.\u2019 \u201d 299 Md. at 359, 473 A.2d 903 (emphasis by Appellant). He adds that \u201c[hjere, there is no conviction of felony murder nor sufficient evidence to support such a conviction.\u201d Although not stating it directly, Appellant\u2019s emphasis suggests to- us that he views <em>Stebbing </em>as limiting defendants eligible for death by way of the robbery aggravator in \u00a7 413(d)(10) to those convicted of felony-murder. We do not believe that the legislature intended that the statute be so confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">To determine whether Appellant was eligible for death, we begin by looking at the purpose of the statute and the legislature\u2019s intent. The time-honored principles of statutory interpretation that we shall employ in this analysis include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">[e]very quest to discover and give effect to the objectives of the legislature begins with the text of the statute. If the intent of the legislature is clear from the words of the statute, our inquiry normally ends and we apply the plain meaning of the statute. In other words, we will approach our analysis from a common sense perspective, seeking to give the statutory language its ordinary meaning. In furthering the identified\u201d legislative objectives, we avoid giving the statute a strained interpretation or one that reaches an absurd result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-9\"><em>Huffman v. State, </em>356 Md. 622, 627-28, 741 A.2d 1088, 1090-91 (1999) (citations omitted). <em>See also Thanos v.

In addition to the words of the statute, this Court considers other traditional sources of information, including historical background, prior cases interpreting the statute, and any \u201cother material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.\u201d <em>Kaczorowski v.

The contemporary iteration of \u00a7 413 has been shaped largely in response to Supreme Court decisions mandating that the states protect the constitutional rights of defendants facing the ultimate punishment of death. In <em>Tichnell, </em>we discussed a series of Supreme Court cases that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>provided the impetus for the General Assembly to design \u00a7 413 in its present form. <em>See Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 720-24, 415 A.2d at 843-45 (explaining <em>Furman v. Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238, 92 S.Ct. 2726, 33 L.Ed.2d 346 (1972); <em>Woodson v. North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976); <em>Roberts v. Louisiana, </em>428 U.S. 325, 96 S.Ct. 3001, 49 L.Ed.2d 974 (1976); <em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); <em>Proffitt v. Florida, </em>428 U.S. 242, 96 S.Ct. 2960, 49 L.Ed.2d 913 (1976); <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976); and the General Assembly\u2019s reaction to these cases). <em>See also Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 121-27, 472 A.2d 953, 970-72 (1984). We recognize these cases as essentially holding that an arbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty is unconstitutional. <em>Furman </em>declared that death penalty statutes that provided for unbridled discretion of the imposition of the sentence of death amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 720-21, 415 A.2d at 843-44. <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Roberts </em>struck down death penalty statutes that mandated the sentence of death for the commission of certain first degree murders, no matter how narrow the class. <em>See Tichnell, </em>287 Md. at 722, 415 A.2d at 844. In contrast, <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>and <em>Jurek </em>upheld death penalty statutes that provided for guided discretion before imposition of the death penalty. In upholding the constitutionality of Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute in <em>Tichnell, </em>we compared it with those statutes upheld by the Supreme Court. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">[t]he death penalty statutes upheld by the Court in <em>Gregg, Proffitt </em>and <em>Jurek </em>each contained three provisions which guarded against the concerns raised in <em>Furman. </em>First, each of the new discretionary statutes provided for a bifurcated trial so that guilt and punishment would be separately determined. Second, imposition of the death penalty was restricted to cases in which certain aggravating circumstances were established. The sentencing authority was also required to consider the existence of mitigating circumstances. The Court stated ... that this type of provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u201cguides and focuses the (sentencing authority\u2019s) objective consideration of the particularized circumstances of the individual offense and the individual offender before it can impose a sentence of death.\u201d [citing <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 274, 96 S.Ct. at 2957, 49 L.Ed.2d at 939],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">Finally, the statutes that were upheld provided for expedited appellate review of the death penalty statute as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">287 Md. at 723-24, 415 A.2d at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Since the <em>Gregg-ProffiM-Jurek </em>trilogy, the Supreme Court has expressly held that proof of the aggravator may be made at the sentencing phase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">[t]o pass constitutional muster, a capital sentencing scheme must \u201cgenuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.\u201d Under the capital sentencing laws of most States, the jury is required during the sentencing phase to find at least one aggravating circumstance before it may impose death. By doing so, the jury narrows the class of persons eligible for the death penalty according to an objective legislative definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">The use of \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d is not an end in itself, but a means of genuinely narrowing the class of death-eligible persons and thereby channeling the jury\u2019s discretion. We see no reason why this narrowing function may not be performed by jury findings at either the sentencing phase of the trial or the guilt phase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\"><em>Lowenfield v. Phelps, </em>484 U.S. 231, 244-45, 108 S.Ct. 546, 554, 98 L.Ed.2d 568, 581-82 (1988) (citations omitted). The Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">It seems clear to us ... that the narrowing function required for a regime of capital punishment may be provided in either of these two ways: The legislature may itself narrow the definition of capital offenses ... so that the jury finding of guilt responds to this concern, or the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>may more broadly define capital offenses and provide for narrowing by jury findings of aggravating circumstances at the penalty phase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Lowenfield, </em>484 U.S. at 246, 108 S.Ct. at 555, 98 L.Ed.2d at 582. Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute follows the latter scheme and mandates narrowing of those eligible for death during the sentencing phase. Indeed, we have explained \u201c[although narrowing may occur within the definition of first-degree murder, the use of statutorily prescribed aggravating circumstances is a more ideal tool with which to genuinely narrow the class of death-eligible defendants.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 197, 670 A.2d 398, 408 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Against this backdrop, we think it is clear that a plain reading of \u00a7 413 shows that it does not limit death penalty eligibility for the aggravating circumstance of robbery to only those convicted of felony-murder during the guilt phase. The plain words of \u00a7 413(a) state that a person convicted of \u201cmurder in the first degree\u201d may be sentenced to death. The words \u201cmurder in the first degree\u201d do not distinguish between felony-murder and premeditated murder, both of which are classified as first degree murder under \u00a7\u00a7 407-410. In this case, Appellant pled guilty to premeditated murder and robbery.' The missing link here is that the State did not prove, nor attempt to prove at the guilt phase, the element of committing the murder during the perpetration of the robbery. The absence of a felony-murder conviction at the guilt phase, however, does not preclude the State from proving, during the sentencing phase, that the murder was committed while in commission of the robbery in order to satisfy the statutory aggravator. <em>See Commonwealth v. Lee, </em>541 Pa. 260, 662 A.2d 645, 656 (1995)(holding that absent a legislative mandate requiring a conviction of the aggravating circumstance \u201cthe death penalty statute does not require that a defendant be convicted of the substantive offense under the crimes code in order for a jury to consider it as an aggravating factor\u201d); <em>State v. Hunter, </em>840 S.W.2d 850, 868 (Mo.1992)(holding that robbery aggravating circumstance may be proven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>even though defendant did not plead guilty to felony-murder and only to premeditated murder and robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">In sum, while the State must prove first degree murder as a prerequisite to death penalty eligibility, the State is not obligated to prove the \u00a7 413(d)(10) aggravators during the guilt phase of the trial. We hold, therefore, that a defendant who does not plead guilty to the robbery variation of felony-murder, but does plead guilty to premeditated murder and robbery, is still eligible for the death penalty upon proof of the robbery aggravator. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 495 A.2d 1 (1985)(defendant convicted of premeditated murder and robbery during guilt phase of trial and sentenced to death under robbery aggravator); <em>Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 530 A.2d 743 (1987)(affirming first degree murder convictions and death sentence based on finding of robbery aggravator even though defendant was never charged with robbing his victims); <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 597 A.2d 1359 (1991)(affirming premeditated murder and robbery convictions and sentence of death based on finding of robbery aggravator).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Our language in <em>Stebbing </em>does not contradict this legislative intent, nor does it foreclose the possibility that a defendant pleading guilty to premeditated murder and robbery, but not felony-murder, may still be eligible for death under the robbery aggravator. <em>Stebbing </em>was decided in the context of a felony-murder conviction. Nowhere in our decision did we restrict the death penalty\u2019s application of the robbery aggra-vator solely to felony-murderers.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Appellant next argues that the evidence presented by the State during the sentencing phase does not support the finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. While we have already determined that Appellant robbed Ms. Magaziner, we must now decide whether he murdered her \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit\u201d a robbery within the meaning of \u00a7 413(d)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Appellant analogizes the language of \u00a7 413(d)(10) with the language used to describe the felony-murder crimes delineated in \u00a7\u00a7 408-410, as well as the Maryland common law definition of felony-murder, to assert that the elements necessary to prove the robbery aggravator are equivalent to that of the robbery variation of felony-murder.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> He further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Under the felony-murder doctrine, as the malice required to establish murder is imputed from the defendant\u2019s \u201cintent to commit a dangerous felony,\u201d logic dictates that absent an intent to commit the felony at the time of the killing, there is no felony murder. To impute malice from an intent to steal, arising after the killing is to reason circularly and allows a murder conviction \u25a0 absent \u201cnecessary\u201d proof that \u201cthe conduct causing death was done in furtherance of the design to commit the felony.\u201d Equally troubling, in circuitousness of reasoning, is the prospect of simultaneously looking back in time at the application of force to find a robbery while looking forward in time to the taking of property to find a felony murder, where, in fact, no felony was contemplated when the homicide occurred. Under such reasoning, a reckless homicide followed by a taking of property as an afterthought would be felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">Moreover, such is inconsistent with the policies underlying the felony-murder rule (to deter the commission of dangerous felonies) and is thus an unwarranted extension of the doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(Citations omitted). Appellant also points to the legislative intent behind the enumerated aggravators in \u00a7 413(d)(10). He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">The felony-murder doctrine aside, the circumstances of this case do not fall within the conduct contemplated by the General Assembly when it drafted \u00a7 413(d)(10). First, the application of this aggravating circumstance to such conduct is not consistent with the plain language used by the General Assembly in defining the statutory aggravating circumstance. The General Assembly did not include all felonies that will support a conviction of felony murder within \u00a7 413(d)(10) but limited its application to felonies which necessarily involve the direct application of violence or threat of violence to the person (i.e., rape, robbery, sexual offense) or create a very high risk of death (i.e., arson, carjacking). Conspicuous by its absence, for example, is burglary. From this, it can be inferred that the General Assembly did not contemplate the inclusion of a \u201crobbery\u201d based on a taking of property that was, in fact, an afterthought to the homicide and played no causative role. Second, application of this aggravating circumstance to such conduct is not consistent with the statute\u2019s legislative history, which makes clear the legislative intent to narrow, in a rational way, the class of cases eligible for the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The real issue here is whether Appellant\u2019s actions fall within the scope of culpable conduct punishable by death under the \u00a7 413(d)(10) robbery aggravating circumstance. This issue, of course, must be assessed against the posture of the factual record in this case. Probably owing to the passage of time between the contemporaneously undiscovered commission of the crimes in July 1994 and the ultimate revelation of Methe-ny\u2019s involvement during the course of his police interrogation in December 1996 regarding an unrelated murder, the State\u2019s case against Metheny was dependent to a great extent on Metheny\u2019s uncontradicted and uncontradictable version of what occurred in July 1994. As to what occurred and why, there is but one version, Metheny\u2019s. According to that ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>sion, the consummated crime of murder occurred before the intent arose to deprive permanently the victim of her clothing and purse. There are no disputed facts from which contrary inferences may be drawn. Thus, for purposes of our legal analysis in this case, it is a given that the predicate felony aggravator, robbery, was an afterthought to the murder of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We conclude, as a matter of statutory interpretation, that the General Assembly\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cwhile committing or attempting to commit\u201d one of the aggravators in \u00a7 413(d)(10) conveys a legislative intent that a murder, in order to qualify for punishment by death, must have been connected to the aggravating crime by more than mere coincidence, therefore eliminating from death penalty consideration a robbery committed as an afterthought. Use of the conjunction \u201cwhile\u201d in tandem with the present participles \u201ccommitting\u201d and \u201cattempting\u201d denotes more than the aggravating crime occurring at the same time as the counterpart murder. <em>See Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>at 1347 (10th ed.l993)(defining conjunction \u201cwhile\u201d as \u201cduring the time that; as long as; when on the other hand; in spite of the fact that; similarly and at the same time that.\u201d). Although coincidence in time of the two crimes is obviously an important aspect of the sense of the word, the guided discretion at the heart of the death penalty statute necessarily conveys a requirement of greater connectivity between the two crimes. Thus, a murderer may be convicted, as we have reconfirmed in this case, of an \u201cafterthought\u201d robbery against his or her murder victim, where indisputably the necessary intent is formed <em>subsequently </em>to the murder and the requisite element of force is imported from that employed to commit the murder itself, the lawful convictions of murder <em>and </em>robbery under such a scenario do not fit within the death penalty scheme under \u00a7 413(d) on account of the inherent lack of concurrence between the intents to commit the respective crimes. In order to be death eligible in the present case, the evidence would have had to support the conclusion that Appellant killed Ms. Magaziner at the same time he was robbing her or in furtherance of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>already-formed intent to rob her. Because the evidence in this case is uncontroverted that Appellant did not form the intent to rob the decedent until after he had killed her, as an afterthought, the requisite connection between the two crimes is not satisfied and he may not in turn be put to death for her murder.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">As we have already discussed <em>supra, </em>Maryland\u2019s current iteration of its death penalty was structured under the influence of the <em>Gregg-Proffitt-Jurek </em>trilogy. <em>See Tichnell, 287 </em>Md. at 723-24, 415 A.2d at 845. Furthermore, although Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute was not drafted exactly in the likeliness of any one statute of another state, it is clear that the General Assembly was influenced most significantly by the procedures set forth in the Georgia, Florida, and Texas statutes upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Gregg, Proffitt, </em>and <em>Jurek, </em>respectively, as well as the Model Penal Code. <em>See </em>Letter from Francis B. Burch, Attorney General of Maryland, to the Honorable Marvin Mandel, Governor of Maryland, 2 Feb. 1977, at 4-5; Memorandum from Thomas J. Peddicord, Jr., Chief Legislative Officer, to the General Assembly, <em>Capital Punishment\u2014Senate Bill 371+ and House Bill 601+, </em>14 Dec. 1977, at 22 (discussing the development of Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute). The relevant wording of the Georgia death penalty statute, however, is substantially different from Maryland\u2019s, and, while the Florida and Texas statutes are worded more similarly to Maryland\u2019s, they are not particularly helpful, standing alone, in delineating any further the scope of culpable conduct under Maryland\u2019s robbery aggravator.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>We agree with the Supreme Court of California that a robbery committed as an \u00e1fterthought to a murder cannot serve as an aggravating circumstance supporting an imposition of the death penalty. In <em>People v. Green, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468, 504 (1980), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Hall, </em>41 Cal.3d 826, 226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99, 104 n. 3 (1986), the jury sentenced the appellant, convicted of murder and robbery among other crimes, to death after finding the special circumstance of robbery (and others) to exist in the commission of the murder. Green killed his wife and removed her clothing and belongings, some during the course of the murder and some after the murder was completed. <em>See Green, </em>164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d at 502. The Court addressed the special circumstance of robbery and scope of culpable conduct punishable by death. It reversed the jury\u2019s finding of a special circumstance of robbery and explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">[W]e infer that the purpose of the Legislature was to comply insofar as possible with what it understood to be the mandate of <em>Furman </em>and <em>Gregg </em>et al. At the very least, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>therefore, the Legislature must have intended that each special circumstance provide a rational basis for distinguishing between those murderers who deserve to be considered for the death penalty and those who do not. The Legislature declared that such a distinction could be drawn, inter alia, when the defendant committed a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated\u201d murder \u201cduring the commission\u201d of a robbery or other listed felony ... The provision thus expressed a legislative belief that it was not unconstitutionally arbitrary to expose to the death penalty those defendants \u2022who killed in cold blood in order to advance an independent felonious purpose, e.g., who carried out an execution-style slaying of the victim of or witness to a holdup, a kidnaping, or a rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Legislature\u2019s goal is not achieved, however, when the defendant\u2019s intent is not to steal but to kill and the robbery is merely incidental to the murder \u201ca second thing to it,\u201d . .. because its sole object is to facilitate or conceal the primary crime. <em>In the case at hand, for example, it would not rationally distinguish between murderers to hold that this defendant can be subjected, to the death penalty because he took his victim\u2019s clothing for the 'purpose of burning it later to prevent identification, when another defendant who committed an identical first degree murder could not be subjected to the death penalty if for the same purpose he buried the victim full clothed or even if he doused the clothed body with gasoline and burned it a,t the scene instead. </em>To permit a jury to choose who will live and who will die on the basis of whether in the course of committing a first degree murder the defendant happens to engage in ancillary conduct that technically constitutes robbery or one of the other listed felonies would be to revive \u201cthe risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action\u201d condemned by the high court plurality in <em>Gregg ... </em>We conclude that regardless of chronology such a crime is not a murder committed \u201cduring the commission\u201d of a robbery within the meaning of the [death penalty] statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Id. </em>164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d at 505-06 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> California\u2019s special circumstance of robbery is similar to Maryland\u2019s aggravating circumstance of robbery. The relevant statute states that a special circumstance exists if the \u201cmurder was committed while the defendant was engaged in, or was an accomplice in, the commission of, attempted commission of, or the immediate flight after committing, or attempting to commit\u201d a robbery. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.2 (West 1999). <em>But see People v. Thomas, </em>137 Ill.2d 500, 148 Ill.Dec. 751, 561 N.E.2d 57, 71-72 (1990) (in distinguishing and rejecting <em>Green </em>approach, stating that Illinois\u2019s death penalty \u201cstatute imparts no significance to the precise timing of the formation of criminal intent with regard to the various [aggravating] felonies defendant commits\u201d and consequently holding that \u201ca defendant is eligible for the death penalty if he commits murder and one of the specifically enumerated felonies either simultaneously or as part of the same criminal episode\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Because of similarity of language in \u00a7 413(d)(10) and the definition of felony-murder. Appellant argues that felony-murder jurisprudence should be considered in our analysis of whether the General Assembly intended for the aggravators to encompass a narrower or broader band of conduct than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>doctrine. The strongest indicator of an analogy between felony-murder and the \u00a7 413(d)(10) aggravators is the similarity in language between \u00a7\u00a7 408-410 and \u00a7 413(d)(10). Section \u00a7 413(d)(10) requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant committed the murder while committing or attempting to commit a carjacking, armed carjacking, robbery, arson in the first degree, rape or sexual offense in the first degree.\u201d Section 410 states that \u201call murder which shall be committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate\u201d a robbery (or other listed felony) is guilty of first degree murder. Many of the felony-murder crimes (i.e. robbery, rape, carjacking, etc.) are also listed as aggravating circumstances. Under Maryland common law, we have held that a felony-murder conviction can be obtained only by the State\u2019s proving that the defendant committed the underlying felony and that the death occurred \u201cin the perpetration of [that] felony.\u201d <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 268-69, 373 A.2d 262, 266-67 (1977). Furthermore, the words \u201ccommitting\u201d and \u201cperpetration\u201d have similar, if not synonymous meaning. <em>See </em>2 Wayne R. LaFave and Austin W. Scott, Jr., Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 7.5, at 222 (1986) (explaining that the \u201ctypical modern statute make[s] it murder to cause a death, accidently or intentionally in the commission [or perpetration] or attempted commission [perpetration] of certain named felonies\u201d) (citing numerous state felony-murder statutes)(second and third alterations by author) (internal quotation marks omitted). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccommission\u201d as \u201c[t]he act of doing or perpetrating (as a crime)\u201d and \u201cperpetrate\u201d as \u201c[t]o commit or carry out (an act, esp. a crime).\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 264 and 1161 (7th ed.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Although we are not presented with, and thus shall not decide, the question whether an \u201cafterthought\u201d to commit a felony, specifically the intent to rob indisputably formed after a murder, is encompassed by the felony-murder rule and thus may underlie a felony-murder conviction, decisions on this very issue by some other jurisdictions support our conclusion that an afterthought robbery may not serve as a death penalty aggravator, whether alone or in conjunction with any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>aggravator(s). The Supreme Court of Tennessee has aptly-stated the two main diverging views regarding \u201cafterthought\u201d situations under that State\u2019s felony-murder rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">The law does not require that the felony necessarily precede the murder in order to support a felony-murder conviction. The killing may precede, coincide with, or follow the felony and still be considered as occurring \u201cin the perpetration of\u2019 the felony offense, so long as there is a connection in time, place, and continuity of action. Where the killing precedes the commission of the felony, however, there is a split of authority between the various jurisdictions as to whether, intent to commit the felony must exist concurrent with the commission of the homicide, or whether intent formed after a killing is nonetheless sufficient to bring a case within the felony-murder rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><em>State v. Buggs, </em>995 S.W.2d 102, 106 (Tenn.1999). The <em>Buggs </em>Court went further to hold that the intent to commit the underlying felony must exist prior to or concurrent with the commission of the act causing the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">LaFave and Scott have also noted the split of authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">A problem arises concerning felony murder if the deathblow precedes the felony or the attempt, after which the defendant continues on and commits the felony or its attempt. Of course, if the defendant knocks his intended robbery victim on the head to disable him from resistence, thereby intentionally or accidentally injuring him fatally, and thereafter he takes his victim\u2019s money, the homicide occurs in the commission of the felony and so constitutes murder (and under most statutes first-degree murder). But what if the robber thus injures him in a fight, with no thoughts of robbing him, and only later seeing his adversary helpless, decides to rob him? There is a split of authority as to whether this constitutes a homicide in the commission of robbery. It would seem that the homicide, done without thought of a felony, could not be \u201cin the commission of\u2019 the felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>2 Wayne R.

Pennsylvania premises its rejection of the \u201cafterthought\u201d scenario on the deterrent purpose of the felony-murder rule. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held, in the context of felony-murder, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[wjhere an actor kills prior to formulating the intent to commit the underlying felony, we cannot say the actor knew or should have known death might occur from involvement in a dangerous felony because no involvement in a dangerous felony exists since the intent to commit the felony is not yet formulated.

In <em>Spallone, </em>the Superior Court cut against the grain of prior Pennsylvania Supreme Court decisions that noted in dicta that the timing of the intent to commit the felony was irrelevant. <em>See id. </em>at 1147. The <em>Spallone </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">our conclusion comports with the rationale of the felony-murder doctrine. The purpose of the rule is to deter one about to commit a felony in which a reasonable man knows, or should know, that death may result, by making him criminally responsible for any such deaths.... Where, as here, the trier of fact determines that the accused, at the time of the killing, has not formed the intent to commit the felony, a rule designed to deter commission of a contemplated felony can have no effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">In reversing a jury finding that the intent to rob happened at the time of the homicide, the Supreme Court of Florida explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Robbery is \u201cthe taking of money or other property which may be the subject of larceny from the person or custody of another when in the course of the taking there is the use of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\u201d \u00a7 812.13(1), Fla.

Stat. (1989). Thus, a taking of property that otherwise would be considered a theft constitutes robbery when in the course of the taking either force, violence, assault, or putting in fear is used. We have long recognized that it is the element of threat or force that distinguishes the offense of robbery from the offense of theft ... Under section 812.13, the violence or intimidation may occur prior to, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the taking of the property so long as both the act of violence or intimidation and the taking constitute a continuous series of acts or events.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\"><em>Mahn v.

The California statute permits the imposition of the death penalty when the jury finds that the defendant committed murder \u201cduring the commission or attempted commission of\u2019 one of the several enumerated felonies. We think that this language contemplates a shorter time frame than does the \u201cin the course of\u2019 language found in the Illinois statute. That is, we think that the Illinois statute recognizes that the crime of murder is not necessarily complete when the victim\u2019s heart stops beating, but rather the crime continues throughout the time that the perpetrator conceals the crime and flees the scene. Therefore, the crimes of arson, aggravated arson and murder in this case sufficiently overlapped to support the jury\u2019s finding that the murder occurred in the course of the other felonies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">Second, we do not think that the portion of the Illinois death penalty statute under which defendant was found eligible is designed only to apply to murders that \u201cadvance an independent felonious purpose.\u201d The distinction between murder facilitating arson and arson facilitating murder, which defendant raises, is not determinative. We cannot say, as did the California Supreme Court in interpreting its own statute, that our legislature intended that this portion of the death penalty statute apply only to cases in which the defendant kills in the furtherance of another crime. The language of the Illinois death penalty statute is not that restrictive. It applies with equal force to those situations in which a defendant commits a series of crimes, one of which is murder. The statute imparts no significance to the precise timing of the formation of criminal intent with regard to the various felonies defendant commits ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">As such, we find that a defendant is eligible for the death penalty if he commits murder and one of the specifically enumerated felonies either simultaneously or as part of the same criminal episode. This rule, furthermore, is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>with Federal constitutional precedent which prohibits arbitrary application of the death penalty ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">148 Ill.Dec. 751, 561 N.E.2d at 71-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Virginia takes a <em>res gestae </em>approach to determine if the accused committed a crime within the scope of the felony-murder rule. <em>See Haskell v.

Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 187, 522 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1999) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">It appears that the majority view in this country is the more narrow view of felony-murder and thus, there can be no felony-murder where the felony occurs as an afterthought following the killing. <em>See United States v. Bolden, </em>514 F.2d 1301, 1307 (D.C.Cir.1975); <em>Ex parte Johnson, </em>620 So.2d 709, 713 (Ala.1993); <em>People v.

State, </em>901 P.2d 397, 402 (Wyo.1995). This majority view holds that in order to establish felony-murder, the intent to commit the felony must exist prior to or concurrent with the commission of the act causing the death. The minority view is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>felony-murder may be established when the intent to commit the underlying felony arises after the killing if there is a continuity of action or if the killing is part of the same occurrence or episode as the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">While it is unnecessary in this case to decide to which of these views Maryland subscribes, because Metheny was not convicted of felony-murder, we consider the subject here solely for the weight it contributes by analogy to the issue before us. That the majority of our sister States has determined that at least concurrence of criminal intents, as well as the commission of the underlying felony and the murder, is required to convict a defendant of first degree felony murder further buttresses our conclusion that the ultimate penalty of death ought to be imposed only where such concurrence is proven to exist.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>We reiterate that in the present case the State was required to prove the robbery aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. \u201cThe applicable standard of review is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Grandison, </em>341 Md. at 246, 670 A.2d at 432. Here, there is no evidence that Appellant murdered Ms. Magaziner while robbing her of her clothing and purse. Indeed, while the murder may have been a factor in creating a situation ripe for robbery, the robbery was not a factor in bringing about the death of Appellant\u2019s victim. Ms. Magaziner was killed in furtherance of a murder\u2014the evidence shows Metheny killed her for what he described as his personal pleasure.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> His conception of the design to rob her of her clothing and purse was not formed until after the murder. Because the intent to steal was formed after the murder, a rational trier of fact could not have found that Appellant murdered Ms. Magaziner while committing the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Our holding is not inconsistent with <em>Stebbing, </em>in which we held the defendant responsible for the application of force that left the victim vulnerable for the commission of a robbery, and therefore affirmed her conviction for robbery. <em>See Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353-54, 473 A.2d at 914. Our decision in that case, arising in the context of a capital murder conviction based solely upon the felony-murder rule, did not directly vouch for the sufficiency of Stebbing\u2019s \u201cafterthought\u201d robbery as a death penalty aggravator as she was also convicted of committing rape and a first degree sexual offense, all the elements of which simultaneously coincided with the murder. In short, the robbery in <em>Stebbing </em>was not necessarily the basis for the felony-murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">That the force used to steal and the force used to kill are the same does not prove a defendant guilty of committing a murder while committing a robbery. At most, it is evidence of a relation between the murder and the robbery. To satisfy the robbery aggravator for death penalty purposes, the prosecutor must yet prove that the relationship between the two crimes is that the murder was committed with or in furtherance of the robbery. The evidence adduced at Metheny\u2019s sentencing proceeding did not prove that beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Furthermore, the facts in <em>Stebbing </em>easily are distinguishable from the facts of this case. In <em>Stebbing, </em>the appellant asked \u201cus to rule as a matter of law that, unless the intent to steal coincides with the use of violence, the crime is not robbery.\u201d We held that the jury had ample evidence before it from which to determine that the appellant had formed the intent to steal her victim\u2019s clothing when she applied the force that eventually killed her victim. <em>See Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353, 473 A.2d at 913. We stated further that the appellant\u2019s argument assumed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">that [her] intent when she assaulted [her victim] was solely to assist [her co-felon\u2019s] rape and sodomizing of [the victim] and not to rob her. However, [the victim\u2019s] jeans and panties, and inferentially the boots which she was wearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>were pulled from her body when the attack commenced, and the force separated her from control over her purse. From the subsequent discarding of those items, the jury could have inferred that the intent permanently to deprive [the victim] of their possession coincided with the use of force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayv-dedup-0\"><em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353, 473 A.2d at 913. In dismissing the premise of Stebbing\u2019s argument, we held that even assuming that appellant formed her intent to steal after application of the force that killed her victim, her robbery conviction would still stand. In concurrence with the majority view of other jurisdictions, this Court held that the intent to steal from someone may arise after the force is applied to the victim. <em>See Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353-56, 473 A.2d at 913-15. We also affirmed her sentence of death based on the finding that she murdered her victim while committing robbery, first degree sexual offense, and rape. Each of the three felonies was recognized under our death penalty statute as an aggravator. <em>See Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 360, 473 A.2d at 917, and the validity of the robbery alone as an aggravating circumstance was neither presented to nor decided by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">In the present case, however, all of Ms. Magaziner\u2019s possessions that were removed from her body before application of the force that led to her death were in furtherance of consensual sexual activity. It was not until after her death that Appellant took the balance of her belongings and apparently buried them in a separate location from her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On this record, the evidence was insufficient to establish the sole statutory aggravator asserted by the State to justify imposition of the death penalty. Accordingly, we vacate Metheny\u2019s death sentence and remand this case to the trial court for new sentencing proceedings, not to include the possibility of a new death sentence as no appropriate statutory aggravator remains. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>Metheny\u2019s robbery conviction and resultant sentence are affirmed.

The robbery involved the taking of the victim's clothing and pocketbook after the defendant had killed the victim, and burying those items in a location different from where the naked body of the victim was buried. Another person who had killed their victim as the defendant did, but buried the victim in her clothes would not qualify for the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">We note that the <em>Green </em>court also held, in contrast to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 353, 473 A.2d at 914, that under California law, the crime of robbery cannot be committed if the intent to steal is formed after the murder. <em>See Green, </em>164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d at 500-01.

It held that if the intent to steal from the victim was formed after the murder of the victim, the defendant could be convicted of felony-murder. <em>See id. </em>at 159, 655 A.2d 1282. Our intermediate appellate court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARQI\">Under <em>Stebbing, </em>if a person commits an act of force that causes the death of the victim and then forms the intent to deprive the victim permanently of his property, the taking of the property with that intent may constitute robbery if the act causing the death and the 'taking with intent to steal [are] part of the same general occurrence or episode. 299 Md. at 353, 473 A.2d 903 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9b\"><em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 655 A.2d 1282.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\"><em>Higginbotham </em>went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">[u]nder these circumstances, the robbery could also serve as the underlying felony supporting a first degree felony murder conviction.

The facts in <em>Foster </em>are notably distinguishable from this case because there was evidence that Foster formed the intent to steal before she murdered her victim. <em>See Foster, </em>297 Md. at 194, 464 A.2d at 988 (discussing Foster's intentions to rob and kill her victim). The court in <em>Higginbotham </em>buttressed its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>by noting that \u00a7 410 does not explicitly require that the intent to commit the enumerated felonies exist \u201cprior to the commission of the act causing the death of the victim.\u201d 104 Md.App. at 159, 655 A.2d at 1288. In so holding, the court rejected expressly <em>Legg </em>and <em>Green, </em>seemingly upon the rationale that Pennsylvania and California common law conflicted with <em>Stebbing </em>in that <em>Stebbing </em>holds that a felon may be convicted of robbery even if the force preceded the intent to steal. <em>See id. </em>at 162, 655 A.2d 1282. According to <em>Green, </em>under California law, the crime of robbery cannot be committed if the intent to steal is formed after the murder. <em>See </em>164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d at 500-01. <em>Cf.

I do, however, agree with the ultimate result, i.e., that the sentence of death in this case must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">\u25a0 Mr. Metheny, if the record and the statement he gave at his sentencing hearing are accurate, is a serial murderer. As such, he is the ultimate characterization of evil. There may well be many sincere proponents of the death penalty who would hold to a position that death would be an appropriate penalty for Mr. Metheny\u2019s crimes against the State. The Legislature, however, has not established serial murder as a death qualified offense. In other words, a person who commits two or more murders during one incident, can be sentenced to death, but a person who commits one murder a month for twelve months before he is apprehended, i.e., a serial murderer, cannot be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">In my view, the real reason the death sentence was sought in this case is that Mr. Metheny was a heinous serial murderer. Because serial murder is not a death qualified offense in this State, the prosecution sought the death penalty on the premise that Mr. Metheny robbed the victim when he buried the victim\u2019s clothing and purse separate from her body. This strategy, which was successfully employed by the State in the circuit court, stretches Maryland\u2019s death penalty statute beyond the scope intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">A. Conclusion Statements are not Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">There is simply no <em>evidence </em>(as opposed to conclusions) contained in the agreed Statement of Facts, which is sufficient to support a conviction of robbery. In the case <em>sub </em>judice&gt; the only evidence in respect to a robbery was what the prosecution gleaned from the statements of the defendant, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>made its own conclusions\u2014conclusions that were subsequently adopted as facts by both the trial court and, in my view, by the majority in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Near the beginning of the Statement at issue, it states: \u201cMs. Magaziner had been in his trailer one hour when the Defendant strangled her, and robbed her of her purse and clothing.\u201d The use of the word \u201crobbed\u201d in this sentence is a conclusion, not a fact. At the end of the statement is another sentence that reads: \u201cThe robbery and murder of Catherine Magaziner did occur in Baltimore City.\u201d The use of the term \u201crobbery,\u201d in this context, is a conclusion not a fact. The facts are contained elsewhere in the Statement. They are not hidden. They are expressly identified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">A review of the Defendant\u2019s statements regarding the evidence of robbery is as follows: when the Defendant met the Victim she was fully clothed and was carrying a purse; when he had sex with her, she was partially clothed; after he strangled her, he buried her with no clothing; and finally, he indicated that after he buried her, he buried her clothing and purse at a separate [but nearby] location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Simply stated I do not perceive the above to satisfy the requirements of the crime of robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Maryland courts have consistently distinguished conclusions contained in statements of facts from the facts themselves, holding that determinations as to whether the facts are sufficient to support a finding that an offense has been committed by a defendant, are limited to a consideration of the facts, exclusive of the conclusions reached by the prosecution, or for that matter, conclusions reached by a defendant. In the context of taking a plea, it is the court\u2019s function, not the State\u2019s or the defendant\u2019s, to assess the facts and arrive at conclusions as to the commission of offenses. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-242(c). As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>In Maryland an accused is permitted to plead guilty. Md.

Barkai, \u201cAccuracy Inquiry for all Felony And Misdemeanor Pleas; Voluntary Pleas But Innocent Defendants?\u201d, 126 U.Pa.L.Rev. 88, in terms of how the factual basis for a plea is placed upon the face of the record and how detailed that factual basis must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">\u201cAlthough the accused is typically interrogated by the judge, some courts allow the defense attorney or the prosecutor to conduct the questioning. The testimony of these attorneys has also been accepted in some states as a source of the factual basis, provided the defendant is present. A prosecutor\u2019s testimony usually consists of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>summary of the evidence he expects to present at trial. This method of establishing a guilty plea\u2019s accuracy has been limited at times, however, by requirements that a prosecutor supply concrete facts rather than merely assert that a factual basis exists, and that the truth of the evidence thus summarized be confirmed by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><em>Thornton </em>then holds unequivocally, at 73 Md.App. at 258, 533 A.2d 951, that a full \u201cstatement of facts is indispensable\u201d and that a mere conclusory statement that a factual basis for the guilty plea exists will not suffice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">\u201cThe factual basis inquiry serves a dual purpose. First, an examination of the law and the acts which the defendant admits he committed \u2018protect[s] a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u2019 .... \u201d (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\u201cAn inquiry may be made of the defendant, of the attorneys, or by whatever means is appropriate in a specific case. The inquiry, however, must be sufficient to develop the underlying facts from which the court will determine whether the conduct which the defendant admitted constituted the offense to which he has pled guilty.\u201d (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The Court of Special Appeals first applied the requirement that a factual basis be presented in the context of a defendant\u2019s plea in <em>McCall v. State </em>9 Md.App. 191, 263 A.2d 19, <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 729 (1970), in reference to a plea of <em>nolle contendere, </em>after the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its decision in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). The Court of Special Appeals held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">We construe <em>Boykin </em>as also requiring, as constitutionally mandated, that the record affirmatively show that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>a factual basis for the plea. In <em>[Boykin, </em>395 U.S. at 244 n. 7, 89 S.Ct. at 1713 n. 7, 23 L.Ed.2d 274] it quoted from <em>Commonwealth et [ex] rel. West v. Rundle, </em>428 Pa.2d 102, 105-106, 237 A.2d 196, 197-198 [1968]):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cA majority of criminal convictions are obtained after a plea of guilty. If these convictions are to be insulated from attack, the trial court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the defendant which should include, <em>inter alia, </em>an attempt to satisfy itself that the defendant understands the nature of the charges, his right to a jury trial, <em>the acts sufficient to constitute the offenses for which he is charged, </em>and the permissible range of sentences.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">Thus in this jurisdiction since <em>Boykin, </em>the trial court must determine that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged to which he has pleaded guilty. <em>Requiring this determination of the relation between the law and the acts which the defendant admits having committed is designed to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding nature of the charge but urithout realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge. </em>And the record must affirmatively show the acts which the defendant admits which served as the basis for the court\u2019s determination. We think it preferable that such determination by the court be made before the acceptance of the plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">We point out that the determination of the factual basis for the plea is predicated upon conduct of the defendant which he admits. Therefore, insofar as the acceptance of the guilty plea is concerned, it is not a question of the credibility of the defendant or the weight to be given to facts and circumstances with regard to that conduct nor is it a matter of resolving conflicting information before the court regarding his conduct. The inquiry is not a matter of what the State may be able to prove on a trial of the merits, but is confined to what the defendant admits he did. If the conduct which he admits is not sufficient to constitute the offense to which he pleads guilty, the plea shall not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>accepted. To the extent that this is a departure from our holding in <em>Gopshes v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 396, [230 A.2d 475 (1967)], <em>Gopshes </em>is overruled. Of course, the requirement that there must be a factual basis for the plea is to be distinguished from the rule that a valid plea of guilty makes unnecessary the production of evidence to support the indictment. <em>Fix v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 703, 712[, 249 A.2d 224]. An effective plea of guilty obviates the necessity for the State to meet its' burden of proof of the guilt of the defendant for he has confessed it. We note further, that the rule that the acceptance of a guilty plea is not effective unless the court determines from facts and circumstances appearing in the record that there is a factual basis for the plea is to be distinguished from the rule that the fact that there may have been a defense raised to the crime charged, if there had been no guilty plea, does not, of itself, make an otherwise valid entry of a guilty plea ineffective. See <em>Palacorolle v. State, </em>239 Md. 416, 421[, 211 A.2d 828].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\"><em>We believe that Boykin impressed upon the rule followed in this State prior to its opinion with respect to the acceptance of a plea of guilty only the need for the specific inclusion of the three designated constitutional rights and the requirement that the trial court determine, preferably prior to acceptance of the plea, upon proper showing appearing in the record, that there was a factual basis, accepted by the defendant, sufficient to constitute the offense to which the plea was tendered. </em>So for a guilty plea to be effective after 2 June 1969, there must be compliance with the rule established in this State as refined by <em>Boykin.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbM\"><em>McCall, </em>9 Md.App. at 199-201, 263 A.2d at 25-26 (some emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Additionally, the Court of Special Appeals later noted in <em>Murphy v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 131, 136, 640 A.2d 230, 232 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">Because the agreed statement of facts contained no evidence of \u201cdeception ... in addition to any false representation or false representations that there [were] sufficient funds in the drawee bank to cover the check[s],\u201d Art. 27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>\u00a7 344(b), appellant\u2019s conviction for theft over $300 was improper. The trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion to set aside the verdict. [Alterations in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><em>See Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 28, 354 A.2d 499, 501 (1976) (stating that, even in a trial based upon agreed statement of facts, accused must be acquitted if evidence is insufficient to sustain conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">In addition to discussing the Statement of Facts, the majority relies on the trial court\u2019s interrogation of Metheny in reference to his plea, pointing out that the appellant responded affirmatively to the court informing him that he had been charged with robbery. He is then asked: \u201cDo you know how the crimes are committed?\u201d He answers: \u201cI <em>committed them. </em>\u201d That response is a conclusion, not a fact. Relative to the robbery, he is later asked: \u201cDo you know how that crime is committed?\u201d He responds: \u201cYes. <em>It was committed </em>during the premeditated murder.\u201d He is then asked: \u201cBy doing what?\u201d He responds: \u201cBy <em>stealing </em>her clothes and <em>stealing </em>her purse.\u201d Every emphasized answer is a conclusion, not a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Accordingly, it is clear, as I see it, that, as a matter of law, in assessing the appropriateness of a finding that a defendant has committed an offense based only on a statement of facts, as occurred in the case at bar, the court must look only to the facts proffered in the statement in support of the State\u2019s <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> position that the specified offense was in fact committed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The facts proffered in this case, as stated above, or any other <em>facts </em>contained in the Statement, or, for that matter, facts contained in any of the four statements of the defendant upon which the Statement of Facts was based, in my view are not sufficient to sustain a conviction for robbery, let alone a finding of an aggravating factor in the context of death sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In the present case the error was compounded by the trial court\u2019s conveying to the sentencing jury that the defendant had pled guilty to and been not only convicted of robbery, but, by the trial court\u2019s assertion to the jury panel of its opinion that Metheny had, in fact, robbed the victim. In its opening remarks to the sentencing jury panel during <em>voir dire, </em>the court advised the panel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">Joe Roy Metheny, was found guilty on his plea of guilty to first degree premeditated murder and robbery.... The Defendant <em>robbed </em>the victim of her purse and clothing and buried her in a shallow grave ... and buried her purse and clothing in a separate location. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Additionally, in closing argument the State informed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">So, you can consider that the Defendant pled guilty, that he entered a plea of guilty to robbery, and you will see when you go to deliberate that there is a typed out statement of facts that were relied on by the Court in convicting the Defendant of the robbery. Those facts are essentially the same as the facts that you had in this courtroom.... [Y]ou may consider ... the fact that the Defendant pled guilty to robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">B. Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\"><em>Stebbing v. </em>State<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> notwithstanding, in Maryland robbery maintains its common law definition. Robbery is \u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another from his person by the use of violence or by putting in fear.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>302 Md. 787, 792, 490 A.2d 1277, 1280 (1985). A more descriptive definition is provided by the Maryland pattern jury instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">Robbery is the taking and carrying away of property from someone else [or from [his][her] presence and control], by force or threat of force, with the intent to steal the proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ty. In order to convict the defendant of robbery, the State must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">(1) that the defendant took the property from (victim) [or from [his][her] presence and control];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">(2) that the defendant took the property by force or threat of force; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">(3) that the defendant intended to steal the property, that is, to deprive (victim) of the property permanently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayg-dedup-0\">[Alterations in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">MJPI\u2014Cr 4:28, <em>Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions </em>(1987); <em>see also Maryland Criminal Law, </em>Section 12.0, <em>Common Law Robbery in Maryland, </em>Gilbert &amp; Moylan, (1988 Cumulative Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">We noted in <em>Harris v. State, </em>353 Md. 596, 614, 728 A.2d 180, 188 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">The elements of carjacking differ from the elements of robbery and each offense can be committed without committing the other offense. Robbery is the felonious taking and carrying away of personal property from the person of another, accomplished by force or fear. <em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378, 380-81 (1973). <em>Robbery requires asportation of the property. Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 184, 699 A.2d 1170, 1183 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>[522] U.S. [1082], 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998). Although reference to the intent requirement begs the question before the Court, we note that robbery is a specific intent crime, <em>and that the specific intent required is the intent to permanently deprive the person of the property. Gover, </em>267 Md. at 606, 298 A.2d at 381. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">Similarly in <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 188-89, 699 A.2d 1170, 1185 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-12\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we hold that Appellant\u2019s use of force against Debra Goodwich satisfied the \u201cforce\u201d element of robbery. Debra Goodwich presumably sought to prevent Appellant from removing the items of personal property from her parents\u2019 home. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>using force to prevent immediate interference with his possession of the property, therefore, Appellant committed the crime of robbery. From this conclusion, it follows that the property was taken from Debra Goodwich\u2019s person or presence, as required under the common law definition of robbery. The law is settled that the victim of a robbery need not be in the same room of the dwelling from which property is taken in order for the \u201cperson or presence\u201d element of robbery to be satisfied. <em>See State v. Colvin, </em>814 Md. 1, 19-20, 548 A.2d 506, 515 (1988) (finding that robbery had been committed in victim\u2019s presence where the victim was stabbed in different room of the house from which the property was taken). Moreover, it should be noted that Appellant was indicted not only for robbery with regard to the jewelry and other items, but also with regard to Debra Goodwich\u2019s 1988 Honda Accord. Appellant stole the vehicle after he murdered Debra Goodwich and as she lay dead in the foyer of the Goodwich home. Even if we had concluded that the elements of armed robbery were not satisfied with respect to the other items, Appellant was at least guilty of armed robbery with respect to the vehicle. <em>See Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 353-54, 473 A.2d 903, 913-14 (holding that taking and asportation of property constitutes robbery even where intent to steal is not formed until after application of force resulting in death), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 900, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Additionally, in <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 558, 693 A.2d 781, 796-97 (1997), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">The essential elements of the crime of robbery are \u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, by violence or putting in fear.\u201d <em>West v. State, </em>312 Md. 197, 202, 539 A.2d 231, 233 (1988). Robbery with a deadly weapon is not a separate substantive offense, but if the State can prove that a defendant used a deadly weapon during the commission of a robbery, the defendant is subject to harsher penalties. Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 486, 488; <em>see Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 140-41, 416 A.2d 265, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>266 (1980), <em>cert. denied and appeal dismissed, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981). Appellant was convicted of robbery and robbery with a deadly weapon, and he argues that this conviction must be reversed because the State failed to prove the element of taking and carrying away. We hold that the convictions are supported by sufficient evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Ms. Johnson regularly kept some money in her wallet, and, on the night of the crime, Ms. Wilson was told by Ms. Johnson that she had twenty dollars. Mr. Johnson testified that when his wife was at home, her wallet was usually kept in her purse, which was stored out of sight. At the scene of the shooting, Ms. Johnson\u2019s purse was found on the floor of her bedroom, and her wallet was found, opened and empty of cash, on top of her dresser. From these facts, we hold that a rational trier of fact could have found a taking and carrying away of Ms. Johnson\u2019s personal property beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 30-31, 553 A.2d 233, 236 (1989), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">Robbery is a specific intent crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">It is clear that there can be no robbery without a larcenous intent.... Therefore, as larceny is an ingredient of robbery, we look to the components of the former to ascertain the requisite mental element of the latter. Larceny is the fraudulent taking and carrying away of a thing without claim of right <em>with the intention of converting it to a use other than that of the owner without his </em>consent.... Because an intent to steal, the <em>animus furandi, </em>must be present, it follows that larceny, and therefore robbery, is classed as a specific intent crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AND\"><em>State v. Gover, </em>267 Md. 602, 606, 298 A.2d 378 (1973) (citations omitted). One of the elements of robbery is the additional <em>mens rea </em>of a specific intent above and beyond the doing of the <em>actus rea.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">There is absolutely no evidence in this case that the defendant ever intended to commit a robbery, or was, in fact, murdering the victim in order to steal her clothing and purse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The only evidence relating to why he murdered the victim was that he did it because of a:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">Sense of power. I don\u2019t know. Vulnerable. I dreaded, just ... I got a very ... got a rush out of it, got a high out of it. Call it what you want. I had no real excuse why other than I like to do it. I don\u2019t know how to describe it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">That is the only reason he ever gave as to why he murdered the victim. There is no evidence that demonstrates an intent to commit a robbery. It is evident that he intended to kill Ms. Magaziner, and that he eventually disposed of her body, clothes, and purse, in an effort to conceal evidence of the murder. Under the circumstances of this case, that is not robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">It, standing alone, certainly does not satisfy the intent element of the crime of robbery. Moreover, unlike <em>Stebbing, supra, </em>there was no evidence that Metheny ever took the victim\u2019s clothes and purse <em>from her, </em>even after she was dead. Certainly there is no evidence that he had unclothed her during, or even reasonably close in time to, the application of the force that resulted in her death. In the present case the victim\u2019s clothes were in the trailer when he strangled her. Sometime after he killed her, and, given Metheny\u2019s affinity for post-mortem sexual activity, it could have been days later, he buried her body. Presumably her clothes and purse were wherever she left them when she voluntarily disrobed, or partially disrobed in order to voluntarily engage in sexual activity with Metheny. At this point he has not asported her clothes or purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">It is later, after he disposed of her remains, that he takes the evidence in his trailer, the clothes and purse, and transports them to the general vicinity of the location of her remains and buries them as well, nearer to the victim\u2019s remains than they had been when they were in the trailer. In my view, Metheny\u2019s disposal of the evidence under these circumstances was not the asportation of property, nor does it indicate an intent to permanently deprive someone of their property. As I have said, <em>supra, </em>he was disposing of evidence of a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>C. Other Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The State argues, and the majority agrees, that the circumstances of the offense provide the missing element in the same manner as was supplied in <em>Stebbing v. State, supra. </em>To me, this case is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">First, I have not been able to discover anywhere in the record before us as to when, relative to her strangulation, the body of the victim was buried. The defendant dug up her skull approximately six months after he buried her in order to have sex with it, therefore, as I have indicated above, it is just as reasonable to suppose that he kept her body for a period of time after the killing for similar purposes without burying it, as it is to surmise that her body was buried contemporaneously with her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">That being possible, it can be surmised that there was a period of time when her clothes remained with her. If so, a question is, was the burying of her clothes near her body at a later date, perhaps days after her demise, the \u2018carrying away\u2019, the asportation, of her property? Did it in fact constitute a robbery when he first removed her body and buried it but left her clothes in the trailer? Was he robbing her by separating her body from her clothes? In order for a robbery to exist, the burying of her clothes and purse would had to have been a continuation of the offense of murder, even under <em>Stebbing. </em>There is no factual evidence contained in the statement of facts that the burying of the clothes near the body was a part of the same general occurrence of the murder. The clothes could have been buried weeks or even months later. In <em>Stebbing, </em>the victim\u2019s clothes were forcibly removed during the murder itself as a continuum of the offense, and disposed of relatively contemporaneously,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and some of the property, a blue sapphire ring, was kept permanently by one of the perpetrators\u2014there is no similar evidence of intent in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Conyers, supra, </em>can similarly be distinguished. In that case, there was evidence that Mrs. Johnson, the victim, kept money in her purse. Her purse was found ransacked with all her money missing. From that we held that a trier of fact could find that her money had been transported away during, or just after the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In <em>Ball, supra, </em>Ms. Goodwich interrupted a burglary in process at her parent\u2019s home, and was murdered by the perpetrator. Items of personal property were taken during the burglary. Additionally, Ms. Goodwich\u2019s car was taken as well. We held that his taking of her car, after she was left for dead in the family home, still constituted robbery based on the force used to kill her. In <em>Ball, </em>as in the cases discussed <em>supra, </em>a clear connection with respect to the timing of the force used and the taking of the property had been established to prove that the robbery was a continuation of the initial offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The evidence in the case <em>sub judice </em>was all supplied through the statements of the defendant, and the fact portion of the Statement of Facts. It is limited to his statements that he \u201clater\u201d buried the victim\u2019s purse and clothes near where he buried her body. There is no evidence of when the clothes were buried. While it is true that the authorities never found them, there is no evidence contradicting the defendant\u2019s statement as to where he buried them.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One can only surmise that if he had thrown the clothes in the grave with her body, no robbery would be alleged to have occurred. Would there have been a robbery if he had put the clothes she had voluntarily removed back on her after the murder before burying her? Would there have been a robbery if he had left the clothes she voluntarily removed where she put them, until apprehended?</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Reviewing the holding in <em>Stebbing, </em>further, I note that in that case, we held that the disposal of clothes in dumpsters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>and the retaining of the victim\u2019s ring, were sufficient to satisfy the specific intent prong of the elements of robbery and that robbery does not require, \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s violence-or-intimidation acts be done for the very purpose of taking of the victim\u2019s property ... [it is] enough that he take advantage of a situation which he created for some other purpose!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 473 A.2d at 914 (quoting W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law \u00a7 94 at 701-02 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">To better understand our holding in <em>Stebbing </em>and how it may be distinguished, it is necessary to discuss certain facts of that case. Annette Louise Stebbing and her husband, Bernard Lee Stebbing, offered a ride to Dena Marie Polis, (the step-daughter of Bernard\u2019s brother). During the trip Bernard pulled their van to the side of the road and Annette pulled Dena into the back of the van. There, while Dena was still alive, Bernard forcibly disrobed her, and while Annette sat on Dena\u2019s chest with her hands around Dena\u2019s neck, Bernard raped her. During the rape Annette strangled Dena, killing her. The next day they disposed of the clothing in two separate dumpsters at different locations, but kept the victim\u2019s ring. They disposed of the body on the same day in the area of the waterfront \u201cheadfirst through a manhole into a sewer.\u201d <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 340, 473 A.2d at 907. We further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">The instant case makes explicit what was implicit in <em>Midgett [v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 139 A.2d 209 (1958) ], namely that there must be an intent to steal at the time of the taking. If the force precedes the taking, the intent to steal need not coincide with the force. It is sufficient if there be force followed by a taking with intent to steal as part of the same general occurrence or episode. Even if the force results in death, a taking and asportation after death is nevertheless robbery. <em>See Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 464 A.2d 986 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>[464] U.S. [1073], 104 S.Ct. 985, 79 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 356, 473 A.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\"><em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 139 A.2d 209 (1958), implied that there must be an intent to steal at the time of the taking. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>It is interesting to note, however, that in <em>Midgett </em>we reversed the judgment and sentences of the trial court. In that case, a police officer unexpectedly came upon three men who were waiting in an alley to rob a businessman. One of the men pulled a gun on the officer. When the men attempted to disarm the officer, they were unable to remove his revolver from its holster so they removed the officer\u2019s entire belt assembly. Commenting on the proceedings on remand we advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">[WJhen the charge of robbery is retried, the trial judge should instruct the jury to the effect that, if it finds that the defendant, by taking and carrying away the equipment of the officer, intended to steal it, then the verdict should be \u201cguilty\u201d, but, if it finds that he merely intended to disarm the officer, <em>without an intent to steal his equipment at the time it was taken and earned away, </em>then the verdict should be \u201cnot guilty\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 43,139 A.2d at 218 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">There is simply no actual evidence in the case at bar that the defendant at any time contemporaneously with the occurrence or episode of the murder ever acted with larcenous intent in respect to any of the property of the victim. There is even no evidence that the burial of the clothes occurred contemporaneously with the burying of her body. The evidence is to the contrary. Again the events occurred as follows: victim voluntarily partially disrobes in order to have sex with defendant, he murders her, sometime later he buries her, sometime later he buries her clothes in the vicinity of her body. There is nothing more to support the robbery conviction. There is no evidence of any taking. There is no evidence of an intent to steal. In my view, the sparse facts stated above are not enough to establish that a robbery took place. Metheny did not intend to deprive the victim of her clothes and purse at the time he buried them. She was already dead and buried in the ground nearby. I respectfully suggest that the intent to dispose of the items, under the circumstances of this case, is not synonymous with an intent to steal or to rob.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We also based our decision in <em>Stebbing, </em>in large part, on a number of out-of-state cases where perpetrators were primarily committing assaults, and then, as an afterthought took money from the victim. None of these cases are factually similar to the present case, although several may be similar to <em>Stebbing.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">There was evidence in <em>Stebbing </em>of force followed by an intent to steal as part of the same occurrence or episode. That type of evidence is not present in the case <em>sub judice. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Unlike <em>Stebbing, </em>in the present case there is no actual evidence of an intent to permanently, or temporarily, deprive the victim of her property; i.e., no ring. At least in <em>Stebbing </em>there was some evidence that at least a part of the property taken during the act of violence, was taken with the intent to convert it to the perpetrator\u2019s use. That is not so in the case at bar. Metheny deprived Ms. Magaziner of her life, not her property. In <em>Stebbing, </em>and the other cases mentioned, <em>supra, </em>there was evidence, that the taking of property occurred during, or just after, the acts of violence, or at least at the time of the disposal of the remains in <em>Stebbing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">In the present case, because of the limitations of the abbreviated Statement of Facts there is no evidence of when the items of clothes and the purse were buried in the vicinity of the body, no actual evidence of when any clothes were involuntarily removed, if any were, from Ms. Magaziner. It is clear that none were involuntarily removed during the sexual act or the violent act of strangulation, i.e., during the murder. If the State\u2019s logic were to be applied here, i.e., Stebbing\u2019s holdings be extended under the facts of this case, Metheny would not have committed a robbery had he buried the victim with her clothes and purse. He would, however, have committed a robbery by burying her property nearby. By extension of that logic, he would also have committed a robbery when he dug up her skull to have sex with it and disposed of it in Pennsylvania, but would not have committed a robbery if he had returned the skull to the victim\u2019s grave. I do not believe that it was the intention of this Court that <em>Stebbing </em>be extended so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In my view the evidence of a robbery in this case does not rise to the level necessary to provide the intent element of robbery, even to the level found in <em>Stebbing. </em>Accordingly, I would reverse Metheny\u2019s conviction for robbery, hold that there was insufficient evidence of robbery as an aggravating factor and vacate his sentence of death for first degree premeditated murder. The evil of a defendant, the horrendous nature of his crimes, the ultimate impact upon victims, should never be enough to let us forget that it is the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ture that creates the penalties that we, as judges, or juries in death penalty cases, are permitted to impose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We, as judges, should not extend the boundaries the Legislature has put in place.
