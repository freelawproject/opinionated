Immediately prior to trial, Petitioner unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence obtained by the police as a result of a traffic stop. The trial judge sentenced Cartnail to one year in prison, suspended all but four months of the term of incarceration, and directed a two year probation upon his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in denying the motion to suppress. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted Petitioner\u2019s request for a writ of certiorari which presented the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">Did a police officer have reasonable suspicion to stop a gold Nissan occupied by two black men approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after the report of an armed robbery in a different section of the city of Frederick where the report indicated that a gold or tan Mazda with unknown tags and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>occupied by three black men had fled in \u201cno known direction\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We reverse and hold that the police did not have reasonable suspicion to stop and seize Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The relevant facts of this case, proffered by counsel at the suppression hearing, are not in dispute. What to make of those facts, however, is the crux of the case. At approximately 1:49 a.m. on 26 August 1997, the City of Frederick police investigated a reported robbery of the Quality Inn hotel at 420 Prospect Avenue, located near the interchange of Interstate 70, Interstate 270, Route 15, and Route 340 in Frederick. Information supplied to the police from unidentified sources was that three black male suspects had fled from the scene in an unknown direction driving a gold or tan Mazda. That also was the extent of the information made available to the patrol officer who later encountered Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">At approximately 3:05 a.m. of the same morning, Petitioner was observed by a patrol officer driving a vehicle in the vicinity of West 7th Street and the Frederick Memorial Hospital, an area of the City of Frederick northeast of where the Quality Inn is located.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was pulled over by the officer. The officer stopped Petitioner based on the information he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>received regarding the Quality Inn robbery. At the time, Petitioner was driving a gold Nissan and had one passenger with him. Both Petitioner and his guest are black men.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The officer requested Petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration. Petitioner volunteered that he was driving on a revoked driver\u2019s license. After apparently requesting a computer check of Petitioner\u2019s driving record, the officer confirmed that he was in fact driving with a revoked license.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Petitioner was arrested and charged based on the information obtained pursuant to the traffic stop. At the suppression hearing, Petitioner moved to suppress \u201cany statements [he made] after the stop or any resulting information\u201d because the officer did not stop him due to suspicion of having committed a traffic violation, nor did the officer have a reasonable, articula-ble suspicion of any other criminal activity. The State responded that the police officer had articulable suspicion based on the information obtained about the robbery earlier that morning and, even if that- information did not support an articulable suspicion, the officer would have obtained the disputed evidence by inevitable discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The Circuit Court concluded that the officer had an articula-ble suspicion to pull over Petitioner and denied the motion to suppress. In addition to noting that the roads in the early morning hours are sparsely populated, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">[w]ell, what impresses me in this case is the\u2014apparently there was not the exact identification of the first car that indicated it might have been a Mazda. You said gold or tan Mazda with unknown tags occupied by three people. Well, you don\u2019t have to be a genius to figure that if there was three people, one or more could have been let out in an hour and 15 minutes. Considering the time that was involved and certainly the similarity between a\u2014I\u2019m familiar with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>both types of cars, a Mazda and a Nissan, and one was described as a gold or tan Mazda and then the other was, when they found the Nissan, it was gold in color and occupied by two black males, and black males, three in number, had been described by the officer at the time of the investigation of the suspected robbery. Under those circumstances, I think certainly that\u2019s an articulable reason for the officer to check on that vehicle ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">After denial of the motion, the parties proceeded on a not guilty plea and an agreed statement of facts, the latter comprised of Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel reading from the arresting officer\u2019s Statement of Probable Cause. Petitioner was found guilty of driving with a revoked license.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">He appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which, affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">[I]n this case, the color of the vehicle was the same as that reported, the vehicle type was similar, it was in the same metropolitan area, and it had multiple occupants. The stop occurred in the early morning hours when there were few vehicles on the street. <em>See Watkins v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 437 [601 A.2d 1115] (1992) (A police officer responding to a robbery was advised that the robbers were two black men who left in a small compact car. One of the men was described as wearing a grayish sweat jacket, and the other was described as having a thin beard, a mustache, and large eyes. The officer stopped three black men in a Hyundai car approximately thirty minutes after the incident. One of the occupants had characteristics similar to one of the robbers described by the witnesses. The stop was held to be lawful.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">While presenting a closer question than that in <em>Watkins, </em>we conclude that the motion to suppress was properly denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">We granted certiorari to decide whether the police stop of Petitioner was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Petitioner contends essentially that the only description of the robbery suspects, used by the police officer to pull him over, was that they were three black men who drove away from the robbery scene in an unknown direction in a gold or tan Mazda over an hour and fifteen minutes before Petitioner was stopped. He asserts that such information does not support a reasonable and articulable suspicion for the police officer to stop his vehicle simply because he was driving in another part of Frederick later that same morning, that he and his passenger are black men, and that he was driving a gold Nissan. In sum, he believes the police officer was operating on a \u201chunch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The State argues that the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop Petitioner based on the facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time. It argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aen\">There had been an armed robbery in the area and a description of the suspects\u2019 car was broadcast as \u201ca gold or a tan Mazda ... [with] three black males in the vehicle.\u201d [Petitioner] quibbles that his car did not exactly match the description broadcast over the police radio. His car was a gold Nissan and he had only one other person in the car. However, as the trial judge suggested, cars made by Nissan and Mazda, both Japanese manufacturers, are similar in appearance and could have been easily confused by a witness. As the trial judge also observed, [Petitioner] could have dropped a third passenger off at any time subsequent to the robbery. A gold Nissan with two black males substantially matched the description with which the police were working and [Petitioner\u2019s] vehicle was hardly selected at random or on a \u201chunch\u201d as he insists. Furthermore, the fact that the robbery took place at 1:49 a.m. and the car was stopped at 8:05 a.m. on August 26, 1997, a Tuesday, means that there would have been very few cars on the road, making the gold Nissan stand out even more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">[Petitioner] also complains that the stop, which occurred an hour and sixteen minutes after the robbery, was too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>remote in time and in a \u201ccompletely different section of Frederick.\u201d First of all, [Petitioner] cannot have it both ways. He cannot simultaneously complain that, after an hour and sixteen minutes, a suspect car would have both remained at the scene of the crime and been long gone. In any case, the trail was hardly cold after a little more than an hour. Prospect Avenue, where [Petitioner\u2019s] car was stopped, is about a mile from the interchange of Interstates 70 and 270 where the armed robbery took place. [Petitioner\u2019s] car was located where one might expect to find it: away from the scene of the crime, but still within the general area. As the suppression judge noted, he would not have expected to find a robber within a half block of where the robbery took place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The State contends that several factors must be considered when determining whether the totality of the circumstances suffices to establish reasonable suspicion, including whether the description of the suspects was sufficient to narrow the class of persons who could be stopped, the size of the area where the suspects might be located, and the number of persons that are in the area at the time the police make the stop. It elaborates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Assessing these facts in light of the factors relevant to similar stops, the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop [Petitioner]. First, the description was sufficient to narrow the class of persons who could be legitimately stopped. The lookout was for a gold or tan Mazda with three black males. As LaFave notes, \u201cin the last analysis the most important consideration is whether the description is sufficiently unique to permit a reasonable degree of selectivity from the group of all potential suspects\u201d [citation omitted]. Although the description was somewhat general, it narrowed the class of persons to a single race and gender, and the type of car by color and manufacturer. The next factor, size of the area, also increases the reasonableness of the stop. The question is whether the person stopped was \u201cwithin the range of possible flight.\u201d [citation omitted]. Here, of course, [Petitioner\u2019s] car was stopped near the reported crime scene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>of the robbery within an hour and 15 minutes of the crime. The third factor, number of persons in the area, also supports the stop. At 3:05 in the morning on a weekday, in an area such as Frederick, there obviously would be very few cars on the road, particularly ones matching the description contained in the lookout ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">Given the sum total of information, the officer\u2019s stop of [Petitioner\u2019s] car was reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We disagree with the State that the stop of Petitioner was reasonable. To the contrary, the police action in this case trespassed into unconstitutional territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Our review of a circuit court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence under the Fourth Amendment ordinarily is limited to information contained in the record of the suppression hearing. <em>See Ferris v.

In a later case, the Supreme Court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">[reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause ... [An] unverified tip from [a] known informant might not have been reliable enough to establish probable cause, but nevertheless found it sufficiently reliable to justify a <em>Te'try </em>stop. Reasonable suspicion, like probable cause, is dependent upon both the content of information possessed by police and its degree of reliability.

First, the assessment must be based upon all the circumstances. The analysis proceeds with various objective observations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions\u2014inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person. The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same\u2014and so are law enforcement officers.

Rather, the objective justification requires us to evaluate whether a reasonable and prudent police officer would have been warranted in believing that Petitioner had been involved in criminal activity. <em>See Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 696, 116 S.Ct. at 1661-62, 134 L.Ed.2d at 919; <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 384, 735 A.2d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">We hold that the record of the suppression hearing in the present case fails to establish that a reasonable and prudent police officer would have had reasonable suspicion to stop Petitioner and, therefore, the stop was constitutionally illegal under the Fourth Amendment. There is no question that the police officer in this case was operating on a \u201chunch\u201d that Petitioner and his passenger may have been two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>three suspects associated with the reported robbery of the Quality Inn.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We are struck first by the lack of corroboration between the description of the robbery suspects and the circumstances surrounding Petitioner at the time of the stop. At the outset, we note that two of the reasonable suspicion factors\u2014observed suspicious activity of the motorist and knowledge that the motorist has been involved in other criminal activity of similar ilk but in an unrelated 'case\u2014are inapplicable here. The State admits that, at the time of the stop, Petitioner was not engaged in any suspicious activity, that there was no reason to believe that Petitioner was involved in another criminal case, and that he appeared to be operating his vehicle in compliance with the apparent rules of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Here, a reasonable police officer had only facially innocent activity to generate reasonable suspicion because no suspicious activity had been personally observed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Ferns, </em>we considered the .issue of innocent activity and when it can lead to a reasonable articulable suspicion if placed in proper context. 355 Md. at 386-87, 735 A.2d at 507. We observed that the Supreme Court, in <em>Reid v.

We contrasted <em>Reid </em>against <em>Sokolow </em>where the Court explained that a series of acts which could appear naturally innocent if viewed separately may collectively warrant further investigation by grounds of reasonable suspicion. <em>See Ferris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>355 Md. at 386, 735 A.2d at 507. <em>Ferris </em>reconciled the two parallel decisions by adopting the reasoning of <em>Karnes v. Skrutski, </em>62 F.3d 485 (3 rd Cir.1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">The Third Circuit reasoned that, although the factors relied upon in <em>Sokolow </em>to find reasonable suspicion were consistent with innocent travel, they were nonetheless \u201c \u2018out of the ordinary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 493 (quoting <em>Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 8, 109 S.Ct. at 1586). <em>Karnes </em>emphasized the distinction between individual factors which are consistent with innocent travel, but nonetheless out of the ordinary, and individual factors which are both consistent with innocent travel and too commonplace to be probative in tending to show criminal activity. <em>Id. Accord United States v. Lambert, </em>46 F.3d 1064, 1069 (10th Cir.1995). <em>See also United States v. Alarcon-Gonzalez, </em>73 F.3d 289, 293 (10th Cir.1996). The Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Karnes </em>also recognized that the reasonable suspicion standard, as applied to the totality of the circumstances, must be narrow enough to eliminate a great number of objectively innocent individuals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\"><em>Reid </em>and <em>Sokolow, </em>taken together, demonstrate it is not enough that law enforcement officials can articulate reasons why they stopped someone if those reasons are not probative of behavior in which few innocent people would engage\u2014the factors together must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers before the requirement of reasonable suspicion will be satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Karnes, </em>62 F.3d at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\"><em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 386-87, 735 A.2d at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The remaining reasonable suspicion factors, as discussed by LaFave,\u2014the level of detail of the description of the suspects, the size of the area where the suspects may have been found, the number of persons in the area at the time of the stop, and the direction of flight\u2014we consider as a whole picture. In looking at the description of the suspects, undoubtedly physical characteristics, such as race<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, gender, eth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>nicity, hair color, facial features, age, body build, or apparel of a suspect permits winnowing of innocent travelers. <em>See </em>4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 195-96 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). In addition to personal appearance, LaFave explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">Quite obviously, it is also of considerable help if it is known that the offender actually or likely left the crime scene in a vehicle. And if a vehicle is involved, it is extremely useful to know something about the appearance of the car, such as its color, condition, special equipment, vintage or manufacturer, to have even part of the license number, or to know the number of occupants. This type of information is often very helpful notwithstanding the existence of detailed information about the offender\u2019s personal appearance, for the latter may be of little use when the offender is traveling by car and surveilling police cannot determine without first making a forcible stop whether any particular potential suspect has those characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 197-98 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). In essence, the more detailed and unique the description of the suspects, the more likely the police will have authority under the Fourth Amendment to make a <em>Terry </em>stop because the potential persons on the road matching the description will be fewer. <em>See </em>4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 198 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). In assessing both the quality and quantity of details in the description, \u201cthe most important consideration is whether the description is sufficiently unique to permit a reasonable degree of selectivity from the group of all potential suspects.\u201d 4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 198 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>[i]n determining whether a particular description is sufficiently unique, the description cannot be considered in a vacuum.

In <em>Ferris </em>we explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">a police officer, \u201cby reason of training and experience, may be able to explain the special significance of .. . observed facts.\u201d Thus, conduct that appears innocuous to the average layperson may in fact be suspicious when observed by a trained law enforcement official. The Fourth Amendment, however, does not allow the law enforcement official to simply assert that apparently innocent conduct was suspicious to him or her; rather the officer must offer \u201cthe factual basis upon which he or she bases the conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">355 Md. at 391-92, 735 A.2d at 510 (citing and discussing <em>Derricott, </em>327 Md. at 591, 611 A.2d at 597). The only factors present that matched Petitioner\u2019s circumstances were gender, race, and arguably the color of the car. The other factors were too tenuously corroborated, or not corroborated at all, by Petitioner\u2019s circumstances. There is no indication whatsoever that the factors considered in their totality were any more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>suspicious than their individual components. <em>See Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 392, 735 A.2d at 510. Certainly, \u201c[tjhis is not a case where facts observed by the police officer take on a special meaning when viewed through the eye of that officer.\u201d <em>Derricott, </em>327 Md. at 591, 611 A.2d at 597. Furthermore, \u201c[ajlthough the nature of the totality of the circumstances test makes it possible for individually innocuous factors to add up to reasonable suspicion, it is \u2018impossible for a combination of wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wood, </em>106 F.3d 942, 948 (10th Cir.1997)(citing <em>Karnes, </em>62 F.3d at 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">We reject the State\u2019s claim that the supposed corroboration of Mazda and Nissan vehicles here can sufficiently narrow the group of innocent travelers. We doubt that a reasonable officer would equate a gold or tan Mazda with a gold Nissan simply on the basis that they are \u201cboth Japanese\u201d vehicles. Such a justification by the State seems tenuous to us. Under this premise, the police, with solely a gold or tan Mazda manufacturer description, would have unfettered discretion to pull over seemingly infinite combinations of drivers. Within this assumptive universe would be any gold or tan (or other similar color\u2014yellow, beige, light brown, \u201cchampagne\u201d) vehicle, be it early model or late model; two door, four door, or five door; sub-compact, compact, convertible, sedan, station wagon, van, SUV, pick up truck, or sport car; and, whether attributed to any so-called \u201cJapanese\u201d manufacturer such as Honda, Subaru, Toyota, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki, and perhaps affiliated luxury manufacturers such as Lexus, Infini-ti, or Acura, as well as vehicles manufactured by Japanese automakers and sold under non-Japanese manufacturer logos such as General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler, or Ford.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>We stress, in considering the \u201cwhole picture,\u201d that the size of the area, or \u201crange of possible flight,\u201d that the suspects could have taken after approximately one hour and fifteen minutes following the robbery is relatively enormous at its circumference, particularly because the suspects escaped in no known direction and in an area immediately adjacent to two interstate highways and three other major roadways. LaFave has noted that a significant difference exists between spotting a suspect within minutes of a crime, as opposed to an hour later, because \u201c \u2018the time and spatial relation of the \u2018stop\u2019 to the crime\u2019 is an important consideration in determining the lawfulness of the stop. The elapsed time indicates the minimum distance it would be possible for the offender to have covered since the crime, and this in turn supplies the radius of the area in which he might be found.\u201d 4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 204 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). With multiple interstate roadways near the robbery site, the suspects could have remained in the City of Frederick or just as easily fled in the intervening time in to Frederick County or even other urban centers such as Hagerstown, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Annapolis, or rural areas in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, or Pennsylvania. Given the circumstances, the State has provided no valid, logical reason why the robbery suspects would remain in Frederick any more than they would have traveled outside of Frederick in the one hour and fifteen minutes after the robbery. We cannot say that, all other things regarding the suspects\u2019 description remaining unchanged, a reasonable police officer could have pulled over Petitioner in any one of those metropolitan cities or in another sister state under such a flimsy guise of \u201creasonable suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">It is of no surprise that courts place heavy weight on whether the stop of a suspect was accomplished in the late evening or early morning hours, when fewer people are out in public, as compared to the daylight or early evening hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>when more \u00a1people are out and about. 4 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.4(g), at 206 (3d ed.1996 and 2000 Supp.). The time of day can narrow the number of innocent people on the road and aid the police in honing in on criminal suspects. Nonetheless, absent exigent or unusual circumstances, early morning hours may also provide police with more opportunity to observe a motorist suspected of criminal activity before initiating a <em>Terry </em>stop since there is less public activity to divide their attention. We have no reason to believe, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>that if the robbery suspects escaped in a Mazda vehicle, a reasonable police officer comparing the description of the suspects against the circumstances of Petitioner in all other respects (e.g., race, gender, and color of vehicle), could also determine the make of the vehicle before intruding on Petitioner\u2019s travel. The record clearly shows that Petitioner gave no indication he was engaged in criminal activity, nor did he commit a moving traffic violation, that would have triggered immediate police reaction. For as much as the suppression hearing record reveals, Petitioner\u2019s vehicle evidenced no outward violations of the motor vehicle laws, such as a malfunctioning light, missing license plate, or the like. We note that, despite the fact that there are usually less people in public during the early morning hours, a driver is still entitled to privacy at any time of the day and should not be disturbed by the police without constitutional authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We conclude that the details of the robbery suspects used by the patrol officer to make the stop did not reasonably and articulably match Petitioner\u2019s circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>By refusing to harbor the fruits of unconstitutional seizures, we give teeth to the notion that the courts cannot accord police carte blanche to pick and choose whom to stop based on some \u201chunch\u201d that a motorist, or his or her passengers, are involved in criminal activity such as in the case <em>sub judice.

The State analogizes numerous out-of-state cases with the circumstances of this case to support the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Petitioner's motion to suppress the evidence. <em>See e.g., Medrano v. State, </em>914 P.2d 804 (Wyo.1996); <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>451 Pa.Super. 129, 678 A.2d 798 (1996); <em>Wells v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 541, 371 S.E.2d 19 (1988). Because, as the State acknowledges, this particular analysis is fact sensitive and distinguishable, we find their factual comparisons unpersuasive here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
