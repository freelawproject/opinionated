Important, if not critical to the resolution of that issue, is the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action. Rejecting the State\u2019s contention that it enjoyed a right of appeal pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1995 RepLVol.) \u00a7 12-302(c)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>State v. Webster, </em>119 Md.App. 585, 596, 705 A.2d 151, 157 (1998), the Court of Special Appeals held that the State had a common law right of appeal, which was authorized in that case, since</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">\u201cGiven the sole reason for the sentence modification tendered by appellee and the circuit court, the trial court possessed no authority to deviate from this legislative mandate [that a mandatory sentence be imposed] via the sentence modification/review process, and thus, the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 599, 705 A.2d at 158. We granted the petitioner\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari. We shall reverse in part, and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The petitioner was convicted July 15, 1993 by a Howard County jury of daytime housebreaking and felony theft. At that time, daytime housebreaking was a crime of violence pursuant to \u00a7 643B (a). The State having both timely, in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-245,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> notified the petitioner and the court of its intention to seek a mandatory sentence pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 RepLVol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and established the predicate for the imposition of such sentence, the court, on January 25, 1994, merged the convictions and sentenced the petitioner to 25 years imprisonment without parole. On January 26, 1994, the day after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>petitioner was sentenced, Senate Bill 322 was introduced. That bill proposed to delete daytime housebreaking, among other offenses, from the list of crimes of violence, set out in \u00a7 643B (a), for the purpose of imposing mandatory minimum penalties on subsequent offenders. Thereafter, the petitioner timely filed, pursuant to Rule 4-345(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a Motion for Modification or Reduction of Sentence. Subsequently, Senate Bill 322 was enacted, effective October 1,1994. <em>See </em>1994 Md. Laws, Chap. 712. Just as had been proposed, the bill removed daytime housebreaking from \u00a7 643B(a) as a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 643B(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The trial court held a hearing on the petitioner\u2019s motion to modify or reduce his sentence on December 19, 1996 and, based on amended \u00a7 643B (a), on May 9, 1997, vacated the mandatory sentence it earlier had imposed, in favor of concurrent ten year sentences for the housebreaking and theft convictions. The State noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 1997 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-302(c)(2), of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article. That court issued an opinion reinstating the mandatory sentence. <em>Webster, </em>119 Md.App. at 599, 705 A.2d at 158. We granted the Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which the petitioner filed in this Court, to consider the important issues this case presents. <em>Webster v. State, </em>350 Md. 274, 711 A.2d 867 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The petitioner argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the State had any right to appeal the trial court\u2019s order granting the petitioner a reduction of sentence. Specifically, the petitioner asserts that the State had no statutory right of appeal. He argues that, under \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) of-the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, the State may appeal final judgments only. With this, the Court of Special Appeals agreed. <em>Webster, </em>119 Md.App. at 596, 705 A.2d at 157. In addition, the petitioner rejects the State\u2019s claim that it has a common law right of appeal in this -case. The trial court had jurisdiction to hear the timely filed motion for reconsideration, and the legality of the sentence imposed, the petitioner argues, may be addressed by either the doctrine of plain error or by the inherent power of an appellate court to correct error. Next the petitioner argues it was error to hold that the trial court had no authority to reduce his sentence and impose a sentence that was lawful at the time of resentencing. Although the sentence on resentencing would not have been lawful when the petitioner\u2019s initial sentence was imposed, the petitioner submits that, because resentencing took place after the effective date of the revision to \u00a7 643B (a), the trial court was not obliged to reimpose the mandatory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Also, the petitioner maintains that Maryland Rule 4-345(b) gives the trial court broad discretion to revise a defendant\u2019s sentence; thus, the petitioner concludes on that basis as well, that imposition of a lesser sentence under the revised \u00a7 643B (a) was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The State argues that the petitioner\u2019s initial sentence was not subject to reinterpretation, that the trial court had no authority to reduce a sentence legally imposed pursuant to mandatory sentencing provisions, simply because the Legislature amended those provisions to remove the qualifying conviction. This is so, it argues, because \u00a7 643B (a), as amended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>is, by its terms, prospective in operation, and clearly so,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, therefore, limits the court\u2019s ability to impose more lenient sentences on those defendants initially sentenced before its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We must first decide whether the State may appeal when it alleges that the court exceeded its authority in sentencing the defendant. The petitioner maintains, relying on <em>Telak v. State, </em>315 Md. 568, 556 A.2d 225 (1989), and <em>Chertkov v. State, </em>335 Md. 161, 642 A.2d 232 (1994), that the State may not. In <em>Telak, </em>we held that the State\u2019s appeal, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-401(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, filed more than 30 days after the judge rendered a verdict, was untimely. 315 Md. 568, 556 A.2d 225. There, the defendant was convicted of Driving Under the Influence, but, notwithstanding that the defendant previously had been placed on probation before judgment, in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1984 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court struck the guilty verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>and imposed probation before judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 556 A.2d at 225. Rather than appealing the court\u2019s action, the State filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Only after that motion was denied did the State file an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-401. By then, however, the 30 day appeal period had expired. The State argued that its appeal was timely because it was filed within 30 days of the denial of its collateral motion. <em>See id. </em>at 574, 556 A.2d at 228. Examining the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 and 12-302, we rejected the State\u2019s argument that the 30 day deadline for filing an appeal started to run after the collateral motions timely filed in the case had been decided. Concluding that \u201can order placing a defendant on probation before judgment ... was a final judgment in the criminal case for purposes of appeal,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 577, 556 A.2d at 229, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cThe language and the framework of Ch. 49 of the Acts of 1976 demonstrate that the appealable order is the order which imposes a sanction upon the defendant and which ordinarily represents a disposition of the criminal case. The final judgment in a criminal case consists of the verdict and, except where there is an acquittal, the sanction imposed, which is normally a fine or sentence of imprisonment or both. <em>See e.g., Christian v. State, </em>309 Md. 114, 119, 522 A.2d 945 (1987); <em>Jones v. State, </em>298 Md. 634, 637, 471 A.2d 1055, 1057 (1984); <em>Sigma Repro. [Reproductive] Health Cen. v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 665, 467 A.2d 483, 485 (1983); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>289 Md. 1, 4, 421 A.2d 974, 977 (1980); <em>Langworthy v. State, </em>284 Md. 588, 596, 399 A.2d 578, 583 (1979). An order denying a later motion to correct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>illegal sentence is not the final judgment in the criminal case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 556 A.2d at 228-29. Based on this reasoning and citing <em>Valentine v. State, </em>305 Md. 108, 501 A.2d 847 (1985), <em>overruled, State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 184, 742 A.2d 508, 516 (1999), the petitioner argues that no right of appeal would lie from the allegedly illegal granting of a collateral motion such as the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The petitioner also relies on <em>Chertkov, </em>on which the State, interestingly, relies for the opposite proposition. In that case, we held that the State\u2019s appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) was improper where the sentence its appeal challenged was one allowed by Maryland law. At issue in <em>Chertkov </em>was the trial court\u2019s modification of a sentence entered pursuant to a written plea agreement which contemplated a specific sentence. 335 Md. at 165, 642 A.2d at 234. After the defendant had pled guilty and the agreed sentence had been imposed, she timely filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(b), a motion for reconsideration of that sentence. The court granted the motion more than 90 days later, after she had served the unsuspend-ed portion of the sentence, striking the previously entered guilty findings and imposing probation before judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 642 A.2d at 234. On appeal, the State argued that the court\u2019s modification of the sentence was an extrajudicial act, in that the court failed to impose a sentence specifically mandated by the Code. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 642A.2d at 234-5. Rejecting that argument, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cThe trial court sentenced the petitioner in accordance with the parties\u2019 plea agreement. That sentence was not illegal and, hence, the State, could not allege at that time, \u2018that the trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code, or in conformity with the Maryland Rules of Procedure.\u2019 That allegation could only have been made after the trial court modified the sentence. That occurred long after the appeal time for challenging the original sentence had expired.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 168, 642 A.2d at 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">A decisive factor in our decision in <em>Chertkov, </em>as the State points out, was that the sentence being appealed in that case, \u201cfell within the permitted range of sentences for the particular offense; but for the plea agreement, the modified sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>would be immune from attack on illegality grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 642 A.2d at 236. On that point, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201c[S]ection 12-302(c)(2) \u2018specifie[d] the type of illegality which must be alleged for the State to be entitled to appeal.\u2019 <em>Telak, </em>315 Md. at 574, 556 A.2d at 228. And it did so clearly and unambiguously; when it referred to a failure to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code, it was not referring to the Maryland Rules or anything else other than the statutory law of this State. There is no justification, therefore, for expanding the meaning of section 12-302(c)(2) to encompass more.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 169, 642 A.2d at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The case sub judice is identical to the factual posture in <em>Chertkov </em>and distinguishable from that in <em>Telak </em>in a critical respect. Here, the collateral motion, the motion for reconsideration, was granted, and resulted in the imposition of a new sentence. Therefore, unlike the case in <em>Telak, </em>this case does not involve an appeal from the denial of such a motion. As the State points out, \u201cthe action of the trial court served to alter the sentence previously imposed upon [the petitioner].\u201d This Court has recognized that the modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence revises the final judgment previously entered, although it does not result in the entry of a wholly new judgment. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 29, 41, 333 A.2d 37, 43-44 (1975). Assessment of a new sentence resurrects the penalty portion of a judgement; it replaces the prior sentence. The new sentence \u201cimposed a sanction upon the defendant and ... represents a disposition of the criminal case.\u201d <em>Telak </em>at 575, 556 A.2d at 228. Thus, the sentence imposed as a result of the granting of the motion for reconsideration is the appeal-able order, and the State, under \u00a7 12-302(c), properly and timely filed its appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Because we conclude that the State has a right of direct appeal, we do not reach, or address, its alternative argument that, under <em>Cardinell v. State, </em>335 Md. 381, 644 A.2d 11 (1994),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the State has a common law right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We now address whether the Legislature intended that the mandatory sentences imposed in accordance with \u00a7 643B (a) before its amendment be inviolate notwithstanding that amendment and its purpose. The purpose of amending \u00a7 643B is stated in a Committee Note, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201c[The deletion of daytime housebreaking from the definition of \u2018crime of violence\u2019] is a substantive change that is intended to enhance the fairness and uniformity of sentencing practices in the State. The Committee believes that the mandatory minimum sentences established in this section should be applicable only to crimes against persons or crimes that directly involve a threat to human life. In addition, the deletion of the crime of daytime housebreaking is a logical change because this bill eliminates the distinction between daytime and nighttime housebreaking and doubles the penalty for this offense. See new \u00a7 29. Under Section 3 of this bill, this change will apply prospectively to cases in which a defendant is sentenced after the effective date of the bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>Laws of Maryland (1994) 3158-59. Also of critical importance is the meaning of \u00a7 3 of Chapter 712, providing \u201cthat the changes that are made to Article 27, \u00a7 643B of the Code by this Act shall apply prospectively only to defendants who are sentenced after the effective date of this Act and may not be construed to apply in any way to defendants who are sentenced before the effective date of this Act,\u201d in particular, the word, \u201csentence.\u201d That is a question of statutory construction. The applicability of Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.) Art. 1, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the general savings clause, to this case must be considered as well. We shall hold that the Legislature did intend for the modified statute to apply to all sentences occurring after its effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The paramount object of statutory construction is the ascertainment and effectuation of the real intention of the Legislature. <em>Lewis v. State, </em>348 Md. 648, 653, 705 A.2d 1128, 1131 (1998); <em>Gordon Family Partnership v. Gar on Jer, </em>348 Md. 129, 137, 702 A.2d 753, 757 (1997); <em>Harris v. State, </em>344 Md. 497, 510, 687 A.2d 970, 976, <em>cert. denied, sub nom. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Koenig v. Maryland, </em>522 U.S. 1017, 118 S.Ct. 605, 139 L.Ed.2d 492 (1997). The process of statutory construction is straight-forward and, when the statute is clear and unambiguous, requires resort only to the words of the statute. <em>Blitz v. Beth Isaac Adas Israel Congregation, </em>352 Md. 31, 39, 720 A.2d 912, 916 (1998). When that is the case\u2014when, giving the words of the statute their ordinary and natural meaning, <em>see Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 647-48, 689 A.2d 610, 612-13 (1997), the meaning of the statute is clear\u2014and that meaning is consistent with both the broad purposes of the legislation, and the specific purpose of the provision being interpreted, the search for legislative intent is at an end. <em>Lewis, </em>348 Md. at 653, 705 A.2d at 1131. On the other hand, where the meaning of the plain language of the statute, or the language itself, is unclear, \u201cwe seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior case law, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 705 A.2d at 1131. We have explicated the rules applicable when resort to surrounding circumstances is required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">\u201cWhen the words of a statutory provision are reasonably capable of more than one meaning, and we examine the circumstances surrounding the enactment of a legislative provision in an effort to discern legislative intent, we interpret the meaning and effect of the language in light of the objectives and purposes of the provision enacted. <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675, 678 (1994); <em>see Kaczorowski v. [Mayor and City Council] of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513-16, 525 A.2d 628, 632-33 (1987). Such an interpretation must be reasonable and consonant with logic and common sense. <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 56, 673 A.2d 221, 229 (1996). In addition, we seek to avoid construing a statute in a manner that leads to an illogical or untenable outcome. <em>Greco [v. State], </em>347 Md. [423,] 429, 701 A.2d [419,] 422 [ (1997)]; <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 174, 680 A.2d 1052, 1062 (1996).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA8\"><em>Id. </em>at 654, 705 A.2d at 1131. While we have defined \u201cambiguity\u201d as \u201creasonably capable of more than one meaning,\u201d <em>Greco </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 429, 701 A.2d 419, 421 (1997), we have also recognized that \u201c[ljanguage can be regarded as ambiguous in two different respects: 1) it may be intrinsically unclear ...; or 2) its intrinsic meaning may be fairly clear, but its application to a particular object or circumstance may be uncertain.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 648-49, 689 A.2d 610, 613 (1997), <em>quoting Bernhardt v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>102 Md.App. 45, 54, 648 A.2d 1047, 1051 (1994) <em>(quoting Town &amp; Country v. Comcast Cablevision, </em>70 Md.App. 272, 280, 520 A.2d 1129, 1132, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 2, 526 A.2d 954 (1987)). Thus, a term which is unambiguous in one context may be ambiguous in another. <em>See Sullins v. Allstate, </em>340 Md. 503, 508, 667 A.2d 617, 619 (1995); <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 74, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">An ambiguity in a criminal penal statute, in accordance with the rule of lenity, ordinarily is to be construed against the State and in favor of the defendant. <em>See Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 651, 689 A.2d at 614; <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 539, 546 A.2d 465 (1988); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>75 Md.App. 621, 631, 542 A.2d 429, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 675, 561 A.2d 215 (1989). In other words, courts are prohibited from extending \u201cpunishment to cases not plainly within the language\u201d of the statute. <em>State v. Archer, </em>73 Md. 44, 57, 20 A. 172, 172 (1890). <em>See Gargliano, </em>334 Md. at 437, 639 A.2d at 679. For the rule of lenity to be applicable, the statute being interpreted need not itself be a penal statute; what is required is that the interpretation given the statute have a significant impact on the sentence that the defendant receives. <em>See Maryland House of Correction v. Fields, </em>348 Md. 245, 267, 703 A.2d 167, 178 (1997) (applying the rule of lenity in construing a statute dealing with good-conduct credits).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At the outset, we must decide whether the general savings clause applies to the case <em>sub judice. </em>The State maintains that it does apply and, therefore, \u201cthe applicable penal law continues to be that which was in effect at the time of sentencing.\u201d Accordingly, it concludes that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>had no authority to modify the petitioner\u2019s mandatory sentence. The petitioner, on the other hand, argues that the general savings clause is inapplicable by its very terms. Acknowledging that it provides that, in the absence of a provision in the revised statute so providing, a revision of a statute would not affect any penalty already incurred, the petitioner submits that that is the situation here, that the revising statute \u201cexpressly so provides.\u201d He points out that \u00a7 3 of Chapter 712 expressly saves the mandatory sentence under the prior statute only in the case of those defendants who were sentenced before October 1,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">It is clear that the Legislature\u2019s intent was that the amendment deleting daytime housebreaking from the list of crimes of violence in \u00a7 643B \u201capply prospectively only.\u201d It went on, however, to define what it intended by use of the term \u201cprospective\u201d and it did so by reference to when the defendant was sentenced\u2014if the defendant was sentenced before the effective date of the act, the sentence imposed at that time was \u201csaved,\u201d the amendment would have no applicability to him or her, but if the defendant was sentenced after the effective date of the act, the amendment would apply and the defendant\u2019s sentence would so reflect. Since the Legislature made prospectivity to depend upon the date of the defendant\u2019s sentencing, the critical question is the meaning of the word, \u201csentence,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3 of Chapter 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The meaning of \u201csentence\u201d in the criminal context is clear\u2014 it refers to the act of the court in pronouncing sentence, announcing the sanction that is being imposed on the defendant. It is that part of the final judgment that postdates the rendition of a verdict of guilty. But a trial court may modify a sentence. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-345(b),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which gives a Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Court \u201crevisory power and control over a sentence upon a motion filed within 90 days after its imposition ... (2) ... whether or not an appeal has been filed.\u201d That raises the question of how the court\u2019s action in modifying a sentence is characterized, a question that we must address because the answer is relevant to the construction of \u00a7 8, Chapter 712. If a modification of sentence is a resentencing and, thus, a sentencing, \u00a7 3 is ambiguous\u2014the statute does not purport to distinguish between initial sentencings and those occurring after modification of a previously imposed sentence\u2014thus implicating the rule of lenity. In that event, the rule of lenity would mandate a construction in favor of the petitioner and against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Although it has not before confronted this issue, this Court has addressed the effect of a modification of sentence in various contexts. In <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 701 A.2d 419, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">\u201cConsonant with Rule 4-345(b), a criminal defendant may file a request for modification or reduction of sentence within 90 days of the imposition of that sentence. If the sentencing court grants a motion for modification and reduces the sentence, this subsequent sentence then becomes the effective sentence. <em>See Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 435, 109 A.2d 96, 100-01 (1954) (concluding that a motion to modify must be timely in order to \u2018strike out\u2019 the original sentence); <em>Hurwitz v. State, </em>200 Md. 578, 581, 92 A.2d 575, 576 (1952) (\u2018On motion of appellant, this sentence was stricken out, and he was resentenced....\u2019); <em>Czaplinski v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>Warden, </em>196 Md. 654, 655-56, 75 A.2d 766, 766-67 (1950) (noting that the original sentence \u2018was reconsidered and stricken out ... and the applicant was re-sentenced\u2019); <em>Collins v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 173, 193, 516 A.2d 1015, 1025 (1986) (\u2018The effect of the modified or clarified sentence was to strike out the [initial] sentence and any infirmity attaching to it.\u2019), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 572, 520 A.2d 1328 (1987). Thus, a reimposition of sentence in these circumstances is the equivalent of an \u2018imposition\u2019 [of] sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(b). Accordingly, we hold that, when a sentencing court grants a timely request for modification or reduction of sentence, the defendant may file another request for modification or reduction of sentence within 90 days of the date of the subsequent imposition of sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 433, 701 A.2d at 424. The issue in that case was whether a motion to modify a sentence was timely if filed more than 90 days after the original imposition of sentence, but within 90 days of the granting of a motion to modify the original sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 701 A.2d at 421. In answering that question, we focused on the meaning of \u201cimposition\u201d as used in Rule 4-345(b), <em>id., </em>and rejected the State\u2019s alternative arguments that the unambiguous language of the rule contemplates that \u201ca sentence can only be \u2018imposed\u2019 once\u201d and that, if ambiguous, the history and purpose of the rule indicate that a motion to modify must be filed within 90 days of the initial imposition of sentence, rather than a subsequent modification. <em>Id. </em>at 427-28, 701 A.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Noting that \u201c[p]rior Maryland case law strongly suggests that the modification of a sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(b) is an imposition of sentence for the purposes of that rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 429, 701 A.2d at 422, the Court discussed <em>McDonald v. State, </em>314 Md. 271, 550 A.2d 696 (1988) and <em>Collins v. State, </em>321 Md. 103, 105, 581 A.2d 426, 427 (1990), <em>appeal after remand, </em>326 Md. 423, 605 A.2d 130 (1992), concluding that they confirmed the suggestion. <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 432, 701 A.2d at 423. Moreover, it concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u201cIn interpreting Rule 4-345(b), no sound basis exists to distinguish between the reimposition of a sentence subsequent to the revocation of probation, and the reimposition of a sentence subsequent to the granting of a motion to modify the original sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 701 A.2d at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The question presented in <em>McDonald </em>was whether \u201ca circuit court\u2019s authority to review, de novo, a District Court\u2019s revocation of probation extend to a de novo determination of disposition.\u201d There, a judge of the District Court placed McDonald on probation, which the judge later revoked, directing execution of the sentence originally suspended. 314 Md. at 273, 550 A.2d at 696-97. McDonald\u2019s appeal of the revocation of probation judgment was heard <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court, which affirmed the finding that she had violated probation, but refused her request for <em>de novo </em>hearing on disposition, believing that only alleged violations were subject to de novo review. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 550 A.2d at 697. For the same reason, the court denied McDonald\u2019s Rule 4-345(b) motion for modification of sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 284, 550 A.2d at 702. The Court held that <em>de novo </em>review of a probation violation in the Circuit Court extends to disposition as well as to the determination whether the violation occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 277-78, 550 A.2d at 699. Although that resolved the appeal, we addressed McDonald\u2019s contention that it was error for the Circuit Court to deny her motion for modification, concluding, consistent with its holding, that the revocation of her probation returned McDonald to her original sentencing status, with the result that \u201c \u2018[b]e-cause Rule 4-345(b) applies to any sentence, it must apply to a sentence which is imposed following a revocation of probation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284, 550 A.2d at 702, <em>quoting Coley v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 151, 156, 536 A.2d 1166, 1169 (1988). The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cWhether the hearing judge reimposes the original sentence or imposes a new sentence, the effect under Rule 4-345(b) remains the same; the 90-day period runs from the time any sentence is imposed or reimposed upon revocation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>probation, and the court retains the authority to modify that sentence as the rule provides.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 285, 550 A.2d at 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\"><em>Collins </em>involved the interplay between the execution of a previously suspended sentence following a revocation of probation and a defendant\u2019s right to review of sentence by a three judge panel, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1957,1987 RepLVol.) Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645JA-645JG<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 4-344.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, the question was whether an application for review of a sentence by a three judge panel filed within 30 days of the order of a previously suspended sentence is timely. 321 Md. at 104, 581 A.2d at 426. Collins was convicted of assault and battery and given a ten year sentence, a portion of which was suspended, in favor of a term of probation. While on bail pending appeal, he was convicted of another offense, for which he received probation and, as a result, he was found in violation of the first probation, which then was revoked and the previously suspended sentence was directed to be executed. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 581 A.2d 426, 581 A.2d at 426. Thereafter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Collins sought review of that sentence by a three judge panel, by filing an application therefor within 30 days of the order directing execution of sentence. The application was denied on the basis of a \u201cfinding that the application was untimely, it not having been filed within 30 days of the original imposition of sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105-06, 581 A.2d at 426-27. The Court of Special Appeals having affirmed, <em>Collins v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 456, 550 A.2d 743 (1988), this Court reversed. Although recognizing that there is no right to more than one sentence review by a three judge panel, see \u00a7 645JA (a), <em>citing McDonald </em>and <em>Coley, </em>while noting that \u201cimposition of sentence\u201d means the same in both Rule 4-344 and Rule 4-345, <em>id. </em>at 109, 581 A.2d at 428, it held that \u201cthe legislature intended to allow sentence review either following the imposition of the original sentence or following the [order directing the execution] of a previously suspended sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we did in <em>McDonald, see </em>314 Md. at 284, 550 A.2d at 701, the Court adopted as rationale what the intermediate appellate court said in <em>Coley, </em>74 Md.App. at 156, 536 A.2d at 1169 <em>(quoting Brown v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 74, 77, 488 A.2d 502, <em>cert. denied, </em>303 Md. 42, 491 A.2d 1197 (1985)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cwhen a probation is revoked, the hearing court is returned \u2018to the same position it occupied at the original sentencing of the defendant with one exception; the court may not impose a sentence greater than that which was originally imposed and suspended.\u2019 It follows that if an order revoking a defendant\u2019s probation returns the hearing judge to the original sentencing status, then any sentence so imposed must have the effect of an original sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">321 Md. at 110, 581 A.2d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">d.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">From the foregoing, it is clear that, at best, \u00a7 3 of Chapter 712 is ambiguous, requiring application of the rule of lenity. This Court has interpreted \u201csentence\u201d to refer to the initial imposition of sentence, following the rendition of the verdict, as well as to the imposition of sentence following a modification of sentence. The Legislature is presumed to have acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>with knowledge of that fact. <em>See State v. Sowell, </em>353 Md. 713, 725, 728 A.2d 712, 718 (1999); <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 606, 714 A.2d 841, 851 (1998); <em>Giffin v. Crane, </em>351 Md. 133, 154, 716 A.2d 1029, 1040 (1998); <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 698, 668 A.2d 1, 4 (1995). Had its intent been otherwise, the Legislature could have avoided the ambiguity by defining prospectivity using another marker or by making it apply only to defendants \u201cinitially sentenced\u201d after the Act\u2019s effective date. It follows, therefore, that the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">This result is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the Committee Note\u2014to enhance the fairness and uniformity of sentencing practices and to limit the mandatory minimum sentences of \u00a7 643B (c) only to crimes against persons or crimes that directly involve a threat to human life.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>As we have seen, although the Legislature gave Chapter 712 a prospective effect, it chose, apparently deliberately so, not to make it absolutely prospective, thus evidencing an intention that not all defendants who committed daytime housebreaking before the effective date of amended \u00a7 643B (c) would be subject to the mandatory minimum sentences that statute prescribes. As the petitioner puts it, Chapter 712 \u201cwas written to enable some defendants whose principal crime predated October 1, 1994, to avoid the much harsher punishment that prevailed at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Indeed, construing Chapter 712 as the State urges will lead to unreasonable and illogical results, which are inconsistent with State sentencing practices as well. If the State is correct and a daytime housebreaking sentence once imposed pursuant to \u00a7 643B (c) is inviolate, whether a defendant is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence will depend on such vagaries as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the scheduling practices of the various courts of the State, the timing of the sentencing hearings or, even, the ability of a defendant to delay or avoid sentencing. If the date of sentencing is etched in stone, as the State urges, a defendant who fails to appear and is able to avoid capture until the effective date of the act would avoid the mandatory minimum sentence, while the defendant who cooperates would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">e.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">As it did in <em>Greco, </em>the State relies on <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 29, 333 A.2d 37, for the proposition that a reduced or reviewed sentence is not the imposition of a new sentence, a proposition that it maintains this Court has \u201cexpressly recognized.\u201d At issue in that case was the interpretation of Rule 764b2, the predecessor to Rule 4-345(b).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That issue was presented on the following facts. Johnson was convicted of assault, for which he was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. Although advised of the right to do so, rather than note an appeal, he filed a motion for reduction of sentence, the trial judge having indicated that he would request a post sentence report. After receiving the post sentence report, the trial judge granted Johnson\u2019s motion, reducing his sentence from 5 to 4 years. Johnson then noted an appeal, challenging not the modified sentence, but the conviction itself. The appeal was dismissed as untimely by the Circuit Court for Baltimore. We affirmed, holding that the time for appeal ran from the date of the judgment of conviction, rather than from the date of the modification or reduction of the sentence. We also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_\">\u201cAlthough the phrase \u2018a new judgment of conviction\u2019 may have been imprecise, it is clear from a reading of the section, and its interrelation to Maryland Rule 764 b 1, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>it pertains merely to the entry of a \u2018modified\u2019 or \u2018reduced\u2019 revised judgment and not to the entry of a wholly new judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 41, 333 A.2d at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 701 A.2d 419 (1997), we responded to this argument and, in the process characterized the <em>Johnson </em>holding. We rejected the State\u2019s argument that <em>Johnson </em>undermined the Court\u2019s conclusion in that case that reimposition of sentence subsequent to the reduction of an original sentence is an imposition of sentence. Judge Raker for the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201cThe issue decided in <em>Johnson </em>was whether the granting of a motion to modify a sentence tolled the 30-day period within which the defendant was required to file an appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 333 A.2d at 37-38. The Court in that case recognized that the granting of a motion to modify or reduce a sentence had the effect of revising the judgment in a criminal case, but did not create \u2018the entry of a wholly new judgment,\u2019 and thus had no implication for appeal deadlines. <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 333 A.2d at 43-44.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201cUnder Maryland law, a final judgment in a criminal case is comprised of the verdict of guilty, and the rendition of sentence. <em>Middleton v. State, </em>318 Md. 749, 759, 569 A.2d 1276, 1281 (1990). As related to this case, <em>Johnson </em>stands for the proposition that the granting of a motion to modify or reduce a sentence revises a final judgment because the original sentence has been stricken, but that final judgment is not \u2018wholly new\u2019 because the underlying verdict of guilty remains unchanged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 432 n. 4, 701 A.2d at 423 n. 4.

The Post Conviction Procedure Act provides means for litigating the propriety of the sentence and ultimate bridling by this Court, if such be necessary, of a recalcitrant judge who refuses to correct an illegal sentence. Likewise, there is no denial of equal protection to such individuals. They have a right of direct appeal when an illegal sentence is imposed at the time of original sentencing, the same right accorded to the State by <em>[State ex rel.] Sonner [ v.

It has always been the case that Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 643B and the mandatory minimum sentences it prescribes apply only to crimes against persons or crimes that directly involve a threat to human life. <em>See State v. Taylor, </em>329 Md. 671, 675, 621 A.2d 424, 426 (1993); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. 143, 148, 486 A.2d 179, 182 (1985); <em>Minor v.

Regardless of any other law to the contrary, the provisions of this section are mandatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">The crimes enumerated in \u00a7 (a) indicate that the Legislature was concerned with those crimes with the highest potential for violence. The statute was amended in 1977 by adding new sections (c) and (d), providing \"new and different alternatives for dealing with aggressive and violent offenders ... [and] a minimum mandatory sentence for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>certain persons who have been convicted of three violent crimes.\u201d <em>See </em>1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 678, Preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Daytime housebreaking and other burglary-related offenses were added to the list of crimes of violence in 1982. <em>See </em>1982 Md. Laws, Chap. 479, where the legislative rationale was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201cDaytime housebreaking [was] elevated to violent crimes because it often becomes so, especially when the breaker is confronted or trapped in the house by the owner or police. It is a very common and traumatic type of crime for which we felt increased penalties were warranted for second and subsequent offenses, the same as for abduction, arson, burglaries, kidnapping, murder, rape, robbery, RWDW, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\"><em>See </em>HB 241 (1982). In accord with the legislative determination that daytime housebreaking carried a \u201crisk of personal harm and [that individuals enjoyed] the right, to be free of intrusion,\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>310 Md. 611, 635, 530 A.2d 1223, 1235 (1987), we declined to reverse daytime housebreaking convictions on grounds of disproportionality or cruel or unusual punishment, on several occasions. <em>See e.g. Minor v. State, </em>313 Md. 573, 546 A.2d 1028 (1988). Over time, legitimate concerns surfaced about the disproportionate nature of the sentences meted out for daytime housebreaking convictions and potential Eighth Amendment implications. <em>See Davis, </em>310 Md. 611, 530 A.2d 1223.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Twelve years later in 1994, the Legislature changed its earlier decision regarding daytime housebreaking by making both stylistic and substantive changes to the statutory laws governing burglary and related offenses, thereby decreasing the minimum mandatory penalties that recidivists, such as the petitioner, would face. <em>See </em>1994 Md. Laws, Chap. 712.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">.
