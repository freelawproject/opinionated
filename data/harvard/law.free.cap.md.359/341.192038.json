As this Court has reiterated many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>times, \u201cthe provisions of the ... Act reflect the legislative intent that citizens of the State of Maryland be accorded wide-ranging access to public information concerning the operation of their government.\u201d <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 81, 721 A.2d 196, 199 (1998), quoting <em>Fioretti v. State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 73, 716 A.2d 258, 262 (1998). The Act expressly provides that \u201call persons are entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.\u201d \u00a7 10-612(a). <em>See Office of State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, </em>356 Md. 118, 134, 737 A.2d 592, 601 (1999). In order to carry out this right of access, the Act is to be construed in favor of disclosure. <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-612(b). There are exceptions to this general rule of disclosure, however, as codified in \u00a7\u00a7 10-615 through 10-619 of the Act. These enumerated exemptions delineate certain types of records which are to be excluded from public inspection. Moreover, some of these exemptions include special provisions if the applicant is a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d defined as \u201ca person or governmental unit that is the subject of a public record or a designee of the person or governmental unit.\u201d \u00a7 10-611(e)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Paul Gallagher, the respondent, seeks access to records compiled by the petitioner, the Securities Division of the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s office. Mr. Gallagher and several other individuals were the focus of an investigation and administrative proceedings conducted by the Attorney General\u2019s office from October 1985 through June 1986, relating to Caucus Distributors, Inc., a publishing and fund-raising organization affiliated with Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr. <em>See Caucus Distributors, Inc. v. Maryland Securities Commissioner, </em>320 Md. 313, 316-323, 577 A.2d 783, 784-787 (1990). Based, in part, on the investigation conducted by the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s office, Mr. Gallagher was convicted, in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Roanoke County Circuit Court, of securities fraud and securities registration offenses. Mr. Gallagher is presently serving a thirty-four year sentence of imprisonment in Virginia, and, as he has exhausted his direct appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>he is now planning to file in Virginia a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Mr. Gallagher\u2019s attorney, anticipating that the records compiled by the Maryland Attorney General\u2019s office would \u201cbe useful to Mr. Gallagher\u2019s petition,\u201d requested the records, under the Maryland Public Information Act, by letter dated November 15, 1996. This request was actually a follow-up to a request made in 1990 by George Canning, another individual affiliated with Caucus Distributors, Inc. and Lyndon La-Rouche. This original request was granted in part and denied in part. Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Rowe disclosed approximately 230 documents to Mr. Canning, but withheld certain documents pursuant to enumerated exemptions under the Public Information Act. Mr. Gallagher\u2019s request, at issue in this appeal, sought all of the documents withheld by Ms. Rowe when they were first requested by Mr. Canning.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">When Mr. Gallagher\u2019s letter was received by the Securities Division of the Attorney General\u2019s office, Assistant Attorney General T. Webster Brenner retrieved the relevant files and reviewed the documents previously withheld by Ms. Rowe. In his response letter to Mr. Gallagher, he stated: \u201cUpon a careful review of the material, it appears [Ms. Rowe\u2019s] determination to deny access was in accordance with the mandatory and discretionary provisions of the Act. Nonetheless, I have reviewed each document and find that in the context of your current request some production is permissible.\u201d Mr. Webster then listed 58 documents that he was disclosing, copies of which were provided with the letter, and reiterated that the remaining documents were being withheld pursuant to the exemptions cited by Ms. Rowe (\u00a7\u00a7 10-615(1) and 10-618(f)), as well as \u00a7 10-617 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">After receiving Mr. Webster\u2019s letter, Mr. Gallagher filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the disclosure of the 82 documents which had been withheld by Mr. Brenner. The Circuit Court first ordered the Attorney General to submit a Vaughn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>index,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> then ordered an <em>in camera </em>review of the documents at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">After conducting the <em>in camera </em>inspection, the Circuit Court issued an order directing disclosure of all or part of 17 documents, upholding the non-disclosure of 34 documents based on exemptions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-618(b) and 10-618(f)(2)(v) of the Act, and noting that 31 of the documents had not been provided to the court. When those 31 documents were subsequently provided, the court ordered that all of them could be withheld based on \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-617, and/or 10-618.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Upon Mr. Gallagher\u2019s appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the judgment of the Circuit Court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The intermediate appellate court held that, because all the records at issue were part of an \u201cinvestigatory file,\u201d and because Mr. Gallagher was a \u201cperson in interest\u201d as defined in the Public Information Act, the only exemption applicable to the documents was \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2). <em>See Gallagher v. Attorney General, </em>127 Md.App. 572, 736 A.2d 350 (1999). Thus, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment insofar as it had applied \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) to authorize the non-disclosure of certain documents. The appellate court, however, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court insofar as that court had denied inspection based on other exemptions under the Act. The intermediate appellate court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to re-evaluate the documents, which had been withheld pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-617, and/or 10-618(b), in order to determine if \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) authorized the non-disclosure of those documents. Finally, the Court of Special Appeals directed that all \u201c[documents not exempt under ... \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) must be released\u201d to Mr. Gallagher. <em>Gallagher v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number><em>Attorney General, supra, </em>127 Md.App. at 586, 736 A.2d at 358. The Office of the Attorney General filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which this Court granted. <em>Attorney General v.

Permissible denials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>Unless otherwise provided by law, if a custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the public interest, the custodian may deny inspection by the applicant of that part, as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">\u201c(f) <em>Investigations. </em>(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a custodian may deny inspection of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(1) records of investigations conducted by the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, or a sheriff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">(ii) an investigatory file compiled for any other law enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">(iii) records that contain intelligence information or security procedures of the Attorney General, a State\u2019s Attorney, a city or county attorney, a police department, a State or local correctional facility, or a sheriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-13\">(2) A custodian may deny inspection by a person in interest only to the extent that the inspection would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-14\">(i) interfere with a valid and proper law enforcement proceeding; \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-15\">(ii) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>(iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">(iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">(v) disclose an investigative technique or procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">(vi) prejudice an investigation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">(vii) endanger the life or physical safety of an individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ2\">The parties do not dispute that the respondent is a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d nor do they dispute that the documents at issue are part of an \u201cinvestigatory file.\u201d The respondent argues, however, that when disclosure of an investigatory record would not produce any one of the seven results enumerated under \u00a7 10-618(0(2), the record <em>must </em>be disclosed to a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d irrespective of all other exemptions under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The other exemptions, found by the trial court to be applicable to some of the documents at issue, provide important justifications for non-disclosure. For example, \u00a7 10-615 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201c \u00a7 10-615 Required Denials\u2014In general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201cA custodian shall deny inspection of a public record or any part of a public record if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">(1) by law, the public record is privileged or confidential; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-13\">(2) the inspection would be contrary to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-14\">(i) a State statute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-15\">(ii) a federal statute or a regulation that is issued under the statute and has the force of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-16\">(iii) the rules adopted by the Court of Appeals; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-17\">(iv) an order of a court of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">The petitioner argued, and the Circuit Court held, that several documents were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615, as \u201cprivileged.\u201d They included documents embodying \u201cattorney mental impressions\u201d or attorney \u201cwork product.\u201d According to the respondent\u2019s argument and the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, privileged documents, including attorney work product, contained within an investigatory file, would have to be disclosed to a person in interest if none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the seven exemptions under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) were applicable. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding would allow litigants to have access to records in an investigatory file which disclose the \u201cmental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-402(c). Such records have not heretofore been discoverable pursuant to Rules 2-402(c) and 4-263(c). As this Court made clear in <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Co., </em>299 Md. 493, 510, 474 A.2d 880, 889 (1984), the Public Information Act \u201cwas not intended to be a device to enlarge the scope of discovery beyond that provided by the Maryland Rules.... \u201d On the contrary, the Act explicitly provides, in \u00a7 10-615, \u201cthat effect is to be given to court rules when to allow public inspection of public records would contravene those rules.\u201d <em>State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, supra, </em>356 Md. at 133, 737 A.2d at 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Moreover, if this Court were to adopt the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding in this case, \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) would also override the exemptions for \u201cconfidential commercial information\u201d (\u00a7 10\u2014617(d)(2)), \u201cconfidential financial information\u201d (\u00a7 10\u2014617(d)(3)), \u201cinformation about the finances of an individual\u201d (\u00a7 10\u2014617(f)), and \u201cinteragency or intra-agency letter[s] or memorand[a] that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the unit\u201d (\u00a7 10-618(b)). Nothing in the language or history of the Public Information Act supports the view that, when records are contained within an investigatory file, \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) displaces all other exemptions in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Court of Special Appeals partially relied upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Baltimore v. Maryland Committee Against Gun Ban, </em>329 Md. 78, 617 A.2d 1040 (1993), for its holding that the seven exemptions under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) provide the only legitimate bases under the Act for a custodian\u2019s refusal to disclose investigatory records to a person in interest. The intermediate appellate court stated that this Court\u2019s <em>Maryland Committee </em>opinion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201cnoted that under 10\u2014618(f)(2), a custodian could deny inspection by a \u2018 \u201cperson in interest\u201d \u2019 but \u2018 \u201conly to the extent that the inspection would\u201d produce one of the seven results enumerated in paragraph (f)(2).\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 82, 617 A.2d at 1040. The Court [of Appeals] emphasized that the seven exemptions enumerated in paragraph (f)(2) \u2018comprise the only justifications for withholding a police investigation report from a person in interest.\u2019 <em>Id.; See also Fioretti, supra.\u201d Gallagher v. Attorney General, supra, </em>127 Md.App. at 580, 736 A.2d at 355.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the <em>Maryland Committee </em>case, a political organization, which was not a \u201cperson in interest,\u201d sought records of a Baltimore City police investigation. The City argued that the records were exempt from disclosure under both \u00a7 10-618(b) and \u00a7 10\u2014618(f). Although the holding in <em>Maryland Committee </em>was based on \u00a7 10-618(f) alone, the issue, as framed by this Court, was the same as that before the trial court in the case at bar, specifically, \u201cwhether [the] records fall within <em>any </em>exclusion from the general rule of disclosure.\u201d <em>Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 81, 617 A.2d at 1041 (emphasis supplied). Contrary to the argument of the respondent and the holding of the Court of Special Appeals in the case at bar, this Court in <em>Maryland Committee </em>decided not to address the exemption under \u00a7 10-618(b) because there was \u201cno need\u201d to do so, as the exemptions in \u00a7 10\u2014618(f) were \u201cdispositive.\u201d 329 Md. at 81, 617 A.2d at 1041. Consequently, the language quoted by the Court of Special Appeals from <em>Maryland Committee </em>must be read in light of this Court\u2019s decision to consider only \u00a7 10\u2014618(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As the applicant in <em>Maryland Committee </em>was not a person in interest, the seven exemptions under \u00a7 10-618(f)(2) were not even at issue in that case. The holding was limited to \u00a7 10-618(0(1), which permits non-disclosure of \u201crecords of investigations conducted by ... a police department....\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 10-618(0(1)\u00a9- In the Court\u2019s analysis of subsection (0(1), however, its provisions were contrasted with those in subsection (0(2), in order to explain that an investigatory record could be withheld from a non-person in interest under (0(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>based on a range of public interest concerns including, but not limited to, those listed in (f)(2). Accordingly, the Court\u2019s statement that the seven exemptions under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2) \u201ccomprise the only justifications for withholding a police report from a person in interest,\u201d was made in an effort to juxtapose the custodian\u2019s more limited discretion under subsection (f)(2) with the broader grant of authority under subsection (f)(1). <em>Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 89, 617 A.2d at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In addition, the <em>Maryland Committee </em>opinion sought to contrast the breadth of permissible denials under subsection (f)(1) with those under (f)(2). The Court explained <em>(.Maryland Committee, </em>329 Md. at 96-97, 617 A.2d at 1049):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">\u201cUnder paragraph (2), inspection may be denied to the person in interest \u2018only to the extent\u2019 that the inspection would give rise to one of the seven enumerated circumstances. That statutory mandate requires analyzing the investigation file material in order to distinguish between that which reflects one or more of the enumerated circumstances and that which does not. In contrast, when the request to inspect is made by one other than a person in interest and paragraph (1) applies, the \u2018custodian may deny inspection of ... records of investigations conducted by ... a police department.\u2019 Permissible denial applies to the entire record, to the extent that inspection would be contrary to the public interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">This interpretation of the language in \u00a7 10-618(f)(2), permitting non-disclosure \u201conly to the extent\u201d that one of the seven exemptions applies, gives effect to the Act\u2019s explicit provision for severability of documents when feasible. The General Assembly mandated, in \u00a7 10-614(b)(3)(iii) of the Act, that a custodian should \u201cpermit inspection of any part of [a] record that is subject to inspection and is reasonably severable.\u201d The limiting language of subsection (f)(2) has consistently been interpreted by this Court as a limitation upon the custodian\u2019s authority to withhold an investigatory file in its entirety when claiming an exemption under that subsection. <em>See Fioretti v. Board of Dental Examiners, supra, </em>351 Md. at 86-87, 716 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>A.2d at 268-269. It has never been interpreted as a limitation on a custodian\u2019s ability to withhold documents within an investigatory file pursuant to other exemptions under the Act. When viewed in context, it is clear that this Court\u2019s language in <em>Maryland Committee </em>was not intended to affect a custodian\u2019s discretion beyond the scope of \u00a7 10\u2014618(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The \u201cperson in interest\u201d clause and its seven exemptions, presently set forth in \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)(2), were added to the Public Information Act by Chapter 1006 of the Acts of 1978. At that time, the exemption for investigatory records was codified in Code (1957, 1975 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Article 76A, \u00a7 3(b)(i). In fact, all of the exemptions at issue in this case were once codified in Article 76A, \u00a7 3. The exemptions presently set forth in \u00a7 10-615 were codified in \u00a7 3(a), the exemption for \u201cinteragency or intra-agency letter[s] or memo-rand[a]\u201d (\u00a7 10-618(b)) was codified in \u00a7 3(b)(v), and the exemptions for confidential commercial and financial information (\u00a7\u00a7 10-617(d)(2) and (3)) were codified in \u00a7 3(c)(v).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Contrary to the respondent\u2019s argument that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding \u201cproduced the exact result that the General Assembly intended when it enacted Maryland\u2019s Public Information Act\u201d (respondent\u2019s brief at 2), the explicit language of Article 76A, \u00a7 3, provided that its subsections were to be applied alternatively, and not to the exclusion of one another. Code (1957, 1975 Repl.Vol., 1978 Cum.Supp.), Article 76A, \u00a7 3, provided as follows (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">\u201c \u00a7 3. Custodian to allow inspection of public records; exceptions; denial of right of inspection of certain records; court order restricting disclosure of records ordinarily open to inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">\u201c(a) The custodian of any public records shall allow any person the right of inspection of such records or any portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>thereof <em>except on one or more of the following grounds or as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">(in) Such inspection is prohibited by rules promulgated by the Court of Appeals, or by the order of any court of record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">(iv) Such public records are privileged or confidential by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">\u201c(b) The custodian may deny the right of inspection of the following records or appropriate portions thereof, unless otherwise provided by law, if disclosure to the applicant would be contrary to the public interest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">(i) Records of investigations conducted by, or of intelligence information or security procedures of, any sheriff, county attorney, city attorney, State\u2019s attorney, the Attorney General, police department, or any investigatory files compiled for any other law-enforcement, judicial, correctional, or prosecution purposes, but the right of a person in interest to inspect the records may be denied only to the extent that the production of them would (A) interfere with valid and proper law-enforcement proceedings, (B) deprive another person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) disclose the identity of a confidential source, (E) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, (F) prejudice any investigation, or (G) endanger the life or physical safety of any person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">(v) Interagency or intraagency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201c(c) The custodian shall deny the right of inspection of the following records or any portion thereof, unless otherwise provided by law:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>(v) Trade secrets, information privileged by law, and confidential commercial, financial, geological, or geophysical data furnished or obtained by or obtained from any person;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The language of Article 76A, \u00a7 3, when the \u201cperson in interest\u201d clause was added, clearly stated that the enumerated exemptions did not override or supplant one another, but that a document was to be disclosed unless \u201cone or more\u201d of the exemptions under subsection (a), \u201cor\u201d under subsections (b), or (c) applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">When the State Government Article was enacted by Ch. 284 of the Acts of 1984, Article 76A, \u00a7 3, was \u201ctransferr[ed], without amendment\u201d to separate sections in the new Article. <em>See </em>II <em>Laws of Maryland 198k </em>at 981. There is no indication in the legislative history that the separate sections of Title 10, subtitle 6, of the State Government Article were to be interpreted differently from the separate subsections of former Article 76A, \u00a7 3. As pointed out above, the transfer was described in the Title of Ch. 284 as being \u201cwithout amendment.\u201d Moreover, the revisor\u2019s notes to new \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-617, and 10-618 stated that they were all \u201cderived without substantive change\u201d from Article 76A, \u00a7 3. <em>See </em>II <em>La,ws of Maryland 198k </em>at 1357-1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The language of the Act as it exists today provides further evidence that the interpretation by the Court of Special Appeals is contrary to the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Sections 10-615 and 10-617 are both mandatory provisions, meaning that when they are applicable to a particular record, the custodian <em>must </em>deny inspection of that record. This is made clear by the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in both provisions, which specifically state that \u201ca custodian shall deny inspection\u201d when one of the enumerated exemptions under those sections applies. Section 10-618, however, is a discretionary provision, stating that \u201cif a custodian believes that inspection of a part of a public record by the applicant would be contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>public interest, the custodian <em>may </em>deny inspection by the applicant of that part .... \u201d \u00a7 10-618(a)(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">As the petitioner correctly points out, the discretionary authority of the custodian under \u00a7 10-618 cannot arise if the record cannot be disclosed because of a mandatory provision in \u00a7\u00a7 10-615 or 10-617. Thus, if the intermediate appellate court\u2019s interpretation of the Act in this case were correct, a custodian would have the discretion under \u00a7 10-618 to disclose information privileged or confidential by law when contained within an investigatory file, even though non-disclosure of such records is mandatory under \u00a7 10-615. This would be an unreasonable interpretation of the Act. <em>See Kirwan v. The Diamondback, supra, </em>352 Md., at 83, 721 A.2d at 200, quoting <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195, 1196 (1985) (\u201cthe Court will \u2018reject a proposed statutory interpretation if its consequences are inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Our holding that \u00a7 10-618(f) does not override other exemptions under the Act is supported by the recent decision in <em>State Prosecutor v. Judicial Watch, supra, </em>356 Md. 118, 737 A.2d 592. The records at issue in <em>Judicial Watch </em>were part of a file compiled by the Office of the State Prosecutor in connection with a grand jury investigation. Although these records were, unquestionably, part of an \u201cinvestigatory file,\u201d this Court held that they were exempt from disclosure under \u00a7 10-615 of the Public Information Act because disclosure would have violated Maryland Rule 4-642 protecting the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. In <em>Judicial Watch, </em>as in the case at bar, the State also argued that the documents were properly withheld under \u00a7 10\u2014618(f). Rather than deciding the case on the basis of the investigatory file exemption alone, however, this Court first held that disclosure of the records would violate the \u201crules adopted by the Court of Appeals.\u201d 356 Md. at 130, 737 A.2d at 598. Thus, non-disclosure was mandated under \u00a7 10-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> In conclusion, as the language and legislative history of the Public Information Act make clear, if any exemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>under \u00a7\u00a7 10-615, 10-616, or 10-617 is applicable to a particular record, then it must be withheld. Moreover, if the record is exempt under the provisions of \u00a7 10-618, including \u00a7 10-618(f), then it may be withheld at the discretion of the custodian. The Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that a person in interest can avoid all other exemptions under the Act simply because he is seeking disclosure of an investigatory file pursuant to \u00a7 10\u2014618(f)-</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT TO DECIDE ISSUES RAISED BY THE PARTIES BUT NOT ADDRESSED BY THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.
