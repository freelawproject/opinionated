May a lawyer, who is being sued by a former client for malpractice, obtain contribution or indemnification from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>successor lawyer stemming from the successor\u2019s malpractice or negligent representation of the same client in the same matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\">II. May the first lawyer referred to above maintain such an action against the second lawyer when the former claims that the second lawyer negligently advised the client to settle the underlying case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We respond in the affirmative to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Our response to the certified questions begins with the following factual background supplied by the U.S. District Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">This case stems from the tortured morass which asbestos litigation has become.\" The Plaintiff in this case [before the District Court] is Royal Insurance Company of America (\u201cRoyal\u201d). Royal insured Salomon, Inc. Royal, as Salomon\u2019s insurer, hired Miles [ &amp; Stockbridge, P.C.] to defend Salo-mon in a lawsuit filed by Corinne Jerome in Baltimore City Circuit Court (the \u201cJerome litigation\u201d). (Jerome had previously filed suit against Salomon in New York.) Jerome initiated the Maryland suit to recover damages stemming from her husband\u2019s alleged exposure to asbestosis. Miles represented Salomon for a short time in the initial stages of the Jerome litigation. As will be discussed in more detail below, Royal eventually discharged Miles and retained Par-ler [ &amp; Wobber] to represent Salomon. By that point, a default had been lodged against Salomon in the Jerome litigation. Eventually, Royal, on the advice of Parler, decided to settle the Jerome litigation for approximately $1.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Royal is now suing Miles for malpractice, seeking over $1.6 million in damages (the \u201cRoyal litigation\u201d). Royal claims that it was forced to settle the Jerome litigation due to Miles\u2019 negligence in allowing a default judgment to be entered against it. Miles has answered and denies liability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>In addition, Miles has filed a third-party complaint against Parler, in essence seeking a contribution from it in case Miles is held to be liable to Parler [Royal]. Miles claims that Parler also acted negligently in its representation of Royal and either was the proximate cause of, or added to the extent of, the damages Royal suffered. Parler now argues in its motion to dismiss Miles\u2019 Third Party Com: plaint that it cannot be held liable, as a matter of law, to Miles in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\n<em>The Jerome Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">This case started with a run-of-the-mill asbestosis lawsuit. Apparently, Jerome originally initiated suit in New York. According to Parler, she decided also to file in Maryland because she was worried that she would have statute of limitations problems in New York. Accordingly, she filed suit in Baltimore City Circuit Court in the fall of 1997, naming Salomon as defendant. According to Parler, service was affected on Salomon through its resident agent. No answer was originally filed and an initial Default Order and Notice of Default was issued in December, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Salomon then notified Royal of the lawsuit. Royal in turn hired Miles to defend the case on behalf of Salomon. Miles filed a motion to vacate the Default Order, which was granted by the Baltimore City Circuit Court in January, 1998. Rather than responding to the Complaint at that point, Miles removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. (It is at this point that Miles\u2019 actions become the subject of the Royal litigation). Judge Blake, of this Court, remanded the case to the Baltimore City Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Apparently, Miles assumed that the removal proceeding would stay the Circuit Court\u2019s timely filing deadline for Salomon\u2019s Answer. It did not. Upon remand to the Circuit Court, Jerome filed a Motion to Enter a Default Judgment. Miles answered the Jerome Complaint the next day (well past the original date it was due following the vacation of the first Default Order). On May 8, 1998, the Baltimore City Circuit Court, Angelletti, J., granted Jerome\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>for Default Judgment. Miles unsuccessfully attempted to have that order reconsidered by Judge Angelletti, but he denied Salomon\u2019s motion to vacate his order in August, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Soon after this failure of reconsideration, Royal discharged Miles and retained Parler, which entered its appearance in the Circuit Court on September 28, 1998. Previously, Miles had failed to identify third party defendants (the list was due on September 21, 1998). Parler in turn failed to file any third party complaints before the deadline of October 5, 1998. The parties dispute whether Miles\u2019 failure to identify third party defendants would act as a bar to Parler actually filing third party complaints. Over the next several months, Parler attempted to have Jerome\u2019s suit dismissed, relying primarily on arguments that the dismissal of Jerome\u2019s New York suit on statute of limitations grounds should have <em>res judicata </em>effect in Maryland and that a release Jerome had previously signed absolved Salo-mon of any liability. These efforts, including a denied request for a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals of Maryland, were unsuccessful. According to Miles, Parler never specifically requested the Circuit Court to vacate its default order. Instead, Miles alleges, Parler erroneously conceded the binding effect of the Court\u2019s default judgement [sic]. While Salomon\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis of Jerome\u2019s release was pending, Royal, allegedly on the advice of Parler, settled with Jerome for $1.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\n<em>Malpractice Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Royal initiated this lawsuit by alleging malpractice by Miles. Specifically, it claims that Miles committed malpractice when it: 1) allowed a default judgment to be entered against Salomon in the Jerome litigation; and 2) failed to identify third party defendants before the September 21, 1998 deadline issued by the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Royal asserts that Miles\u2019 negligence proximately caused Royal to settle with Jerome for $1.6 million, despite Parler\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>efforts to avoid the effect of the default order. Royal has not sued Parler for malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Miles filed a third-party complaint against Parler. Miles alleges three specific acts of negligence in Parler\u2019s representation of Salomon: 1) it failed to argue either to the Circuit Court or on appeal (via the writ of mandamus) the appropriate liberal standard for the vacation of an entry of a default order before it becomes a final default judgment<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark>; 2) that Parler could have filed third-party complaints, but failed to do so, before October 5,1998; and 3) that Parler negligently advised Royal to settle the Jerome litigation far in excess of any reasonable settlement value. As a result of this negligent representation, Miles claims that it is entitled to contribution and/or indemnification from Parler for any liability it has towards Royal. (Miles also raises these issues as a defense to Royal\u2019s claim.)<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Under the Certified Questions of Law Act, this Court\u2019s statutorily prescribed role is to determine only questions of Maryland law, not questions of fact. <em>See Reed v. Campagnolo, </em>332 Md. 226, 228, 630 A.2d 1145, 1146 (1993); <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc. v. Joy, </em>283 Md. 205, 219, n. 7, 389 A.2d 874, 882 (1978); <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit and Trust Co. v. Purifoy, </em>280 Md. 46, 55, 371 A.2d 650, 655 (1977). For purposes of our analysis, we accept the facts as submitted by the certifying court. <em>See Reed, </em>332 Md. at 228, 630 A.2d at 1146; <em>Food Fair Stores, Inc., </em>283 Md. at 219, n. 7, 389 A.2d at 882. Furthermore, we confine our legal analysis and final determinations of Maryland law to the questions certified. <em>See Reed, </em>332 Md. at 228-29, 630 A.2d at 1146; <em>Toll v. Moreno, </em>284 Md. 425, 437, 397 A.2d 1009, 1015 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">We are presented with an issue of first impression in Maryland: when a client sues former counsel for professional malpractice, may that former counsel implead the client\u2019s successor counsel for contribution and indemnification where it alleges that successor counsel\u2019s professional negligence in the same matter contributed to the injury suffered by the client? We hold that such a claim may be maintained. In so holding, we must resolve two competing interests: the right for a joint tortfeasor to seek contribution or indemnification from an assertedly common liable party and the need to protect the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Miles argues that it has a statutory right to implead Parler for contribution or indemnification under the Maryland Uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>form Contribution Among Tort-Feasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d), Maryland Code Annotated (1974, 1998 RepLVol.), Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-1401, et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, which contains no express recognition of or exception for the attorney-client privilege issue, and attendant ethical implications, presented here. It asserts that the very purpose of UCATA is served by its impleader action because the statute \u201censures that the costs of injuries is distributed fairly among joint tort-feasors by allowing defendants an opportunity to assert a claim that the plaintiff for whatever reason has not asserted on his own. The plaintiff still may choose whom to name as a defendant, but the defendant may then seek contribution from those tortfeasors ignored by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Parler, in reply, argues that despite UCATA\u2019s provisions, for public policy reasons, it cannot be liable to Miles for contribution or indemnification in cases where the common client sues former counsel for malpractice, but not successor counsel. Parler asserts that an impleader action by former counsel against its successor would breach the attorney-client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>relationship by invading the successor attorney\u2019s duty of confidentiality owed to the client and the attorney-client privilege. In particular, \u201callowing such a claim would create a potential conflict between the interests of the client and the inherent self-protection instinct of the successor attorney.\u201d In essence, Parler warns that if this Court allows Miles\u2019 impleader action under UCATA, we will open Pandora\u2019s box by providing a third party with the right to interfere in the sacred attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In contrast, Miles stresses that successor counsel, if given immunity from such a suit, could abuse its position and insulate its conduct in cases where its negligent representation of the client contributes to or exacerbates the client\u2019s loss and that allowing a suit under UCATA only will further stimulate current counsel\u2019s duty to act diligently in its representation. Miles further requests that we adopt the legal notion that once a former client sues its former counsel, all privileges and immunities between those parties and between the client and successor counsel are waived in all matters relating to the malpractice suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">UCATA has deep historical underpinnings. At common law, Maryland generally recognized indemnification only in cases where a wrongful act of a party imposed liability on a third party; in such instances the latter could seek indemnification from the party actually guilty of the wrongful act. <em>See Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Howard County, </em>113 Md. 404, 414, 77 A. 930, 933 (1910). Among negligent joint tortfeasors, however, courts, lost in dogmatic ritual, stubbornly refused to recognize a common law right of contribution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Franklin v. Morrison, </em>350 Md. 144, 154, 711 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>A.2d 177, 182 (1998); <em>Montgomery County v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 190, 562 A.2d 1246, 1249 (1989) (discussing <em>Baltimore &amp; O.R. Co., </em>113 Md. at 414, 77 A. at 933). The seed for this prohibition was planted in the case of <em>Merryweather v. Nixon, </em>8 Term. Rep. 186, 101 Eng. Rep. 1337 (1799).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In <em>Merryweather, </em>the culpable parties collectively acted intentionally against, and caused harm to, the plaintiff, but one of the wrongdoing parties was prohibited from seeking recovery against the other. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 189, 562 A.2d at 1248. The reasoning underlying <em>Merryweather </em>was that no party who acted wrongfully and intentionally against the injured plaintiff should be able to recover anything as a result of that party\u2019s actions. <em>See id. </em>American courts, perhaps arbitrarily, if not illogically, extended <em>Merryweather </em>to bar negligent joint tortfeasor contribution actions. <em>See </em>3 Fowler V. Harper, et al., The Law of Torts \u00a7 10.2, at 40 (1986 and 1998 <em>Supp,)(\u201cMerryweather v. Nixon </em>involved deliberate and intentional acts by the tortfeasor and thus, as a precedent, does not support the broad proposition for which it is so frequently cited in the American cases\u201d). The application of Merryweather\u2019s reasoning to multiple negligent tortfeasor situations results in the following scenario:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">[W]hen the plaintiff enforced a joint and several judgment entirely against A, A was not allowed to recover contribution from B for any part of what he had paid. The result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>was that although both A and B were at fault, A paid all the damages and B paid none. The rule grew up in the day when joint and several liability applied only to tortfeasors who acted in concert to carry out intentional torts. In that setting, denial of contribution was equivalent to saying that an intentional tortfeasor cannot use the courts to enforce an equitable loss sharing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 386, at 1078 (2000). <em>Merry iveather\u2019s </em>extension to bar negligent joint tortfeasor contribution actions came under sharp attack from courts and commentators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">There is obvious lack of sense and justice in a rule which permits the entire burden of a loss, for which two defendants were equally, unintentionally responsible, to be shouldered onto one alone, according to the accident of a successful levy of execution, the existence of liability insurance, the plaintiffs whim or spite, or the plaintiffs collusion with the other wrongdoer, while the latter goes scot free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\"><em>Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 189, 562 A.2d at 1248 (citing Prosser and Keeton on Torts \u00a7 50, 337-38 (5th ed.1984)). <em>See also </em>1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:17, at 433 (1983 and 2000 Supp.). Another unjust effect of the <em>Merryweather </em>extension was that it permitted the plaintiff, at his or her whim, to determine who should bear the costs of damages. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 195, 562 A.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In Maryland, legislative action was taken to expunge the inherent injustices of the <em>Merryweather </em>rule as it applied to contribution claims between negligent tortfeasors. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 189-90, 562 A.2d at 1248-49; Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts \u00a7 386, at 1078 (2000); 1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:19, at 446-50 (1983 and 2000 Supp.). Through UCATA\u2019s enactment in 1941 \u201ca statutory right of contribution among joint tortfeasors was created which did not exist at common law.\u201d <em>Central GMC, Inc. v. Helms, </em>303 Md. 266, 276, 492 A.2d 1313, 1318 (1985). <em>See also Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 190, 562 A.2d at 1248-49. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Furthermore, the unfairness of allowing a plaintiff the power to pick and choose whom to sue for damages was alleviated by providing the defendant with the right to implead a responsible third party to share in the liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This \u201cdistribute[s] the burden of responsibility equitably among those who are jointly liable.\u201d <em>Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 189-90, 562 A.2d at 1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Under UCATA, joint tortfeasors are defined as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-1401(c). <em>See also Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 191, 562 A.2d at 1249; <em>Central CMC, Inc., </em>303 Md. at 276, 492 A.2d at 1318. We have held that, in situations where only one potential defendant is sued by a plaintiff, that defendant\u2019s right to contribution from a third party is predicated on the impleaded party\u2019s direct liability to the plaintiff. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 193, 562 A.2d at 1250. This means that as between a defendant and an impleaded party, there must be common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>liability in tort to an injured person. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 192, 562 A.2d at 1249; 1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:21, at 455 (1983, 2000 Supp.). Courts and commentators have been careful to note a distinction between common liability and joint negligence. \u201cContribution rests on common liability, not on joint negligence or joint tort. Common liability exists when two or more actors are liable to an injured party for the same damages, even though their liability may rest on different grounds.\u201d <em>Pautz v. Cal-Ros, Inc., </em>340 N.W.2d 338, 339 (Minn.1983). <em>See also </em>1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:21, at 455-56 (1983, 2000 Supp.). In this sense, contribution is derivative in nature rather than a new cause of action. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 192, 562 A.2d at 1249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Because common liability requires no concerted negligence, the tortious conduct among joint tortfeasors leading to a plaintiffs harm may be concurrent. <em>See Trieschman v. Eaton, </em>224 Md. 111, 115, 166 A.2d 892, 894 (1961). It has been noted aptly that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">this requirement of common liability does not necessarily restrict the right to recover contribution to such cases as those in which the liability is imposed for some <em>single </em>act of tortious commission or omission in which all the tortfeasors concerned joined. This aspect usually arises in negligence cases. For a right to contribution to exist among tortfea-sors guilty of negligence, it is not ordinarily essential that there be joint negligence in the sense that all the wrongdoers fail in the performance of an identical duty; contribution may be had among independent tortfeasors whose combined negligence, or whose omission of separate acts of care at the same instant, concur and contribute to the same injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:21, at 456-57 (1983, 2000 Supp.)(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">It is from this statutory cause of action, and its historical underpinnings, that Parler wishes to carve an exception that it perceives will avert a threat to the attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Confidentiality is a core value in the attorney-client relationship. The duty of confidentiality of information is enshrined in the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cRPC\u201d). Rule 1.6(a) states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).\u201d The reasoning behind this confidentiality is explained by the RPC 1.6 Comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">The observance of the ethical obligation of a lawyer to hold inviolate confidential information of the client not only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper representation of the client but also encourages people to seek early legal assistance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">Almost without exception, clients come to lawyers in order to determine what their rights are and what is, in the maze of laws and regulations, deemed to be legal and correct. The common law recognizes that the client\u2019s confidences must be protected from disclosure. Based upon experience, lawyers know that almost all clients follow the advice given, and the law is upheld.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">A fundamental principle in the client-lawyer relationship is that the lawyer maintain confidentiality of information relating to the representation. The client is thereby encouraged to communicate fully and frankly with the lawyer even as-to embarrassing or legally damaging subject matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">The principle of confidentiality is given effect in two related bodies of law, the attorney-client privilege (which includes the work product doctrine) in the law of evidence and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-9\"><em>See also 2 </em>Ronald E. Mallen and Jeffery M. Smith, Legal Malpractice \u00a7 14.5, at 242 (4th ed.1996); <em>Noble v. Bruce, </em>349 Md. 730, 758, 709 A.2d 1264, 1278 (1998)(confidentiality' blocks interference with an attorney\u2019s duty of loyalty to a client, avoids situations that compromise an attorney\u2019s ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>zealously advocate on behalf of a client, and prevents forced attorney disclosures of confidences that the client may not have wanted revealed).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">There are notable exceptions under RPC 1.6(b), however, which make the rule of confidentiality not absolute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm or in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-7\">(2) to rectify the consequences of a client\u2019s criminal or fraudulent act in the furtherance of which the lawyer\u2019s services were used;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">(3) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, or to establish a defense to a criminal charge, civil claim, or disciplinary complaint against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved or to respond to allegations in any proceedings concerning the lawyer\u2019s representation of the client[;or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">(4) to comply with these Rules, a court order or other law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">There is a critical distinction, not acknowledged clearly by Parler, between confidentiality required by ethical rules and the evidentiary basis of the attorney-client privilege. More protection is provided to communications within the attorney-client relationship under one than the other. The confidentiality umbrella of the ethical rule encompasses \u201call situations <em>except </em>where the \u2018evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. 1, 5, 602 A.2d 1220, 1222 (1992)(citing RPC 1.6 Comment)(emphasis in opinion). \u201cIn the latter situation, only the attorney-client privilege, not the broader rule of confidentiality, protects against disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, relevant evidence sought through discovery, unless protected by the attorney-client privilege, must be produced and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ethical duty of confidence takes a back seat to the quest for truth. Stated differently, the search for truth is paramount to just disposition of cases in controversy and Maryland\u2019s broad discovery rules take precedent over the attorney\u2019s ethical duty of confidentiality unless protected by law. <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

Generally, the attorney-client privilege bars compelled disclosure, without the client\u2019s consent, of attorney-client communications made in confidence between the attorney and client. <em>See In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. at 5, 602 A.2d at 1221-22; <em>State v.

It is codified in Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Repl.VoL), Courts and Judicial Proceeding Article \u00a7 9-108, which provides that \u201c[a] person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d The privilege is grounded in the public policy of encouraging a client to consult freely with and seek legal advice from an attorney without fear of the attorney being forced to testify or produce evidence as to the confidences in various judicial or other proceedings. <em>See In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. at 5, 602 A.2d at 1221-22; <em>Pratt, </em>284 Md. at 520, 398 A.2d at 423; <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 134, 345 A.2d at 837.

These courts refuse to recognize a direct action in negligence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or third party action in contribution or indemnification for fear of the adverse impact such an action would have on the attorney-client relationship. A myriad of concerns have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>voiced by these courts. Some feared that the duty of loyalty would be split between client and former counsel if the duty of care was owed to each, <em>see Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, </em>156 Cal.Rptr. at 330-31; <em>Olds, </em>696 A.2d at 643; <em>Housley, </em>599 P.2d at 1254, or that successor counsel might feel compelled to act in its self-interest, rather than the client\u2019s interest, in order to avoid a third party action, <em>see Holland, </em>245 Cal.Rptr. at 251-52; <em>Waldman, </em>544 A.2d at 693. The <em>Holland </em>court noted as well that successor counsel might be discouraged from taking a case where it might be sued or, after the taking the case, may feel it necessary to no longer participate in the client\u2019s litigation. <em>See </em>245 Cal.Rptr. at 250-51. The result would be that the client is deprived of the attorney of choice or may be left with great difficulty in finding a competent replacement. <em>See id. </em>Foreseeing all of these problems, the <em>Holland </em>court warned that a third party complaint by former counsel would be used as an ill-motivated tactical device to confuse, disorient, and spread chaos in the opponent\u2019s camp. <em>See </em>245 Cal.Rptr. at 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">On the other side of the coin, two appellate Illinois courts have allowed a former attorney to implead a successor attorney when the client only sues the former attorney but both attorneys contributed to the client\u2019s injury.

Glieberman, </em>276 Ill.App.3d 590, 213 Ill.Dec. 426, 659 N.E.2d 56, 61 (1st 1995), the court explained that under Illinois law \u201can attorney may seek contribution from a subsequent attorney where both attorneys worked on the same underlying cause.\u201d (discussing <em>Faier v. Ambrose &amp; Cushing, P.C., </em>154 Ill.2d 384, 182 Ill.Dec. 12, 609 N.E.2d 315 (1993)). The court rejected the contention that continued representation of the client was not grounds to dismiss former counsel\u2019s suit against the successor attorney. Under this premise, said the court, \u201csubstitute counsel, no matter how egregious their conduct, would be immunized from suit simply because the client whom they continue to represent chooses not to sue her current counsel.\u201d <em>Goran, </em>213 Ill.Dec. 426, 659 N.E.2d at 61. <em>Accord Brown-Seydel v.

In <em>Maddocks v.

The plaintiffs [as clients] are probably correct that Casson could not be directly liable to the defendant attorneys [as former attorneys for the client] for his negligence in handling the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Gove. That fact is irrelevant, however, because, as we read the third-party complaint, the defendant attorneys\u2019 claim against Casson is founded on Casson\u2019s obligation of contribution if it is determined that the plaintiffs lost their claims against Gove because both the defendants and Casson were negligent. Further, in considering another issue collateral to the underlying dispute, we see no valid basis for argument that, as a matter of law on the face of the pleadings, the alleged negligence of the defendants and of Casson did not result in joint liability for the same injury to the plaintiffs, thus justifying contribution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">When Lawyer II brings an action for malpractice on behalf of a client against Lawyer I, Lawyer II is not immunized from liability to Lawyer I for contribution if the negligence of each caused the same injury to the client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az9a\">403 Mass. 592, 531 N.E.2d 583, 589 (1988) (citations omitted). Nonetheless, in allowing former counsel to implead client-plaintiffs current counsel for contribution, the Court expressed concerns that the attorney-client privilege and legal ethical considerations were at risk in such actions and that practical judicial measures must be taken to balance the contribution right against the attorney-client privilege. The Court cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">A decision to add a plaintiffs lawyer as a third-party defendant has significant consequences to the client because the client must lose the attorney of his choice or must await <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>a decision as to whether his current attorney (Lawyer II) might be liable for contribution. The decision ... to allow a third-party complaint (or the decision not to dismiss such a complaint filed of right ... ) requires careful and prompt judicial attention. If the merits of the claim for contribution can be addressed and ruled on immediately, the question whether a plaintiff needs new counsel should be answered at an early stage in the case. The judge should be alert to the possibility that Lawyer I is using the cross-complaint as a tactical device to disqualify Lawyer II. At the same time, Lawyer II should not be entitled to use his continued representation of the client to immunize himself from the consequences of his own negligent conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">We conclude, on the issues open for consideration in this appeal, that Casson may not properly represent the plaintiffs and at the same time be a third-party defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKBA\"><em>Maddocks, </em>581 N.E.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In <em>Schauer v.

The Court rejected the successor attorney\u2019s argument that there was no contractual privity or duties between former and successor attorneys in the case and, therefore, it owned no contribution to the defendant. The Court held that existence of a duty between the wrongdoer attorneys was not a necessary predicate for the former attorney to sue the successor. <em>See Schauer, </em>444 N.Y.S.2d 564, 429 N.E.2d at 84. <em>See also Rosner v.

[H]ere we are concerned with more than one attorney\u2019s alleged negligence to the same client. Thus, the policy protecting an attorney\u2019s zealous representation of a client is not defeated by allowing a claim for contribution or indemnity by one attorney against another for alleged negligence in the representation of the same client. Instead, allowing such claims promotes that policy by assuring that any attorney who negligently represents a client may be held liable. To allow a client to sue one attorney where two or more attorneys may be responsible for the client\u2019s damages, and not allow contribution among all negligent attorneys, defeats the purpose of contribution among joint tortfeasors\u2014assuring that the responsible parties pay their share of damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">Furthermore, although the Minnesota cases are not controlling, there is a legitimate concern with protecting attorney-client confidentiality. By suing attorney \u201cA,\u201d the client waives his or her right to confidentiality. However, this waiver does not apply to the client\u2019s attorney \u201cB\u201d who is joined by \u201cA\u201d for purposes of contribution. This joinder may present evidentiary problems for attorney \u201cA\u201d at trial, but it does not defeat his right to sue for contribution or indemnity.

In <em>Pappas, </em>the former attorney sued his client for unpaid attorney\u2019s fees in a particular case. <em>See id. </em>at 32-33. The client counter-claimed malpractice against the former attorney relating to the same matter. <em>See id. </em>The client had been represented by several different counsel throughout the litigation, however, and former counsel sought to implead the attorneys who had represented the client in an effort to show that he was not responsible, or only partially responsible, for the client\u2019s loss. <em>See id. </em>at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The Court in <em>Pappas </em>balanced the interests of the client\u2019s attorney-client privilege against the interests of former counsel in mounting an adequate defense to the claim of malpractice.

Plaintiff argued the attorney-client privilege did not cover the communications, or, in the alternative, that defendants waived the privilege by asserting their good faith affirmative defense. <em>Hearn, </em>at 580. In holding defendants were required to disclose the communications, the trial court concluded that where the following three conditions are satisfied, an implied waiver of the attorney-client privilege should be found: (1) assertion of the privilege was the result of some affirmative act, such as filing suit, by the asserting party; (2) through this affirmative act, the asserting party put the protected information at issue by making it relevant to the case; and (3) application of the privilege would have denied the opposing party access to information vital to his defense. <em>Hearn, </em>at 581.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">* <em>* % </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-5\">...

While we too are concerned with protecting the attorney-client privilege and the attorney-client relationship, this Court is reluctant to exempt a potential joint tortfeasor from accepting the blame for its negligent actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">We are aware that Maryland has created exceptions to UCATA, in an immunity context, for certain third parties despite that party\u2019s culpable conduct. <em>See Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 353, 550 A.2d 947, 954 (1988)(dis-cussing immunities granted over the years such as interspousal immunity, workers\u2019 compensation immunity, and parent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>child immunity). Under such circumstances, when immunity is recognized, no right to contribution or indemnification exists because the third party has no common liability to the plaintiff. <em>See Hatzinicolas, </em>314 Md. at 353, 550 A.2d at 954. \u201cContribution is not available where an immunity exists between the third party and the original plaintiff, because the immune party cannot be held liable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>See </em>1 Lee Lindahl, Modern Tort Law: Liability and Litigation \u00a7 20.20, at 707 (1994). It has been further noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgX\">Instances are not uncommon when one of the tortfeasors has at the time of the tort a personal defense against the injured person that negates the possibility of personal legal liability and thus makes common liability a logical impossibility. In that situation it has been the traditional view that the person compelled to discharge the liability cannot recover contribution from the other, whose participation in the tort gave the injured party no cause of action against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At0\">3 Fowler V. Harper, et al., The Law of Torts \u00a7 10.2, at 47-50 (1986, 1998 Supp.). Like the attorney-client privilege, the immunities previously recognized as applying to UCATA actions were grounded on public policy concerns. For example, in <em>Hatzinicolas, </em>we noted that the parent-child immunity \u201cis founded upon public policy, and is designed to preserve peace and harmony of the home, as well as to recognize the authority of the parent, under normal conditions, responsible for the maintenance of the home.\u201d 314 Md. at 356, 550 A.2d at 955 (citing <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 550, 505 A.2d 826, 830 (1986))(other citations and internal quotations omitted). The interspousal immunity was based on the premise that to allow suits between spouses would adversely affect familial ties and strike at the heart of domestic relations. <em>See Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 253-57, 462 A.2d 506, 511-13 (1983)(discussing the rationale behind the immunity and the states that refused to abrogate it).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Nonetheless, the historical underpinnings of UCATA, notably its purpose in remedying the injustices of the common law rule barring joint tortfeasors\u2019 actions in negligence, are not easily swept aside or forgotten by this Court. In <em>Valk Mfg. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number><em>Co., </em>we expressed a reluctance for carving out exceptions from UCATA. <em>See </em>317 Md. at 196, 562 A.2d at 1251. We noted also that immunities are on the wane. <em>See id., </em>1 Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:21, at 458 (1983, 2000 Supp.). <em>See also </em>Hatzinicolas, 314 Md. at 353-54, 550 A.2d at 953-54 (refusing to extend the parent-child immunity to defendant). This Court and many of our sister states have either eliminated or chipped away at them by narrowing their application to avoid inequities. <em>See Boblitz, </em>296 Md. at 274-75, 462 A.2d at 522 (abrogating interspousal immunity); <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 67-68, 77 A.2d 923, 926 (1951)(narrowing parent-child immunity\u2019s application by allowing a minor child to sue parent under cruel and inhuman treatment or malicious and wanton wrong theories); Stuart M. Speiser, et al., The American Law of Torts \u00a7 3:22, at 458-59 (1983, 2000 Supp.)(citing to several states that have allowed contribution despite immunities under the theory that \u201cas between the two tortfeasors, the contribution is not a recovery for the tort, but the enforcement of an equitable duty to share liability for the wrong done\u201d) (citations omitted). It has been further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-4\">[i]n a growing number of jurisdictions ... the policies in favor of contribution have been deemed to outweigh those in favor of the immunity of the actors who have a personal defense to the injured person\u2019s claim. Thus contribution has in such jurisdictions been permitted against otherwise immune spouses and other relatives, as well as employers who would not be liable in tort to an injured employee because of the exclusive remedy provision of the applicable workers\u2019 compensation act. If the purpose of contribution is to make the wrongdoers share the financial burden of their wrong, then the primary element of contribution should be the participation of the wrongdoers in acts or omissions that are considered tortious and that result in injury to a third person. The fact that one of the tortfea-sors has a personal defense if he were to be sued by the injured party would seem to be irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>3 Fowler V. Harper, et al., The Law of Torts \u00a7 10.2, at 47-50 (1986, 1998 Supp.). \u201cAnd just as courts have become increasingly reluctant to bar a plaintiffs cause of action, so are they reluctant to bar contribution among unintentional wrongdoers.\u201d <em>Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 196, 562 A.2d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Importantly, this Court also has held that attorneys who act negligently in settlement proceedings should be held accountable to the client for their actions. <em>See Thomas v. Bethea, </em>351 Md. 513, 528-30, 718 A.2d 1187, 1194-96 (1998). <em>Thomas </em>acknowledged that settlement proceedings are an integral part of a litigating attorney\u2019s representation and that most cases end in settlement without adjudication. <em>See </em>351 Md. at 529, 718 A.2d at 1195. \u201cThere can be little doubt that clients routinely anticipate that their cases will be settled and that they rely heavily on their lawyer\u2019s recommendation regarding settlement, expecting that the lawyer has a sufficient understanding of the relevant facts, law, and prospects to make an intelligent recommendation.\u201d 351 Md. at 529, 718 A.2d at 1195. In imposing the duty of reasonable care in settlement proceedings, <em>Thomas </em>reiterated the long-held rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACC\">\u201c[Ejvery client employing an attorney has a right to the exercise, on the part of the attorney, of ordinary care and diligence in the execution of the business intrusted to him, and to a fair average degree of professional skill and knowledge; and if the attorney has not as much of these qualities as he ought to possess, and which, by holding himself out for employment he impliedly represents himself as possessing, or if, having them, he has neglected to employ them, the law makes him responsible for the loss or damage which has accrued to his client from their deficiency or failure of application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">351 Md. at 530, 718 A.2d at 1195 (citing <em>Cochrane v. Little, </em>71 Md. 323, 332, 18 A. 698, 701 (1889)).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Prohibiting a joint tortfeasor action in this case would open an undesirable loophole in <em>Thomas </em>and circumvent UCATA\u2019s purpose. A central premise of <em>Thomas </em>and UCATA is that a party should be held accountable for damages caused by his or her negligence. Successor counsel could escape from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>accountability by forcing former counsel to shoulder the burden of loss to the client in situations where both attorneys may have brought about the client\u2019s injury. The unfair and unjust outcome for former counsel would be reminiscent of the pre-UCATA era. We think the better public policy approach is for the parties to lay their cards on the table for the fact-finder to determine the facts and allocate the loss to the proper parties, rather than granting successor counsel a shield of immunity for its alleged wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">We respect the public policy concerns voiced by our sister states that prohibit former counsel from suing successor counsel. Many of their concerns, however, cut both ways. Prohibiting an impleader action in such cases also may undermine the attorney-client relationship. For example, the <em>Holland </em>court voiced concern that allowing former counsel to sue successor counsel would forge an irresponsible weapon of intimidation. <em>See </em>245 Cal.Rptr. at 250. By the same token, we can envision, given successor counsel\u2019s position of trust with and influence over the client, that a bar to an impleader action could create a situation ripe for successor attorney mischief and manipulation. It would hardly be in the client\u2019s best interest to be represented by counsel that was negligent in causing an injury to the client, but who failed to disclose the negligence to the client or take responsibility for the action. This dominant position leaves us uneasy accepting the notion that successor counsel should be left to its potential self-dealing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, Appellants\u2019 argument that their ethical duty of confidentiality is infringed by the tortfeasor action is misplaced. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the confidentiality duty, unless exempted by law, must succumb to discovery and the search for truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Moreover, we do not lack faith in the disciplinary tools in the Maryland Rules, and particularly the Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), that deter the filing of frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>and harassing claims. They represent potential consequences to discourage an improper impleader action. They address, for example, the <em>Holland </em>court\u2019s concerns, such as the availability for monetary sanctions, at the state and federal<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> levels, against attorneys that fall prey to the temptation of harassing an opponent. Maryland Rule 1-341 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">Rule 1-341. Bad faith\u2014Unjustified proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\u201cRule 1-341 sanctions are judicially guided missiles pointed at those who proceed in the courts without any colorable right to do so.\u201d <em>Legal Aid Bureau, Inc. v. Bishop\u2019s Garth Assoc. Ltd. Partnership, </em>75 Md.App. 214, 224, 540 A.2d 1175, 1180 (1988). Furthermore, violation of RPC 3.1,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which prohibits the filing of frivolous suits, is grounds for attorney discipline and can lead to disbarment. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 283-85, 725 A.2d 1069, 1074-75 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 635, 709 A.2d 1212, 1217-18 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Sharing Parler\u2019s concern for protecting the attorney-client privilege, we reject Miles\u2019 assertion that the attorney-client privilege is waived automatically between the client <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>and successor counsel simply by the client suing former counsel. Because the concepts and reasoning behind the three prongs in the <em>Hearn </em>Test, as discussed in <em>Pappas, </em>are well-established in Maryland, we think the <em>Hearn </em>Test<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> serves as an appropriate tool in balancing Miles\u2019 statutory right to contribution under UCATA and Parler\u2019s concern in protecting the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">The burden of showing waiver of the privilege rests with Miles. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>350 Md. at 567, 714 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>A.2d at 195. Once the first prong of the <em>Hearn </em>Test is met by the client filing suit or asserting a claim against former counsel, the second prong of the <em>Hearn </em>Test is met by the client injecting a crucial issue relevant to disposition of the suit. <em>See Mountain States Tel. and Tel. Co., </em>780 P.2d at 544; <em>League v. Vanice, </em>221 Neb. 34, 374 N.W.2d 849, 856 (1985). As discussed <em>supra, </em>Maryland recognizes issue injection as a valid precursor to waiving client-held, confidential communication privileges. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>350 Md. at 565, 714 A.2d at 194 (implied waiver in accountant-client privilege context); <em>Thomas, </em>325 Md. at 174, 599 A.2d at 1177-78 (implied waiver when client challenge\u2019s attorney\u2019s effectiveness in counsel); <em>Fraidin, </em>93 Md.App. at 229, 611 A.2d at 1076 (\u201c[ujnder the self-defense exception, counsel is permitted to reveal client confidence to the extent necessary to defend counsel from charges of wrongdoing\u201d). <em>See also Southern California Gas Co., </em>265 Cal.Rptr. 801, 784 P.2d at 1380 (calling it \u201cdeliberate injection\u201d of the issue); <em>Lorenz, </em>815 F.2d at 1098 (\u201cholder must inject a new factual or legal issue into the case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Under the third prong (vitality), the privileged information must be necessary to defend against an essential element of the claim. <em>See Hearn, </em>68 F.R.D. at 581; <em>Goldsmith v. State, </em>337 Md. 112, 134-35, 651 A.2d 866, 877 (1995)(the information sought must be necessary for a proper defense to pierce the psychotherapist-patient privilege); <em>Fraidin, </em>93 Md.App. at 229, 611 A.2d at 1076 (waiver must be narrowly construed and should be \u201climited strictly to information necessary to the attorney\u2019s defense\u201d). Mere relevance or helpfulness of the information sought is not enough to pierce a professional-client privilege. <em>See Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>350 Md. at 567, 714 A.2d at 195 (accountant-client privilege); <em>Goldsmith, </em>337 Md. at 133, 651 A.2d at 876 (psychotherapist-patient privilege). <em>Accord Frontier Refining, Inc. v.

In other words, \u201c[w]hen the sought-after evidence is only one of several forms of indirect evidence about an issue, the privilege has not been waived.\u201d <em>Amlani, </em>169 F.3d at 1195 (citations and internal quotations omitted). This implies that the privileged information sought must be available from no other source. <em>See Frontier Refining, Inc., </em>136 F.3d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"A__\"><em>Hearn, </em>explains further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\">In an ordinary case the obstruction [to investigating the truth] is not likely to be great, for attorney-client communications are usually incidental to the lawsuit, notwithstanding their possible relevance, and other means of proof are normally available. In this case, however, the content of defendant\u2019s [sic] communications with their attorney is inextricably merged with the elements of plaintiffs case and defendants\u2019 affirmative defense. These communications are not incidental to the case; they inhere in the controversy itself, and to deny access to them would preclude the court from a fair and just determination of the issues. To allow assertion of the privilege in this manner would pervert its essential purpose and transform it into a potential tool for concealment ... behind a veil of confidentiality. Under these circumstances, the benefit to be gained from disclosure far outweighs the resulting injury to the attorney-client relationship. The privilege should not apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">68 F.R.D. at 582. <em>Accord Greater Newburyport Clamshell Alliance, </em>838 F.2d at 20 (\u201cthe privilege ends at the point where the defendant can show that the plaintiffs civil claim, and the probable defenses thereto, are enmeshed in important evidence that will unavailable to the defendant if the privilege prevails\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The remaining question is whether former counsel may sue successor counsel, via impleader, under the theory that successor counsel was negligent in settlement proceedings that may have ultimately contributed to the client\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>damages for which former counsel has been sued. We hold such a suit is cognizable in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">As discussed <em>supra, </em>UCATA defines joint tortfeasors as \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d CJP \u00a7 3-1401(c). This definition requires the defendant impleading a third party to allege that the third party was directly liable to the plaintiff and somehow is jointly liable with the defendant for the same injury to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Attorney negligence in settlement proceedings is proven the same as any other negligence. <em>See Thomas, </em>351 Md. at 529, 718 A.2d at 1195 (rejecting a heightened standard of negligence for attorneys). Here, in a contribution action, Miles would need to prove Parler\u2019s neglect of a reasonable duty owed to Royal\u2019s insured, that breach of the duty proximately caused injury to Royal\u2019s insured, and that Parler\u2019s negligence contributed, with Miles\u2019 negligence, to causing the same injury, wholly or in part, to Royal\u2019s insured. <em>See Thomas, </em>351 Md. at 528-29, 718 A.2d at 1195; <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 128, 492 A.2d 618, 624 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">We reiterate here that which was stated in <em>Thomas, </em>that \u201clawyers [should] not be regarded as negligent simply because another lawyer, or even most lawyers, with the benefit of hindsight, would not have made the recommendation at issue.\u201d 351 Md. at 529, 718 A.2d at 1195. The reason is that \u201cthe factors that the lawyer must consider in developing a settlement recommendation, as well as the recommendation itself, \u2018are mostly subjective in nature,\u2019 and that there can legitimately exist \u2018a range for honest differences of opinion in making settlement recommendations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Mere disagreement between lawyers regarding how to settle a case is common and a difference in opinion cannot be grounds for negligence. When the duty to exercise reasonable care in settlement proceedings is challenged, the alleged negligence must be determined in light of traditional professional negligence standards. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>CERTIFIED QUESTIONS OF LAW ANSWERED AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

In a footnote addressing this particular issue, the District Court elaborated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">This is Miles\u2019 principal claim, so it deserves additional explanation. Miles contends in its complaint and its response to Parler\u2019s Motion To Dismiss that Parler could have had the default order vacated by arguing the correct legal standard (as Miles interprets it) for vacation of a default order to the Circuit Court. Parler, Miles alleges, essentially conceded the default judgment in its two subsequent motions for summary judgment, a critical error on Parler\u2019s part. Had Parler simply argued the correct (liberal) standard for vacating default orders, a default judgment would not have been entered and there would have been no reason for Salomon to settle with Jerome, especially since the paper Jerome signed in the related New York litigation would have acted as a complete bar to recovery in the Maryland litigation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">4. The District Court stated in a footnote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">As noted above, all of the parties apparently agree that Jerome did in fact execute a release which would have been dispositive of her suit against Solomon [sic]. It is not clear when the release came to the attention of any of the present parties\u2014Royal, Miles or Parler. In any event, the fact that this procedural nightmare could have occurred, costing somebody $1.6 million to settle a case which should have been barred, is symptomatic of the problems with modern day mass tort litigation. In this case, Ms. Jerome apparently initiated several lawsuits against several defendants in different states. The courts in one state did not know what the courts in another state were doing, or how resolution in one state would affect the suit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>other state. Unfortunately, the parties did not help resolve the situation. This matter was made worse when alleged procedural mistakes blossomed into case-ending judgments not based on merits. Simply pul, our system of adjudication is not up to the task of justly, efficiently or effectively handling mass tort litigation where the number of plaintiffs and defendants is enormous and there are no reliable ways to determine which defendant is or is not liable for the specific injuries of which plaintiff. The system is broken, as this litigation proves, but apparently because everyone is vested in it, no one is trying hard to fix it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b764-5\">.

In traditional terms, the apportionment of loss between multiple tortfeasors has been thought to present a question of contribution; indemnity, by contrast, has traditionally been viewed as concerned solely with whether a loss should be entirely shifted from one tortfeasor to another, rather than whether the loss should be shared between the two. Competent judicial authority has noted that the dichotomy between the concepts of contribution and indemnity \"is more formal than substantive.\u201d The common goal of both doctrines is the equitable distribution of loss among multiple tortfeasors. Contribution, says the unanimous Washington court of last resort, \"is a remedial scheme which operates exclusively between or among tort-feasors. It has no effect upon the <em>injured party's initial right to recover from the multiple tort-feasors.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">1 Stuart M.

Procedurally, UCATA originally recognized an impleader action of third parties in common liability with a defendant, but that provision has since been removed from UCATA and is now regulated by Maryland Rule 2-332. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. at 191, 562 A.2d at 1249. \"The goals of the procedural device, however, remain the same.

Bullinger, </em>350 Md. 452, 473, 713 A.2d 962, 972 (1998). We noted the importance of impleading as \"an outgrowth of what was found to be a defect in the common law. There were frequent cases where it was necessary to give relief to a defendant when he [or she] had a genuine claim for exoneration against some person not a party to the suit.\u201d <em>Northwestern Nat.

In addition to public policy considerations, some of these courts decided that because no duty was owed or no privity existed between former counsel and successor counsel, former counsel could not maintain an action against successor counsel. <em>See e.g., Olds, </em>696 A.2d at 643-44 (no reinstatement of third-party complaint dismissed by trial court because successor attorney owed no duty of care to predecessor attorney); <em>Housley, </em>599 P.2d at 1253 (former attorney not entitled to relief from successor attorney because no duty was owed to former attorney); <em>Mentzer &amp; Rhey, Inc., </em>532 A.2d at 486-87 (no cause of action by former attorney against successor attorney because absent privity, successor attorney could not be held liable to anyone except the client). Appellants, however, do not cite to these cases for this proposition. As discussed <em>supra, </em>UCATA does not require the existence of a duly owed or privity between the two joint tortfeasors, rather the duty of care is owed to the plaintiff in common liability. Furthermore, we are not presented with the issue of whether a duty of care exists between former counsel and successor counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\">.
