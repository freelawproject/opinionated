The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>127 Md.App. 255, 732 A.2d 912 (1999), applied the rule found in a number of federal court decisions that allows a trial court in some circumstances to disregard as a \u201csham\u201d an affidavit in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. As explained below, we do not adopt the sham affidavit rule. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Terran Pittman (Terran) was born December 18, 1990. From birth until 1996 Terran lived with his mother, Shari Hall (Hall), and his grandmother, Gladys Hall, principally at 1805 Harlem Avenue in Baltimore City. In November 1992 Terran first tested positive for elevated lead levels in his blood. Hall testified on deposition that the Harlem Avenue property contained chipping paint. That property was owned by the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC), a co-defendant below which was voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Sometime in 1992, due to a disagreement with her mother, Hall and Terran left the Harlem Avenue premises and stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>nearby with a family friend, Rita Porter (Porter), at 1908 Lauretta Avenue in Baltimore City (the subject premises). At some undetermined time in 1993, Hall and Terran returned to Harlem Avenue and resided again with Gladys Hall. Both before and after residing with Porter, Hall and Terran visited Porter at the subject premises. These premises were owned by Atlantic Realty Company and managed by Northern Brokerage Co., defendants below and respondents in this Court (Respondents).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">A lead paint violation notice was issued to Atlantic Realty Company for the subject premises on August 12, 1993. Hall testified on deposition that the subject premises contained paint chips and that she frequently saw Terran put them in his mouth. Terran continued to test positive for moderate to high lead levels between December 1993 and November 1995. He had his first normal-range reading in January 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">In June 1994 Terran and his mother (Petitioners) instituted the present action, joining the Respondents and alleging that Terran had been injured due to exposure to lead in the paint at the subject premises. Petitioners prayed for a jury trial. In March 1995 the Circuit Court for Baltimore City entered a scheduling order requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>that all discovery be completed by March 22, 1996, that \u201c[a]ny supplementation of discovery or continuation of deposition shall be concluded no later than\u201d March 18, 1998, and that \u201c[a]ll depositions of experts shall be completed no later than March 18, 1998.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Av6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>During the discovery period, Respondents attempted to learn how long Hall and Terran resided at the subject premises and how often they visited the subject premises both before and after residing there. The variance between the information furnished by Petitioners in discovery and the affidavits submitted in opposition to Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment concerns the amount of time that Terran spent at the subject premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">A. Answers to Interrogatories</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In reply to Respondents\u2019 interrogatory seeking the addresses and dates where Hall and Terran resided, she answered: \u201c1908 Lauretta Avenue 1992-1993.\u201d The periods for Hall\u2019s previous and subsequent residence at Harlem Avenue, with her mother, were listed respectively as 1990-1992 and 1993-1996. In a separate answer, Hall stated that she \u201cmoved into [the subject premises] with ... Porter approximately spring/summer of 1992.\u201d In reply to an interrogatory concerning day care, propounded by HABC, Hall responded that Terran \u201cwas cared for at [the subject premises] by Rita Porter, during the hours of 8:00 a.m. through 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.\u201d The period during which this arrangement was in effect was not stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">B. Hall\u2019s Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">At her deposition taken on February 27, 1997, Hall\u2019s answers concerning how long she and Terran resided with Porter at the subject premises, and how often she visited there with Terran, were vague, confused, and inconsistent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In brief, Hall testified that she and Terran lived at the subject premises for the following periods, defined by different mea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>sures of time, and presented here in the order of her testimony: \u201c[a]bout a month\u201d; \u201c[a]bout two weeks. Two months I mean\u201d; \u201c[f]or about two months\u201d; for a time \u201cin the fall, probably\u201d; for a time beginning when her son \u201cwas two ... [o]r getting ready to turn two. It was somewhere around that area\u201d; for a time ending \u201cclose to a holiday because I had to buy [Terran] an outfit.... It might have been Easter or the Fourth of July. I\u2019m trying to think. Because it was spring when I was around there. Easter is in the spring, right? Right\u201d; for a time beginning \u201cbefore [Terran\u2019s] birthday [in December 1992]\u201d; for a time comprising \u201cJanuary, February [1993], because it wasn\u2019t too bad outside\u201d; \u201c[a]bout two months\u201d; \u201cabout two months, because I know how many times I gave [Porter] some money for rent money.\u201d Finally, in response to the question whether \u201ctwo months is the maximum that you lived with [Porter],\u201d Hall answered, \u201cRight, yes.\u201d \u201c[T]wo months\u201d is Hall\u2019s predominant and, arguably, final answer. One also can infer from this testimony, however, that she resided at the subject premises from December 1992, when her son turned two years old, until Easter 1993, or approximately four months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">With respect to visiting the subject premises from the time Terran was born until he was four years old, as contrasted with residing there, Hall testified as follows: \u201chere and there, [Porter] baby-s[a]t [Terran]\u201d; \u201c[Porter] lived right around the corner from us, so I would stop in there quite often.... [P]robably like twice out of a week or something like that, out of a month, who knows. I\u2019d just drop in, you know.\u201d Hall said that Porter never babysat Terran \u201con a regular basis.\u201d In addition, Hall testified that, when she moved back to Harlem Avenue, she and Terran visited the subject premises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201c[a]bout three or four times a week\u201d; \u201c[wjhenever [Gladys Hall] had something to drink ... [which was] constantly\u201d; at any time of day, whether \u201c[e]vening, mornings, didn\u2019t matter\u201d; for \u201ctwo hours, three hours, maybe an hour [at a time]\u201d; that she \u201cnever stopped going to see [Porter, just] because I moved back with my mom. I still go to see her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">In sum, with respect to Terran\u2019s exposure to lead paint while visiting at Porter\u2019s, the evidence most favorable to the Petitioners is that he visited the subject premises twice a week before residing there and three to four times a week for up to three hours at a time after residing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">C. Deposition of Dr. Klein</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Howard Klein, M.D. (Dr. Klein), Petitioners\u2019 expert on the causal relation between Terran\u2019s exposure to lead paint and lead paint poisoning, was deposed by the defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Initially, Petitioners\u2019 counsel referred Dr. Klein to Hall\u2019s answers to interrogatories, including the answer that Hall and Terran resided at the subject premises between 1992 and 1993, that they moved there in the spring/summer of 1992, and that Terran was cared for by Porter at the subject premises \u201cduring the hours of 8:00 a.m. through 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday\u201d with dates unspecified. When asked whether, based on this information, he had an opinion \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical probability, as to whether or not Terran Pittman was exposed to lead-based paint at [the subject premises],\u201d Dr. Klein testified that \u201cif that information is correct, he was [exposed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Later, Respondents\u2019 counsel redirected Dr. Klein\u2019s attention to both Hall\u2019s deposition and answers to interrogatories, ask<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ing for the basis of his opinion that \u201ca major contributor to ... this young boy\u2019s problems, [was] from lead exposure at [the subject premises].\u201d Dr. Klein replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201cWell, one of the problems is that although I have a Baltimore City Health Department inspection record of [the subject premises] and we know that he continued to have elevated levels well past \u201993, it\u2019s basically the answer to interrogatories that talks about the child being there. I mean I don\u2019t have any other, as I mentioned to you in previous questioning, I don\u2019t have any other source for that information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">When defense counsel, assuming two months to be the longest period of residence stated in Hall\u2019s deposition, asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201c[Terran\u2019s] there for two months, that\u2019s the worst case scenario, according to her answers, two months. Do you really believe that you can say, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that his problems, a major contributor of his problems, is the lead at [the subject premises], where he could have stayed approximately two months?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Dr. Klein replied: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely.\u201d Finally, redirecting Dr. Klein to Hall\u2019s interrogatory answers, defense counsel initiated the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cQ ... [T]he answer I\u2019m reading to [Dr. Klein] is that, \u2018Other than 1805 Harlem Avenue, the minor plaintiff was cared for at [the subject premises] by Rita Porter during the hours of 8 am through 4 pm, Monday through Friday.\u2019 Does that have any significance to you without some sort of date or time frame or context? Was that one week? Was it in 1995? Do you have any idea when that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\u201cA That\u2019s why I can\u2019t give you medical probability and that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that it\u2019s unlikely that this was a major contributor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201cQ Even based on these responses [to the interrogatories], though, too, isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-11\">\u201cA That\u2019s why I answered as I answered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">In sum, Dr. Klein acknowledged on deposition that, without any time frame, he could not state with a reasonable degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>medical probability that lead exposure at the subject premises was a \u201cmajor contributor\u201d to Terran\u2019s injuries. Dr. Klein was able to opine, however, that a two months residence was an insufficient period of exposure to be a substantial factor in causing Terran\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">D. Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On April 20, 1998, Respondents moved for summary judgment, citing those portions of Dr. Klein\u2019s deposition in which he stated that it would be difficult to render an opinion as to substantial factor causation, and that such causation was \u201cunlikely\u201d based on two months residence at the subject premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In response, Petitioners filed their answers to interrogatories and the entire depositions of Hall, Gladys Hall, and Dr. Klein. In addition Petitioners produced new affidavits from each of those three witnesses. These affidavits were signed on May 7, 1998, and filed the next day in court, more than one year after Hall\u2019s deposition and almost two months past the scheduling order\u2019s deadline for concluding all supplementation of discovery and all expert discovery. Gladys Hall swore in her affidavit that her daughter and grandson moved from Harlem Avenue \u201c[i]n approximately the spring or summer of 1992,\u201d and resided at the subject premises \u201cuntil December of 1992.\u201d She thereby tripled or quadrupled the \u201ccouple of months\u201d to which she had testified on deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">In Hall\u2019s affidavit, she swore in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">\u201c3. From the time Terran Pittman was born until 1994,1 constantly visited my friend Rita Porter at her residence, [the subject premises]. I would visit this residence on an every day basis from approximately 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon until approximately 9:00\u201410:00 p.m. in the evening. During these visits Terran Pittman would always be with me at [the subject premises].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">\u201c4. Occasionally, I would go to another location, however, I would leave Terran Pittman with Rita Porter for her to baby-sit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u201c5. In the spring or summer of 1992,1 was in a disagreement with my mother, Gladys Hall. Terran Pittman and I moved out of her residence at 1805 Harlem Avenue and moved in with Rita Porter at [the subject premises]. We stayed at this address for approximately five and one-half months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\">\u201c6. Terran Pittman and I moved back into 1805 Harlem Avenue with my mother in approximately December 1992. We still spent every day visiting at [the subject premises] for approximately eight hours every day. We did this until Rita Porter moved from [the subject premises] in 1994.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Furnished with a then stationary factual platform of five and one-half months residence, plus over three years of visiting \u201con an every day basis\u201d for seven to eight hours a day, Dr. Klein, expressly assuming the truth of the new affidavits, opined in his May 7 affidavit that exposure at the subject premises was a substantial causal factor in Terraris lead poisoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Respondents moved to strike these affidavits. They contended that Hall\u2019s new affidavit contradicted her deposition testimony of a maximum residence of two months duration. If one looks at other deposition answers by Hall, the new affidavit also shifts the residence period from December 1992 through Easter 1998 to spring/summer 1992 through December 1992. The new Hall affidavit also contradicts Hall\u2019s deposition testimony that she would \u201cjust drop in\u201d on Porter twice a week before residing with her and three to four times a week for up to three hours at a time after residing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Neither the Hall nor the Gladys Hall affidavits presented any explanation for the variances from the prior evidence given by the respective witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">E. Circuit Court Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The circuit court granted the motions to strike and for summary judgment. The court reasoned that statements in the affidavits of Hall and Gladys Hall constituted \u201csignificant changes\u201d that \u201ccontradict[ed] testimony [Hall] presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>deposition,\u201d and that \u201cthe process of discovery can become subverted ... if by the mere presentation of an affidavit constructed more than a year after the presentation of deposition testimony, a witness can so dramatically alter her evidence.\u201d Without the new affidavits, the Respondents were entitled to summary judgment on the ground that Petitioners could not meet their burden of showing that exposure to lead paint at the subject premises was a substantial causal factor in Terran\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">F. Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. It characterized the affidavits as \u201ccontain[ing] information which contradicted both the previously elicited interrogatory answers of Terran\u2019s mother and her deposition testimony,\u201d as \u201clengthening] the child\u2019s period of residence at [the subject premises] to 5-1/2 months,\u201d and as \u201cuntimely filed\u201d because submitted \u201cnearly two months [after] the deadline for the completion of discovery.\u201d <em>Pittman, </em>127 Md.App. at 265-66, 732 A.2d at 917. The court noted that \u201c[i]f Ms. Hall had erroneously stated the periods of residence, visits, and baby-sitting in her deposition, she had ample opportunity to amend her answers, to clarify these dates, and to provide this information to [Respondents].\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 268-69, 732 A.2d at 919. Thus, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>affirmed the exclusion of the affidavits on the ground of \u201cunfair surprise.\u201d The court also adopted a rule of federal caselaw (the sham affidavit rule) according to which \u201ca party-may not defeat summary judgment by offering an affidavit which contradicts unambiguous testimony previously elicited during a deposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 732 A.2d at 918 (citing <em>Darnell v. Target Stores, </em>16 F.3d 174, 176-77 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Barwick v. Celotex Corp., </em>736 F.2d 946, 959-60 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Van T. Junkins &amp; </em>Assocs. <em>v. U.S. Indus., Inc., </em>736 F.2d 656, 657-59 (11th Cir.1984)). The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment because, without the affidavits, Petitioners could not meet their burden of establishing \u201cthe necessary element of \u2018substantial causation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 732 A.2d at 920. We granted certiorari in order to determine whether to adopt the federal rule. <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>356 Md. 495, 740 A.2d 613 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">. Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In this Court the Petitioners argue that the federal decisions applied by the Court of Special Appeals are contrary to Maryland law because they violate the rule prohibiting a court from deciding on summary judgment issues involving the credibility of witnesses that are for resolution by the fact-finder at trial (the credibility rule). <em>See Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 332, 413 A.2d 170, 185 (1980). Petitioners further submit that Maryland Rule 2-501 (\u201cMotion for summary judgment\u201d) gives them the right to file an affidavit in opposition to a summary judgment motion. Alternatively, Petitioners assert that the new affidavits merely supplement and clarify the prior discovery. On the other hand, Respondents urge that we adopt the federal rule, asserting that it is consistent with summary judgment procedure, that deposition testimony is inherently more reliable than affidavits, and that the sham affidavit rule preserves the integrity of scheduling orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Both parties argue that adoption of the position of the other will encourage deceptive practices in discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The text of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 (\u201cSummary Judgment\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not definitively address how a trial court should treat an affidavit, submitted in response to a motion for summary judgment, that contradicts prior deposition testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This issue was first addressed explicitly by judicial decision in <em>Perma Research &amp; Development Co. v. Singer Co., </em>410 F.2d 572 (2d Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In that case Perma sued Singer alleging that Singer had entered a contract to perform certain product assembly services for Perma with no intention to perform and that Perma therefore was entitled to recision. <em>Id. </em>at 578-74. On deposition, Perma\u2019s president, Perrino, could provide no particularized evidence of Singer\u2019s fraud and admitted that the parties had been working together to solve the problems in the product until Singer ceased performing. <em>Id. </em>at 576. Singer moved for summary judgment based on Perrino\u2019s deposition, and, in opposition, Perrino submitted an affidavit in which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>swore that one of Singer\u2019s agents told him that \u201c \u2018Singer never had any intention of performing\u2019 \u201d the subject contract. <em>Id. </em>at 577. The court noted that this allegation \u201ccontradict[ed]\u201d statements made in the depositions, including, for example, Perrino\u2019s assertion that there was \u201c \u2018no way of me knowing exactly what [Singer\u2019s] intention was at the time they said it\u2019 \u201d and his admission \u201cthat there had been substantial performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Although it noted authority for the contrary position,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Second Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the defendant because, \u201c[w]hile [the affidavit] would appear to raise a triable issue as to fraudulent intent, we think that [the district court judge] could properly conclude that the statement made in the affidavit was less reliable than the contradictory statements in the deposition, and that it did not raise a triable issue of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Pointing out that Perrino was a party to the conversation alleged in the affidavit and so could not \u201ccomplain of non-access to material facts,\u201d and that the contradiction between the deposition and affidavit could not be explained by the acquisition of newly discovered evidence, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">\u201cIf a party who has been examined at length on deposition could raise an issue of fact simply by submitting an affidavit contradicting his own prior testimony, this would greatly diminish the utility of summary judgment as a procedure for screening out sham issues of fact. Compare <em>Engl v. Aetna Life Insurance Co., </em>139 F.2d 469 (2d Cir.1943), where [the trial court] observed that a party who resists summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>judgment cannot hold back his evidence until the time of trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 578 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Stated strictly, the <em>Perma </em>rule is that, if an interested party has personal knowledge of the relevant facts, and if that party cannot explain a material contradiction between deposition testimony and a subsequent affidavit by the acquisition of newly acquired evidence, then a trial court may disregard the affidavit as a \u201csham,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>as one failing to \u201craise[ ] any issue which [the trial court] can call genuine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Perma </em>court advanced three rationales for this rule: (1) a trial court may evaluate deposition testimony as more reliable than an affidavit because the former is subject to cross-examination; (2) a trial court may disregard a contradictory affidavit because otherwise the utility of the summary judgment procedure, as a process for screening out sham claims, always could be defeated; (3) it is unfair to allow a party to generate an issue of material fact by means of \u201cinconsistent statements made by [that party] the deponent and [that party] the affiant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Respectively these justifications may be referred to as the reliability, utility, and fairness rationales.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The Second Circuit\u2019s <em>Perma </em>rule has been adopted by most other circuits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Some later cases have refined the rule by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>specifying more precisely the circumstances under which a federal district court properly may disregard or strike a nonmoving party\u2019s contradictory affidavit. For example, in <em>Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 703 (3d Cir.1988), the plaintiff sued the manufacturer of Bendectin alleging that birth defects had been caused by ingesting this anti-nausea drug. During the discovery period, the manufacturer attempted to establish the precise time at which the plaintiff began to take the drug, on the theory that only during a certain \u201ccritical period\u201d could a defect develop. As the appellate court characterized this theory, which the plaintiff never disputed, \u201ca defendant in a particular case may be able to demonstrate the absence of proximate cause by establishing the date of conception, the date of first ingestion, the type or types of birth defects, and the critical period of development for the affected organ or organs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 704. In her answers to interrogatories, plaintiff stated that she first filled a prescription for Bendectin on May 19, 1966, also the date of her visit to the doctor who prescribed the drug. On deposition, plaintiff testified that she began to experience nausea her second month of pregnancy and that she had not tried anything herself at home to alleviate the nausea before seeking medical treatment. When defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that the May 19 date was after the critical period for the birth defects at issue, so that the drug could not have caused them, plaintiff submitted an affidavit in which she stated that she had taken Bendectin, left over from a prior pregnancy, from about the eleventh day after her pregnancy began, well before she sought medical treatment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>May 19. Plaintiff also filed an expert affidavit stating that, if she took Bendectin from the time alleged in her new affidavit, then the drug increased the risk of birth defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Affirming the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and disregard of this affidavit, the Third Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">\u201cWe recognize that there are situations in which sworn testimony can quite properly be corrected by a subsequent affidavit. Where the witness was confused at the earlier deposition or for some other reason misspoke, the subsequent correcting or clarifying affidavit may be sufficient to create a material dispute of fact. The case before us, however, does not present such a situation. The date of [plaintiffs] first ingestion of Bendectin, a fact of considerable importance, was the subject of repeated questioning. Plaintiffs affidavit, submitted only after she faced almost certain defeat in summary judgment, flatly contradicted no less than eight of her prior sworn statements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">\u201cMoreover, no explanation was offered in the affidavit for the contradictions. As a result, we conclude that it was permissible for the district court to disregard the affidavit for purposes of determining whether there was a material dispute of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">\u201c... When, as in the present case, the affiant was carefully questioned on the issue, had access to the relevant information at that time, and provided no satisfactory explanation for the later contradiction, the courts of appeals are in agreement that the subsequent affidavit does not create a <em>genuine </em>issue of material fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 705-06 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Wright and Miller summarize the caselaw under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">\u201cAlthough some courts have ruled that conflicts between depositions and later-filed affidavits present questions of credibility, precluding summary judgment, several courts have suggested that summary judgment may be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>under those circumstances, or that the affidavit may be disregarded or stricken as sham.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">10A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 2726, at 448-50 (3d ed.1998) (footnotes omitted). Those authors then present the following evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">\u201cThese decisions should not be interpreted too broadly, however. It seems quite clearly correct to conclude that an interested witness who has given clear answers to unambiguous questions cannot create a conflict and resist summary judgment with an affidavit that is clearly contradictory, without providing a satisfactory explanation of why the testimony is changed. If such an explanation is proffered, a credibility question is presented; without it, there are no facts suggesting why a credibility question exists and the nonmoving party should not be allowed to manufacture a question of fact to delay resolution of the suit. This conclusion may be challenged on the ground that the judge in disregarding the affidavit effectively is making a decision to disbelieve that ex parte testimony and that the judge\u2019s role on summary judgment is not to weigh or evaluate the evidence, but merely to rule on whether there is evidence to go to the jury. However, insofar as the courts always have agreed that credibility issues prevent summary judgment only when there are facts suggesting why credibility is at issue, it seems consistent with this approach to require the nonmoving party to do more than simply interpose an ex parte conflicting statement with the threat that false-swearing may lead to perjury charges and to present facts showing why this later assertion should be taken seriously. On the other hand, if the witness\u2019 answers in the deposition are not that clear or the questions are not that unambiguous, a later-filed affidavit may indeed create a genuine issue by supplying additional facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 452-53 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Before addressing the sham affidavit issue, we address Respondents\u2019 argument that Petitioners violated the schedul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ing order and its discovery cutoff by altering their position from that stated in discovery when they were faced with a motion for summary judgment. Here, as provided under Maryland Rule 2-504, the scheduling order fixed \u201ca date by which all dispositive motions must be filed,\u201d Rule 2-504(b)(1)(E), and that date was after the date \u201cby which all discovery must be completed.\u201d Rule 2-504(b)(l)(D). Rule 2-504\u2019s sequencing contemplates that the facts will be developed during discovery and that, based on that discovery record, the court will be able to determine whether a trial is necessary if a party seeks summary judgment. The summary judgment rule, however, expressly authorizes the filing of an affidavit in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Rule 2-501(b). Rule 2-504 does not, and the scheduling order in this case could not, deprive Petitioners of that right under Rule 2-501(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, if an affidavit in opposition to a motion for summary judgment may be stricken on the ground that its factual content contradicts the affiant\u2019s deposition testimony, a court\u2019s authorization to do so seemingly must be found under Rule 2-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The sham affidavit rule is contrary to the way in which this Court\u2019s rule on summary judgment traditionally has been applied, because, in application, the sham affidavit rule requires a credibility judgment by the trial court. The federal cases find support for making a credibility judgment in the requirement for a grant of summary judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56 that there be no \u201cgenuine\u201d issue of material fact. For example, courts that have adopted the sham affidavit rule have said that \u201c[t]he very object of summary judgment is to separate real and genuine issues from those that are formal or pretended, so that only the former may subject the moving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>party to the burden of trial.\u201d <em>Radobenko v. Automated Equip. Corp., </em>520 F.2d 540, 544 (9th Cir.1975). <em>See also Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire Corp., </em>719 F.2d 1361, 1365 (8th Cir.1983) (characterizing asserted facts as \u201cnot genuine\u201d because \u201cthe circumstances in this case do not suggest legitimate reasons for [the nonmoving party\u2019s] filing of the inconsistent affidavit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">An attempt to narrow the operation of the sham affidavit rule is found in <em>Tippens v. Celotex Corp., </em>805 F.2d 949 (11th Cir.1986), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">\u201cThe purpose of summary judgment is to separate real, genuine issues from those which are formal or pretended. To allow every failure of memory or variation in a witness\u2019s testimony to be disregarded as a sham would require far too much from lay witnesses and would deprive the trier of fact of the traditional opportunity to determine which point in time and with which words the witness (in this case, the affiant) was stating the truth. Variations in a witness\u2019s testimony and any failure of memory throughout the course of discovery create an issue of credibility as to which part of the testimony should be given the greatest weight if credited at all. Issues concerning the credibility of witnesses and weight of the evidence are questions of fact which require resolution by the trier of fact. An affidavit may only be disregarded as a sham \u201cwhen a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact ... [and that party attempts] thereafter [to] create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 953-54 (quoting <em>Van T. Junkins &amp; Assocs., </em>736 F.2d at 657).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">This attempt to constrict the scope of the sham affidavit rule nevertheless requires a court to make credibility determinations. For example, earlier that year, the Eleventh Circuit, in reversing a grant of summary judgment under its rule in <em>Van T. Junkins &amp; </em>Assocs., reasoned in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u201cHere there is little chance of sham factual issues. [The affiant] is a disinterested witness and it is our view that any inconsistency in his testimony is more likely the result of his faulty memory than a predisposition to lie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><em>Lane v. Celotex Corp., </em>782 F.2d 1526, 1580-31 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">In distinguishing between a sham affidavit that may be disregarded and a correcting or clarifying affidavit that should be considered, the opinion in <em>Martin, </em>851 F.2d 703, reflects that the following factors came into play: (1) whether an explanation is offered for the statements in the affidavit that contradict prior sworn statements; (2) the importance to the litigation of the fact about which there is a contradiction; (3) the frequency and carefulness of questions posed at deposition concerning this fact; (4) whether the nonmovant had access to this fact at or prior to the deposition; (5) the frequency and degree of variation between statements on deposition and statements made in the affidavit concerning this fact; (6) whether the deposition testimony indicates that the witness was confused at the time; (7) when, in relation to summary judgment, the affidavit is submitted. Factors identified by other courts include: (1) \u201cwhether the affiant was cross-examined during his earlier testimony,\u201d <em>Franks v. Nimmo, </em>796 F.2d 1230, 1237 (10th Cir.1986); (2) whether the party \u201cread the deposition, made several changes to correct inaccuracies and a possible misinterpretation,\u201d but did not include in these changes the contradictory assertion presented in the affidavit, <em>Miller v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>766 F.2d 1102, 1105 (7th Cir.1985); (3) whether \u201cthe affidavit assertion was ... plausible.\u201d <em>Camfield Tires, Inc., </em>719 F.2d at 1365. These factors are the points that would be raised at trial on cross-examination of the nonmovant-deponent-witness and would be argued by the movant to the trier of fact as reasons to disbelieve the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Maryland law, on the other hand, has not viewed the function of summary, judgment to be determining whether an issue is genuine based on credibility. A summary judgment procedure was first adopted in Maryland on November 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>1947, as \u00a7 IV of the Law and Equity Rules of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1939, 1947 Cum.Supp.) at 2044. The explanatory notes of the Reporter to the Rules Committee at that time described the purpose of the summary judgment rule in these terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">\u201cThe court does not, of course attempt to decide any issue of fact or of credibility, but only whether such issues exist. If the affidavits or other evidence show a genuine conflict, the court must deny the motion. Thus, the proposed procedure is not a substitute for a trial, but only a hearing to decide whether a trial is necessary. But the party opposing the motion must show by <em>facts </em>that there is a real dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADj\"><em>Id. </em>at 2114.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Judge Hammond, writing for the Court in <em>Frush v. Brooks, </em>204 Md. 315, 321, 104 A.2d 624, 626 (1954), quoted the above explanation, and this Court has reiterated that purpose consistently thereafter. <em>See White v. Friel, </em>210 Md. 274, 285-86, 123 A.2d 303, 308 (1956); <em>Tellez v. Canton R.R. Co., </em>212 Md. 423, 431, 129 A.2d 809, 813 (1957); <em>Howard Cleaners of Baltimore, Inc. v. Perman, </em>227 Md. 291, 295-96, 176 A.2d 235, 237 (1961); <em>Wolfe v. Lamar &amp; Wallace, Inc., </em>261 Md. 174, 178, 274 A.2d 121, 123 (1971). More recently, in <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 206, 680 A.2d 1067, 1077-78 (1996), we said of the court\u2019s role in deciding a motion for summary judgment that \u201cin keeping -with Maryland law, the trial judge is not allowed to weigh evidence,\u201d citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202, 212 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The test under Maryland law for determining whether no triable issue of fact is presented on summary judgment is highly analogous to whether a motion for judgment should be granted in a case tried to a jury. <em>See Berkey, </em>287 Md. at 305, 413 A.2d at 171; <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 232, 401 A.2d 1013, 1021 (1979); <em>Porter v. General Boiler Casing Co., </em>284 Md. 402, 413, 396 A.2d 1090, 1096 (1979); <em>Salisbury Beauty Sch. v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 41, 300 A.2d 367, 374 (1973). Thus, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>for a nonmoving plaintiff to prevent the entry of summary judgment on grounds of factual conflict, \u201cthere must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>830 Md. 726, 739, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993). Phrased another way, the evidence presented by the nonmovant must be such as \u201cwould allow a reasonable fact-finder to conclude\u201d that, in actuality, the facts were those most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Chesapeake Pub. Corp. v. Williams, </em>339 Md. 285, 299, 661 A.2d 1169, 1176 (1995). <em>See also Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Richard F.

These consist of claims and defenses that \u2018rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them,\u2019 \u00e1nd they are no rarity in federal courts. For more than a century, our legal system has provided that a factual question will not reach a jury \u2018merely because some evidence has been introduced by the party having the burden of proof, unless the evidence be of such character that it would warrant the jury in finding a verdict in favor of that party.\u2019 The judge cannot discharge that responsibility unless he is willing, when necessary, to reject even the sworn claims of an eyewitness that are literally incredible\u2014even on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">J.J. Duane, <em>The Four Greatest Myths About Summary Judgment, 52 </em>Wash. &amp; Lee L.Rev. 1523, 1581-82 (1995) (footnotes omitted) (quoting, respectively, <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 1733, 118 L.Ed.2d 340, 350 (1992); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. at 251, 106 S.Ct. at 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d at 213).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">If the test stated above is satisfied, a Maryland court is presently authorized to disregard the otherwise admissible content of an affidavit in opposition to a motion for summary judgment. Application of that test to the contradictions and inconsistencies between Hall\u2019s deposition testimony and affidavit results in a reversal of summary judgment for the Respondents. A court, reading this paper trail, without seeing or hearing Hall and without the benefit of forming a firsthand impression as to her degree of intelligence, cannot conclude that a rational jury would reject as incredible the facts stated in Hall\u2019s affidavit. Reasonable persons, based on their real life experiences, may not be persuaded that Hall\u2019s failure to be consistent in dealing with the length of periods of time and when they began means that the testimony most favorable to the Petitioners cannot be believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">With due respect to our colleagues in the federal courts, we decline to change present Maryland law and adopt the sham affidavit rule. In addition to its inconsistency with present Maryland law, such a change in the summary judgment rule would impact other aspects of Maryland law. Further, there are ways, other than by striking the affidavit, in which the trial courts can deal with that which they firmly believe to be a sham affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Unlike Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(e), Maryland Rule 2-415(d) limits corrections by the deponent of a deposition to those that allegedly conform the transcript to the testimony. The Maryland rule does not expressly allow changes of substance. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra. </em>That rule seems to contemplate that any change in the deponent\u2019s testimony ordinarily will be made on the record for the first time at trial, where the deponent-witness can be cross-examined before the trier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>fact concerning the inconsistency.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At trial, when a witness testifies contrary to that person\u2019s deposition testimony, the court is not authorized, on motion of the adversary, to strike the testimony on the ground that it is a sham or to grant a motion for judgment because the trial testimony so contradicts the deposition testimony as to lack all probative value.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In <em>Brooks v. Daley, </em>242 Md. 185, 218 A.2d 184 (1966), we affirmed the denial of a motion for judgment in the face of an argument that prior inconsistent statements deprived testimony of any probative weight, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">\u201cIn two previous cases we specifically held that if \u2018inconsistency appears between statements in a pre-trial deposition and testimony at the trial, the weight and credibility of the testimony are for the jury.\u2019 <em>Safeway Trails, Inc. v. Smith, </em>222 Md. 206, 215, 159 A.2d 823 (1960); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>203 Md. 338, 100 A.2d 798 (1953).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 192, 218 A.2d at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Thus, adopting the sham affidavit rule would shift the credibility determination from the trier of fact at trial, where the trier of fact would have the benefit of observing the witness\u2019s demeanor on cross-examination, to the trial court on summary judgment, where the trial court would be limited to a paper record. Further, were the sham affidavit rule incorporated into Maryland summary judgment practice, some accommodation would have to be made in the deposition rules for the witness who genuinely has a refreshed recollection, in order to permit that deponent formally to place the change on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>record before a motion for summary judgment was filed. As our rules are presently structured, deponents who have honestly concluded that their deposition testimony was in error have no formal opportunity, prior to a motion for summary judgment, to go on record with the change. Under the present practice, were a sham affidavit rule adopted, without other changes, the party-deponent-affiant is placed in the position of appearing to have generated the change in testimony only as a response to the threatened entry of summary judgment against that party.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">It may be possible, of course, for this Court to adopt a form of sham affidavit rule under which the affidavit would be stricken unless the affiant presented in the affidavit the reasons for the change in testimony. That was not done here. Such a rule, however, merely inserts another layer into the analysis, but it does not remove the underlying credibility issue. If this version of a sham affidavit rule required the court to weigh the validity of the explanation, then the credibility determination simply would be moved to another level. If the rule required the court to accept the explanation, those who are disposed to submit a sham affidavit would simply add a sham reason in order to defeat summary judgment, and the result would not differ from having no sham affidavit rule at all. The trier of fact at trial would still determine the truth of the factual matter that had been set forth in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In any event, the principal deterrent to the sham affidavit is its substantial undermining of the credibility of the nonmovant when testifying at trial and the increased risk to the nonmov-ant of losing the case on the merits. The sham affidavit is, almost by definition, an act of desperation. It is filed to stave off an imminent summary judgment in the hope that the movant will settle to avoid the cost of trial. If we were to adopt the sham affidavit rule in order to address what may be a relatively small number of cases in which sham affidavits are presented, the downside possibly would be an increase in the filings of summary judgment motions that are based on an attempt to convince the trial court that some variation in the nonmovant\u2019s affidavit was completely and inexplicably contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>dictory, and that the variation was not simply a clarification or elaboration. If a need develops for a sham affidavit rule, that need ordinarily would be discerned initially by our Standing Committee on the Rules of Practice and Procedure. That committee also would be in the position to recommend appropriate adjustments in other Rules of Procedure if the trial courts were given the discretion under Rule 2-501 to strike a sham affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">There are means other than striking that are available to a trial court for dealing with that which the court is convinced is a sham affidavit. The federal sham affidavit rule in theory applies only when there is a flat contradiction of material fact between the deposition testimony and the affidavit opposing summary judgment. If the trial court is convinced that the affidavit is demonstrably knowingly false, one course of action is to refer the matter to the prosecutor for possible perjury charges. Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Article 27, \u00a7 437 specifically contemplates perjury prosecutions based on contradictory statements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Further, if, at trial, the fact-finder rejects the version of the facts set forth in the nonmovant\u2019s affidavit, and if the court is convinced that the affidavit was a sham, designed merely to forestall summary judgment and to prolong the possibility of effecting some settlement, then \u201cthe offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them\u201d may be required to pay costs and reasonable expenses, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees, under the sanction rule, Rule 1-341. Surely, if the affidavit is demonstrated to be clearly a sham, a claim or defense asserted therein which has been rejected by the fact-finder would be a claim or defense asserted in bad faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Another way of dealing with an apparent sham affidavit would utilize the \u201ccatchall\u201d power under Rule 2~504(b)(2)(G) which permits the court to order \u201cany other matter pertinent to the management of the action.\u201d Under this option the court could sever the issue of material fact involved in the contradictory statements for trial as a separate issue, thus presumably sparing the moving party the expense of a full trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The dissent in this case does not embrace fully the federal sham affidavit rule. Instead, the dissent would apply an analysis of internally contradictory trial testimony that was applied in <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A.2d 683 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The facts and holding in <em>Kucharczyk </em>were succinctly stated in <em>Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 486 A.2d 196 (1985), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cIn <em>Kucharezyk, </em>the defendant was convicted of assault and battery, based on the alleged attempted buggery of a sixteen year old boy. The prosecuting witness\u2019s testimony furnished the only evidence against the defendant. This witness was mentally deficient and, according to a psychologist called by the State, had a full scale I.Q. of only 56. The witness, twice on direct examination and once on cross-examination, \u2018testified that nothing happened. Thus, there were unqualified statements by the prosecuting witness that the crime for which the appellant was convicted never in fact occurred.\u2019 235 Md. at 337-38, 201 A.2d 683. On this ground, the Court reversed the conviction, stating that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAd\">\u201c \u2018the testimony of the prosecuting witness, who was the only person that testified as to any overt act on the part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of the appellant, was so contradictory that it lacked probative force and was thus insufficient to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts required to be proven.\u2019 <em>[Kucharczyk, </em>235 Md.] at 337, 201 A.2d 683.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajb-dedup-0\"><em>Smith, </em>302 Md. at 182, 486 A.2d at 199. In support of its conclusion, the <em>Kucharczyk </em>Court cited <em>Kaufman v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>197 Md. 141, 145, 78 A.2d 464, 466 (1951), <em>Eisenhower v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 528, 537, 59 A.2d 313, 318 (1948), and <em>Slacum v. Jolley, </em>153 Md. 343, 351, 138 A. 244, 248 (1927). <em>Kucharczyk, </em>235 Md. at 338, 201 A.2d at 685. These cases also are cited in the dissent in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><em>Slacum, </em>the seminal case, presented a claim under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act for benefits due to death allegedly caused by exposure to heat in the decedent\u2019s employment as a bus operator. The claimant\u2019s medical experts \u201cstated positively that they could not say what caused [the decedent\u2019s] death,\u201d but one of those also had said that \u201cfrom \u2018all the evidence and the facts which were presented after his death\u2019 [the decedent] died from heat prostration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 138 A. at 248. <em>Slacum </em>held the latter evidence insufficient to present a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\"><em>Smith </em>involved an accused whose testimony was substantially muddled as to whether he was in Texas or in Maryland at the time of the commission of the robbery with which he was charged. We held that it was error to deny the accused an alibi instruction and that the error was not harmless inasmuch as the accused\u2019s testimony was not without evidentiary value under the <em>Kucharczyk </em>analysis. We said that the latter \u201cis extremely limited in scope,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>302 Md. at 182, 486 A.2d at 199, and that the principle set forth by <em>Kucharczyk </em>has a \u201cnarrow ambit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 486 A.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Judge Moylan, writing for the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 83, 294 A.2d 123 (1972), placed the <em>Kucharczyk </em>holding in perspective with the following review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADK\">\u201cDespite the limited utility of the doctrine, the life of <em>Kucharczyk </em>has been amazing for the number of occasions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>on which and the number of situations in which it has been invoked in vain. <em>Kucharczyk </em>does not apply simply because a witness\u2019s trial testimony is contradicted by other statements which the witness has given out of court or, indeed, in some other trial. <em>Brooks v.

Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a witness is forgetful as to even major details or testifies as to what may seem improbable conduct. <em>Gunther v. State, 4 </em>Md.App. 181, 184-185 [241 A.2d 907 (1968) (per curiam) ]. Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a witness is initially hesitant about giving inculpatory testimony but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>subsequently does inculpate a defendant. <em>Wilkins v.

Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a witness appears initially to have contradicted himself but later explains or resolves the apparent contradiction. <em>Wilson, Valentin and Nutter v. State, 8 </em>Md.App. 653, 674 [262 A.2d 91 (1970) ]. Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a State\u2019s witness is contradicted by other State\u2019s witnesses. <em>Scott v.

Nor does <em>Kucharczyk </em>apply where a witness does contradict himself upon a critical issue but where there is independent corroboration of the inculpa-tory version. <em>Tucker v.

In each of those situations, our system of jurisprudence places reliance in the fact finder to take contradictions or equivocations properly into account and then to make informed judgment in assessing a witness\u2019s credibility and in weighing that witness\u2019s testimony. Even in a pure <em>Ku-charczyk </em>situation, the ultimate resolution is solely in terms of measuring the legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s total case and not in terms of the exclusion of the contradictory witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 95-97, 294 A.2d at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">From the time that Judge Moylan wrote <em>Bailey </em>to date, no opinion of this Court or of the Court of Special Appeals has encountered a set of facts that justified applying the <em>Kucharczyk </em>approach. Indeed, <em>Vogel v. State, </em>315 Md. 458, 554 A.2d 1231 (1989), quoted with approval the following passage from <em>Bailey, </em>16 Md.App. at 93, 294 A.2d at 129:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201c \u2018Trial testimony frequently is replete with contradictions and inconsistencies, major and minor. It is the quintessential approach of the Anglo-American trial system to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>fundamentally upon cross-examination, upon the introduction of prior inconsistent statements, upon impeachment devices generally, upon sequestration, upon oral argument to ferret out and to highlight such contradictions if and when they exist.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><em>Vogel, </em>315 Md. at 471 n. 6, 554 A.2d at 1237 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Although the more recent Maryland cases that have rejected an argument that contradictory evidence is legally insufficient have been criminal cases, the restrictions that Maryland appellate courts have put on the reach of <em>Kucharczyk </em>in criminal cases would seem to apply with greater force in civil cases. Inasmuch as the standard of proof in civil cases is lesser than in criminal, internally contradictory trial testimony should less readily be found legally insufficient in civil than in criminal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The dissent in the instant matter would extend <em>Kucharczyk. </em>We read the dissent to advocate that the conflict between Hall\u2019s affidavit and her deposition testimony renders both of no probative value. <em>Kucharczyk, </em>on the other hand, deals only with testimony at trial and with the effect on legal sufficiency of substantial contradictions within the trial testimony of a single witness on whose testimony the entire claim or defense depends. Thus, if Hall testified at trial in a manner consistent with her affidavit in opposition to summary judgment, but inconsistent with her deposition, that trial testimony could not be stricken because of the inconsistency. <em>See Brooks, </em>242 Md. at 192, 218 A.2d at 188. Although Hall may be subject to a bloodying impeachment on cross-examination at trial, based on her prior inconsistent statements, testimony consistent with her affidavit would remain in the case. Thus, remarkably, the dissent would combine <em>Kucharc-zyk </em>with the summary judgment rule to eliminate at the summary judgment stage evidence which would be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons we decline to adopt the sham affidavit rule of the federal courts. Instead, we apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Maryland\u2019s traditional summary judgment law. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

He was like two. My mother put me out [of the Harlem Avenue residence] and I went around there and stayed with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201cQ: So Terran was about two years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">\u201cQ: And you went and stayed with Rita Porter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-12\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-13\">\u201cQ: How long did you stay with her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-14\"><em>\u201cA: </em>About a month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-15\">\u201cQ: Why did your mother put you out of the house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-16\">\u201cA: She was in one of her little deranged stages, and I just got tired of going through it, so she said get out, then. And I took my son and I got out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-17\">\u201cQ: How long did you stay with Miss Porter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-18\">\u201cA: About two weeks. Two months I mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-19\">\u201cQ: Two months. And where did she live?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-20\">\u201cA: 1908 Lauretta Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-21\">\u201cQ: Say that again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cA: 1908 Lauretta Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201cQ: Okay. Other than staying with her for about two months when Terran was about two years old, did you ever stay with her any other times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201cA: Well, after I stayed with her, then I went back home to my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">\u201cQ: Okay. Did you ever go back to staying at her house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-8\">\u201cA: I was staying with her while I was pregnant, for one. I was staying with her while I was pregnant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-9\">\u201cQ: Pregnant with who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-10\">\u201cA: Terran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-11\">\u201cQ: Any other times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">\u201cA: No, just them two times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">\u201cQ: How long did you stay with her while you were pregnant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-14\">\u201cA: For about two, three months. Me and Terran, Sr., yeah, was staying there about two or three months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">\u201cQ: Did Miss Porter ever baby-sit Terran?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-16\">\u201cA: Yeah, here and there, she baby-sit him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-17\">\u201cQ: Okay. From the time Terran was about a year old to the time he was about four years old, how often would he visit Miss Porter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-18\">\u201cA: You say from one to four [years old]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-19\">\u201cQ: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-20\">\u201cA: I go around there quite often, you know, I would go stop in and sit for a while quite often. You know, I was living on Harlem Avenue and she lived right around the corner from us, so I would stop in there quite often.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-21\">\u201cQ: How many times a week or how many times a month, if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-22\">\u201cA: Maybe like, probably like twice out of a week or something like that, out of a month, who knows. I\u2019d just drop in, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-23\">\u201cQ: Did she ever\u2014did she ever baby-sit Terran on a regular basis, like an all day kind of thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cA: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">When similarly questioned by counsel for Respondents, Hall responded as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201cQ: And you stayed in this house [at 1908 Lauretta Avenue] for a couple\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">\u201cA: For about two months. Yes, my mother put me out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201cQ: And can you remember exactly when that was that she put you out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201cA: The time, the date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201cQ: Yeah, like the time of the year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\"><em>\u201cA: </em>Ah, man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">\u201cQ: What the weather was like, so you can pinpoint the time of year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">\u201cA: It was like in the fall, probably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-14\">\u201cQ: Okay. Do you remember what year it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-15\">\u201cA: My son was two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-16\">\u201cQ: He was two. You know he was definitely two?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-17\">\u201cA: Or getting ready to turn two. It was somewhere around that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-18\">\u201cQ: Okay. And then you stayed for a couple of months?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-19\">\u201cA: (Nodding head affirmatively.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-20\">Shortly later this exchange occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-21\">\u201cQ: And when is it that you moved back [from the subject premises]? Do you remember a date or a time or an event that would kind of help pinpoint that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-22\">\u201cA: I know it was getting close to a holiday because I had to buy [Terran] an outfit to wear or something. Let me see what holiday was it. Was it Easter, or was it the Fourth of July? It might have been Easter or the Fourth of July. I\u2019m trying to think. Because it,was spring when I was around there. Easter is in the spring, right? Right. I think I had to buy him an Easter outfit, so that\u2019s how I had to figure I went back home to my mom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-23\">\u201cQ: We were trying to figure out when you moved out\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-24\">\u201cA: And I\u2019m still trying to figure out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u201cQ: Let me ask this. You said you thought it was possibly before he turned two, because his birthday would have been in December?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-5\">\u201cA: December, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cQ: Well, do you think it was before December or after December that you moved in with [Porter]? You think it was before his birthday or after his birthday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cA: ... [I]t was before his birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cQ: So before December of \u201992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">\u201cA: Right. It was before his birthday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">\u201cQ: And do you think the holiday\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">\u201cA: And I moved back\u2014because I had to give him something for Easter. You say give you an event that makes it noticeable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">\u201cQ: Would that maybe have been Christmas? If you moved out before his birthday, then the holiday might have been Christmas?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\">\u201cA: It was after his birthday, so I was probably there like January, February, because it wasn\u2019t too bad outside. And I moved, it was after his birthday, that I do know. And I think I had to buy him an outfit for Easter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-14\">\u201cQ: Okay.... [Y]ou said you think you had occasionally went by to see [Porter] after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">\u201cA: I did. Yeah, I still went by and seen her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-16\">\u201cQ: And how often would you say you did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-17\">\u201cA: About three or four times a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-18\">\u201cQ: Okay. You had told\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-19\">\u201cA: Maybe two [times a week]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-20\">\u201cQ: You told [counsel for a co-defendant]\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-21\">\u201cA: She asked me how many times out of a month. I said, two or three times out of a week. Put it to you like this: Whenever [Gladys Hall] had something to drink, I was around there [at the subject premises], put it to you like that. And she had that, like, constantly. But I would take a break here and there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>\u201cQ: All right. So when you would go by, would it be in the evenings so that you two could socialize?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201cA Evening, mornings, didn\u2019t matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axk-dedup-0\">\u201cQ Did you bring Terran with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWX\">\u201cA I took my baby with me everywhere I went.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyK\">\u201cQ And how long would you be there with [Porter]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYv\">\u201cA Like two hours, three hours, maybe an hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">\u201cQ: Okay. I just want to know if you continued to go visit her over the next few months or the next year or\u2014 \u201cA: Yes. I never stopped going to see her because I moved back with my mom. I still go see her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-16\">Finally, another counsel for Respondents questioned Hall, and this exchange occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-17\">\u201cQ: Miss Hall, I\u2019m confused about the time period when you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-19\">\u201cA: When I moved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-20\">\u201cQ: when you moved in with Miss Porter.

Although I do not necessarily agree with every statement or reason given by the various Federal courts in support of the \u201csham affidavit\u201d rule, I do believe that, if carefully circumscribed, it is a reasonable and useful approach to protecting both the summary judgment procedure and our case management system against blatant fraud. I would hold, in this case, that the trial court had discretion to strike the two affidavits submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, that it did not abuse its discretion in so doing, and that, on the remaining record presented to the court for purposes of the motion, it did not err in granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Judge Rodowsky has accurately presented the underlying facts. Although Shari Hall\u2019s deposition testimony, as a whole, was not a model of clarity\u2014a fact that has independent significance\u2014she very clearly did make two points most relevant to this case: (1) that she and her son lived at 1908 Lauretta Avenue for only about two months between December, 1992 and February, 1993, and (2) while living with her mother at 1805 Harlem Avenue, she visited the Lauretta Avenue home, to visit her friend, Rita Porter, at the most three to four times a week for periods of about three hours. Whenever Ms. Hall strayed from that testimony or injected some ambiguity as to the extent of her contact with the Lauretta Avenue property, counsel attempted to pin her down, and she returned to her statement that she resided there for only about two months and had limited contact when not residing there. It was on that premise that Dr. Klein opined that it was unlikely that any lead paint at the Lauretta Avenue property was a major contributor to Terr an Pittman\u2019s elevated lead levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Ms. Hall\u2019s later affidavit, claiming that she and her son resided full-time at the Lauretta Avenue property for five- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>and-a-half months and that, when not residing there, she and her son visited the property every day of the week for eight hours a day, is flat-out inconsistent with her deposition testimony. The difference is not one of nuance, of refreshed memory, of new information that would lead to a different conclusion, or of incidental fact. It is a complete and unexplained change of story\u2014of the central facts most relevant to her right to recover. What is perhaps more disturbing is that, in contrast to the rambling nature of her deposition testimony, the affidavit has a polished quality to it, suggesting that it was drafted by counsel and was not merely a recording of her own statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">As the Court correctly points out, the function of summary judgment procedure is solely to determine whether a triable issue exists. The trial court does that by examining the evidentiary material presented in support of or in opposition to the motion in a light most favorable to the non-movant and deciding whether, if a trier of fact were to credit that evidence, so viewed, it could reasonably and lawfully reach a verdict on the issue in favor of the non-movant. <em>See Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 738-39, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011-12 (1993). If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d the court may, and usually should, enter a summary judgment, for there is nothing to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Summary judgment procedure is not a substitute for trial, but it does play an important role in weeding out cases, claims, or issues that investigation shows have no merit. Although the device of summary judgment was viewed with some skepticism when initially introduced into the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, given the need for efficiency in handling the burgeoning civil dockets of our trial courts, appellate courts throughout the country have, in recent years, begun to look more favorably on the proper role summary judgments play in that winnowing process. The Federal courts, led in some respects by the Supreme Court, have taken the lead in unshackling summary judgment and allowing it to remove cases from the docket that would otherwise eventually be resolved on a motion for judgment during or after trial. Because our summary judgment rule was derived from the Federal rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>we have almost always regarded Federal practice and interpretations as persuasive in the interpretation of our rule. <em>See Frush v. Brooks, </em>204 Md. 815, 104 A.2d 624 (1954); <em>Metropolitan Mtg. Fd. v. Basiliko, </em>288 Md. 25, 415 A.2d 582 (1980); <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, supra, </em>330 Md. at 738 n. 8, 625 A.2d at 1011 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">A summary judgment may be entered at any time\u2014even during trial\u2014but our rules contemplate that motions for summary judgment be made and decided before trial, usually upon completion of discovery. Maryland Rule 2-504 generally requires that a scheduling order be entered in every civil action in the circuit courts and further requires that such an order contain, among other things, \u201ca date by which all discovery must be completed,\u201d and \u201ca date by which all dispositive motions must be filed.\u201d This is so that, if a case is going to be disposed of on motion, either to dismiss or for summary judgment, the disposition occur as early in the litigation as practicable\u2014that the case not continue to remain on the docket longer than necessary, in competition with other cases needing scarce trial dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">For the system to work efficiently, as intended, the relevant record upon which the court is to act must be closed as of a certain point, and the court must be able to rely on the evidence presented in that record. That is why the date set in a scheduling order for the filing of motions for summary judgment is later than the date set for completing discovery\u2014 so the parties can develop the record and collate, edit, and present it in a way that is relevant to the issues to be raised in the summary judgment proceeding. It is why Rule 2-501 requires that the evidence presented in connection with the motion be supported by affidavit made on personal knowledge by persons competent to testify. It is why, in 1991, we eliminated the trap of allowing anything hidden in some pleading, deposition, or answer to interrogatory to defeat summary judgment and limited the record for summary judgment purposes to those facts presented in the motion or the response. The movant, the non-movant, and the court must be entitled to rely upon the information that is at hand when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the motion is filed and responded to\u2014the information developed largely through discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The Court rejects the \u201csham affidavit\u201d approach because of its concern that adopting that approach would improperly allow the court, on summary judgment, to resolve conflicting evidence and make credibility assessments, which are matters for the trier of fact to determine. I share that concern, which is why I do not accept some of the language used and some of the decisions made by the Federal courts. I do not believe that a judge, on summary judgment, should be generically elevating deposition testimony over affidavits or answers to interrogatories or deciding which of two conflicting statements is correct. There are circumstances, however, in which a witness\u2019s testimony, whether presented at trial or, I believe, in connection with a summary judgment motion, is so internally conflicting on a material issue that the testimony in conflict lacks any probative force and is therefore disregarded. As far back as <em>Slacum v. Jolley, </em>153 Md. 343, 351, 138 A. 244, 248 (1927), we held that \u201c[wjhen a witness says in one breath that a thing is so, and in the next breath that it is not so, his testimony is too inconclusive, contradictory, and uncertain, to be the basis of a legal conclusion.\u201d <em>See also Oberfeld v. Eilers, </em>171 Md. 332, 189 A. 203 (1937); <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Continental Baking Co., </em>172 Md. 24, 190 A. 768 (1937); <em>Askin v. Long, </em>176 Md. 545, 6 A.2d 246 (1939); <em>Butler v. Reed-Avery Co., </em>186 Md. 686, 48 A.2d 436 (1946); and <em>Eisenhower v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 528, 59 A.2d 313 (1948), where we actually applied that doctrine. In <em>Kaufman v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>197 Md. 141, 145, 78 A.2d 464, 466 (1951), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">\u201cIf the testimony of one witness at the trial is legally sufficient, it matters not that this testimony may be contradicted by ten witnesses ... or even that it may be in conflict with statements before the trial, or testimony in a previous trial or other legal proceeding, of the same witness, [citations omitted]. But if any witness\u2019s testimony is itself so contradictory that it has no probative force, a jury cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>invited to speculate about it or to select one or another contradictory statement as the basis of a verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><em>See also Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A.2d 683 (1964); <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 6 A.2d 48 (1939); <em>Branch v. State, </em>305 Md. 177, 502 A.2d 496 (1986) (Eldridge, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The <em>Kaufman </em>analysis illustrates the point of my disagreement with the majority. When the contradiction is between trial testimony and pre-trial statements, the conflict or inconsistency affects only the credibility of the trial testimony, which is for the trier of fact to resolve. When, however, the testimony contemporaneously presented to a tribunal is itself in such contradiction that both versions cannot be true, the testimony has no probative force and cannot be the basis of a verdict. In that latter circumstance, it is not a matter of making credibility determinations or deciding disputed fact; all of the testimony in conflict is disregarded as non-probative, and the court looks only to what is left. Under the rule established in the aforecited cases, if a plaintiff, at trial, swears in one breath that the light was red for her, which would destroy her right of recovery, she cannot defeat a motion for judgment by swearing in the next breath and without any explanation, that the light was green. Because of the contradiction, neither statement is regarded as probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The same principle should apply in a summary judgment proceeding. As noted, the issue there is usually whether the record before the court contains sufficient evidence, if believed, to support a verdict for the non-movant. If, on that record, the only testimony that could support such a verdict is so self-contradictory as to be non-probative, it must be disregarded, just as it would be at trial. Certainly, if the contradiction appeared in a single document offered in opposition to the summary judgment\u2014either deposition testimony or an affidavit\u2014all of the averments in conflict would be treated as non-probative and disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The wrinkle in this case is that, with what appears to be the post-deposition counseling of an attorney, the plaintiff at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>tempted to inject the contradiction through another document. I quite agree with the Court that she was entitled to file an affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment; the filing of an affidavit is not precluded by the scheduling order or by Rule 2-504. What is not allowed, however, is to use the affidavit to present a dramatic change in her sworn testimony, without any explanation. As noted in <em>Martin v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>851 F.2d 703, 705 (3d Cir.1988), there <em>are </em>situations in which sworn testimony can quite properly be corrected by a subsequent affidavit. If the witness was confused on the earlier occasion, did not have complete information at the time, confesses in good faith to having simply been mistaken, or offers some other reasonable explanation for the change in testimony, the subsequent statement should be allowed, its effect then being for the trier of fact to gauge. In the absence of any such explanation, however, the court is left only with the proffered contradiction which, if allowed, would render all of the testimony in conflict non-probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The issue before us is largely one of law, but it embodies a certain discretionary element as well. When there is an <em>unexplained </em>contradiction in testimony on a critical issue\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>the witness has, in fact, actually given conflicting evidence\u2014we have tended to view the effect of the conflict in terms of the legal sufficiency of the evidence and thus as a question of law. When the issue is whether to permit conflicting evidence, however, a measure of discretion is necessary. The court can solicit or require an explanation, in order to make a determination whether the conflict is such as to render the testimony non-probative. If the witness were to be candid and state that he/she has changed the story because he/she is now convinced that victory would be otherwise unobtainable, the court would certainly have discretion to disallow the new testimony. If, on the other hand, the witness gives at least a creditable, even if not entirely credible, explanation, the court should allow the new evidence and let the trier of fact resolve the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Applying this long-established principle to summary judgment proceedings does not intrude upon the prerogatives reserved to the trier of fact. It is a reasonable thing to do; it follows the approach not only of the Federal courts but that of several other States;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it promotes the utility of summary judgment procedure; and it provides a necessary defense against sharp practice and fraud. In this case, the trial court did not err, in my view, in regarding the last-minute affidavits as an improper end-run around the scheduling order, the underlying case management system, and established summary judgment procedure\u2014as a blatant attempt to reconstruct sworn testimony solely for the purpose of defeating summary judgment and forcing a trial. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Judges RAKER and CATHELL have authorized me to state that they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-5\">. <em>See Hanna v.
