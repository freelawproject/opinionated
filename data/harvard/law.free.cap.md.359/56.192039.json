Mooney, Esquire, respondent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-709(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the petition, Bar Counsel alleges violations of Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.3, 7.1, 8.1, and 8.4 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) and Maryland Rule 16-812 based on four separate complaints filed against respondent. This Court referred the matter to the Honorable Michael D. Mason of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Maryland Rules 16-709(b) and 16\u2014711(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After an evidentia-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ry hearing, Judge Mason found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.3, 8.1, and 8.4. Respondent filed in this Court extensive exceptions to the findings of facts and conclusions of law made by Judge Mason. As we shall indicate, we accept some of the court\u2019s findings of facts and proposed conclusions of law, and do not accept certain of its findings and conclusions. We shall suspend respondent indefinitely, with permission to apply for readmission after ninety days. Termination of respondent\u2019s suspension is subject to respondent engaging, at his expense, a monitor acceptable to Bar Counsel, who will oversee respondent\u2019s practice of law and respondent\u2019s accounting for funds entrusted to him for a period of two years, and who will provide Bar Counsel monthly reports for one year and quarterly reports thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">This disciplinary action arose out of the complaints of four of Mr. Mooney\u2019s clients: Ms. Francis L. Greenhill, Ms. Betty Johnson, Mr. Melvin Postell, and Ms. Dee Dee Cunningham. The court heard testimony from Ms. Greenhill, Ms. Johnson, Ms. Cunningham, Mr. Mooney, Ms. Natalija Djurickovic,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Mr. Dennis F. Biennas.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The petition came before the court on December 1, 1999. From the evidentiary record made below, Judge Mason made findings of fact with respect to each complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Complaint of Francis L. Greenhill</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In response to his letter of solicitation,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> respondent was retained by Ms. Greenhill in the latter part of October 1997 to represent her in a criminal case set for January 22, 1998 in the District Court of Maryland, sitting in Prince George\u2019s County. She paid respondent a fee of approximately $325.00. Ms. Greenhill met with respondent in November to discuss the facts of her case. Respondent entered his appearance in Ms. Greenhill\u2019s case on November 7, 1997. Subsequently, Ms. Greenhill attempted to call respondent on the telephone on numerous occasions. The record reflects that respondent neither took nor returned any of her calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Respondent failed to appear as counsel for Ms. Greenhill at the January 22, 1998 trial. That day, at the direction of the court, Ms. Greenhill telephoned respondent\u2019s office and was told that he was not there. When she returned to court, she decided to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The case was dismissed because no witnesses appeared to testify against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Several weeks later, while Ms. Greenhill was in court on an unrelated matter, she saw respondent heading into court with another client. She confronted him concerning his failure to appear at her trial and requested her money back. He offered her no explanation for his failure to appear, but told her to call his office to inquire about getting a refund. She thereafter called his office numerous times, but was never able to contact respondent. On one occasion, respondent\u2019s receptionist told Ms. Greenhill that respondent no longer worked at that office. Ms. Greenhill then filed a complaint with Bar Counsel. Approximately two months after Bar Counsel contacted respondent concerning Ms. Greenhill\u2019s complaint, her $325.00 fee was refunded and she received a letter of apology from respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Ms. Djurickovic testified that she was hired by respondent in 1997 for the primary purpose of handling cases in Prince George\u2019s County. Although the majority of her cases were in the District Court, she occasionally handled circuit court cases. She further testified that respondent had neither discussed the Greenhill case with her nor assigned it to her. Both Ms. Djurickovic and respondent described their general process of \u201cassigning\u201d cases. Ms. Djurickovic was assigned a case when she was given the case file by respondent or the case file was otherwise left for her by respondent in the office. This usually occurred approximately a week in advance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">During the investigation of Ms. Greenhill\u2019s complaint, respondent told an investigator for petitioner that because Ms. Djurickovic handled most of his firm\u2019s cases in Prince George\u2019s County, and that Ms. Greenhill\u2019s case was in Prince George\u2019s County, and he could not find Ms. Greenhill\u2019s file, he assumed that he had assigned the case to her. He conceded, however, that he may have neglected to assign the case. Additionally, he offered no explanation as to: (1) why he neither received nor returned Ms. Greenhill\u2019s calls and (2) why his receptionist would have told Ms. Greenhill that he no longer worked at his office. Finally, he also told Mr. Biennas, the investigator, that when Ms. Djurickovic arrived in court, Ms. Greenhill\u2019s case had already been \u201cnolle prossed\u201d when in fact the case actually had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Based upon the aforementioned findings of fact, Judge Mason concluded that respondent violated the following rules in his representation of Ms. Greenhill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">1. MRPC 1.1 (Competence) by failing to provide competent representation to Ms. Greenhill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">2. MRPC 1.3 (Diligence) by failing to act with reasonable diligence in representing Ms. Greenhill;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">3. MRPC 1.4 (Communication) in failing to respond to the client\u2019s inquiries after his failure to appear for a trial and by failing to appear at the trial itself;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">4. MRPC 8.1 (Bar admission and disciplinary matters) by telling the bar investigator that the case had been assigned to an associate when the evidence indicated that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>such assignment took place and respondent was aware of that fact when he made that statement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag_\">5. MRPC 8.4 (Misconduct) by attempting to mislead the bar investigator by suggesting that the case had actually been assigned to an associate, by failing to appear for trial, and by falsely representing to the court at the disciplinary hearing that he could not remember what happened in this case because he did not have a file.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Complaint of Betty Johnson</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">On or around September 1997, respondent was retained by Ms. Johnson to represent her minor son, Clifton Haggins, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, in connection with the criminal charge of attempted murder. Ms. Johnson specifically asked respondent about filing a petition to waive the jurisdiction of the circuit court (a reverse waiver) and he agreed to do so as part of his representation. Such a petition was never filed by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">After retaining respondent, Ms. Johnson attempted to contact him by telephone on a number of occasions. The record reflects that on at least one occasion, she was able to speak with him and during their conversation he assured Ms. Johnson that he would go to the jail to visit her son, who was incarcerated. Clifton Haggins informed his mother, Ms. Johnson, that respondent never came to visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Ms. Djurickovic testified that respondent assigned Mr. Hag-gins\u2019 case to her in January of 1998.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A line entering her appearance was filed in the case on October 21, 1997; howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>er, she did not sign it and testified that she was unaware that it had been filed. She also testified that when she was assigned the case, there was no file.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, she had to go to court to get information concerning the case. While conducting this research, she noticed that no motions had been filed on Mr. Haggins behalf. According to the docket entries, she filed standard motions to suppress on February 3, 1998. She also testified that at no time did respondent inform her that Mr. Haggins was a minor at the time of his alleged crime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Ms. Djurickovic further testified that one of the first things she noticed when reviewing the case file was that a court date had been set on a day when she already had a trial scheduled in Frederick County. She told respondent that because of this prior commitment she would not be able to represent Mr. Haggins. In response to this information, respondent said that he would take care of the matter and asked only that she have the motions continued to the trial date so he would only have to make one trip to court. The docket entry shows that, on March 6, 1998, the motions were continued to the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Ms. Johnson testified that she contacted respondent approximately a week prior to her son\u2019s trial date, and at that time he informed her that Ms. Djurickovic would be handling her son\u2019s case. Ms. Johnson got Ms. Djurickovic\u2019s phone number from respondent, called her, and left a message at her office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Wfiien she did not hear from Ms. Djurickovic, Ms. Johnson made several calls to her pager number, which the office had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>given her. After not getting a response, she called the pager one final time and put the numbers 911 along with the call back number.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During this time, Ms. Djurickovic was involved in taking depositions in an unrelated matter. During a recess from the depositions, she responded to Ms. Johnson\u2019s last page. They briefly discussed Mr. Haggins\u2019s case. It was the one and only conversation between the two women. On March 17, 1998, in response to the facts outlined, <em>supra, </em>Ms. Johnson notified the court that she was dismissing respondent and seeking other counsel. On March 20, 1998, just three days before trial, new counsel entered their appearance in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Based upon the aforementioned findings of fact, Judge Mason concluded that respondent violated the following in his representation of Ms. Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">1. MRPC 1.1 in failing to represent Mr. Haggins in a competent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">2. MRPC 1.3 in failing to act either diligently or promptly in representing his client;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">3. MRPC 1.4 in failing to meet with his client, or otherwise discuss the case with Mr. Haggins or Ms. Johnson for a period of over four months; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">4. MRPC 8.4 in accepting Mr. Haggins\u2019 case for representation and thereafter taking no action to provide representation and further misrepresenting to his client\u2019s mother that he was taking such efforts. Judge Mason further found that respondent attempted to mislead the court by testifying in the court hearing that he believed he had given the case to Ms. Djurickovic in a timely fashion and reasonably believed that she was taking necessary action.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Complaint of Melvin Postell</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">In response to his letter of solicitation, respondent was retained by Mr. Postell, on or about March 26, 1998, to represent him at a trial scheduled for March 30, 1998 before the District Court, in Prince George\u2019s County. Mr. Postell paid a fee of $600.00 for the representation. On the day of the trial, an unknown member of respondent\u2019s staff told Mr. Postell over the telephone that he did not have to appear at the trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In reliance on this information, Mr. Postell did not appear. Neither respondent nor any representative from his office appeared for Mr. Postell\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Shortly after March 30, 1998, Mr. Postell learned that a bench warrant had been issued for his arrest. He called respondent and was put through to Ms. Djurickovic. She told Mr. Postell to turn himself in to the police, to which Mr. Postell replied that their office should post any necessary bond. Ms. Djurickovic explained to Mr. Postell that she would have to discuss that matter with respondent. When she later discussed the issue with respondent, he said he would take care of the matter. Subsequently, Mr. Postell turned himself in to the authorities. Respondent filed a motion to rescind the bench warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Concerning his failure to appear, respondent indicated to the investigator for Bar Counsel, Mr. Biennas, that he had assigned the case to Ms. Djurickovic. Ms. Djurickovic testified that she had never been assigned Mr. Postell\u2019s case and only became aware of it after the failure to appear, when Mr. Postell\u2019s call was forwarded to her. Because of this testimony, and because (1) the trial was set for March 30, 1998 and, according to the exhibits, respondent did not enter his appearance in the case until March 26, 1998; and (2) respondent, not Ms. Djurickovic, drafted the motion to rescind the bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>warrant, Judge Mason found that respondent gave Mr. Bien-nas false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Based upon the aforementioned findings of fact, Judge Mason concluded that respondent violated several of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct in his representation of Mr. Postell.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">1. The court found that respondent violated MRPC 1.1 and 1.3 by failing to provide competent and diligent representation to Mr. Postell. He found that respondent not only failed to appear for trial, he failed to do anything except make a halfhearted effort to have the bench warrant rescinded. He did not include the most important piece of information\u2014that his client was told by someone in respondent\u2019s office that he did not have to be in court that day\u00bf</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">2. It found that he violated MRPC 1.4 by failing to keep Mr. Postell informed about the status of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">3. It found that he violated MRPC 5.3 (Responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants). The court found that respondent failed to make any reasonable efforts to ensure that his administrative staff would accurately inform the clients of the status of their cases. Only in the absence of any such reasonable efforts could a situation arise where a member of his staff would tell a client that he did not have to appear for trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">4. It also found that he violated MRPC 8.1 because respondent falsely informed the bar investigator that he had assigned the case to his associate. The court found that, at best, respondent intended to assign the case, but knew by the time he spoke to the bar investigator that Ms. Djurickovic had never gotten the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">5. Finally, Judge Mason found that respondent, by reason of his actions described above, violated MRPC 8.4. Additionally, as has been noted, according to the court, respondent attempted to deceive the bar investigator regarding his han<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>dling of the case. Further, the judge found that while it may-have been technically correct in the motion to rescind the bench warrant to assert that the defendant did not know that he had to appear in court, the statement was misleading. Judge Mason reasoned that if counsel had been candid with the hearing court and informed the court that the client had been erroneously informed not to appear, the chances of having the bench warrant recalled may have been substantially higher. Instead, counsel simply stated that the client did not know he had to be in court without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">In addition to finding that respondent misled the court in the way he phrased the motion to rescind the bench warrant in th\u00e9 Postell case, Judge Mason found that respondent was not candid when he testified in the disciplinary court hearing itself, that he could not recall what his investigation had revealed in respect to this case. He had to have found out why the client failed to appear before he could file the motion in the Postell case to rescind the bench warrant. Judge Mason reasoned that, because respondent was already being investigated by Bar Counsel at that time in the Greenhill matter, it was inconceivable that respondent would have discovered and then forgotten what he had learned regarding Mr. Postell\u2019s case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Complaint of Dee Dee Cunningham</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Respondent was retained by Ms. Cunningham to represent her in connection with an assault trial scheduled for May 28, 1998. Ms. Cunningham insisted that she was innocent and presented respondent with a list of witnesses who had observed the fight from which the charges arose, who she asserted would testify on her behalf. Additionally, she told respondent of the existence of certain medical records that would corroborate her version of what had occurred. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>the initial meeting, but before the trial, Ms. Cunningham sent a fax to respondent reminding him of the witnesses and medical records. Moreover, before the trial, she made repeated unsuccessful efforts to reach respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">On the day of the trial, respondent did not appear. Instead, Ms. Djurickovie arrived late. Ms. Cunningham had no prior contact with Ms. Djurickovie. Although Ms. Djurickovie had a file, she had received no information about the witnesses or the medical records from respondent. Ms. Djurickovie testified that respondent had given this case to her on the afternoon of the day before trial. It was not until her initial discussion with Ms. Cunningham that Ms. Djurickovie learned that Ms. Cunningham had requested that respondent obtain medical records and subpoena witnesses. Realizing that neither task had been performed, Ms. Djurickovie recommended that the case be continued in order to secure the witnesses and obtain the medical records. However, Ms. Cunningham elected to go forward with the trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Ms. Cunningham was convicted, but offered a probation before judgment. She refused the probation before judgment in order to preserve her appeal rights. Accordingly, a guilty verdict apparently was entered against her. After an appeal was noted, Ms. Cunningham promptly fired respondent and his firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Respondent testified on December 1, 1999 that he could not locate his file and was therefore unsure as to how the case was handled; however, in a letter to Bar Counsel dated September 15, 1998,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> concerning Ms. Cunningham\u2019s complaint, he wrote: \u201cI reviewed the file and spoke to my associate Ms. Djurickovie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>concerning this matter.\u201d Judge Mason found it difficult to believe that respondent had simply forgotten what he learned when he spoke to his associate about a case that Bar Counsel was investigating. Additionally, respondent testified that he could not dispute that he had been given the names of witnesses and that he had failed to subpoena them. He also conceded that it was possible that he gave Ms. Djurickovic the file the night before the trial. Based upon the aforementioned findings of fact, Judge Mason concluded that respondent violated the following in his representation of Ms. Cunningham:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">1. MRPC 1.1 by failing to provide competent representation due Ms. Cunningham;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">2. MRPC 1.3 by failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing Ms. Cunningham;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">3. MRPC 1.4 in failing to respond to any of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s phone calls or correspondence prior to the trial and in failing to respond to her letter of June 12, 1998,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> following the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">4. MRPC 5.1 because the system set up by respondent to provide files to Ms. Djurickovic for the Prince George\u2019s County cases was woefully inadequate, it was not reasonably designed to make sure that Ms. Djurickovic received the files in a timely fashion and to ensure that she received notice that she had been assigned to a given case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">5. MRPC 8.4 by virtue of the violations of the MRPC as set out, <em>swpra; </em>by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information regarding Ms. Cunningham\u2019s complaint; and by attempting to mislead the court by testifying that he could not recall what had occurred in this case.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">As we stated in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Gavin, </em>350 Md. 176,189, 711 A.2d 193, 200 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary proceedings. Md.

Under our independent review of the record, we must determine whether the findings of the hearing judge are based on clear and convincing evidence. The \u201chearing court\u2019s findings of fact are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Accordingly, the ultimate decision as to whether a lawyer has violated professional rules rests with this Court. <em>Garland, </em>345 Md. at 392, 692 A.2d at 469; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Breschi </em>340 Md. 590, 599, 667 A.2d 659, 663 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Respondent\u2019s Exceptions<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Complaint of Francis L. Greenhill</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Judge Mason found that respondent was in violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1, and 8.4 for his actions conducted in the representation of Ms. Greenhill. Respondent excepts to the findings that he violated MRPC 1.1, 1.4, 8.1, and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>a. MRPC 1.1 (Competence), MRPC 1.3 (Diligence), &amp; MRPC 1.4 (Communication)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">While respondent concedes that no lawyer from his office appeared at Ms. Greenhill\u2019s trial and admits that such practice may be a violation of MRPC 1.3, he argues that it does not make out a clear violation of MRPC 1.1. We disagree. MRPC 1.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Respondent failed to provide Ms. Greenhill with <em>any </em>representation, much less <em>competent </em>representation. Instead, he left Ms. Greenhill to fend for herself when her day in court arrived. When the court directed that she call her attorney, she called his office and was told that he was not there. As to a specific case, such a complete failure of representation is the ultimate incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">We have held that it is unacceptable for an attorney to appear in court for a trial or other proceeding unprepared, and that such practice may constitute a violation of MRPC 1.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ficker, </em>349 Md. 13, 39-40, 706 A.2d 1045, 1057-58 (1998) <em>(Ficker </em>II). An attorney who does not even show up for the court appearance violates the same rule, absent sufficient explanation. As we said in <em>Ficker II, </em>349 Md. at 39-40, 706 A.2d at 1057-58:</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The Comment to Rule 1.1 explains, in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHJ\">\u201cCompetent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners. It also includes adequate preparation. The required attention and preparation are determined in part by what is at stake____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The requirement of adequate preparation has long been recognized as part of a lawyer\u2019s responsibility to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>competent representation, and it is not without significance that, in the current Code of Professional Responsibility embodied in the MLRPC, the duty to provide competent representation is given \u201cthe place of honor as the first ingredient in the lawyer-client relationship.\u201d 1 Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. and W. William Hodes, The Law of Lawyering, 2d ed. \u00a7 1.1:101 (1997). Former DR 6-101(A)(2) precluded a lawyer from handling a matter \u201cwithout preparation adequate in the circumstances,\u201d and the failure to make a proper investigation of the facts of a case prior to trial has led to discipline. <em>See In Re Conduct of Chambers, </em>292 Or. 670, 642 P.2d 286, 291 (1982); <em>People v. Felker, </em>770 P.2d 402 (Colo.1989). <em>See also Lamar v. American Finance System of Fulton Cty., Inc., </em>577 F.2d 953, 955 (5th Cir.1978), noting the duty in a non-disciplinary context.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Respondent did not adequately represent Ms. Greenhill because he failed to appear for her trial. When Ms. Greenhill retained respondent in October of 1997 for her criminal trial set for January 22, 1998, clearly it was her intention to have him represent her in trial that day. His failure to appear in court for his client\u2019s trial is incompetent representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Respondent acknowledges that his failure to appear at Ms. Greenhill\u2019s trial may be a violation of MRPC 1.3. MRPC 1.3 states in relevant part that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d He excepts, however, to the court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 1.4 in \u201cfailing to respond to the client\u2019s inquiries after his failure to appear for a trial\u201d and \u201cby failing to appear at the trial itself.\u201d MRPC 1.4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">We overrule his exception and hold that respondent\u2019s actions violated both MRPC 1.3 and 1.4. As we stated in <em>Attorney </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Grievance Commission v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597, 600 (1983) <em>(Montgomery </em>I), the \u201clack of communication with one\u2019s client, for whatever reason, is a matter of continuing concern to the public. Moreover, this Court has consistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be [an ethical violation] warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u201d <em>Montgomery I </em>involved five different cases in which the attorney repeatedly failed to return communications from clients and neglected to file timely claims on their behalf. The sixty-day suspension in <em>Montgomery I </em>apparently did not deter the attorney; he later was found to have neglected three more cases in which he also failed to communicate with his clients. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Montgomery, </em>318 Md. 154, 567 A.2d 112 (1989) <em>(Montgomery II). </em>This second set of violations led to his disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ficker, </em>319 Md. 305, 572 A.2d 501 (1990) <em>(Ficker </em>I), we disciplined an attorney who in two separate cases neglected to file his appearance pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-214(a) or to appear in court on behalf of his clients. Mr. Ficker argued before this Court that under former Code of Professional Responsibility (Code) Disciplinary Rule (DR) 6-101(A)(3),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a single failure to appear did not amount to \u201cneglect\u201d of a legal matter. He based his argument on the comment to DR 6-101. We noted, however, that we interpreted DR 6-101 more broadly than the comment. In addition, we had already held in <em>Montgomery I </em>that a single failure to appear could constitute a violation of DR 6-101(A)(3). Thus, Mr. Ficker\u2019s failure to appear in each case constituted \u201cneglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 572 A.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In the present case, Judge Mason found that respondent had violated MRPC 1.3 for his failure to appear, and MRPC 1.4 for failing to appear as well as his subsequent failure to respond to the attempted communications by Ms. Greenhill. The comment to MRPC 1.3 states in relevant part, \u201c[u]nless the relationship is terminated as provided in Rule 1.16, a lawyer should carry through to conclusion all matters undertaken for a client.\u201d The comment to MRPC 1.4 provides that \u201c[e]ven when a client delegates authority to the lawyer, the client should be kept advised of the status of the matter.\u201d The record reflects that after their initial meeting and his filing of appearance, respondent had no contact with Ms. Greenhill until she happened to see him heading into court with another client several weeks after her trial. Thus, as of November 1997, respondent effectively ceased all communications with Ms. Greenhill regarding the status of her case or what actions he might take on her behalf. Not only did he not answer or return her telephone calls, but he failed to appear at her scheduled trial. It was only by a chance later meeting that Ms. Greenhill was able to confront respondent and request that he refund her money. During their exchange, respondent continued to evade Ms. Greenhill by offering no explanation for his actions and telling her to call his office to inquire about getting a refund. When she thereafter called his office numerous times, she was never able to contact respondent. On one occasion, respondent\u2019s receptionist even told Ms. Greenhill that respondent no longer worked there.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Only after Ms. Greenhill filed a complaint and Bar Counsel contacted respondent concerning that complaint, was her $325.00 fee refunded and a letter of apology received. Respondent clearly did not cany through all matters undertaken for Ms. Greenhill; he did not even appear at her trial. Additionally, when she attempted to collect the refund, to which she was clearly entitled, respondent not only failed to communicate with Ms. Greenhill, but an inference can be drawn from the evidence that he avoided her. Respondent was forthcoming with said refund and apology only after Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Greenhill\u2019s complaint to the Bar Counsel. Respondent clearly violated MRPC 1.3 and 1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">b. MRPC 8.1 (Bar admission and disciplinary matters)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Respondent excepts to the finding by Judge Mason that he lied to or deceived the bar investigator, Mr. Biennas, when he indicated that the Greenhill case had been assigned to an associate, Ms. Djurickovic. We agree with respondent and shall grant this exception. Although Judge Mason ultimately concluded that respondent\u2019s statements to the investigator were not accurate, the evidence does not support by clear and convincing evidence a finding that respondent knew at the relevant time that the files had not been physically given to Ms. Djurickovic or that he intended to mislead the investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">MRPC 8.1 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">[A] lawyer ... in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">(a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">In Maryland, a finding of deceit and misrepresentation in a disciplinary action must be found to be intentional. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 298, 572 A.2d 174, 179 (1990) (holding that it is necessary \u201cto establish that the dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation is intentional\u201d). Thus, in order to establish its case against respondent, Bar Counsel is required to prove with clear and convincing evidence that respondent\u2019s supposed false statements were made with the knowledge that such statements were false when he made them. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 474 (1996) (\u201cThe burden is on Bar Counsel to establish the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tions by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>335 Md. 1, 9, 641 A.2d 510, 514 (1994) (\u201cTo be sustained, the findings of fact of a hearing court must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d). We have defined the clear and convincing evidence standard as \u201cmore than a preponderance of the evidence and less than evidence beyond a reasonable doubt....\u201d <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 320, 413 A.2d 170, 178 (1980) (quoting <em>Whittington v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 676, 679 n. 3, 262 A.2d 75, 77 n. 3 (1970)). We expounded further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">The requirement of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence does not call for \u201cunanswerable\u201d or \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure\u2014that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. It has also been said that the term \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details thereof narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><em>Berkey, </em>287 Md. at 320, 413 A.2d at 178 (quoting 30 Am.Jur.2d <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 1167).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In the Greenhill case, the evidence does not support a finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.1 by telling the bar investigator that he believed the case had been assigned to the associate. It is respondent\u2019s contention that he told the bar investigator that he believed that the Greenhill case had been assigned to Ms. Djurickovie based on his knowledge that ninety to ninety-five percent of the cases in his office, which were pending in Prince George\u2019s County, were handled by Ms. Djurickovie, that Ms. Greenhill\u2019s case was in Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>County, and he could not find Ms. Greenhill\u2019s file. In other words, he assumed that he had assigned the case to her and gave an answer that reflected that assumption. Judge Mason said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">it [is] inconceivable that [respondent] could have investigated this failure to appear, as a result of the investigation hired an office manager (and fired his secretary according to his letter to bar counsel), and now can\u2019t recall what his investigation revealed! Instead, the [c]ourt concludes that [respondent] has taken this position because his investigation revealed that Ms. Djurickovic had never received this file as she testified. This means he made a false representation to the investigator for bar counsel when he told him that he believed the case had been assigned to the associate, which he does not want to admit. Although [respondent] denies making such a statement to bar counsel, the [c]ourt finds that he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">This conclusion based on the evidence presented to the trial court does not meet the standard of clear and convincing evidence. Judge Mason bases his conclusion, in large part, on Mr. Biennas\u2019s testimony that \u201c[h]e did tell me that that case was assigned to somebody else, an associate in his office.\u201d This testimony was based on a conversation Mr. Biennas had with respondent one year and six months earlier. Respondent explained that he told Mr. Biennas in general terms that the case had been assigned to Ms. Djurickovic. In dealing with cases set in Prince George\u2019s County, respondent acted under the assumption that, absent unusual circumstances or any recollection to the contrary, such cases were handled by Ms. Djurickovic. This is further evidenced by respondent\u2019s testimony relative to the Greenhill case that \u201csince it was a Prince George\u2019s County case, Ms. Djurickovic would probably have handled it\u201d and his subsequent testimony acknowledging that he had no specific knowledge that she did, in fact, handle it. The evidence presented by Bar Counsel is not so clear and convincing to lead one to conclude that respondent intended to mislead the bar investigator. We hold that Judge Mason erred in finding that respondent made intentional false repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>sentations to the bar investigator. We therefore grant respondent\u2019s exception to the finding that he violated MRPC 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">c. MRPC 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Respondent excepts to the finding of the trial court that he lied to or deceived the bar investigator, Mr. Biennas, when he indicated that the Greenhill case had been assigned to an associate, Ms. Djurickovic, and that he falsely represented to the court at the hearing that he could not remember what happened in the case because he did not have a file. We agree with respondent, overrule the finding of the trial court, and grant this exception. However, respondent does not except to the finding that he violated MRPC 8.4(d) by failing to appear for trial. We hold that respondent did violate MRPC 8.4(d) when considering that portion of the finding. MRPC 8.4 states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-8\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">We first address the trial court\u2019s finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c) by lying to or deceiving the bar investigator, Mr. Biennas, when he indicated that the Greenhill case had been assigned to an associate, Ms. Djurickovic. As we stated, <em>supra, </em>Bar Counsel has not proven by clear and convincing evidence that respondent intended to mislead the bar investigator as to this allegation. Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s exception concerning his conversation with the bar investigator and overrule the hearing court\u2019s finding on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We next address Judge Mason\u2019s finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c) by falsely representing to the court at the hearing that he could not remember what happened in this case because he did not have a file. We have held that conduct before the hearing court at an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>disciplinary hearing cannot be the basis for a separate finding of a violation of MRPC 8.4 in the same proceeding on the charges already filed. We addressed this exact issue in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 361-62, 624 A.2d 503, 512 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Bar Counsel also contends that Judge Simpson\u2019s finding that Goldsborough was \u201cdeliberately untruthful\u201d in his testimony before the circuit court necessitated a finding that he violated Rule 8.4(c). While Goldsborough\u2019s conduct before the circuit court might be relevant in determining an appropriate sanction, it does not permit a separate finding of a Rule 8.4(c) violation. The charges brought against Golds-borough were based on his pattern'of conduct occurring <em>before </em>the petition for disciplinary action was filed in this Court. Due process considerations dictate that attorneys are entitled to notice of the charges against them when disciplinary proceedings begin. <em>[In re </em>] <em>Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. [544,] 550-51, 88 S.Ct. [1222,] 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d [117,] 122 [ (1968) ]. While the charges are not necessarily fixed until a petition is docketed in this Court, once the petition is docketed, the charges become fixed. <em>The existing charges cannot be expanded to include an attorney\u2019s post-charge conduct during the circuit court hearing itself </em>Judge Simpson\u2019s findings regarding Goldsborough\u2019s untruthfulness before the circuit court might serve as the basis for subsequent formal charges, but only after Goldsborough is provided adequate notice. Judge Simpson was correct in not finding a violation of Rule 8.4(c) based on Goldsborough\u2019s post-charge deliberate untruthfulness at the circuit court hearing. We therefore overrule Bar Counsel\u2019s exception. [Footnote omitted.] [Second emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Clearly, in respect to charges and allegations filed in a specific proceeding, the Disciplinary Rules are designed to address only possible violations, which arise out of an attorney\u2019s conduct prior to the disciplinary hearing in that proceeding in the circuit court. Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s exception concerning his hearing testimony and overrule the court\u2019s finding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Third, we address the court\u2019s finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 by failing to appear at Ms. Greenhill\u2019s trial. Failure to represent a client in an adequate manner violates MRPC 8.4(d). We held in <em>Ficker I, </em>319 Md. at 315, 572 A.2d at 506, that tardiness or absence from a trial may violate former Code DR 1-102(A)(5), which contained virtually the same text as current MRPC 8.4(d). As we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">Ficker knew precisely when Daley\u2019s trial was to be held and had agreed to be there. His negligent failure to be present at that trial interfered with the orderly disposition of the court\u2019s docket; a trial set for 9:00 a.m. had to be postponed until afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">We have held that failure to be punctual in a scheduled court appearance is \u201cnot only detrimental to the administration of justice but also constitute^] discourteous conduct degrading to the tribunal.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Howard, </em>282 Md. 515, 523, 385 A.2d 1191, 1196 (1978). We have held that an attorney who fails to appear punctually at a trial is guilty of a contempt of court. <em>Kandel v. State, </em>252 Md. 668, 250 A.2d 853 (1969). Misconduct of that sort is a contempt of court because it interferes with the conduct of court business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">[A]n attorney plays such an integral role in the judicial process that without his presence the wheels of justice must, necessarily, grind to a halt. The attorney\u2019s absence from the courtroom is immediately cognizable by the judge and intrudes upon the operation and dignity of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-7\"><em>Murphy v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 138, 146, 416 A.2d 748, 753 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">If being late for a scheduled court appearance interferes with the administration of justice, it is obvious that being altogether absent from a scheduled trial does so as well. As in the case of neglect, the circumstances surrounding the failure to appear and the actual consequences of that failure are matters that go to the question of sanction. [Alterations in original.] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>respondent concedes that no one from his firm made an appearance to represent Ms. Greenhill on her January 22, 1998 trial date. Respondent therefore violated MRPC 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Complaint of Betty Johnson</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The trial court found that respondent was in violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4 for his actions conducted in the representation of Clifton Haggins. Respondent was retained to represent Clifton Haggins, a minor, by his mother, Ms. Johnson. Mr. Haggins was facing attempted murder charges in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Respondent excepts to the findings that he violated MRPC 1.1,1.4, and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">a. MRPC 1.1 &amp; 1.3</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Respondent acknowledges that his office failed to file a reverse waiver motion as originally discussed with Ms. Johnson. He contends that this failure may constitute a violation of MRPC 1.3, but not a violation of MRPC 1.1. He argues that because the reverse waiver motion that was eventually filed was unsuccessful,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> not enough facts exist to establish whether such a motion, if timely, had a reasonable possibility of success. We disagree. The fact that the reverse waiver petition that was ultimately filed was unsuccessful generally has no bearing on whether respondent\u2019s failure to file it constituted incompetence. Respondent\u2019s failure, without explanation, to file a reverse waiver motion in a case in which a minor, who was fifteen at the time of the alleged offense, was facing attempted murder charges as an adult, under the circumstances of the case, constitutes a violation of both MRPC 1.1 and 1.3. This is especially so because his client\u2019s mother asked for such a motion to be filed and respondent told her that he was going to file it. As we said in <em>Kemp, </em>335 Md. at 9-10, 641 A.2d at 514:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">An attorney will be held to the ethical and performance standards of his or her profession. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Martin, </em>308 Md. 272, 518 A.2d 1050 (1987). The quality of a lawyer\u2019s representation is measured by the degree of legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation the lawyer brings to the representation. <em>See </em>Rule 1.1. Whether the representation the lawyer gives is incompetent or is merely careless or negligent depends upon what reasonably is necessary in the circumstances, <em>i.e. </em>the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Moreover, in determining whether a lawyer employs the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular matter, relevant factors include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">the relative complexity of the matter, the lawyer\u2019s general experience, the lawyer\u2019s training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give the matter and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Rule 1.1, comment, at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Competent handling of a particular matter includes inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem, and use of methods and procedures meeting the standards of competent practitioners, including adequate preparation in the circumstances. Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Looking at the facts and circumstances of this case, respondent was not merely careless or negligent; holding him to the standard of his profession, he was clearly incompetent. He was neither thorough nor adequately prepared in respect to his representation of Mr. Haggins. First, he was specifically asked by his client\u2019s mother about filing a petition to waive the jurisdiction of the circuit court. Second, he told her that he would file the petition as part of his representation. Third, he assigned the case to an associate without telling her that the client was a minor, that there had been a request that he file a petition for reverse waiver, and that he had agreed that he would file the petition. Finally, he neither filed the petition nor explained why not. As we noted in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brown, </em>308 Md. 219, 231-32, 517 A.2d 1111, 1117 (1986), individual errors may not constitute incompetence; however, numerous minor errors may be looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>upon, as a whole, as incompetence. His actions, or lack of action, concerning the reverse waiver motion constituted incompetence and violated MRPC 1.1! Accordingly we overrule respondent\u2019s exception to that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Respondent does not except to the finding that he violated MRPC 1.3 in failing to act with either diligence or promptness in representing his client. We still feel the need to briefly address that his actions were indeed in violation of MRPC 1.3. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Pinkney, </em>311 Md. 137, 141, 532 A.2d 1367, 1369 (1987), we disciplined an attorney who led her client to believe that she had filed a lawsuit on the client\u2019s behalf when in fact she had not. We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\u201cRespondent violated DR 6-101(A)(3)<footnotemark>[24]</footnotemark> by neglecting a legal matter entrusted to her. Respondent admitted that she set Ms. Manners\u2019 file aside from all of the others in her office and ignored it unless she heard from Ms. Manners. She also failed to adequately investigate and sufficiently research the matter to either establish that there was a cause of action or dissuade Ms. Manners from pursuing the claim if there was insufficient basis to file suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Clearly, respondent was in violation of MRPC 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">b. MRPC 1.4</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Respondent excepts to the finding that he violated MRPC 1.4 in failing to meet with his client, or otherwise discuss the case with Mr. Haggins or Ms. Johnson for a period of over four months. We shall overrule this exception. The testimony presented by Ms. Johnson is compelling. Between September 1997, when she retained respondent to represent her son, and January 1998, respondent had essentially no contact with his client or his client\u2019s mother. As Ms. Johnson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\">I called [respondent\u2019s] office, his secretary would answer and say that he wasn\u2019t there. If I got [respondent], he would say he was busy, and that he was going to go and see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>my son, or either he would be in Upper Marlboro, and it never happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Ms. Johnson continued to have problems tracking down respondent until March of 1998 when he told her that Ms. Djurickovic was handling the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Considering the evidence presented concerning the lack of work actually performed on Mr. Haggins case, the repeated pattern of respondent avoiding his clients, and the testimony of Ms. Johnson, we concur with the finding of the trial court. Accordingly, we hold that respondent was in violation of MRPC 1.4 for failing to communicate with his client for a period of at least four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">c. MRPC 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Respondent also excepts to Judge Mason\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 8.4 in accepting Mr. Haggins\u2019 case for representation and thereafter taking no action to provide representation and further misrepresenting to his client\u2019s mother that he was taking such efforts. We overrule this exception. He also excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 8.4 by attempting to mislead the court by testifying that he had believed that he had given the case to Ms. Djurickovic in a timely fashion and reasonably believed that she was doing that which was necessary. We grant this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The relevant provisions of MRPC 8.4 have already been stated, <em>supra. </em>We agree that insufficient action was taken by respondent and that he misrepresented to the client\u2019s mother that he was \u201ctaking such efforts.\u201d The record reflects that on numerous occasions respondent told Ms. Johnson things that were not true: (1) he told her that he was going to file a petition for reverse waiver; and (2) that he was going to visit her son in jail. He performed neither of these activities.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> His comments were made with the intent to mislead his client and his client\u2019s mother. The evidence presented justifies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>finding of misconduct under MRPC 8.4. Accordingly, we overrule respondent\u2019s exception with regard to his misrepresentations to Ms. Johnson and Mr. Haggins.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">We do, as we have indicated, grant respondent\u2019s exception to Judge Mason\u2019s finding that he falsely testified to the hearing court that he believed he had given the case to Ms. Djurickovic in a timely fashion and reasonably believed that she was taking necessary action. As we stated, <em>supra, </em>conduct before the circuit court at an attorney disciplinary hearing cannot be the basis for a separate finding of a violation of MRPC 8.4 in the same proceeding. Judge Mason erred in making such a finding. Therefore, we overrule the trial court\u2019s finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 with respect to his hearing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Complaint of Melvin Postell</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The trial court found that respondent was in violation of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.3, 8.1, and 8.4 for his actions conducted in the representation of Melvin Postell. Respondent excepts to all of the court\u2019s findings in regard to the Postell matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">a. MRPC 1.1, 1.3, &amp; 1.4</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">On the day of Mr. Postell\u2019s trial, an unknown member of respondent\u2019s staff told Mr. Postell over the telephone that he did not need to appear at the trial. In reliance on this information, Mr. Postell did not appear for trial on March 30, 1998. No representative from respondent\u2019s office appeared for the trial. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>an attorney\u2019s failure to appear in court for his client\u2019s trial, without sufficient explanation, is a violation of MRPC 1.1. The same logic applies here, except in this case, respondent not only failed to appear for the scheduled trial, his office also incorrectly told his client that he need not appear as well. Based on respondent\u2019s failure to appear at trial and his office\u2019s providing incorrect legal advice, we hold that he violated MRPC 1.1. Accordingly, we sustain that finding of the trial court and overrule respondent\u2019s exception. As we discussed, <em>supra, </em>respondent\u2019s failure to appear for his client\u2019s trial, also constitutes a violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>MRPC 1.3. The additional consideration that respondent\u2019s office incorrectly told Mr. Postell that he did not need to appear for his trial simply adds to the incompetency of this particular representation. Accordingly, we sustain the trial court\u2019s finding and overrule the respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Respondent excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 1.4 by failing to keep Mr. Postell informed about the status of his case. Keeping the client informed is a basic responsibility of an attorney. Through MRPC 5.3, which we discuss, <em>infra, </em>this responsibility to communicate may include communications between a client and an attorney\u2019s staff. MRPC 1.4(a) states in relevant part that \u201c[a] lawyer shall keep a client <em>reasonably informed about the status of a matter. </em>...\u201d (emphasis added). Additionally, the comment to MRPC 1.4 states that the \u201c[a]dequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance involved.\u201d When Mr. Postell called respondent\u2019s office, he was incorrectly told that he did not need to appear for his scheduled trial. That is not the furnishing of reasonable information to a client. Mr. Postell relied on that incorrect information to his detriment. Respondent did not keep Mr. Postell reasonably informed. In fact, Mr. Postell would have been better off had respondent\u2019s office given him no advice, rather than incorrect advice. We therefore overrule respondent\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">b. MRPC 5.3 (Responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Respondent excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 5.3. The trial court found that respondent failed to make any reasonable efforts to ensure that his administrative staff would accurately inform the clients of the status of their case. Obviously, reasonable efforts were not taken in the Postell case to ensure that respondent\u2019s nonlawyer assistants conducted themselves in a manner compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer. There is no other explanation for a member of his office staff to incorrect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>ly tell a client that he did not need to attend his own trial. MRPC 5.3 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-4\">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">(b) a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over the nonlawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person\u2019s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Respondent is responsible for the errors of his staff. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201cAn attorney may not escape responsibility to his clients by blithely saying that any shortcomings are solely the fault of his employee.\u201d <em>[Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldberg, </em>292 Md. 650, 655, 441 A.2d 338, 341 (1982).] An attorney must ascertain that his or her employees perform their responsibilities in a competent manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">Maryland Rules 5.3(b) and (c) concern a lawyer\u2019s duty to supervise employees; Rule 5.3(a) concerns operating procedures and measures. Rule 5.3(b) requires an attorney to make reasonable efforts to ensure that employees\u2019 conduct is compatible with the lawyer\u2019s professional obligations. Rule 5.3(c) holds a lawyer responsible for conduct of an employee that would be a violation of the rules of professional conduct if the lawyer orders, or with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved, or if the lawyer is a partner or direct supervisor over the employee and, knowing of the conduct, fails to take reasonable remedial action to avoid the consequences of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\"><em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 479-80, 671 A.2d at 478. To have a situation where a member of an attorney\u2019s staff, on behalf of that attorney, gives a client incorrect advice, which results in the client being incarcerated for two days, leads to no other conclusion but that respondent violated MRPC 5.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>c. MRPC 8.1</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">Respondent excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 8.1. The court found that respondent falsely informed the bar investigator that he had assigned the case to his associate. Concerning his failure to appear, respondent indicated to Mr. Biennas that he had assigned the case to Ms. Djurickovic. Ms. Djurickovic testified that she had never been assigned Mr. Postell\u2019s case and only became aware of it after the failure to appear, when Mr. Postell\u2019s call was forwarded to her. Because of her testimony and because (1) the trial was set for March 30, 1998 and, according to the exhibits, respondent did not enter his appearance in this case until March 26, 1998; and (2) respondent, not Ms. Djurickovic, drafted the motion to rescind the bench warrant, the court found that he gave the bar investigator false information. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">As discussed in the Greenhill case, <em>supra, </em>the evidence in the Postell case does not support a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated MRPC 8.1 by telling the bar investigator that \u201che believed the case had been assigned to the associate.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is respondent\u2019s contention that he told the bar investigator that he believed that the Postell case had been assigned to Ms. Djurickovic based on his knowledge that ninety to ninety-five percent of the cases in his office, which were pending in Prince George\u2019s County were handled by Ms. Djurickovic, that Mr. Postell\u2019s case was in Prince George\u2019s County, and he could not find Mr. Postell\u2019s file. In other words, according to him, he assumed that he had assigned the case to her and gave an answer that reflected that assumption. Just as we held that the evidence does not support a finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.1 in the Greenhill case, we hold the same in the Postell case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s exception as to the MRPC 8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">d. MRPC 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Respondent excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 8.4. The trial court found that because respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.3, and 8.1, he also violated MRPC 8.4(a), which states, \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Profession Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.\u201d Because we have held, <em>supra, </em>that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 5.3, we hold that he also violated MRPC 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Judge Mason\u2019s finding that respondent violated 8.4(c) was based on his belief that respondent attempted to deceive the bar investigator regarding his handling of the case and on respondent\u2019s lack of candor concerning the motion to rescind the bench warrant. We do not agree. Judge Mason\u2019s finding as to this issue is not supported by clear and convincing evidence. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>there is insufficient evidence presented in the record that respondent attempted to mislead the bar investigator. Bar Counsel\u2019s assertion that respondent lacked candor in his motion to rescind the bench warrant also falls short of a MRPC 8.4 violation. Bar Counsel never charged respondent with a violation of MRPC 3.3 (Candor toward the tribunal).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Additionally, the trial court\u2019s finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 when he testified that he could not recall what his investigation revealed in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>also fails based on our discussion, <em>supra, </em>that conduct before the circuit court at an attorney disciplinary hearing cannot be the basis for a separate finding of a violation of MRPC 8.4 in the same proceeding. As such, trial court\u2019s finding was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Complaint of Dee Dee Cunningham</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Respondent was retained by Ms. Cunningham to represent her in connection with an assault trial scheduled for May 28, 1998. In his representation of Ms. Cunningham, the trial court found that respondent violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, and 8.4. We agree with all the findings of the trial court except the finding that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 based on possible false testimony before the hearing court in this disciplinary matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">a. MRPC 1.1, 1.3, &amp; 1.4</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Respondent excepts to the trial court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 1.1. We disagree with respondent, overrule his objection, and sustain the finding of the court. Respondent\u2019s failure, without sufficient explanation, to subpoena witnesses and to obtain medical records, which may have exculpated his client, and which were specifically brought to respondent\u2019s attention by his client, is a violation of MRPC 1.1. Additionally, he assigned the case to Ms. Djurickovic without telling her about the existence of the witnesses or medical file. Looking at the facts and circumstances of this case, respondent was incompetent. He was neither thorough nor adequately prepared in his representation of Ms. Cunningham. As we noted in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Sinclair, </em>302 Md. 581, 589, 490 A.2d 236, 240 (1985), failure to contact witnesses except one hostile to his client\u2019s claim, and adequately to investigate the facts giving rise to his client\u2019s injuries, constituted a violation of MRPC 1.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheehy, </em>298 Md. 371, 378, 470 A.2d 341, 344 (1984) (inadequate preparation of client\u2019s case\u2014naming an obviously improper party when the names of the proper defendants were readily discoverable\u2014filing the complaint on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the day before the statute of limitations was to run). Additionally, as we noted in <em>Brown, </em>308 Md. at 231-32, 517 A.2d at 1117, the individual errors may not constitute incompetence; however, numerous minor errors may, as a whole, constitute incompetence. Respondent\u2019s failure to subpoena witnesses, collect the medical file, and failure to tell the associate handling the case of their existence constitutes incompetence and a violation of MRPC 1.1. Accordingly we overrule respondent\u2019s exception to that finding. Under this same rationale, we hold that respondent violated MRPC 1.3 and overrule respondent\u2019s exception to that finding as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Respondent excepts to the finding that he violated MRPC 1.4 in failing to respond to any of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s phone calls or correspondence prior to the trial and in failing to respond to her letter of June 12, 1998. We also overrule this exception. After the initial consultation, respondent never answered or returned any of Ms. Cunningham\u2019s telephone calls. Respondent, at the last minute, sent his associate, Ms. Djurickovic, to handle the trial. Because of respondent\u2019s failures, she was grossly unprepared and Ms. Cunningham was convicted. After Ms. Cunningham\u2019s conviction, respondent continued to avoid her telephone calls and virtually ignored her letter of June 12, 1998. Considering the evidence presented concerning the lack of work actually performed on Ms. Cunningham\u2019s case, the repeated pattern of respondent avoiding his clients, and the testimony of Ms. Cunningham, we concur with the finding of the trial court. Accordingly, we hold that respondent violated MRPC 1.4 for failing to communicate with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">b. MRPC 5.1 (Responsibilities of a partner or supervisory lawyer)</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Respondent excepts to the court\u2019s finding that he violated MRPC 5.1. We disagree with respondent\u2019s argument and sustain the finding. MRPC 5.1 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">(a) A partner in a law firm shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the rules of professional conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">We conclude that the system set up by respondent to provide files to Ms. Djurickovic for Prince George\u2019s County cases was woefully inadequate. It was not reasonably designed to make sure that Ms. Djurickovic received the files in a timely fashion and to ensure that she received notice that she had been assigned to a given case. As a result, she was unable to provide Ms. Cunningham with adequate representation in her trial. As a partner, it was respondent\u2019s responsibility to make reasonable efforts to ensure measures were in effect in his office to assure compliance with the MRPC. Clearly, no such measures were in place; thus, respondent violated MRPC 5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">c. MRPC 8.4</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Respondent excepts to the trial courts finding that he violated MRPC 8.4 by virtue of the violations of the rules of professional conduct as set out, <em>supra, </em>by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information regarding Ms. Cunningham\u2019s complaint and by attempting to mislead the court by testifying that he could not recall what had occurred in this case. We agree that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 with regard to his violations of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4 and 5.1. However, we disagree that respondent violated MRPC 8.4 with regard to responding to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information and by attempting to mislead the court by testifying that he could not recall what had occurred in this case. A violation of MRPC 8.1(b) was not alleged in this proceeding.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Regarding respondent\u2019s supposed false testimony, as we discussed, <em>supra, </em>conduct before the circuit court at an attorney disciplinary hearing cannot be the basis for a separate finding of a violation of MRPC 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>III. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Regarding the proper sanction to apply in an attorney grievance case, we noted recently that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agd\">\u201c[t]he purpose of disciplinary proceedings against an attorney is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Com\u2019n v. Hamby, </em>322 Md. 606, 611, 589 A.2d 53, 56 (1991). \u201cThe public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm. v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). The severity of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case before this Court. <em>Hamby, </em>322 Md. at 611, 589 A.2d at 56. Imposing a sanction protects the public interest \u201cbecause it demonstrates to members of the legal profession the type of conduct which will not be tolerated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 631-32, 714 A.2d 856, 864 (1998) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Bar Counsel recommends that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law without prejudice to his right to apply for reinstatement after three years. Bar Counsel also recommends that respondent pay for, attend, and complete a legal ethics course, and that he be supervised by a monitor for a period of two years should he be reinstated. Respondent submits that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. David, </em>331 Md. 317, 323, 628 A.2d 178, 181 (1993), we suspended an attorney indefinitely from the practice of law because the attorney\u2019s representation of four clients was marked by serious neglect and inattention; he \u201cfailed to return a fee, which was unearned for a period of nine months; he failed to timely remit funds he received on behalf of a client; he failed to communicate with his clients; and in connection with the investigation of three of the complaints, [he] failed to answer Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We granted him the right to apply for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>reinstatement after the suspension had been in effect for six months. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 644, 709 A.2d 1212, 1222 (1998), we also imposed an indefinite suspension upon an attorney who committed misconduct under MRPC 8.4. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 296, 725 A.2d 1069, 1081 (1999), we suspended an attorney indefinitely with the right to apply for reinstatement after one year for violations of MRPC 1.4, 3.1, 3.3, 5.5, 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">We have also ordered that suspended attorneys who are reinstated to the Bar of Maryland may be subject to the supervision of a monitor. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">Since the Bailey<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark> and <em>Finlay</em>son<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark> cases, it has become relatively common to require monitoring appropriate to the circumstances as a condition of reinstatement after a suspension for disciplinary violations that concern competency. Typically the requirement has stated generally that the monitor \u201coversee\u201d the practice of the sanctioned lawyer. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Brugh, </em>353 Md. 475, 727 A.2d 913 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kuhn, </em>353 Md. 423, 726 A.2d 1269 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Perweiler, </em>353 Md. 312, 726 A.2d 238 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>353 Md. 85, 724 A.2d 666 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Domingues, </em>352 Md. 395, 722 A.2d 883 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Consistent with <em>Alison, David, </em>and <em>Brown, </em>we find an indefinite suspension to be the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>conduct. The number and similarities of the complaints before this Court are of great concern. We note that while we have generally suspended lawyers who for the first time have been found to have violated rules relating to competency; we have disbarred subsequent offenders. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Judge Mason also determined that respondent did not violate MRPC 5.3 (Responsibilities regarding nonlawyer assistants) and 7.1 (Communications concerning a lawyer\u2019s services) in the representation of Ms. Greenhill. Concerning MRPC 5.3, the court found that the staff gave the client\u2019s messages to respondent; he simply failed to respond. Concerning MRPC 7.1, the court found that the statements contained in the letter were not false or misleading at the time that they were made. There was no evidence before the court that respondent did not intend to live up to the promise of his letter, even though he did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b147-9\">. Respondent offered conflicting statements as to when he assigned the case to Ms. Djurickovic.

As to the sanction, I would impose an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>With respect to Rule 8.1, I would overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing court\u2019s findings that he lied to or deceived the bar investigator, Mr. Biennas, when Respondent indicated that the Greenhill, Postell and Cunningham cases had been assigned to Ms. Djurickovic. The hearing judge is in the best position to assess credibility of witnesses. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999) (noting that trial judge \u201cis in the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Judge Mason considered all the testimony before him, including Respondent\u2019s denial of a critical statement to the investigator, and concluded that Respondent \u201cmade a false representation to the investigator for bar counsel when he told him that he believed the case had been assigned to the associate, which he does not want to admit.\u201d Judge Mason did exactly what this Court has suggested he should have done, i.e., provided this Court with a credibility finding, and the basis therefor. The judge wrote, in his findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avu\">Mr. Mooney\u2019s testimony that he can\u2019t say what happened here because he can\u2019t find Ms. Greenhill\u2019s file is very troubling. The Court does not believe Mr. Mooney would need the file to be able to recall what had occurred. Mr. Mooney, or at the least his office, was immediately notified by Ms. Greenhill of the failure to appear at trial. It is inconceivable to the Court that Mr. Mooney, once aware of the failure to appear, would not investigate what had happened. Even if the secretary who spoke to Ms. Greenhill about the failure to appear failed to give the message to Mr. Mooney, Ms. Greenhill spoke to him in person within a few weeks of that date. Therefore, at the very least, Mr. Mooney would have investigated what had occurred within a few weeks of the failure to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">If Mr. Mooney hadn\u2019t investigated the matter prior to February 20, 1998, then certainly he would have investigated it when he got the letter from bar counsel of that date. Ultimately, when he responds to bar counsel after a second letter, he says he delayed responding because he \u201cwanted to investigate the allegations.\u201d In his letter to Ms. Greenhill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>he states \u201cwhen I became aware of your allegations, I immediately investigated the situation.\u201d He also tells her that as a result of his investigation he has hired an office manager to oversee staff and instruct his staff on how to answer the phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">The Court simply finds it inconceivable that Mr. Mooney could have investigated this failure to appear, as a result of the investigation hired an office manager (and fired his secretary according to his letter to bar counsel), and now can\u2019t remember what his investigation revealed! Instead, the Court concludes that Mr. Mooney has taken this position because his investigation revealed that Ms. Djurickovic had never received this file as she testified. This means he made a false representation to the investigator for bar counsel when he told him that he believed the case had been assigned to the associate, which he does not want to admit. Although Mr. Mooney denies making such a statement to bar counsel, the Court finds that he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">This finding is supported by clear and convincing evidence. We tell juries that they are not required to accept every farfetched fairy tale; neither are trial judges. Because I find sufficient evidence to support Judge Mason\u2019s finding that Respondent attempted to mislead the bar investigator, I would also overrule the exception regarding Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">As to the sanction, I would impose an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after one year. Repeated neglect of client matters and incompetency are no small matters. Neither is intentionally misleading or misrepresenting to bar counsel. Indeed, both are serious rule violations. <em>See Chang v.
