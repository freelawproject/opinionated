The Trial Court <em>(Morris, </em>J.) found defendant in violation of RSA ch. 319-A (Supp. 1973) and permanently enjoined defendant from the practice of land surveying \u201cuntil and unless he becomes registered as a land surveyor pursuant to the provisions of RSA 319-A (Supp. 1973).\u201d The trial court reserved and transferred the defendant\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Defendant\u2019s exceptions and the issues briefed by the parties concern the validity of RSA ch. 319-A (Supp. 1973) as it is applied to the defendant. However, because of certain events which are alleged to have occurred some months after the case was reserved and transferred to this court, it does not appear appropriate to determine the case upon the present state of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Defendant\u2019s brief asserts that he took the land surveyor\u2019s qualify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ing examination on June 1, 1974, and was notified in October of 1974 that he had qualified for certification as a surveyor in training. The defendant further states in his brief that he has returned his application and fee for such certification but that he still has not received his certificate. At the time of the trial in the superior court, the only facts before the court in relation to defendant\u2019s qualifications were that he was a registered professional engineer in New Hampshire, a licensed land surveyor in Maine, and that in 1971 he had failed the land surveyors examination in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">If the facts alleged by the defendant are correct, he may now be entitled to registration. This would dispose of the case since the injunction is terminable upon the defendant becoming \u201cregistered as a land surveyor in the State of New Hampshire pursuant to the provisions of RSA 319-A (Supp. 1973).\u201d We therefore remand the case to permit the superior court to determine whether the new issues raised by defendant are material or dispositive of the case. <em>Caron v.
