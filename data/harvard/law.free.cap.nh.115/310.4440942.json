Written comment from members of the bar was invited by the court and interested members of the bar who desired to be heard orally argued on February 7, 1975. Paul R. Cox, Esq., and Laurence F. Gardner, Esq., of the committee and Robert H. Reno, Esq., submitted written comments and argued orally. Honorable Charles G. Douglas III, Jerome L. Silverstein, Esq., and Frederic T. Greenhalge, Esq., submitted written comments and suggestions. Edward J. Haseltine, a lay member of the committee, commented orally on the rules at the hearing. We have considered comments and suggestions relating to all of the proposed rules, and with the changes noted, the proposed rules replace the present Supreme Court Rule 26 and are attached to this opinion in their corrected form.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We approve effective July 25, 1975, the proposed rules and the rules of procedure subject to the following changes:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">1. Rule 12 is eliminated as it is covered in rule 1 A. The remaining rules 13 through 18 are renumbered to conform to this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">2. The second sentence of rule 1 B is amended to read: \u201cIt is the duty of every recipient of that right to conduct himself at all times in conformity with the standards imposed upon members of the bar as conditions for the right to practice law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">3. Rule 3 C 4, second sentence, shall read: \u201cUpon the approval of such findings and recommendations, the committee can dismiss the complaint, administer private reprimand, or institute and oversee the prosecution of formal disciplinary proceedings in this Court as the case may be.\u201d The word \u201cparty\u201d in the second sentence of Rule 3 C 5 is changed to \u201cattorney\u201d. Rule 3 G 5, next to last sentence, \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">4. Rule 7 is amended to add after the first sentence a new sentence to read as follows: \u201cFunds of a client, and funds in which a client has an interest shall be deposited in a trust account and shall in no way be commingled with the fundsof an attorney or the fundsofthe firm of the attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">5. The last sentence of rule 7 is amended to read: \u201cThe Court may at any time order an audit of such financial records or trust accounts of an attorney and take such other action as it deems necessary to protect the public.\u201d The sentence as originally proposed permitted audit of \u201can attorney\u2019s financial records\u201d and was objectionable on self-incrimination grounds under the rule laid down in <em>Spevack v. Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511 (1967). In our opinion the limitation of the audit to records and accounts which an attorney is required by rule of court to maintain for the protection of the public avoids this constitutional objection. Andr<em>esen v. Bar Association, </em>269 Md. 313, 305 A.2d 845 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1065 (1973); <em>see In re Scull, </em>63 N.J. 108, 305 A.2d 70 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">6. Rule 14 E, first sentence, \u201cmay\u201d instead of \u201cshall\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">7. It was suggested subsequent to the oral arguments that we add to rule 7 a requirement that attorneys annually certify to the clerk of this court their maintenance of trust accounts as required by rule 7. While this suggestion appears to have merit we are not disposed to adopt this addition to rule 7 without an opportunity to the bar to be heard. If the committee desires to submit such an amendment, it may be considered at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The comments and suggestions from interested members of the bar have been helpful and have resulted in some of the modifications we have made in the proposed rules. In view of the nature of some suggestions which we have rejected, it appears desirable to offer some explanation of our reasons for not adopting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The suggestion that the committee should only act upon written complaint and provide all the due process safeguards of a trial appears to misconstrue the functions of the committee. The rules permit the committee to conduct an investigation upon a complaint or upon its own motion. When the investigation is completed, the committee may dismiss the matter, bring a formal complaint to the court, or issue a private reprimand to the attorney. In the event of a reprimand, the attorney may appeal to the court and obtain a hearing. No publicity is attendant upon the committee investigation, and if the complaint is unjustified, the action of the committee has protected the attorney from unwarranted publicity and damage to the attorney\u2019s reputation. In the event of an appeal from a reprimand or in the event of a formal complaint to this court, rule 15 (new rule 14) provides the respondent-attorney with complete due process protection. The proposed rule as adopted (effective June 23, 1974) is in accord with the recommendations contained in the report of the American Bar Association Special Committee on Evaluation of Disciplinary Enforcement, Problems and Recommendations in Disciplinary Enforcement 71, 92 (Final Draft, June 1970) [hereinafter cited as Clark Report].</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We have rejected the suggestion that rule 8, providing for suspension of an attorney convicted of a serious crime as therein defined, should be eliminated. \u201cNo single facet of disciplinary enforcement is more to blame for any lack of public confidence in the integrity of the bar than the policy that permits a convicted attorney to practice while apparently enjoying immunity from discipline.\u201d Clark Report 124. The integrity of the bar and the protection of the public dictate the summary suspension permitted by this rule during the period of any appeal from conviction of a serious crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">We have also rejected objections to rule 5 which extends the absolute privilege given to statements in court (W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 114 (4th ed. 1971)) to statements made in disciplinary proceedings providing they are made in good faith. It denies the privilege to statements made other than to the court, committee or attorney general. This is in accord with what we believe to be the better rule. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>( See </em>Annot., 77 A.L.R.2d 493 (1961); <em>Ramstead v.

Expenses Relating to Discipline Enforcement 326</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">1. <em>Discipline Matters in General:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">A. <em>Jurisdiction: </em>Any attorney admitted to practice law in this State or any attorney specially admitted to practice by a court of this State is subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of this Court and the Committee as hereinafter defined. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to deny to any other court such powers as are necessary for that court to maintain control over proceedings conducted before it, such as the power of contempt. Suspension or disbarment of an attorney shall not terminate jurisdiction of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">B. <em>Grounds For Discipline: </em>The right to practice law in this State is predicated upon the assumption that the holder is fit to be entrusted with professional matters and to aid in the administration of justice as an attorney and as an officer of the Court. It is the duty of every recipient of that right to conduct himself at all times in conformity with the standards imposed upon members of the bar as conditions for the right to practice law.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Acts or omissions by an attorney individually or in concert with any person or persons which violate the standards of professional responsibility that have been and any that may be from time to time hereafter approved or adopted by this Court, shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">C. <em>Priority of Discipline Matters: </em>Matters relating to discipline of an attorney shall take precedence over all other civil cases in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">2. <em>Definitions:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">A. <em>Committee: </em>\u201cCommittee\u201d means Committee on Professional Conduct or any successor committee designated to receive and investigate complaints against attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">B. <em>Bar Counsel: </em>\u201cBar Counsel\u201d means the attorney or attorneys responsible for the prosecution of all the disciplinary proceedings before the Court, the Committee or any hearing panel. The Committee shall designate one or more active members of the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Hampshire Bar Association other than one of their number, to act as Bar Counsel in the investigation and presentation of evidence in the matter under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">3. <em>Committee On Professional Conduct:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">A. The Court shall appoint a Committee to be known as the Committee On Professional Conduct (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cCommittee\u201d) which shall consist of fifteen members one of whom shall be designated by the Court as the Chairman and another as the Vice Chairman to act in the absence or disability of the Chairman. There shall be one member of the Committee from each county in the State or such other districts as the Court may designate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">B. When the Committee is first selected, five of its members shall be appointed for a term of one year, five for a term of two years and five members for a term of three years and thereafter all regular terms shall be three years. No member shall serve for more than three consecutive terms, but he may be reappointed after a lapse of one year. The Committee shall act only with the concurrence of a majority of its members present and voting, provided, however, that eight members shall constitute a quorum.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">C. The Committee shall have the power and duty:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">1. To consider and investigate the conduct of any attorney within the jurisdiction of this Court and may initiate any such investigation on its own motion or may undertake the same upon complaint by any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">2. To appoint a Bar Counsel and such assistant Bar Counsel as may from time to time be required to properly perform the functions hereinafter prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">3. To appoint as may be necessary and in the discretion of the Committee, hearing panels consisting of three members and to assign to such hearing panels complaints concerning charges of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">4. To make a determination either on its own findings or after review of findings by a hearing panel as to whether or not such conduct warrants dismissal, private reprimand or formal disciplinary proceedings in this Court. Upon the approval of such findings and recommendations, the committee can dismiss the complaint, administer private reprimand, or institute and oversee the prosecution of formal disciplinary proceedings in this Court as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">5. To reprimand attorneys subject to the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>this Court for misconduct by issuing a letter of discipline. Any attorney aggrieved by a letter of discipline issued by the Committee shall have the right to appeal such discipline to the Court. Such right must be exercised within thirty days from receipt of the letter of discipline. 1'he manner of appeal shall be determined by the Court. The Court may refer the appeal to a judge or referee in the same manner as provided in Rule 14. Such discipline may be affirmed, modified or reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">6. To adopt rules of procedure not inconsistent with the rules promulgated by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">7. To appoint such investigative and other personnel as the Committee shall deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">4. <em>Bar Counsel:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">A. The Committee shall appoint a Bar Counsel and such Assistant Bar Counsel as may be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">B. Counsel shall have the power and duty to prosecute all disciplinary proceedings before hearing panels, the Committee and this Court as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">C. Counsel shall appear at hearings conducted with respect to motions for reinstatement by suspended or disbarred attorneys, cross-examine witnesses testifying in support of the motion and marshall available evidence, if any, in opposition thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">D. Within the budgetary authorization approved by the Committee, Counsel shall appoint such investigative and other personnel as Bar Counsel shall deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">5. <em>Immunity: </em>Each person shall be immune from civil liability for all of his statements made in good faith to the Committee, the office of the Attorney General or to this Court or given in any investigation or proceedings pertaining to alleged misconduct of an attorney. The protection of this immunity does not exist as to statements made to others. The Committee, its staff, counsel, investigators and any members of the Hearing Panels, shall be immune from civil liability for any conduct arising out of the performance of their duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">6. <em>Subpoena Power For The Committee: </em>At any stage of an investigation witnesses may be summoned by subpoena issued by the Court upon request of the Committee or a respondent attorney. Witnesses before the Committee shall be examined under oath or affirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>7. <em>Attorney\u2019s Financial Records: </em>Every attorney shall maintain complete records of the handling, maintenance and disposition of all funds, securities and other properties of a client at any time in his possession from the time of receipt to the time of final distribution and shall preserve such records for a period of six years after final distribution of such funds, securities or other properties or any portion thereof. Funds of a client and funds in which a client has an interest shall be deposited in a trust account and shall in no way be commingled with the funds of an attorney or the funds of the firm of the attorney. The Court may at any time order an audit of such financial records or trust accounts of an attorney and take such other action as it deems necessary to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">8. <em>Attorneys Convicted Of Serious Crimes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A. Upon the filing with the Court of a certified copy of any Court record establishing that an attorney has been convicted of a serious crime as hereinafter defined, the Court may enter an order suspending the attorney, whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, and regardless of the pendency of an appeal, pending final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">B. The term \u201cserious crime\u201d shall include any felony and any lesser crime a necessary element of which, as determined by the statutory or common law definition of such crime, involves interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft, or an attempt or a conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a \u201cserious crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">C. A certified copy of any Court record establishing the conviction of an attorney for any \u201cserious crime\u201d shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding instituted against him based upon the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">D. Upon the receipt of a certificate of conviction of an attorney for a \u201cserious crime\u201d, the Court may, and shall if suspension has been ordered pursuant to sub-paragraph A above, institute a forr mal disciplinary proceeding and refer the matter to a referee, in which the sole issue to be determined shall be the extent of the final discipline to be imposed provided that a disciplinary proceeding so instituted will not be brought to hearing until all appeals from the conviction are concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>E. Upon receipt of a certificate of a conviction of an attorney for a crime not constituting a \u201cserious crime\u201d, the Court shall refer the matter to the Committee for whatever action it may deem warranted including the institution of an investigation, provided, however, that the Court may in its discretion make no reference with respect to convictions for minor offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">F. An attorney suspended under the provisions of \u201cA\u201d above may be reinstated upon the filing of a certificate demonstrating that the underlying conviction for a serious crime has been reversed but the reinstatement will not terminate any proceeding then pending against the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">G. The clerk of any court within the State in which an attorney is convicted of any crime shall, within ten days of said conviction, transmit a certificate thereof to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">H. Upon being advised that an attorney has been convicted of a crime within this State, the Committee shall determine whether the clerk of the Court where the conviction occurred has forwarded a certificate to this Court in accordance with the provisions of \u201cG\u201d above. If the certificate has not been forwarded by the clerk or if the conviction occurred in another jurisdiction, it shall be the responsibility of the Committee to obtain a certificate of conviction and to transmit it to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">I. Whenever an attorney is indicted or bound over for any felony the Court shall take such actions as it deems necessary, including but not limited to the suspension of the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">9. <em>Proceedings Where An Attorney Is Declared To Be Incompetent Or Is Alleged To Be Incapacitated:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">A. Whenever an attorney has been judicially declared incompetent or voluntarily or involuntarily committed to a mental institution, the Court, upon proper proof of the fact, may enter an order suspending such attorney from the practice of law until the further order of the Court. A copy of such order shall be served upon such attorney, his guardian and such other persons and in such manner as the Court may direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">B. Whenever the Committee shall petition the Court to determine whether an attorney is incapacitated from continuing the practice of law by reason of mental or physical infirmity or illness or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, the Court may take or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>direct such action as it deems necessary or proper to determine whether the attorney is so incapacitated, including the examination of the attorney by such qualified medical experts as the Court shall designate. If, upon due consideration of the matter, the Court concludes that the attorney is incapacitated from continuing to practice law, it shall enter an order suspending him on the ground of such disability for an indefinite period and until the further order of the Court and any pending disciplinary proceeding against the attorney may be held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The Court shall provide for such notice to the respondent-attorney of proceedings in the matter as it deems proper and advisable and shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent if he is without adequate representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">C. If, during the course of a disciplinary proceeding, the respondent-attorney contends that he is suffering from a disability by reason of mental or physical infirmity or illness, or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, which makes it impossible for the respondent-attorney to adequately defend himself, the Court thereupon shall enter an order immediately suspending the respondent-attorney from continuing to practice law until a determination is made of the respondent-attorney\u2019s capacity to continue to practice law in a proceeding instituted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph \u201cB\u201d of this Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">If, in the course of a proceeding under this Rule or in a disciplinary proceeding, the Court shall determine that the respondent-attorney is not so incapacitated, it shall take such action as it deems proper and advisable including a direction for the resumption of the disciplinary proceeding against the respondent-attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">D. Any attorney suspended under the provisions of this Rule may apply for reinstatement following the expiration of one year from the date of suspension or at such other time as the Court may direct in the order of suspension or any modification thereof. Such application shall be granted by the Court upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney\u2019s disability has been removed and he is fit to resume the practice of law. Upon such application, the Court may take or direct such action as it deems necessary or proper to a determination of whether the attorney\u2019s disability has been removed including a direction for an examination of the attorney by such qualified medical experts as the Court shall designate.

At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing panel shall promptly file a report containing its findings and recommendations and transmit same, together with the record, to the Committee.

In the event that the Court decides to impose discipline, Bar Counsel shall cause an investigation to be made as to the respondent-attorney and to file such report with the Court.
