Const. pt. II, art. 74 may be doubtful. <em>See Opinion of the Justices, </em>95 N.H. 557, 66 A.2d 76 (1949). However, inasmuch as the legislative session is in its closing days, we return an answer, but this opinion will not be a precedent for similar questions that may be submitted in the future under article 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The medieval reasons for the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, decided in 1581, are no longer applicable. <em>See </em>28 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Estates </em>\u00a7 104, at 214 (1966). \u201cNo problem in present American law depends, for its solution, upon the policy considerations which functioned in the English history of the Rule.\u201d 3 R. Powell, Real Property \u00a7 378, at 284 (1970). It has been abolished by statute or common law in most jurisdictions. Annot., 99 A.L.R.2d 1161 (1965). In <em>Crockett v. Robinson, </em>46 N.H. 454 (1866), where the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case was applied, the court noted that the result was \u201ccontrary to the intention of the testator\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">We have no case in this State in which the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case has been applied since the <em>Crockett </em>case. Doubt was expressed in <em>Cloutman v. Bailey, </em>62 N.H. 44 (1882), as to whether this Rule had been adopted in this State, and its viability as applied to an estate created by conveyance is at least questionable in view of the language of RSA 477:24 and the emphasis which our cases place on the intention of the grantor as expressed in a deed, in order to determine the estate created. <em>In re Allaire Estate, </em>103 N.H. 318, 171 A.2d 191 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Without determining whether the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is now a part of our common law, our answer to your question is limited to statutory law. It is our opinion that the provisions of House bill 672 would be effective to eliminate by statute the effect of the Rule in Shelley\u2019s Case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-10\">Frank R.
