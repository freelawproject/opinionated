Bank of New Hampshire, National Association</parties>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADH\">November 28, 1975</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b778-10\"><em>Frederick J. Barry, </em>by brief and orally, pro se for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b778-11\"><em>Devine, Millimet, Stahl &amp; Branch, Luke S.

Thereafter counsel withdrew, and the plaintiff, acting pro se, on December 18, 1974, filed a motion to set the verdict aside. The motion was denied by <em>Mullavey, </em>J., who presided at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">The plaintiff submitted a proposed reserved case on February 18, 1975, which was after expiration of the time limited by superior court rule 69. RSA 491:App. R. 69 (Supp. 1973). The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment was granted on February 28, 1975, after a hearing at which the plaintiff sought relief from his failure to comply with rule 69, on the grounds of accident, mistake, or misfortune as provided by the introduction to the superior court rules. RSA 491:App. (Supp. 1973, at 100). On March 3, 1975 his proposed reserved case was denied by the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>siding justice \u201cas not being timely filed\u201d. His exception to this order was reserved and transferred to this court by <em>Mullavey, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">There is no question that rule 69 was not complied with. In consequence all exceptions were deemed waived on judgment day. Since there are no transcripts of the post-trial hearings in superior court, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiff relief from his failure to comply with rule 69. <em>Timberlane Regional Educational Association v. Crompton, </em>115 N.H. 616, 347 A.2d 612 (1975); <em>Gallo v. Century Broadcasting, </em>114 N.H. 810, 330 A.2d 780 (1974). The order implies a finding that justice did not require the relief sought, and the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent motion to remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exception overruled; judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
