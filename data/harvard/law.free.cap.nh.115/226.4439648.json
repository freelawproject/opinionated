Books and Material Containing Obscene Language Prohibited. Amend RSA 189 by inserting after section 26 the following new section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">\u201c189:26-a Books and Material Containing Obscene Language Prohibited. No person shall require the reading, as part of a course of instruction in a public elementary or secondary school, of any book or material which contains language which is obscene according to the definition of that term in RSA 650:1. Any person who violates this paragraph shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">\u201c2. Effective Date. This act shall take effect sixty days after its passage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The proposed enactment applies to any material \u201cwhich contains language\u201d which is obscene under RSA 650:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">This court has held that RSA 650:1 meets constitutional requirements. <em>State v. Harding, </em>114 N.H. 335, 320 A.2d 646 (1974). We are of the opinion also that the provisions of RSA 650:1 which purport to apply different standards to material designed for children from that designed for adults is constitutional. <em>Ginsburg v. New York, </em>390 U.S. 629, 638-43 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">In <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973), the Supreme Court laid down the constitutional guidelines for determining whether a work or material is obscene. They are: \u201c(a) whether \u2018the average person, applying contemporary community standards\u2019 would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, <em>Kois v. Wisconsin, supra </em>at 230, quoting <em>Roth v. United States, supra </em>at 489; (b) whether the work depicts or describes in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">It should be noted that these guidelines require considering the material as a whole, as does RSA 650:1. <em>See Kois v. Wisconsin, </em>408 U.S. 229 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">Consequently, we are of the opinion that the proposed legislation is of doubtful constitutionality, because it would proscribe requiring the reading of any book or material solely because it \u201ccontains language which is obscene\u201d, without also requiring consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>whether, \u201ctaken as a whole\u201d, it could be found to appeal to the prurient interest, and to lack serious value.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-5\">Frank R.
