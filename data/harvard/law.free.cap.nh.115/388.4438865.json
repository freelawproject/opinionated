The defendants filed motions to dismiss on the following grounds: (1) the matters have already been adjudicated, and (2) the actions are barred by the general statute of limitations (RSA 508:4 (Supp. 1973)) or by the specific one-year limitation pertaining to accounting by a mortgagee. RSA 479:17. The motions were heard by a Master <em>(Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) who made certain findings and rulings and recommended dismissal of the actions under RSA 508:4 (Supp. 1973). The recommendation was approved by <em>Grant, </em>J., who reserved and transferred plaintiff\u2019s exceptions. However, no appeal was pursued from the dismissal of the action against Howard and Bayside.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">The bank advertised a foreclosure sale of plaintiff\u2019s property to take place on August 6, 1963. Plaintiff secured a temporary injunction which was dissolved September 10, 1963. The master found that in the course of that proceeding the bank \u201cgave the plaintiff a statement of the moneys due under the mortgage, the amount, of the required monthly payments, the number that had been made, and the situation relative to taxes.\u201d The foreclosure sale was held February 26, 1964. Thereafter the bank filed a bill of interpleader in which the plaintiff and others were named defendants. The same master, as in this case, heard the matter making certain findings and recommendations as to the distribution of the funds interpleaded which were approved by <em>Leahy, </em>C.J., whose decision was sustained on appeal. <em>Exeter Co-operative Bank v. Clark, </em>100 N.H. 503, 256 A.2d 653 (1969). There was also introduced as an exhibit in the present case a request by the plaintiff addressed to the bank dated August 11, 1964, which sought an accounting of various items relating to the sale among which were lines, interest, and balance due.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The nature of the present action is to be determined not by the label of assumpsit attached to it in plaintiff\u2019s writ, but rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>by its substance. <em>Dunn &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Paragon Homes of New Eng., Inc., </em>110 N.H. 215, 217, 265 A.2d 5, 7 (1970); <em>Madbury v. State, </em>115 N.H. 196, 340 A.2d 103 (1975). The master properly found that plaintiff\u2019s action against the bank was \u201cbased upon alleged wrongful imposition of fines, imposing of interest, and failure to credit with payments.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s action is therefore in essence an action for an account by a mortgagee provided for by RSA 479:13. <em>Guarente v. Ginsberg, </em>101 N.H. 218, 223, 138 A.2d 456, 459 (1958). RSA 479:17 provides that: \u201cNo such petition shall be heard unless the same shall be entered in court within one year after ... payment, performance, tender, refusal or neglect.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s writ dated February 17, 1970, is more than one year after the sale of February 26, 1964, or the date the mortgage debt was extinguished in April 1964, or the date of plaintiff\u2019s demand for an accounting on August 11, 1964. We hold that the bank\u2019s motion to dismiss was proper under RSA 479:17 even though granted by the trial court under RSA 508:4 (Supp. 1973). <em>See Preston v. National Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>114 N.H. 212, 215, 317 A.2d 787, 789 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
