A verdict for the defendant by the Master who heard the parties <em>(Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) was approved by the Superior Court <em>(Batchelder, </em>J.) The case reaches this court on the plaintiff\u2019s bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The contract of the parties, executed under date of May 3, 1972, called for passage of title on or before June 15, 1972. Under the head of \u201cAdditional provisions\u201d, the cryptic phrase \u201cSubject to bank financing\u201d was inserted in the printed form. The plaintiff recognizes that the evidence indicated that \u201ca loan for 65% of the price at least was considered reasonable by both ....\u201d The defendant., a resident of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, with another resident of the same town as coapplicant, applied to the Merchants Savings Bank of Manchester for a 15-year mortgage loan of $416,000 with interest at 9 percent. On June 14, 1972, the bank notified the plaintiff seller and the buyer\u2019s co-applicant that a loan would be granted of $340,000. The loan was never consummated.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The plaintiff testified that he had offered to take a second mortgage for the difference of $76,000, but the master found that there was no evidence that this was ever agreed to by the defendant. There was evidence that a new agreement at a higher price was tendered by the plaintiff\u2019s real estate agent later in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In <em>Grayson v. LaBranche, </em>107 N.H. 504, 225 A.2d 922 (1967), this court held that a contract conditioned upon the buyer obtaining a \u201cconventional mortgage\u201d in an amount left blank was properly found in the light of all the evidence in that case to require a mortgage in a \u201creasonable amount.\u201d Despite the caveat contained in the Aiken article <em>\u201cSubject to Financing\u201d Clauses, </em>43 Marq. L. Rev. 265, 300 (1960), cited in the <em>Grayson </em>opinion which advised brokers, attorneys and parties to \u201cavoid such clauses as they would the plague\u201d, the record in this case would indicate little progress in the field. <em>See </em>Annot., 81 A.L.R.2d 1338 (1962) and Later Case Service; Friedman, <em>Buying a Home, </em>47 A.B.A.J. 596, 603 (1961). <em>But see </em>16 Am. Jur. Legal Forms 2d \u00a7 219.339 (1973); 8 C. Nichols, Cyclopedia of Legal Forms \u00a7 8.1159 b (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">A clause such as was employed in the contract before us provides no answer to the numerous questions likely to arise if financing is not forthcoming: financing in what amount and on what terms; who is to arrange and to whose satisfaction; will a second mortgage to the seller satisfy the requirement? <em>See </em>Aiken, 43 Marq. L. Rev 265, 266-70 (1960); <em>Reese v. Walker, </em>6 Ohio Op. 2d 55, 151 N.E.2d 605 (Cincinnati Mun. Ct. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In the case at bar the master found that, interpreted \u201cin terms of the action of the parties\u201d, the term \u201cbank financing\u201d meant the granting of a loan in the amount applied for. The plaintiff was found to be \u201ca practicing attorney and a man of considerable business experience.\u201d He testified \u201cwe discussed the method of financing. And since ... [Mr. Nolan ] was from Massachusetts, he was not familiar with New Hampshire practice, and I told him from past experience on commercial property, the commercial banks in New Hampshire usually do not go above 65 percent of the purchase price, and that\u2019s the figure that was submitted on the initial application to the Merchants Bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The record supports the master\u2019s findings that the condition precedent which meant to the parties the financing of a loan of $416,000 was never met.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The burden of proof was upon the plaintiff. 3A A. Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 749, at 468 (1960); 1 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 179, at 700 (3d ed. 1957). He requested a ruling that \u201can agreement by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the seller to take a second mortgage on the bank\u2019s terms... satisfies a condition of \u2018bank financing\u2019\u201d. He argues that the absence of a finding of fact as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s offer was communicated to the defendant and the lack of a ruling upon his request \u201chas left [the master\u2019s] decision incomplete\u201d so that the case should be remanded. Since the master found that the written contract contained no provision by amendment or otherwise which would cover such an offer, and that there was no evidence that the defendant \u201cever agreed to such an arrangement\u201d, a ruling upon the request became immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled; judgment for defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b237-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
