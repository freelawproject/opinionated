It was there pointed out that the failure to adequately define the \u201cnet project cost\u201d for which the governmental unit might be liable made the statute of questionable validity. The proposed legislation eliminates all reference to \u201cnet project cost\u201d as being an obligation of the governmental unit, thus removing this constitutional objection and would provide safeguards and standards not included in the existing statute RSA ch. 162-G.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">As we have so often stated before, we \u201ccannot predict every issue\u201d which adversaries might raise if Senate bill 1824s enacted. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>111 N.H. 199, 205, 278 A.2d 357, 361 (1971). We have examined the proposed legislation which on its face appears to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Whether industrial development should proceed locally under the proposed legislation or State-wide under the provision of RSA ch. 162-1 as inserted by Laws 1975, ch. 98 approved April 22, 1975, is a question of policy, wisdom, and procedure, determination of which is a legislative and not a judicial function.</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-9\">Frank R.
