Rudman, </em>attorney general, and <em>Robert V. Johnson II, </em>assistant attorney general, by brief for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-11\"><em>Carroll F.

The State was granted a pretrial psychiatric examination, and in response to the State\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>defendant\u2019s counsel filed notice of intent to rely on the defense of insanity as well as other defenses in accordance with Superior Court Rule 90-C and -D. RSA 628:2. The question of competency to stand trial was also raised by the State, but neither side moved for a hearing on that issue and the trial court decided not to conduct a hearing sua sponte. <em>See Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Defense counsel informed the trial court that defendant did not want to raise insanity as a defense and therefore had not signed the notice of intent filed by counsel. This notice has now been withdrawn. State\u2019s counsel indicated that the State would produce evidence of insanity at the trial and the defense moved for a bifurcated trial which the State opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The State moved that the grand jury be recalled so that it could determine whether, in view of presently available evidence, it would omit to indict by reason of insanity under RSA 651:8. Defense counsel objected and raised the question of the constitutionality of RSA 651:8 and :9.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">All questions of law raised by the various motions of the parties were reserved and transferred without ruling by <em>Keller, </em>C.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The trial court in its discretion has the authority to reconvene the grand jury as the State requests. If the grand jury should omit to find an indictment for the reason of insanity or mental derangement, and so certify to the court under RSA 651:8, committal under RSA 651:9 would require a due process hearing in accordance with RSA 135:30-a (Supp. 1973). Consequently we hold RSA 651:8 and :9 to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">We also hold that the trial court can in its discretion order a bifurcated trial reserving the issue of insanity at the time of the alleged offense to be determined at a later trial in the event the jury finds defendant committed the acts charged. Such bifurcation involves the exercise of the discretion which trial judges have always had to determine \u201cthe manner and timing of the trial of all or part of the issues in an action ... <em>.\u2019\u2019Jamestown Mut. Ins. Co. v. Meehan, </em>113 N.H. 639, 641, 312 A.2d 689, 691 (1973). No reasons exist for prescribing a different rule in criminal cases than in civil so long as due process is not denied the defendant. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Due Process and Bifurcated Trials, </em>66 Nw.
