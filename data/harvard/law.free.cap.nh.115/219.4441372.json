Would any provision of the constitution of the United States or of this state be violated by the provision of the bill that restricts the maximum finance charge permitted and which is applicable only to credit cards issued by a manufacturer or distributor of gasoline and related products for the purchase of gasoline, related products and services?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-11\">\u201cFurther resolved that the clerk of the senate be instructed to transmit to the clerk of the Supreme Court six copies of this resolution and six copies of House Bill number 253.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-12\">The following answer was returned:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b320-13\">\n<em>To the Honorable Senate:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-14\">The undersign\u00e9d justices of the supreme court return the following reply to the inquiries contained in your resolution adopted April 8, 1975, and filed with this court on April 11, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">Economic legislation, like the regulation of finance charges, to be constitutional must be based on some substantial and rational foundation. <em>Valley Bank v. State, </em>115 N.H. 151, 335 A.2d 652 (1975); <em>Granite State Grocers Ass\u2019n v. State Liquor Comm\u2019n, </em>112 N.H. 62, 66, 289 A.2d 399, 402 (1972); <em>Welch Co. v. State, </em>89 N.H. 428, 432, 199 A. 886, 888 (1938), <em>aff'd, </em>306 U.S. 79 (1939). Classifications, therefore, made by such legislation must reasonably promote some proper object of public welfare or interest. <em>Welch Co. v. State supra; Marine Corps League v. Benoit, </em>96 N.H. 423, 427, 78 A.2d 513, 517 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Here the proposed statute would amend RSA ch. 399-B, which is concerned with the disclosure of finance charges. <em>See </em>Annot., 14 A.L.R.3d 330 (1967, Supp. 1974). By adding the proviso contained within House bill No. 253, the State would not only require disclosure of credit charges but would limit the interest chargeable on only certain types of credit cards. The amendment would specifically limit interest chargeable on sales of \u201cgasoline and related products and for primarily personal, family or household purposes ....\u201d made on credit cards \u201cissued by a manufacturer or distributor of gasoline and related products [to] three-quarters of one per cent per month on the unpaid balance.\u201d Hence, manufacturers and distributors of gasoline and related products are singled out for reg ulation while others issuing credit cards are not regulated by the proposed act.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We are of the opinion that the proposed House bill No. 253 is unconstitutional, because it arbitrarily discriminates against a certain category of credit card issuers. <em>See Rosenblum v. Griffin, </em>89 N.H. 314, 197 A. 701 (1938); N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 12.</p>\n<judges id=\"b321-6\">Frank R. Kenison</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ans\">Laurence I.
