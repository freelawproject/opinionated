Defendant filed a motion to set aside the personal property section of the decree alleging that the decree failed to take into account a prior agreement of the parties and that the court was not aware of what properties each party possessed at the time the order was made. The trial court first modified the original decree by ordering certain items returned to the defendant but on rehearing held that, based on the rule in <em>Douglas v. Douglas, </em>109 N.H. 41, 242 A.2d 78 (1968), the court was without jurisdiction to modify its original decree. Defendant\u2019s exception to this ruling was reserved and transferred by the Trial Court, <em>Batchelder, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\"><em>Douglas v. Douglas </em>held that a decree dividing property or decreeing property to a party in a divorce case was \u201cbinding and not subject to retroactive modification because of a change of circumstances.\u201d 109 N.H. at 43, 242 A.2d at 80. The decree of divorce and the decree of property division \u201cstand upon the same footing as other judgments\u201d. <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>51 N.H. 388, 396 (1872). They are to be distinguished from what may be called \u201ccontinuing\u201d orders of the court relating to support, custody and occupation of premises. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Twardosky v. Twardosky, </em>113 N.H. 438, 309 A.2d 217 (1973). The court has been granted by statute continuing jurisdiction to modify orders of the latter type when subsequent changes in circumstances require such modification. RSA 458:14.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The distinction pointed out between the continuing order and a decree of property settlement in <em>Douglas v. Douglas </em>did not indicate a decree of property settlement took from the court any of its common law power to correct under the proper circumstances. <em>Adams v. Adams, </em>51 N.H. 388, 396 (1872); <em>Smith v. Consul General of Spain, </em>110 N.H. 62, 260 A.2d 95 <em>Lester v. Lester, </em>109 N.H. 359, 252 A.2d 429 (1969). The trial court was in error when it ruled it had no jurisdiction to correct this decree of property settlement in the event it was based upon a misunderstanding of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exception sustained; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
