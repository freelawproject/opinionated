Subsequently, the plaintiff brought the present action to enforce the New York judgment. Again the defendant defaulted, and judgment was entered against him on June 15, 1973, by <em>Perkins, </em>J. Thereafter, the judgment was vacated <em>(Morris, </em>J.) and the defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim for monies owed. At a subsequent hearing before <em>Perkins, </em>J., the Court ruled that the New York judgment \u201cis an <em>in rem </em>judgment and therefore the action on saidjudgment in New Hampshire does not lie and accordingly is dismissed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Examination of the record before us indicates that the New York judgment was a valid in personam judgment entitled to full faith and credit in our courts. <em>Sampson v. Conlon, </em>100 N.H. 358, 126 A.2d 250 (1956); <em>Moore v. Moore, </em>96 N.H. 130, 71 A.2d 409 (1950); <em>Emery v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number><em>Hovey, </em>84 N.H. 499, 153 A. 322 (1931). The contract was entered into in New York and entirely performed in New York. By the time the New York action was commenced, the defendant was a resident of Kensington, New Hampshire. It is not disputed that he was served personally in New Hampshire in that action, in compliance with the New York long-arm statute, by a representative of the Rockingham County sheriff\u2019s office. See C.P.L.R. \u00a7 313. Nor has the defendant averred that the New York long-arm statute cannot constitutionally reach him in this case. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302 (a); <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714 (1877); <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310 <em>(1945); Longines-Wittnauer Co. v. Barnes &amp; Reinecke, </em>15 N.Y. 2d 443, 209 N.E.2d 68, 261 N.Y.S.2d 8 (1965); <em>see Roy v. Transairco Inc., </em>112 N.H. 171, 291 A.2d 605 (1972); <em>Leeper v. Leeper, </em>114 N.H. 294, 319 A.2d 626 (1974); <em>Kinchla v. Baumner, </em>114 N.H. 818, 330 A.2d 112 (1974). The existence of the judgment was properly pleaded and on the present state of the record the plaintiff\u2019s action was erroneously dismissed. The order of the trial court is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b704-6\">Grimes, J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
