The defendant filed a motion to dismiss which asserted that \u201cthe grounds for divorce have not arisen or accrued within the State of New Hampshire.\u201d The Master <em>(Raymond P. Blanchard, </em>Esq.) held a hearing and recommended that the motion be denied. The Court <em>(Morris, </em>J.) so ordered. <em>Woodruff v. Woodruff </em>114 N.H. 365, 320 A.2d 661 (1974). The defendant then filed a request for findings of fact and rulings of law. The requests for findings of fact were directed at the issue raised by her motion to dismiss. The requested rulings of law declared that the court lacked jurisdiction over the parties and over the cause of action. <em>Cf. </em>RSA 458:5 III and 458:6. The Master <em>(Raymond P. Blanchard, </em>Esq.) recommended that certain requests for findings of fact be granted but that those essential to the defendant\u2019s position be denied. He further recommended that the defendant\u2019s requested rulings of law be denied. The Court <em>(Morris, </em>J.) so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The defendant then filed a \u201cFurther Answer and Specifications\u201d requesting relief with respect to support payments, custody and visitation rights, and the division of jointly held property. The Master <em>(Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) recommended and the Court <em>(Douglas, </em>J.) granted a decree of divorce with provisions for custody and visitation, ownership of the household furniture, and alimony and child support. The court reserved and transferred the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>defendant\u2019s exceptions to the decree and the orders contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The defendant filed no brief and did not argue orally. The defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed for failure to file a brief as required by RSA 490:13 (Supp. 1973), as amended by Laws 1973, 214:2. <em>McNamara v. MacCormac, </em>113 N.H. 540, 309 A.2d 916 (1973); <em>Connecticut Valley Construction Co., Inc. v.
