The vehicle was alongside the traveled part of a public highway with its tires buried in sand. Tire skid marks led from one side of the road to the other directly to the position of the truck. The only other person at the scene was a local resident who was preparing to bring his own vehicle from nearby to assist in pulling the truck out.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">This case is governed by <em>State v. Costello, </em>110 N.H. 182, 263 A.2d 671 (1970), and <em>State v. Allen, </em>114 N.H. 682, 327 A.2d 715 (1974). Not only could it be found that the defendant drove the truck on the public highway to the location where he was found, but the brief lapse of time that it took the officer to arrive would support a finding that defendant\u2019s degree of intoxication had not materially changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-9\">Kenison, C.J., did not sit.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
