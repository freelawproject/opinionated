RSA 458:7-a (Supp. 1973). The defendant\u2019s exceptions were reserved and transferred by <em>Morris, </em>J.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">This case was first heard by a Master <em>(Leonard C. Hardwick, </em>Esq.) who made certain findings and rulings and recommended that a divorce be granted. His report was approved, but a subsequent motion by the defendant for a rehearing was granted. The case was again heard and the master\u2019s report -recommending a divorce, upon the same grounds as previously, together with findings and rulings, was again approved. In all these hearings the defendant was adequately represented by counsel but chose to appear pro se on her appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">The issue before us is whether the record supports the decree. We hold that it does. A careful examination of the transcripts and exhibits discloses ample evidence to sustain the granting of the divorce. The orders for support were $60 weekly for the maintenance of the minor child, whose custody was awarded to the defendant, payment of all his dental, medical, and optical expenses, and a lump sum of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">As to these orders, it is fundamental in such cases that the court has broad discretion <em>(Comer v. Comer, </em>110 N.H. 505, 507, 272 A.2d 586, 587 (1970)) and that its decision will not be set aside unless \u201cthe evidence demonstrates clearly an abuse\u201d of such discretion. <em>Collette v. Collette, </em>108 N.H. 469, 470, 238 A.2d 598, 599 (1968). <em>See also Ford v. Ford, </em>112 N.H. 270, 293 A.2d 605 (1972). In the present case it is clear that the court\u2019s conclusions were well within the proper bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The record discloses the proceedings were free from error and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
