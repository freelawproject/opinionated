The attorney-general, or the appointing authority of such official may petition the governor and council for his removal, setting forth the grounds and reasons therefor....\u201d In <em>Barry v. King, </em>106 N.H. 279, 281, 210 A.2d 161, 162 (1965), this court decided that \u201c[u]nder RSA 4:1 the Governor and Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>may remove public officers for cause after public hearing and due notice of the charges preferred.\u201d <em>See Summers v. Town of Exeter, </em>114 N.H. 841, 843, 330 A.2d 120, 121 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">RSA 12-A:3 stipulates that the \u201ccommissioner (of resources and economic development) shall nominate for appointment by the governor and council a ... director of economic development... (who) shall serve, subject to the provisions of RSA 4:1....\u201d Whether the Governor and Council or the commissioner of resources and economic development is the \u201cappointing authority\u201d contemplated by RSA 4:1 depends upon the definition of that term and upon an interpretation of the specific language used in RSA 12-A:3. The phrase \u201cappointing authority\u201d generally denotes the power to designate a person to occupy and to discharge the duties of an office or a position. <em>See McAdams v. Barbieri, </em>143 Conn. 405, 417, 123 A.2d 182, 188 (1956); <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>142 Ohio 496, 504, 52 N.E.2d 980, 984 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">RSA 12-A:3 states that the commissioner of resources and economic development \u201cshall nominate for appointment by the governor and council\u201d a director of economic development. While the terms \u201cnominate\u201d and \u201cappoint\u201d may be synonymous under some circumstances <em>(See, e.g., Wilson v. Stump, </em>310 Mass. 614, 617, 39 N.E.2d 416, 418 (1942)), the use of these two words in RSA 12-A:3 gives them each different meanings. As used in the statute \u201cnominate\u201d means to propose a candidate for appointment. <em>Fiscella v. Nulton, </em>22 N.J. Super. 367, 375, 92 A.2d 103, 107 (1952); <em>State v. Barker, </em>113 Fla. 865, 868, 152 So. 682, 683 (1934). The \u201cappointment\u201d envisioned by RSA 12-A:3 is the act of exercising the executive authority to officially place a nominee in office, thereby conveying to him the title and all of the incidents of office. <em>See Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 156-57 (1803).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Under the express language of RSA 12-A:3 the commissioner of resources and economic development shall \u201cnominate\u201d, whereas the Governor and Council \u201cappoint\u201d. The functions are distinctly separate and interdependent ones. The commissioner of resources and economic development has no authority to appoint the director of economic development; he only has the power to nominate for appointment. While the Governor and Council have the powers to appoint and to remove the director of economic development, they do not have the capacity to nominate for appointment. RSA 4:1; <em>see Withrow v. Larkin, </em>421 U.S. 35, 46-53 (1975). Both generally recognized definitions and the language of RSA 12-A:3 compel the conclusion that the Governor and Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>constitute the \u201cappointing authority\u201d of the director of economic development.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-4\">Frank R.
