He took no appeal but filed a habeas corpus petition on December 23, 1974, which petition was pending when the motions for bail were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">It is established that the question of bail is discretionary with the court. <em>State v. Booton, </em>114 N.H. 152, 317 A.2d 18 (1974). The court\u2019s action will not be disturbed except on evidence of a compelling nature. <em>See State v. Hutton, </em>107 N.H. 426, 428, 223 A.2d 416, 417 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-17\">The record before us discloses no evidence sufficient to warrant reversal of the trial court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-18\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
