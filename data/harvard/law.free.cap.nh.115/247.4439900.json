No brief was filed within those time limits. On February 28, 1975, the clerk notified plaintiff that the case would be submitted to the court on March 25, 1975, on the State\u2019s brief and without oral argument, and that plaintiff could file a brief before March 25, 1975. No brief and no communication from or on behalf of plaintiff was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">On the basis of the history of the case in this court, and following an examination of the record, including the transcript and the master\u2019s report, we think the rationale and the holding in <em>McNamara v. MacCormac, </em>113 N.H. 540, 309 A.2d 916 (1973), is controlling. For plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a brief in compliance with RSA 490:13. (Supp. 1973), the order in this case is</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled; judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
