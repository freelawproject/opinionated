Const. pt. II, art. 5-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-15\">RSA 79-A:2 XIII (Supp. 1975) defines \u201cwild land\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Wild land\u2019 means any unimproved land upon which there are no detrimental structures and on which the owner is not substantially interfering with the natural ecological processes as determined and classified by criteria developed by the board.\u201d The board referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>to is the Current Use Advisory Board (RSA 79-A:3 (Supp. 1975)), consisting of eleven members including certain named department heads or their designees and some appointees.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The board established a schedule of criteria and values for the various current land uses listed in RSA ch. 79-A (Supp. 1975) and as authorized by that statute. Under VI of the criteria are listed certain alternatives for qualifying \u201cwild land\u201d of which the following is applicable to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">\u201cA. Qualifying \u2018wild land\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">1. A tract of unimproved land of at least ten (10) contiguous acres which by its nature is incapable of producing commercial agriculture or forest crops and which is being left in its natural state without interference with the ecological process;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The board of taxation found that the taxpayers\u2019 land was unimproved, that there are no detrimental structures on the land, and that the owners have not substantially interfered with the ecological processes. However, the board found as a fact that the land in question was capable of producing commercial forest crops and so failed to meet the criteria established by the Current Use Advisory Board. The decision of the board of taxation is overruled since it is based upon a criterion established by the Current Use Advisory Board which impermissibly narrows the statutory definition of \u201cwild land\u201d and contravenes the express purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Criteria and rules and regulations may properly be promulgated by administrative boards when so authorized by the legislature with proper standards. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>99 N.H. 528, 114 A.2d 514 (1955); <em>Ferretti v. Jackson, </em>88 N.H. 296, 188 A. 474 (1936); <em>State v. Normand, </em>76 N.H. 541, 85 A. 899 (1913). This does not authorize a board to \u201cadd to, change, or modify the <em>statute.\u201dId. </em>at 545, 85 A. at 901; <em>Whitney v. Watson, </em>85 N.H. 238, 240, 157 A. 78, 80 (1931). The authority granted is designed only to permit the board to fill in the details to effectuate the purpose of the statute. <em>Hanover Precinct v. Atkins, </em>78 N.H. 308, 310, 99 A. 293, 294 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">The taxpayers in this case were found by the board of taxation to be maintaining their land in conformity with the requirements of the statute as \u201cwild land\u201d. The stated purpose of the statute is to \u201cencourage the preservation of open space\u201d and \u201cto prevent the conversion of open space to more intensive use\u201d by means of \u201cas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>sessment of land value for property taxation on the basis of current use.\u201d RSA 79-A:l (Supp. 1975). Classification of land as \u201cwild land\u201d does not entitle the taxpayer to permanent classification since he must apply each year (RSA 79-A:8 (Supp. 1975)), and the board of taxation may order reclassification either on complaint or its own motion. RSA 79-A:12 (Supp. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Current Use Advisory Board criteria requiring that \u201cwild land\u201d be \u201cincapable of producing commercial agricultural or forest crops\u201d are unrelated to \u201ccurrent use\u201d and directed at future potential use. If one excludes \u201cwet land\u201d (otherwise classified by RSA 79-A:2 XII (Supp. 1975)) and the tops of certain mountains, the argument of the taxpayers that no land could qualify as \u201cwild land\u201d under this criterion is not complete hyperbole. The specific definition in the statute granted taxpayers the right to have their land classified as \u201cwild land.\u201d The criterion of the Current Use Advisory Board that operates to deprive them of their statutory right is in conflict with the statutory pattern and policy and is therefore invalid. <em>Harkeem v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Employment Security, </em>115 N.H. 658, 348 A.2d 711 (1975); <em>Clark v. N.H.
