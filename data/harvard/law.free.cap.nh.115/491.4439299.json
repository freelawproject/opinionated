The Dover city manager discharged these employees on the grounds that they violated an existing labor agreement and participated in an illegal strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">The plaintiffs petitioned the superior court and asked that pending a hearing on the merits the city be temporarily enjoined from hiring replacement employees and for a temporary order reinstating the discharged employees. The Trial Court <em>(Mullavey, </em>J.), after hearing, ordered the discharged employees to be reinstated pending a hearing on the merits of the petition. The parties are before this court as a result of a petition by the city asking this court to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the order of the superior court pending a hearing on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In effect, the city is asking for a writ of prohibition. <em>See State ex rel. Regan v. Superior Court, </em>102 N.H. 224, 153 A.2d 403 (1959); <em>State v. Superior Court, </em>106 N.H. 228, 208 A.2d 832 (1965). The city seeks to restrain and stay action of an inferior court. The petition is within the jurisdiction of this court (RSA 490:4 (Supp. 1973)) but our authority is exercised with caution and forbearance and only when the necessity to act is clear. The order complained of merely preserves the status quo pending a hearing on the merits which shall be held expeditiously. <em>Hillsborough v.
