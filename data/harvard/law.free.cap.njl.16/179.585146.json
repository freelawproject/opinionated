MORRIS, APPELLEE.</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-8\">On <em>Certiorari </em>to Common Pleas.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b195-9\">A party sued by a wrong name, may appeal and make the necessary affidavit therefor, in his right name, and if necessary, may prove his identity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b195-10\">The affidavit that the appeal is not <em>brought </em>instead of <em>intended </em>for delay, and <em>but </em>instead of <em>and, </em>are variances from the words of the statute, which are immaterial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-11\">STATE OF THE CASE.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-12\">The Common Pleas dismissed the appeal, because the affidavit was made by John Tomlin jun. and the suit below was against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>John Tomlin \u2014 And 2dly. because the affidavit in other respects, was not conformable to the one required 'by the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>Mr. A. Browning,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALv\">upon these facts, moved for a mandamus to re-instate the appeal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b196-6\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayqb\">The statute <em>{Harr. Comp. </em>6.) requires that the party, demanding the appeal shall file an affidavit, made by him <em>&amp;o. </em>If therefore John Tomlin jun. who made the affidavit, was really the party appealing, it was sufficient. If he had been sued by a wrong name, and instead of putting in the dilatory plea of a misnomer, chose more honestly, to go to trial upon the merits, it is no reason, why in subsequent proceedings, he must not only call himself by the wrong name, but actually write it wrong. There Was no pretence that the affidavit had not in fact . been made by the appellant, who was the defendant below. If there had been, it was competent for him to shew that he was the same identical person.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The second objection is no better. Instead of saying, as in the statute, \u201c that the said appeal is not <em>intended </em>for the purpose of delay; <em>and </em>that he verily believes <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>the affidavit is \u201c that the said appeal is not <em>brought </em>for the purpose of delay; <em>but </em>that &amp;c.\u201d This is hypercritical indeed. If the appeal was not <em>brought </em>for delay, it could not be <em>intended </em>for that object; and when he says, \u2018 <em>but;\u2019 </em>he verily believes he has a just and legal defence, he as distinctly affirms that belief, as if he had said \u201c <em>and\u201d </em>that he verily believes &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">\n<em>Let a mandamus issue.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Cited <em>in Hamilton </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>436.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
