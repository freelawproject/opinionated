The usual practice of the Court has been followed in this case. L&lt; t the judgment be opened, and stand as security.</p>\n<author id=\"b365-14\">Ryerson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8T\">As the defendant\u2019s affidavit affects the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>parties, I think it should be taken upon notice; and always so, unless on a motion for a rule to shew cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">I doubt the propriety of granting the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\n<em>Judgment opened, to stand as security for the sum which may be recovered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Cited <em>in, Van Wagenen </em>v. <em>Halsey, 1 Harr. </em>351: <em>Cooper v.
