Elmer, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9H\">insisted that the judgment was well entered. The bond and warrant of attorney was signed \u201c Thomas B. and Isaiah Wood,\u201d but it appears by Thomas B. Wood\u2019s own affidavit read in support of this motion, that he executed the bond and warrant of attorney, and signed the names \u201c Thomas B. and Isaiah Wood \u201d without any authority from Isaiah Wood to use his name, and that it is therefore a good several bond against Thomas B. Wood. 2 <em>Cai. Rep. </em>255; 2 <em>W. Black. Rep. </em>1133.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Opinion op the Court. The motion must be denied. It is the bond of Thomas B. Wood, on his own admission; and it does not lie in his mouth to avoid it by swearing to his own turpitude, nor even by shewing that he had innocently, but without authority, written the name of Isaiah Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">If a bond on the face of it, purports to be the joint bond of two or more, but is executed and delivered, by one only, it is his several bond. The cases cited by counsel, (viz: <em>Motteux </em>v. <em>St. Aubin et al, </em>2 <em>W. Bl. </em>1133; <em>Green et al </em>v. <em>Beals, </em>2 <em>Caine\u2019s R. </em>254; <em>and Gerard </em>v. <em>Basse, et al. </em>1 <em>Dall. R. </em>119) are full and satisfactory upon the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">\n<em>Motion denied with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
