Q. C. Elmer,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A79\">in behalf of Mr. Ellet attorney for plaintiff, moved for judgment on the verdict, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-9\">The Judge by request, declined at the circuit, giving the usual certificate that the title came in question, and recommended that the application be made at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-10\">The act of the legislature, on this subject, must be considered as applicable to cases which cannot be tried before a Justice of the Peace, before whom the only question to be tried is the fact of possession. 6 <em>Halst. </em>62, 63, <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Kanouse. </em>The term <em>title </em>is to be taken in a strictly technical sense. It involves the <em>justa causa possessionis.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-11\">Another question arises. Is it requisite for the Judge to give the certificate <em>instanter, at the trial? </em>The statute <em>Rev. Laws, </em>666, should not be taken literally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-12\">It may be given at the next term or subsequent convenient time. 2 <em>Barn and Cress. </em>580 : 9 <em>Eng. G. Law R. </em>186 <em>; Ih. </em>202. 2 <em>Barn, and Ores, </em>621. <em>Held </em>that the words \u201c the judge at the trial of the cause\u201d means the Judge who tried the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-13\">The pleadings in this case set up a title; and where a party pleads title, the statute, <em>Rev. Laws, </em>309, does not apply.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-14\"><em>D. Elmer, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agb\">Application for the certificate should be made to the Judge who tried the cause, and not at bar. The Court is referred to <em>Rev. Laws </em>309; <em>Ih. </em>666. To recover costs in this case, the Judge\u2019s certificate upon record, must be produ--. ced. The <em>title </em>intended by the statute, is more than possession, or matter pleaded. The certificate should be made at the trial. 7 <em>Hals. </em>177, <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Morris. </em>The act of 1820, <em>Rev. L. </em>666, refers to actions of trespass only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-15\">The words \u201cjudge <em>at the trial,\u201d </em>mean the <em>place </em>of trial. <em>Wilson </em>221. The title may come in question at the trial by evidence or pleading.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>L.

Ed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">The act of 1820 <em>Rev. Laws </em>666, repeals the clauses in <em>Pat. Rev. </em>sec. 4, 5, 6.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b280-6\">Horrblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYC\">The plea, <em>liberum tenementum </em>puts the title in question; and the jury having passed thereon, the plaintiff is entitled to costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b280-7\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlcU\">I have no doubt of the plaintiffs\u2019 right to costs. By the plea, issue, and verdict, the title is directly at issue. If the certificate were necessary, I think it may now be given, but it is not necessary.</p>\n<author id=\"b280-8\">Ryersor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9a\">In this case there are two pleas, one of which puts the title in question. But even on the general issue pleaded, the title as offered to be set up here, entitles the plaintiff to costs. The question was one which a Justice of the Peace could not try.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">I had entertained an opinion, from the English practice, that a certificate may be given at any time; but perhaps our statute was intended to alter that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\n<em>Costs allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\"><em>D. Elmer, </em>applied for and obtained a rule to shew cause, why a new trial should not be granted, the <em>postea </em>being brought in at this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Leave to amend the replication on payment of costs, was also granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
