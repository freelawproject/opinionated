He cited the acts in <em>Har. Comp. </em>5, and 302 \u2014 and 6 <em>Halst. </em>169. See also <em>Har.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIF\">If the rule of the Hunterdon Pleas, were a convenient one, I would not willingly disturb it. Under the first act authorising special terms of Courts in certain counties, <em>Har. Comp. </em>129, such a rule might be <em>adopted; </em>but by the last act on this subject, <em>Har. Comp. </em>302, which extends to all the counties of the state, the legislature give a specific rule, requiring an express <em>waiver </em>of trial by jury. No rule of Court then is here wanted. Rules are made for cases in which the statute is silent. The Common Pleas in the present case have reversed the directions of the statute,'and require a <em>demand </em>of a jury; and put the party to the expense of continued entries of such demand. Their rule is oppressive and contrary to the statute.</p>\n<author id=\"b364-10\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">A party has a vested right to his trial by jury, unless he <em>waive </em>it. Courts may prescribe the form of, but cannot dispense with the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">The rule of the Common Pleas is contrary to the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b364-12\">Ryerson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADPy\">I concur in granting a <em>mandamus. </em>But I am inclined to think the Common Pleas may make a rule that the silence of the party, shall be construed as a waiver; but not to require a repetition of a demand of a jury. The last act extends the power of the Court-to try jury causes, and, as I think, to make a rule that <em>not demanding </em>a jury, is a equivalent to a <em>waiver. </em>The language of the act does not require an <em>express </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>waiver; but to compel a repetition of the <em>demand </em>of a jury, would bo oppressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In this case a demand of a jury had been twice entered on the minutes of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Peremptory Mandamus ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
