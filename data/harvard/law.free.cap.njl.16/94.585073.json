By an act passed the <em>4th February </em>1812, it was expressly enacted that in case of <em>the death </em>or <em>removal </em>of a justice of the peace before whom a judgment had been given, such judgment might be revived, and carried into effect, by <em>scire facias </em>before another justice. But that act was repealed by the 65th section of the act of 12th <em>February </em>1818, <em>(Rev. Laws, </em>629. \u2014 648.) by the 54th section of which, a sc <em>we facias </em>is given to revive an unsatisfied judgment, of more than one year\u2019s standing: but such <em>scire facias </em>must be issued by the same justice, before whom, the judgment was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">When therefore the justice who rendered a judgment, is alive and in office, a <em>sairefaeias </em>must be issued by him, and not by another justice. If the justice is dead, or out of commission, the only remedy is by action of debt on the judgment: and such action may be brought in all cases, and may be instituted before any justice. The other objection, is equally fatal. The judgment on a <em>scire facias, </em>instead of being, as in this case, for a certain sum of debt, and costs, should have been simply, that the plaintiff have execution &amp;c. (see a proper form of entry, in <em>the N. J. Justice, </em>73. 2d. <em>edition.) </em>These points have been repeatedly ruled by this Court: as in <em>Boylan </em>v. <em>Anderson, Penn. R. </em>529, <em>Woolston </em>v. <em>Gale and al. </em>4 <em>Halst. </em>32, <em>Swisher </em>v. <em>Hibler, </em>2 <em>South. R. </em>808, <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Vanderhoof, Penn. R. </em>73.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\n<em>Judgment Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
