J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av\">By this <em>Certiorari, </em>we have, brought before us, a conviction entered up against one Johnson, by Littleton White, Esq., a justice of the peace, for profane swearing, and the confirmation thereof, by the Court of Quarter Sessions of the county of Monmouth, on an appeal to that court, by Johnson. Upon looking into the papers sent up with our writ, it appears, that on the third day of November, 1834, Joseph Barclay gave information to Justice White, under oath made before the said Justice, that on the 11th day of October then last past; he heard John I. Johnson \u201cat Eatontown\u201din the county of Monmouth, swear thirty-three profane oaths in these words, to wit, \u201c By God <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>On the same day, the justice issued his precept to a constable, reciting the aforesaid complaint and oath of the informant, and commanding the constable to cause the said Johnson to appear before him, (the justice) on Tuesday the 11th of the same month of November, at &amp;c. to answer the premises, and be further dealt with according to law. On that day, the accused appeared before the justice, and the informant Barclay filed a state of demand, stating himself to be plaintiff sueing in behalf of tho Township of Shrewsbury, in the county of Monmouth, and demanding of the defendant, sixteen dollars and fifty cents, \u201cfor this, to wit; that on the 11th day of October then last past, in the township aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, he the said John I. Johnson, swore thirty-three profane oaths, in the words to wit, \u201cBy God <em>&amp;c.\u201d </em>It further appears by the justice\u2019s record, that Johnson demanded a jury, whereupon, the justice being in doubt, adjourned the matter to a future day. On that day, Barclay and Johnson again appeared before the justice, and a jury being denied, the justice proceeded to hear the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>matter; thereupon Barclay was sworn, and on oath, repeated that he did hear Johnson on the 11th of October then last past, at Eatontown, in the Township of Shrewsbury, swear thirty-three oaths, in these words to wit, \u201cBy God &amp;c.\u201d Whereupon, the justice \u201cadjudged\u201d and so entered upon his docket, that the said Johnson stood convicted before him, of profane swearing in manner aforesaid, contrary to the statute in such case made and provided; and then drew up a conviction in the following words, to wit; \u201cConviction, Monmouth County to wit: Be it remembered, that on the twenty second day of November, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and thirty four, John I. Johnson was convicted before me Littleton White, one of the justices of the peace of the said county, of swearing thirty-three profane oaths, on the eleventh day of October, last past, at Eatontown, in the Township of Shrewsbury, in the said county : Whereby, the said John I. Johnson hath forfeited sixteen dollars and fifty cents, to the use of the poor in the Township of Shrewsbury, in the said county, and also one dollar, being the costs and charges of the said conviction. Given under my hand and seal, the day and year above said.\u201d Signed Littleton White, and his seal affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-4\">To this proceeding, the counsel for Johnson, has with very commendable industry and research, raised many objections \u2014 -1 will endeavour to examine them all, though not perhaps in the order staled in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">1st. It is objected, that the <em>information </em>is uncertain; that it charges thirty-three oaths, and sets forth the words of one only. And under this head, the counsel insists, that the information should specify the offence or offences, with as much certainty as is necessary in an indictment. If this was a proceeding by \u201cinformation,\u201d in the nature of a public prosecution, in a criminal case, in which an indictment would lie, the remark would he just: But this is not such a case. The <em>information </em>given under oath, to a magistrate, to justify his issuing process for the accused, is a very different thing from an information filed by the attorney general, in lieu of an indictment. I am not certain, which the counsel refers to, as the information; the original complaint under oath made by Barclay; or the state of demand, subsequently filed by him. If the former, I think, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>information was sufficiently certain and specific. He says that he heard Johnson swear thirty-three profane oaths, in these words, to wit, \u201c By &amp;c.\u201d the plain and common sense meaning of which is, that he thirty-three times repeated those words \u2014 If the counsel alludes to the state of demand subsequently filed by Barclay, that will be found equally explicit, but in truth, that state of demand was useless and nugatory. It was unnecessary, and did no hurt or good \u2014 It could not have mislead Johnson, for it was m the very words of the original complaint \u2014 Again.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">2nd. It is objected that the <em>information </em>does not shew that the words were used profanely; that the same words may be innocently spoken in connexion with other words, as \u201cBy God the world was made\u201d \u201call things were created by God\u201d &amp;c. It is a sufficient answer to this, to say, that if the words were so used, by the defendant, or were spoken by him in connexion with any other words, in the ordinary course of argument, or conversation, then- Barclay, the informant, has committed perjury, for he swears that Johnson uttered <em>profane </em>oaths \u2014 Profane oaths and rational conversation, are very different things, and it does not require judicial skill to distinguish the one from the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">3d. Objection \u201c that the <em>nature </em>of the oaths are not set out in the information and proceedings; \u201d and this is said to be necessary, that the court may see whether they are profane or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">This objection is not true in fact. The oaths are set out in the \u201cproceedings.\u201d The very words of the oaths are set out in the original complaint; in the summons; and again in the justice's record of the testimony on which he founded the conviction. And the conviction is then drawn up in the very words of the formula prescribed by the act of assembly, <em>(Rev. L. </em>383.) It was the difficulty of drawing up convictions in due form, and with such precision and accuracy as would stand the test of legal criticism, that induced the legislature, in aid of the justices, to prescribe, as in this and other cases, a short and compendious form of conviction. <em>(Burn\u2019s Just. </em>339 <em>tit. </em>Convictions.) A conviction therefore, in the words of the statute, is sufficient. It is true, Eyre, Ch. Just, is reported to have said, in <em>Moult </em>v. Jennings, (as cited by counsel, in <em>Crepps </em>v. <em>Durden, Cowp, </em>642) that \u201cif the nature of the oaths had not been specified in the <em>conviction, </em>so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>that they might appear to the court, the conviction would have been void.\u201d But what is meant by \u201c specifying the nature of the oath ?\u201d What more can be meant, than stating the words of the oath \u2014 Whether those words were used \u201c profanely\u201d or not, it is true, must depend upon the connexion in which they were spoken, or the circumstances or occasion that gave rise to the use of them. But if the quarrel, the altercation, and <em>all </em>the accompanying words of the profane swearer, are to be set out in the proceedings and conviction, it would defeat the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">Profane swearers generally pour out their profanity, with such rapidity, and mix up their oaths with so many and such unmeaning words, that it would be impossible to specify or prove them\u2014 As to so much of the counsel\u2019s argument, as is founded on the supposition, that without a more specific description of the oath, and the words, and the circumstances connected with it, a man might be twice convicted for the same offence; the answer is, that upon a second complaint, he could shew by proof, that it was the same oath, and spoken on the same occasion, as that for w'hieh he had been already convicted and fined \u2014 If he could not, it would be his misfortune.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">4th. Another objection is, that each particular offence should have been separately set out \u2014 But this objection was made and overruled in the <em>King </em>v. <em>Roberts, Str. R. </em>608 <em>&amp; S. C. 2 Ld. Raym. </em>1376. In the latter book, the case is reported thus. \u201cThe defendant was convicted for swearing a hundred oaths: Viz. By G \u2014 d, and a hundred curses, viz. G \u2014 d d-n you ; Sergeant Darnell took exception to this conviction, that the oaths and curses ought to have been set out <em>a hundred times each, </em>particularly. <em>Sed non allocatur ; </em>for it is sufficient to say, he swore such an oath, or made such a curse, a hundred times.\u201d In <em>Str. </em>it is said, the conviction was for one hundred and fifty oaths, <em>his verbis, videlicit, </em>\u201cBy Gr\u201d \u2014 and cursing one hundred and fifty curses <em>in his verbis, videlicit, \u201c </em>G \u2014 d d-n you,\u201d without repeating each, an hundred and fifty times \u2014 The cases cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on this point, <em>[Kerr </em>v. <em>Harker 2 Halst. R. </em>349, <em>&amp; Hill </em>v. <em>Herbert, Penn. R. </em>924) are not applicable \u2014 \u25a0 Those were suits at law, prosecuted in a court of record, for selling liquors by the small measure, and governed by very different rules, from those applicable to the case 1 efore us.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>5th. Another objection is, that only one offence, can be committed in one day, yet the justice has convicted the defendant below, of thirty-three offences committed on one and the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The ease already cited from <em>Sir. &amp; Ld. Raym. </em>are direct authorities against this objection \u2014 While the case of <em>Crepps </em>v. <em>Durdin, Cowp. </em>640, affords it no support \u2014 That was a conviction for four offences, under the 29 <em>Car. </em>2 <em>Cap. </em>7, of a Baker, for exercising his-ordinary calling, on a Sunday \u2014 Ld. Mansfield very properly remarked, that the object of the statute, was to punish a man for exercising his ordinary trade and calling, on a Sunday; and therefore if a Taylor sews, on the Lord\u2019s day, every stitch he takes would not constitute a separate offence.\u2014 But the object of that part of the statute, under which this conviction took place, is not to preserve the sanctity of a day, but to suppress profane swearing; every act of which, is a distinct offence against law and decency. The doctrine contended for, by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, amounts to this, that a man by paying fifty cents for a profane oath taken in the morning, obtains a license to spend the rest of the day, in profane swearing; such a doctrine may find some favour, in the code of dispensations and indulgences, but not much in a statute to suppress vice and immorality.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">6th. The next error assigned, is that the information, does not shew the Township in which the offence was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">This is not necessary \u2014 The information or complaint under oath, is only to authorise the justice to issue process for the accused. It is sufficient if the Township appears in the conviction, as it does in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">7th. Objection \u2014 The justice refused a trial by jury</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">In doing so, the justice was right. Convictions before a justice, were in practise in this state, long before the Constitution was formed \u2014 by the twenty-second article of that instrument, the trial by jury was to \u201c remain confirmed \u201d as a part of the law of this (then) colony; but it was not introduced as a <em>new </em>mode of trial, in all cases \u2014 it was adopted, or rather continued, as it was then used in England and in this colony, and was not at that time, either there or here, resorted to in cases of summary proceedings and convictions for petty offences.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Lastly. </em>It is objected that the title of the statute, under which the conviction took place, and the name of the prosecutor, was not indorsed on the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Such indorsements were not necessary. The provisions of the act relative to suits by common -informers, <em>{Rev. L. </em>405.) do not apply to this case. Its application, by the terms and the whole tenor of the act, is limited to cases where the common informer is plaintiff on the record; where there is a regular suit or action at law; and where judgment is to be given, for or against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">X have now considered all the objections, and am of opinion,, that the order of the Sessions, confirming the conviction, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">I might have contented myself with shortly overruling the various objections that have been urged in this <em>case; </em>but as I find no case in our state reports, settling the construction, and regulating the practice under the statute for suppressing vice and immorality, I have thought it a fit occasion, to give some guide and direction to such magistrates, as may be disposed to discharge their duties, in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The conviction must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">IPobd and Ryerson, Justices concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">CITED <em>in State </em>v. <em>Zeigler, </em>3 <em>Vroom </em>267; <em>McGear et al. </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>217.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
