This lease or contract, was parol; and under it, William Hall entered into possession, and it was mutually agreed that the terms of the contract should be reduced to writing in the form of a lease, and signed by the respective parties.

The inheritance was undisposed of by the will, and of course it descended to the heirs; and consequently the rent accruing after the testator\u2019s death, belongs to them. The question whether the action should have been debt on the indenture of lease; and of apportionment, seems to be waived by the case submitted</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
