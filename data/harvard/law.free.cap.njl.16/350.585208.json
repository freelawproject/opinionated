J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av87\">I always supposed that no notice of taking the affidavit of a party, is necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-14\">The objection to the affidavit, being waived,, it was read, stating that the judgment was entered by surprise, the joinder of issue on the demurrer, not being filed in time.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-15\">\n<em>Mr. Green.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A59\">The affidavit of a party, should not be heard on motion for rule <em>absolute, </em>to open a judgment; but only for a rule to <em>shew a cause. Rules of Supreme Court, 20, </em>affidavit, 1; 3 <em>Halst. </em>160; 2 <em>Archb. Pr. </em>11; <em>Coxe R. </em>400; <em>Allen </em>ads. <em>Den, Hendrickson, </em>3 <em>Green, </em>102.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-16\">H\u00f3rnblower, C. J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aia5\">I never understood the practice in this Court or at Westminster Hall, to be, that where a party\u2019s affidavit may be taken for a preliminary motion, that it must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>on notice. If such be the rule, it ought to be altered. Every day\u2019s practice is otherwise. I cannot distinguish this case from that of <em>Gondii </em>and <em>Grane, (ante </em>349.) There was <em>laches </em>in that case, there is <em>laches </em>here. The defendant is an attorney of this Court, and should have attended to the case. The joinder in demurrer is a merely formal matter and much like a <em>similiter </em>on pleas of general issues. In the case of <em>Livingston </em>and <em>Smith </em>in the Circuit Court of United States, Judge Washington would not permit advantage to be taken on demurring to omissions or misplacing of names, but ordered the plea to be amended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-4\">Ford, J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWX\">Laying aside any conversation out of doors between the parties, I see no necessity or utility of notice of taking an affidavit in such a case as this. The affidavit is good on a rule' to shew cause. The plaintiff being in possession of a judgment and execution, can lose nothing by the rule applied for. The affidavit shews that the defendant has merits. Let the judgment be opened to let in a defence; the judgment and execution remaining as surety.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-5\">Ryerso\u00edt, J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqsJ\">I entertain still my opinion expressed in the case of <em>Condit </em>and <em>Crane. </em>I think the old rule was either to give notice of taking affidavit, or serving a copy of it. The English practice, I believe, requires notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b367-6\">The Chief Justice observed, that there is no settled rule of practice in such cases.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-7\">By the <em>Court.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">Let the plea be amended during the term, as to the matter demurred to; and the judgment be opened, but standing together with the execution, as security for the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>Rule granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
