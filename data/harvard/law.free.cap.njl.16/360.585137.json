The trial was a surprise upon the defendant below, the plaintiff in this Court. The time and place of trial being misunderstood or forgotten. The defendant below had a meritorious defence; holding a receipt in full from the plaintiff. The defendant in <em>Certiorari </em>admitted there was due to him, only fifty or sixty dollars, and yet he has taken a judgment for ninety dollars. 1 <em>South. </em>289; 3 <em>Halst. </em>254; 5 <em>ib. </em>55; 7 <em>ib. </em>245; 1 <em>Green, </em>263; &amp;c. Several of the facts stated, were supported by sundry affidavits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-5\"><em>It. P. Thompson, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUGT\">The altering of the summons does not appear to have been done after its delivery to the officer for service. The service was correct. The words <em>\u201c </em>for S. C.\u201d is mere surplusage. The use of figures instead of words in the return day, is not fatal. As to the' pretence of merits; the true rule is; that where the conduct of the party was entirely fair, and the proceedings regular, this Court will not interfere. 1 <em>Green, </em>304; <em>Penn. </em>74.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-6\">Hornblower, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A19\">The objection to the summons is not well founded. The return day being in figures is not cause for reversal. The case of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>was one in which the summons was unintelligible. The constable\u2019s return, in this case, is good, and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">There is no valid objection to the state of demand. The services appear to have been for the defendant below..</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The party\u2019s forgetting the time and place of trial, is not a matter of surprise in legal contemplation. This Court cannot interfere merely because the judgment is for too much; this is not a Court of equity; it can only reverse for error. The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Ford, J. Concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b377-10\">Ryersost, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">I concur in affirming the judgment. It appears that the defendant below, rejected a fair offer to submit the ease to arbitrators; he is therefore the less entitled to sympathy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
