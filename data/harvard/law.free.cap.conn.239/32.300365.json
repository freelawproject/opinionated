In Docket Nos. 15346 and 15347 (mandamus action), the defendants, the board of mediation and arbitration and the United Automobile Workers Local 376 (union), appeal<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court, <em>Hauser, J., </em>issuing a writ of mandamus in favor of the plaintiffs, the town and the board of education. That judgment required the board of mediation and arbitration to select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). We affirm the judgments of the trial courts in all three appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The facts and procedural history are undisputed. The board of education and the union negotiated for a collective bargaining agreement covering certain noncertified employees of the board of education. Because the parties were unable to reach an agreement, pursuant to MERA, the dispute was referred to the board of mediation and arbitration for binding arbitration before a panel of arbitrators. The arbitration panel issued an award in September, 1993. Within twenty-five days of the award; see General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5); the town council of Stratford (town council) voted to reject the award and, subsequently, gave timely written notice to the board of mediation and arbitration of that action and of its reasons therefor. Thereafter, the board of mediation and arbitration notified the town and the union that it would not select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5) because, in the view of the board of mediation and arbitration, the town council was not the \u201clegislative body\u201d of the board of education within the meaning of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Thereafter, the town and the board of education filed the administrative appeal in the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 of the UAPA. In that action, the town and board of education sought an order requiring the board of mediation and arbitration to select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). The board of mediatioh and arbitration moved to dismiss the administrative appeal. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, reasoning that: (1) the board of mediation and arbitration is exempt from the UAPA by virtue of \u00a7 4-186 (c); and (2) the town and the board of education should have filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>dismissing the appeal. The town and the board of education appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The town and the board of education also thereupon brought the mandamus action, claiming that the board of mediation and arbitration was required, as a matter of law, to select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). The trial court agreed, and rendered judgment issuing the writ of mandamus. Both the board of mediation and arbitration and the union filed appeals from that judgment, which were consolidated in this court prior to oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We first consider the appeal of the town and the board of education in the administrative appeal. If they were entitled to appeal under the UAPA from the action of the board of mediation and arbitration, their mandamus action could not be maintained because they would have had an adequate remedy at law. See <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 365, 472 A.2d 336 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The town and board of education claim that the trial court improperly dismissed their administrative appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>under the UAPA because: (1) the exemption from the judicial appeal provisions of the UAPA for the board of mediation and arbitration does not apply to administrative and ministerial actions of that agency, including the failure to select a review panel of arbitrators under MERA; and (2) a motion to vacate an award under \u00a7 52-418 is not an appropriate remedy for the failure of the board of mediation and arbitration to select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). Because we disagree with their first claim, we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the administrative appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The town and board of education claim that the trial court improperly dismissed the administrative appeal because \u00a7 4-186 (c) does not exempt from the judicial appeal provisions of the UAPA the failure of the board of mediation and arbitration to perform an administrative or ministerial duty, such as the duty to appoint a review panel under \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). We are not persuaded. We conclude that \u00a7 4-186 (c) exempts actions of the board of mediation and arbitration from judicial review by way of an administrative appeal under \u00a7 4-183, and that this exemption is not implicitly limited regarding administrative or ministerial functions of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">This claim presents a question of statutory interpretation. \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Meriden-Wallingford Hospital, </em>237 Conn. 259, 266, 676 A.2d 857 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">First, the language of \u00a7 4-186 (c) is clear and unequivocal: \u201cThe employment security division and <em>the Board of Mediation and Arbitration of the state labor department, </em>the claims commissioner, and the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner <em>are exempt from the provisions of section 4-176e and sections 4-177 to 4-183, inclusive.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 4-183 is the provision for judicial review of an agency decision by way of an administrative appeal under the UAPA. Thus, there is no suggestion in the language of \u00a7 4-186 (c) that it contains any implicit limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Second, \u00a7 4-186 (c) does not exempt the board of mediation and arbitration from all the provisions of the UAPA; it exempts the board only from the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 4-176e and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-177 through 4-183. Section 4-176e<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> addresses who may conduct hearings by an agency. Sections 4-177 through 4-183 address, in general, contested cases and appeals to the court from final decisions in contested cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The UAPA does not begin and end, however, with those sections. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 defines the terms used throughout the UAPA. General Statutes \u00a7 4-167 addresses such matters as the requirements of each agency regarding its organization, its procedural rules, and public access to its regulations and policy statements. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-168 through 4-176 govern an agency\u2019s regulation-making process, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>declaratory rulings regarding regulations. The board of mediation and arbitration is subject to those provisions of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The careful delineation by the legislature in \u00a7 4-186 (c) of the limitation on the scope of the exemption of the board of mediation and arbitration from certain provisions of the UAPA strongly counsels against our reading in a limitation that is not expressly stated in the statute. Furthermore, some of the functions addressed by the provisions of the UAPA to which the board of mediation and arbitration is subject are administrative, rather than adjudicative. This reinforces our caution against reading in the limitation urged by the town and the board of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Third, contrary to the argument of the town and board of education, the legislative history of the exemption at issue is insufficient to compel a different construction. It is true that when, in 1975, House Bill No. 6231, which ultimately became the exemption at issue in this case, was introduced in the Senate the mediation and arbitration functions of the board were uppermost in the minds of the legislators.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although we have on occasion relied in part on legislative history to narrow what might otherwise be regarded as broad statutory language; see, e.g., <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 595 A.2d 313 (1991); the legislative history is not compelling enough to persuade us to do so in the present case. Not only is the language of the exemption broad and straightforward, but also the exemption itself is limited in scope, as explained previously. Thus, we cannot conclude that these remarks, which focus on those functions of the board of mediation and arbitration, also mean that the legislature intended that <em>only </em>those functions are exempted from the appeal provisions of the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The town and board of education argue that, unless we adopt their interpretation of \u00a7 4-186 (c), bizarre results will ensue because errant administrative and ministerial acts of the board of mediation and arbitration will escape judicial review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The fact that certain conduct of an agency is not subject to the administrative appeal provisions of the UAPA does not mean that such conduct automatically escapes judicial review. Rather, it means only that such conduct escapes judicial review pursuant to an appeal under the UAPA. Other avenues of judicial review, such as an action for a writ of mandamus, may remain, as we discuss in part II of this opinion. Although review by way of mandamus involves more exacting standards than those employed under the UAPA, there is nothing bizarre or anomalous about the legislative choice to subject the conduct of this agency to those more exacting standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Having concluded that the trial court properly dismissed the administrative appeal, we next consider, in the mandamus action, the appeal of the union and the board of mediation and arbitration. Identifying the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d is crucial in this appeal, because the trial court issued the writ of mandamus predicated on its conclusion that the town <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>council was the legislative body of the municipal employer. The union and the board of mediation and arbitration argue, however, that the board of education was the legislative body. If the union and the board of mediation and arbitration are correct, then the board of education has not timely rejected the award under \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5) and, therefore, neither the town nor the board of education may receive relief via mandamus. We conclude that the town council was the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u201cIt is well established that mandamus will issue only if the plaintiff can establish: (1) that the plaintiff has a clear legal right to the performance of a duty by the defendant; (2) that the defendant has no discretion with respect to the performance of that duty; and (3) that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 365. The third requirement is satisfied by our previous conclusion that the town and the board of education were not entitled to appeal under the UAPA. None of the parties has suggested, nor can we conceive of, any other adequate legal remedy available to the town and board of education in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The parties also agree, as do we, that the first two requirements for mandamus in this case distill into the question of whether the town council or the board of education is the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer,\u201d as that phrase is used in \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the town council is the legislative body of the municipal employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In order to place this question in its proper context, a brief overview of this part of MERA is useful. Section 7-473c (b) calls for \u201cbinding and final arbitration\u201d between a municipal employer and a municipal employee organization or union, when they have reached an impasse in their collective bargaining. In general, each party selects one arbitrator and a third arbitrator is selected by the board of mediation and arbitration from a panel of neutral arbitrators selected by the neutral arbitrator selection committee appointed by the state labor commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (b); see also <em>International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 564 </em>v. <em>Jewett City, </em>234 Conn. 123, 125, 661 A.2d 573 (1995) (parties may waive rights under MERA).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The arbitral process is that of last best offer. Pursuant to that process, after the parties have stipulated in writing to all items on which they are in agreement, each side presents in writing its last best offer with respect to each unresolved issue. Thereafter, the arbitration panel \u201cshall issue, upon majority vote ... its decision on all unresolved issues.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (1). The panel must treat each unresolved issue separately, and decide each such issue in accordance with the last best offer of one of the parties. In addition, \u201c[a]s part of the arbitration decision, each member shall state the specific reasons and standards used in making his choice on each unresolved issue.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The statute sets forth the standards to be employed by the arbitration panel. \u201cIn arriving at a decision, the arbitration panel shall give priority to the public interest and the financial capability of the municipal employer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (2). In addition, \u00a7 7-473 (d) (2) provides that the panel further consider certain factors \u201cin light of such financial capability.\u201d These factors are: the prior negotiations of the parties; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>the interests and welfare of the employees; changes in the cost of living; conditions of employment of the employee group and those of similar groups; and wages, salaries, fringe benefits and other conditions of employment prevailing in the labor market, including the private sector. General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (2) (A) through (E). Section 7-473c (d) (3) provides: \u201cThe decision of the panel and the resolved issues shall be final and binding upon the municipal employer and the municipal employee organization except as provided in subdivision (5) of this subsection and, if such award is not rejected by the legislative body pursuant to said subdivision, except that a motion to vacate or modify such decision may be made in accordance with sections 52-418 and 52-419.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">This brings us to the statutory provision at issue in this case. Section 7-473c (d) (5), which was enacted in 1992 as part of No. 92-84 of the 1992 Public Acts (P.A. 92-84), provides in part: \u201cWithin twenty-five days of the receipt of an arbitration award issued pursuant to this section, <em>the legislative body of the municipal employer </em>may reject the award of the arbitrators or single arbitrator by a two-thirds majority vote of the members of such legislative body present at a regular or special meeting called and convened for such purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The parties agree that the board of education is the \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d under MERA in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>because the collective bargaining and binding arbitration contemplated the eventual execution of a contract between the union and the board of education. Under General Statutes \u00a7 7-467 (1), the board of education was the municipal employer of the bargaining unit in question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The question, however, is whether the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d is the town council, as the town and board of education claim, or the board of education, as the union and board of mediation and arbitration claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We begin with the language of the statute. The legislature employed the term \u201clegislative body.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (m) provides, with one exception not relevant here, that \u201cthe words \u2018legislative body\u2019 ... as applied to cities and consolidated towns and cities, shall mean the board of aldermen, council or other body charged with the duty of making annual appropriations.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pursuant to the Stratford charter, the town council has the power to make annual appropriations. This legislative use of a specifically defined statutory term strongly suggests, if not compels, the conclusion that the legislature intended to incorporate that definition into \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5) when it enacted that subdivision in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Furthermore, the term \u201clegislative body\u201d in its normal usage ordinarily means a body that enacts laws. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) (defining \u201clegislation\u201d as \u201cthe making or giving of laws [as by an individual or an organized body]; specif: the exercise of the power and function of making rules [as laws, ordinances, edicts] having the force of authority by virtue of their promulgation by an official organ of a state or other organization\u201d). At the municipal level, the lawmaking function generally takes the form of enacting ordinances. Although a local board of education has an important role in setting educational policy, its responsibilities do not customarily encompass the enactment of ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In addition, the purpose of \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5), as disclosed by its legislative history and by other simultaneous amendments to \u00a7 7-473c, buttresses the conclusion that the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d was intended to mean the local body that has the responsibility for making appropriations and levying taxes. The legislative history indicates that in 1992, the legislature undertook to amend MERA<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in response to apparently widespread perceptions on the part of municipal officials that the binding arbitration process had yielded results that did not sufficiently take into account local financial conditions. A principal purpose of the 1992 amendments was to give a say in the ultimate result of the process to the local officials who were accountable for local finances. The legislation accomplishing that purpose was modeled in part after existing legislation that gives the General Assembly a say in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>binding arbitration awards for state employees. See General Statutes \u00a7 5-278 (b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The testimony on House Bill No. 5566 before the joint standing committee on labor and public employees, which ultimately became P.A. 92-84, strongly supports this reading of the principal purpose of the legislation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The floor debate in the House of Representatives strongly supports the conclusion that the purpose of \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5) was to vest the right to reject, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>first instance, an arbitration award under MERA in the local body that was most directly accountable to the local taxpayers, and that, therefore, the legislature intended the phrase \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d to mean, in a municipality such as Stratford, the town council.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Moreover, other parts of P.A. 92-84 reinforce this reading of \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). By that same legislation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the legislature amended \u00a7 7-473c in other respects that reflect a legislative emphasis on the public interest and the financial capabilities of the municipalities engaged in the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">Thus, P.A. 92-84 amended \u00a7 7-473c by adding what is now subsection (a). Subsection (a) of \u00a7 7-473c provides for the appointment by the labor commissioner of a \u201cneutral arbitrator selection committee,\u201d whose function is to appoint \u201ca panel of neutral arbitrators consisting of not less than twenty impartial persons representing the interests of the public in general to serve as provided in this section.\u201d These neutral arbitrators serve as the pool from which the third, and often deciding, arbitrator is chosen for the binding arbitration process under MERA. This legislative emphasis on the interests of the public is reinforced by other language of P.A. 92-84 amending what is now \u00a7 7-473c (b), providing that after each side has selected its arbitrator for purposes of the binding arbitration process, those two members shall select from this panel a third member \u201cwho shall be an impartial representative of the interests of the public.\u201d Moreover, in P.A. 92-84, the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ture inserted into what is now \u00a7 7-473c (d) (2), the provision that \u201c[i]n arriving at a decision, the arbitration panel shall give priority to the public interest and the financial capability of the municipal employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The union and board of mediation and arbitration argue, to the contrary, that the phrase \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d means the board of education because: (1) in General Statutes \u00a7 7-474 (b)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the legislature used the phrase \u201cbargaining representative of the municipality,\u201d signifying that there is a difference between the municipal employer and the municipality, and that when \u201cthe Connecticut legislature intended to refer to \u2018the legislative body of the municipality,\u2019 it did so explicitly\u201d; (2) the legislative history of MERA discloses that under that statutory scheme, the municipal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ity plays no role in the collective bargaining process, unlike under the Teacher Negotiation Act (TNA), General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq.; and (3) the trial court\u2019s conclusion gave insufficient weight to the interpretation given to the statute by the board of mediation and arbitration, which is the body charged with its enforcement. These arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">First, although we agree that the terms \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d and \u201cmunicipality\u201d have different meanings, if we were to accept the argument of the union and board of mediation and arbitration that the board of education is the \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer,\u201d we would have to conclude that the board of education is both the municipal employer and the legislative body of the municipal employer. That would mean, in turn, that in the context of this case, the term \u201cmunicipal employer\u201d is superfluous. We do not normally read legislative language as superfluous.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, 237 </em>Conn. 71, 79, 676 A.2d 819 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Second, the fact that the legislature used the word \u201cmunicipality\u201d in \u00a7 7-467 (1), and did not do so in \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5), cannot overcome the other strong indications that its use of the phrase \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d was intended to have the same meaning as legislative body of the municipality. That is the meaning that makes the most sense, given the language that it did use and its evident purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Similarly, the fact that, under MERA, unlike under TNA, the legislative body of the municipal employer is not injected into the process until after the arbitrators\u2019 first decision, is not determinative of the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d under MERA. The legislature\u2019s employment of the state-level model in this respect, pursuant to which the General Assembly plays no role in the collective bargaining process until after the arbitrators\u2019 decision, sufficiently explains this difference in treatment between MERA and TNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Finally, we are unpersuaded that we should attach special significance to the administrative interpretation of \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5) by the board of mediation and arbitration. Because the phrase \u201clegislative body of the municipal employer\u201d is of recent vintage, the board\u2019s interpretation thereof is of similar recent vintage. Moreover, the phrase has not, until this case, been the subject of judicial interpretation, and in such cases we ordinarily discount the weight given to administrative interpretation of legislative language.

The very nature of mediation and arbitration is not an adversary proceeding and has a different set of rules and different set of values, you might say and it would work a hardship on getting parties together in a labor dispute if the mediation process or indeed, the arbitration process is subject to the UAPA. There obviously would still be other remedies in court to overturn an arbitration decision under the pre-existing standard, such as the arbitrator was arbitrary, capricious and in abuse of discretion. So, I think it\u2019s something that we worked on and I think it should be passed. I move it to consent.\u201d 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., p. 2283.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> In their briefs, all of the parties assumed that this third requirement for mandamus was satisfied if there were no appeal under the UAPA. Nonetheless, we directed the parties to be prepared to address at oral argument the question of whether the filing of a motion to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 could constitute an adequate legal remedy that would preclude mandamus. That question, therefore, was considered at oral argument. We conclude that a motion to vacate an arbitration award under \u00a7 52-418 is not an appropriate method of challenging the failure of the board of mediation and arbitration to select a review panel of arbitrators pursuant to \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). There are significant differences between the two statutory schemes that compel this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Under \u00a7 52-418 (a), the court may grant an application to vacate an arbitration award on any of four grounds: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) an arbitrator was guilty of partiality or corruption; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, in refusing to hear pertinent and material evidence, \u201cor of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced\u201d; or (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, \u201cthat a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\u201d If the court concludes that any of these defects is present, the court \u201cshall make an order vacating the award\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a); and, if the award is vacated \u201cand the time within which the award is required to be rendered has not expired, the court . . . may direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">This statutory scheme is quite different from that providing for a review panel of arbitrators under \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). Under that statutory scheme, which is part of the binding, last best offer arbitration provisions of MERA, in order for the legislative body of the municipal employer to require the board of mediation and arbitration to appoint a review panel of arbitrators, the legislative body need not allege or establish any of the defects stated in \u00a7 52-418. Moreover, unlike \u00a7 52-418, the consequence of a request by the legislative body of the municipality is the appointment of a review panel of arbitrators, or one reviewing arbitrator, whose function is not to rehear the arbitration case, but whose \u201creview . . . shall be limited to the record and briefs of the hearing . . . the written explanation of the reasons for the vote [of the legislative body of the municipality] and a written response by either party.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5). Thus, an application to vacate under \u00a7 52-418 does not invoke the same standards, and will not yield the same or similar consequences, as a request for the appointment of a review panel under \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Indeed, by making reference to each other, both \u00a7 7-473c (d) and \u00a7 52-418 specifically contemplate that, in addition to a request for a review panel of arbitrators under \u00a7 7-473c by the legislative body of a municipality, either party to the binding arbitration process under MERA may file a petition with the court pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 to vacate an arbitration award rendered under MERA. In that event, however, the petitioner would be required to establish one of the four defects stated in 152-418, and the remedy would not be the appointment of a review panel of arbitrators but the remedies provided by \u00a7 52-418.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">We need not detail all of the differences between the two arbitral statutory schemes. Suffice it to say that the two provisions are sufficiently different to persuade us that a motion to vacate under \u00a7 52-418 cannot act as a surrogate for a request for a review panel of arbitrators under \u00a7 7-473c (d) (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> Following such a rejection, the board of mediation and arbitration selects a review panel of three arbitrators, who review the first decision based solely on the record of the first arbitration proceeding supplemented by the written objections and responses thereto. This review panel, using the same criteria specified in \u00a7 7-473c (d) (2), and also limited to the last best offers submitted on each issue, then issues a second decision, which is, absent a petition to vacate or modify pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 or General Statutes \u00a7 52-419, final and binding on the parties.

I think it\u2019s important that, particularly in the case of binding arbitration, Connecticut\u2019s taxpayers want to be part of the process. They feel that their elected representatives are prohibited from participating in the very decision making which has such a major impact on local taxes.\u201d Id., p. 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">During the same hearing, Representative Dale W. Radcliffe referred to the state procedures on which the proposal was modeled. He asked a witness: \u201cIf binding arbitration has been successful for state employees, would you be in favor of or opposed to giving local legislative bodies the same power the General Assembly has regarding collective bargaining agreements if in fact it has made for a successful process?\u201d Id., p. 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Donald St. Pierre, the chairman of the town council of Plainville stated: \u201cSeventeen years ago I sat in this house as a state representative and I voted for the binding arbitration law. The legislative intent 17 years ago was to correct three political situations that existed in the state of Connecticut, three cities, Bridgeport, New Haven and Hartford. We passed that law. Where it\u2019s gone from there is unbelievable. All I ask is give the local legislators like myself, the town councils, the chance to participate, to be able to say to the taxpayer, \u2018we did it, not an arbitrator.\u2019 I think we in our towns could do these things, but give us the power and the opportunity to do it. \u201d Id., p. <em>'440.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Saranne P. Murray, representing the Connecticut Public Employer Relations Association, \u201csupport[ed] the changes in the statutory factors which arbitrators are to consider in making binding arbitration awards. The increased emphasis on the public interest and financial capability of the municipality including other demands on the municipalities\u2019 financial resources, and also the ability to make comparisons with developments in the private sector are critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">\u201cWe also support the opportunity for municipalities to reject arbitration awards by a two-thirds majority vote. We believe that this is consistent with the strong home rule tradition of the state of Connecticut, would return decision making to the local level and urge the General Assembly to neither . . . nor condone delegation of these important decision making powers to a third party.\u201d Id., p. 455.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\"> Representative Joseph A.

We think that the criteria that has been added, adds to the arbitrators\u2019 decision, the need to take a much closer, a much closer look at the city or town\u2019s ability to pay and capability to pay, based on not only the evidence before it, but on the evidence related to those factors that might otherwise affect the town based on, for example, outstanding indebtedness, outstanding high tax structures and the like.\u201d 35 H.R. Proe., Pt. 6, 1992 Sess., pp. 1858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Representative Brian J.

This amendment would give them that power by a two-thirds override within 30 days after an arbitration award is issued. After that is issued, the legislative body will notify in the case of a teacher award, the Commissioner of Education and in the case of a municipal binding arb[itration] award that\u2019s non-teacher will notify the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration and one or three arbitrators will be appointed to serve as a review panel. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">\u201cThe board will review the prior arbitration, the rejection and a written appeal that will be given, a written reply given from the other party and then they will have 20 days to make their review and 5 days after that to issue an award. ... I think it provides for a very tight process and I will add something else this amendment does.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\u201cFirst of all, the cost. Who\u2019s going to pay for it? The legislative body that overrides this will have to pick up the tab and they\u2019ll know that going into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">\u201cAnd secondly, there has been some concern expressed that whatever two-thirds override it was, it would blow out the process too long and we would not be able to meet our time lines. The towns would not be able to submit their budgets on time. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">\u201cWe will have closure. We will have most importantly, a local voice in determining what happens. The taxpayers will have their elected representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>tives on their legislative bodies, able to stop a runaway train that some of these awards have been, similarly as we do. Because when three private individuals such as arbitrators, come into a town and they make an award, they leave, and they are not accountable to the people of that town who must live with the decision.\u201d Id., pp. 1864-66.</p>\n<p id=\"A5a\">Representative Flaherty also observed that \u201c[t]he intent of both of these subsections, and it is, and it should be mirrored that again, that legislative body is, will perform the duties where there is a town meeting.\u201d Id., p. 1895.</p>\n<p id=\"A1e\">Representative Robert A. Maddox stated: \u201cI think that we\u2019re losing some sight of what this amendment attempts to do. It brings back some control to the municipalities over the process. . . . We\u2019re saying to them, we\u2019re going to return to you some degree of control if a binding arbitration comes down that you believe is wrong.\u201d Id., pp. 1902-1903.</p>\n<p id=\"AD_\">According to Representative X Vincent Chase, \u201cthis is a very simple amendment. It says we\u2019re going to tell, excuse me, it says we\u2019re going to allow our local officials the option to override an agreement that they may feel they can\u2019t afford. We\u2019re not completely eliminating binding arbitration because it still has to go back to an arbitration panel.\u201d Id., p. 1904.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 7-474 (b) provides: \u201cAny agreement reached by the negotiators shall be reduced to writing.

Where the legislative body is the town meeting, approval of the agreement by a majority of the selectmen shall make the agreement valid and binding upon the town and the board of finance shall appropriate or provide whatever funds are necessary to comply with such collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> We recognize that there may be some cases in which the factual context compels a finding that the municipal employer and the legislative body of the municipal employer are one and the same. That, however, is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
