Co., </em>239 Conn. 537, 687 A.2d 1262 (1996). Specifically, the sole issue in this appeal is whether, under the facts of this case, the estate of the decedent, Jorge A. Agosto, is entitled to underinsured motorist benefits, as a covered insured, pursuant to the automobile liability insurance policy (policy) issued to the decedent\u2019s employer, the state of Connecticut (state). The policy was issued to the state in order to insure the fleet of state police and division of criminal justice vehicles, as well as various other state vehicles. This policy also contained an uninsured/underinsured motorist endorsement (uninsured motorist endorsement). The plaintiff, Debra Ann P. Agosto, as administratrix of the estate of her husband, brought an action to recover underinsured motorist benefits, as a result of his death, under the policy issued by the defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that the decedent was not a covered insured under the uninsured motorist endorsement issued to the state. The trial court granted the motion and rendered summary judgment for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"Axd\">The undisputed facts are as follows. The decedent, in his official capacity as a state trooper, effected a traffic stop of a vehicle on the highway. The decedent exited his police cruiser and proceeded to approach the stopped vehicle at the side of the road when a third vehicle struck and killed him. After exhausting the tortfeasor\u2019s motor vehicle liability policy, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>brought an action against the defendant for underinsured motorist benefits. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the uninsured motorist endorsement issued to the state was not ambiguous, and that the decedent did not fall within the definitions of an insured. The trial court found that the only way that the decedent could have been an insured covered by the uninsured motorist endorsement was if he was \u201coccupying\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his vehicle, as defined by the uninsured motorist endorsement, at the time of his fatal accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the uninsured motorist endorsement was unambiguous. The plaintiff essentially argues that the policy was ambiguous because it contained language oriented toward both individuals and family members and, therefore, it should be construed in favor of coverage for the plaintiffs decedent. Within the context of an uninsured motorist endorsement issued to a corporation, we addressed this very same policy language in <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 537, and, for the reasons set forth therein, we reverse the judgment of the trial court in this case. Because the uninsured motorist endorsements are practically identical,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we see no reason to distinguish this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>case from <em>Hansen </em>on the ground that this policy was issued to a governmental entity, the state, as opposed to a corporation. The same problematic language exists here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the basis of our reasoning in <em>Hansen, </em>the defendant in the present case should not have issued an uninsured motorist endorsement containing language referring to individuals and family members when the named insured was a governmental entity. The plaintiffs decedent is entitled to coverage under the uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> \u201cOccupying,\u201d according to the definition in the policy\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsement, \u201cmeans in, upon, getting in, on, out or off\u2019 a covered auto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> The uninsured motorist endorsement of the policy issued to the state provided in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">\u201cA.

Moreover, \u201cwhen a corporate or <em>governmental </em>entity is identified as the named insured in an insurance policy that uses coverage terms appropriate for coverage issued to <em>individuals, </em>courts chastise insurers for employing those forms rather than using coverage terms that are appropriate for insurance policies issued to various types of businesses or <em>governmental </em>entities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 3 A.
