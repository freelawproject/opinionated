We granted certification to appeal to review the propriety of the Appellate Court\u2019s ruling. See <em>Lumber Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>237 Conn. 908, 675 A.2d 456 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">While this case was pending, however, the legislature enacted No. 95-111<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the 1995 Public Acts, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>applicable to civil actions filed on or after July 1, 1995. That public act has, among other things, altered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>procedure applicable to the type of motion and ruling at issue in this appeal. Although the defendant\u2019s motion was filed prior to the enactment of Public Act 95-111, which does not apply retroactively to the motion, we conclude that the significance of this appeal has been undermined significantly by this legislation and, therefore, that the appeal should be dismissed because certification to appeal was improvidently granted. See, e.g., <em>In re Romance M., </em>229 Conn. 345, 358, 641 A.2d 378 (1994) (appeal dismissed where, subsequent to granting of certification, promulgation of new rule of practice \u201cfirmly established] the applicable policy\u201d for future cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-102 provides: \u201cJoinder of persons with interest adverse to plaintiff and of necessary persons.

(NEW) (a) A defendant in any civil action to which section 52-572h of the general statutes applies may serve a writ, summons and complaint upon a person not a party to the action who is or may be liable pursuant to said section for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages in which case the demand for relief shall seek an apportionment of liability. Any such writ, summons and complaint, hereinafter called the apportionment complaint, shall be served within one hundred twenty days of the return date specified in the plaintiffs original complaint. The defendant filing an apportionment complaint shall serve a copy of such apportionment complaint on all parties to the original action in accordance with the rules of practice of the superior court on or before the return date specified in the apportionment complaint. The person upon whom the apportionment complaint is served, hereinafter called the apportionment defendant, shall be a party for all purposes, including all purposes under section 52-572h of the general statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">\u201c(b) The apportionment complaint shall be equivalent in all respects to an original writ, summons and complaint, except that it shall include the docket number assigned to the original action and no new entry fee shall be imposed. The apportionment defendant shall have available to him all remedies available to an original defendant including the right to assert defenses, set-offs or counterclaims against any party. If the apportionment complaint is served within the time period specified in subsection (a) of this section, no statute of limitation or repose shall be a defense or bar to such claim for apportionment, except that, if tire action against the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>who instituted the apportionment complaint pursuant to subsection (a) o\u00ed this section is subject to such a defense or bar, the apportionment defendant may plead such a defense or bar to any claim brought by the plaintiff directly against the apportionment defendant pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"AU1e\">\"(c) No person who is immune from liability shall be made an apportionment defendant nor shall such person\u2019s liability be considered for apportionment purposes pursuant to section 52-572h of the general statutes. If a defendant claims that the negligence of any person, who was not made a party to the action, was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries or damage and the plaintiff has previously settled or released the plaintiff\u2019s claims against such person, then a defendant may cause such person\u2019s liability to be apportioned by filing a notice specifically identifying such person by name and last known address and the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against such person have been settled or released. Such notice shall also set forth the factual basis of the defendant\u2019s claim that the negligence of such person was a proximate cause of the plaintiff s injuries or damages. No such notice shall be required if such person with whom the plaintiff settled or whom the plaintiff released was previously a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah8\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitation or repose, the plaintiff may, within sixty days of the return date of the apportionment complaint served pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, assert any claim against the apportionment defendant arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"A_l\">\u201c(e) When a counterclaim is asserted against a plaintiff, he may cause a person not a party to the action to be brought in as an apportionment defendant under circumstances which under this section would entitle a defendant to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Azt\">\u201c(f) This section shall be tire exclusive means by which a defendant may add a person who is or may be liable pursuant to section 52-572h of the general statutes for a proportionate share of the plaintiffs damages as a party to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"AYer\">\u201c(g) In no event shall any proportionate share of negligence determined pursuant to subsection (f) of section 52-572h of the general statutes attributable to an apportionment defendant against whom the plaintiff did not assert a claim be reallocated under subsection (g) of said section. Such proportionate share of negligence shall, however, be included in or added to the combined negligence of the person or persons against whom the plaintiff seeks recovery, including persons with whom the plaintiff settled or whom the plaintiff released under subsection (n) of section 52-572h of the general statutes, when comparing any negligence of the plaintiff to other parties and persons under subsection (b) of said section.</p>\n<p id=\"AKFV\">\u201cSec. 2.
