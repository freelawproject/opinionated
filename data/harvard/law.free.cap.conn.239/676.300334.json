J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa8\">The issue in this appeal from the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) concerns the proper method of calculating the cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) of the plaintiff, Karyn Gil, whose injury occurred prior to October 1, 1991, and whose workers\u2019 compensation benefits extend beyond October 1,1991, the effective date of Public Acts 1991, No. 91-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>339, \u00a7 27 (P.A. 91-339), which amended General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, the second injury fund (fund), appealed to the Appellate Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from a decision of the board, which reversed a finding and award of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the sixth district. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We reverse the judgment of the board and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. On December 1, 1983, the plaintiff was exposed to chlorine gas during the course of her employment. As a result, she suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>permanent injury to her respiratory system. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff earned an average weekly wage of $139.96; her base compensation rate<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was $93.35. The fund assumed liability for the plaintiffs claim in November, 1986. The plaintiff has received total incapacity benefits from the date of her injury to the present, and in accordance with \u00a7 31-307a (a), she has received COLAs that have been added to her base compensation rate each October l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">In 1991, the legislature enacted P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, amending \u00a7 31-307a (a). Prior to the enactment of P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, COLAs were calculated annually on October 1 by means of a flat dollar adjustment equal to the flat dollar increase in the maximum compensation rate from year to year.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Public Act 91-339, \u00a7 27, altered the method by which COLAs were calculated, replacing the flat dollar adjustment method with a percentage adjustment method.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>In order to allay confusion caused by the new method of calculating COLAs, the then workers\u2019 compensation commission chairman, John Arcudi, on October 30, 1991, promulgated an interpretation of P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27 (Arcudi method). Arcudi interpreted \u00a7 27 to mandate percentage adjustments, rather than flat dollar adjustments, for all total disability claimants, including the plaintiff, on and after October 1, 1991. COLAs, under the Arcudi method, were calculated by multiplying the percentage increase each year of the maximum compensation rate by the claimant\u2019s current adjusted compensation rate. Consequently, the claimant\u2019s new adjusted compensation rate was comprised of that year\u2019s COLA added to the previous year\u2019s adjusted compensation rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Workers\u2019 compensation payors followed Arcudi\u2019s interpretation until June 5,1995, when the board issued its decision in <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>JAB Enterprises, Inc., </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 127 (1995). In <em>Wolfe, </em>the board concluded that \u201c[b]y its plain language, the statute [P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27] increases the base compensation rate at the time of the injury by the percentage of the increase in the maximum compensation rate. The statutory formula does not contemplate an increase based in part on prior COLAs, as those take place [after] the time of the injury. This language is unambiguous, and we do not have discretion to construe it otherwise.\u201d Id., 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Pursuant to the <em>Wolfe </em>decision, COLAs were calculated by determining the percentage increase between the maximum compensation rate at the time of injury and the current maximum compensation rate, multiplying that percentage by a claimant\u2019s base compensation rate, and adding that amount to the base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>compensation rate. The fund altered its method for calculating annual COLAs to comply with the <em>Wolfe </em>decision and began implementing the new procedure in December, 1995. Under the <em>Wolfe </em>method of calculating COLAs, the plaintiffs biweekly check was reduced from $518.21 to $316.04. The plaintiff challenged the reduction in her benefits and was given a formal hearing before the sixth district commissioner on February 15, 1996. After the hearing, the commissioner rendered a decision ordering the fund to \u201creinstate the flat dollar amount of cost of living adjustments the claimant is entitled to receive through September 30,1991 and . . . only apply the formula for calculating adjustments on a percentage increase from October 1, 1991 forward in accordance with the statutory changes made by the enactment of P.A. 91-339.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The fund subsequently petitioned the board for a review of the commissioner\u2019s decision. Upon review, the board found that the amendments to \u00a7 31-307a (a) in P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, constituted \u201ca change in the substance of our workers\u2019 compensation law and therefore should not be applied retroactively.\u201d The board then remanded the matter to the commissioner to enter an order in accordance with its determination that COLAs are to be calculated in accordance with the method of calculation in existence at the time of the injury. That method, in the case of the plaintiff, was the flat dollar COLA in effect prior to the effective date of P.A. 91-339. The fund appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The fund urges us to adopt the Arcudi method of calculating COLAs as the proper application of the statute. Alternatively, the fund argues that the court should adopt the position of the board in <em>Wolfe. </em>The plaintiff would have us embrace the position taken by the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>in this case and preserve the flat dollar COLA for those persons injured prior to the effective date of P.A. 91-339, applying a percentage formula only to those injured after that date. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association, an amicus curiae in this appeal, argues for a method of calculation that preserves the plaintiffs flat dollar COLAs to 1990, but applies the amended statute\u2019s percentage rate to the plaintiff as of October 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">This is a case of statutory construction and, as such, \u201c[o]ur analysis of the plaintiffs claims is guided by well established tenets .... [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . . In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 714-15, 674 A.2d 845 (1996); see <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 120, 676 A.2d 825 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We acknowledge, however, that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial and must be interpreted liberally to achieve its humanitarian purposes. <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 341, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992); <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992); <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>221 Conn. 29, 32, 602 A.2d 560 (1992); <em>Ash </em>v. <em>New Milford, </em>207 Conn. 665, 672, 541 A.2d 1233 (1988). \u201cBecause the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] is a remedial statute, this court should not impose limitations on the benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u201d <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">If we were to restrict our view of the question at issue to a literal application of \u00a7 27 of P.A. 91-339, the resulting method of calculation of COLAs would be the alternate position espoused by the fund and the method set forth in the board\u2019s decision in <em>Wolfe. </em>Basically, that method would have the current adjusted compensation rate determined by dividing the current maximum compensation rate by the maximum compensation rate on the date of the plaintiffs injury to find the percentage increase of the maximum compensation rate, and then multiplying that percentage increase by the plaintiffs base compensation rate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The increase over the plaintiffs base compensation rate would be the COLA for the current year. This application of the statute disregards the previous flat dollar COLAs and, as noted above, reduced the plaintiffs biweekly check from $518.21 to $316.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In addition to \u00a7 27, however, the legislature also enacted P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 50, to take effect October 1,1991, which provides: \u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to affect any claims for compensation arising from any injury that occurred before October 1, 1991. Nothing in this act shall be construed to reduce the amount of any compensation awarded for any injury that occurred before October 1,1991.\u201d While the first sentence of \u00a7 50 concerns claims that were pending at the time the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>was passed, the second sentence focuses on compensation and prohibits its reduction for those receiving compensation who were injured before October 1,1991.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The intent of the legislature, as expressed in \u00a7 50, calls into question a literal application of \u00a7 27 because the legislature clearly did not intend to reduce benefits being received by persons injured prior to October 1,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Representative Joseph A. Adamo, on the floor of the House of Representatives, expressed the legislature\u2019s intent to safeguard the increased compensation received by claimants due to previous COLAs when he summarized P.A. 91-339. He said, in part, \u201c[P.A. 91-339] goes on to repeal a number of sections under the act that are changed by this particular, with . . . most of the act being effective on July 1,1991, the benefit levels being changed effective October 1, 1991, and it would not \u2014 it would be prospective, everyone who [is] on the benefits would be grandfathered under those existing benefits . . . .\u201d 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 24, 1991 Sess., p. 9039, remarks of Representative Joseph A. Adamo. Although Adamo\u2019s comments concerned all of P.A. 91-339, which altered compensation in ways other than the computation of COLAs,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> his assertions that that act would be applied prospectively and that persons currently receiving benefits would be grandfathered support a reading of the statute that protects COLAs that had been received by claimants prior to October 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Clearly, the legislature did not enact P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, with the intent to reduce drastically a claimant\u2019s adjusted compensation rate. We therefore conclude that \u00a7 50 lends ambiguity to P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, and that a literal reading of \u00a7 27 would result in its improper application. We conclude, rather, that P.A. 91-339 should be applied to preserve the COLA effective October 1, 1990,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> for claimants who had been receiving COLAs prior to October 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We cannot agree, however, with the plaintiffs contention that she is entitled to have her COLAs determined in the future by the same method of calculation that existed on the date of her injury. In support of her contention, the plaintiff cites the \u201cdate of injury\u201d rule and General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (u) and 55-3. We summarized the date of injury rule in <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988). There we considered the effect of a 1978 amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: \u201cBy the time Public Acts 1978, No. 78-369, was enacted, we had made clear through earlier decisions our view that new workers\u2019 compensation legislation affecting rights and obligations as between the parties, and not specifying otherwise, applied only to those persons who received injuries after the legislation became effective, and not to those injured previously. This date of injury rule was first referred to in 1916, in <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O.K. Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 220-21, 96 A. 963 (1916). In 1921, we stated that \u2018[t]he obligations of the employer to dependents of an employee in case of the death of an injured employee are . . . fixed and determined by the statute in force at the time of injury.\u2019 <em>Quilty </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Conn. 124, 127, 113 A. 149 (1921).\u201d <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 222.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The date of injury rule functions as a presumption of legislative intent within the workers\u2019 compensation context, similar to the general presumption against retroactive application of a statute. \u201c[W]e consistently have expressed reluctance to construe statutes retroactively where the statutes affect substantial changes in the law, unless the legislative intent clearly and unequivocally appears otherwise.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 741, 517 A.2d 610 (1986). In <em>Iacomacci, </em>we noted the date of injury rule\u2019s presumptive status: \u201c[N]ew workers\u2019 compensation legislation affecting rights and obligations as between the parties, <em>and not specifying otherwise, </em>applies] only to those persons who received injuries after the legislation became effective, and not to those injured previously.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 222. As recently as 1994, we noted that the date of injury rule was a presumption subject to the express intent of the legislature. See <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>231 Conn. 287, 293 n.8, 649 A.2d 523 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The legislature is presumed to know of our interpretation of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes and to know that it must make its intention clear if it intends to override the date of injury rule. We presume \u201cthat the legislature [was] mindful of judicial construction relevant to . . . legislation it enact[ed].\u201d <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 200 n.14, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985); <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 395 n.7, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982), overruled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>part on other grounds, <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Coon, </em>220 Conn. 30, 36 n.6, 594 A.2d 977 (1991). \u201c \u2018In the interpretation of a statute, a radical departure from an established policy cannot be implied. It must be expressed in unequivocal language.\u2019 <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>140 Conn. 650, 667, 103 A.2d 535 (1954) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 459, 497 A.2d 974 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The legislature, however, has demonstrated its ability to overcome the presumption of the date of injury rule when amending the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Public Acts 1969, No. 696, \u00a7 5, added COLAs to compensation benefits for total incapacity \u201cas a result of an injury sustained prior to October 1, 1969\u201d \u2014 before the effective date of the act. Further, Public Acts 1977, No. 77-554, \u00a7 1, made the fund responsible for COLAs that were to be added to death benefits \u201cas a result of death arising out of a compensable injury occurring on or before September 30,1977\u201d \u2014 again, before the effective date of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We conclude that it was the intention of the legislature to make P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, applicable to claimants injured prior to October 1, 1991, when it amended \u00a7 31-307a (a) to provide as follows: \u201cThe weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 <em>as a result of an injury sustained on or after October 1, 1969 . . . </em>shall be adjusted . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language in the statute is unequivocal, and there is nothing in the legislative history that suggests a different conclusion. Any presumption against having P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, apply to those injured before 1991 must therefore give way to the expressed intent of the legislature to apply the amended COLA provision to claimants injured before the effective date of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">In support of her position, the plaintiff also cites \u00a7\u00a71-1 (u) and 55-3 and case law concerning judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>application of substantive and procedural changes in the law. Section 1-1 (u) provides: \u201cThe passage or repeal of an act shall not affect any action then pending.\u201d We have interpreted \u00a7 1-1 (u) as reflecting the general rule concerning the effect of a statute on a pending action. \u201cThe situation is not within the provision of [\u00a7 1-1 (u)] of the General Statutes, that \u2018[t]he passage or repeal of an act shall not affect any action then pending,\u2019 for this is \u2018merely declaratory of a rule of construction\u2019 and not applicable where a legislative intent to the contrary appears. <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>86 Conn. 425, 427, 85 Atl. 686 [1913].\u201d <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, </em>127 Conn. 415, 420, 17 A.2d 525 (1941). Section 1-1 (u) and our interpretation of it is a rule of construction, an aid in construing statutes, and not a rule that preempts the legislature\u2019s clearly expressed intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Section 55-3 provides: \u201cNo provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have a retrospective effect.\u201d We have stated that: \u201cThe \u2018obligations\u2019 referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. <em>Nagle v. Wood, </em>178 Conn. 180, 186, 423 A.2d 875 (1979). Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of presumed legislative intent that statutes affecting substantive rights shall apply prospectively only. <em>Westport v. State, </em>204 Conn. 212, 219, 527 A.2d 1177 (1987); <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. v. Department of Liquor Control, </em>194 Conn. 165, 174, 479 A.2d 1191 (1984); <em>Enfield Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. Bissell, </em>184 Conn. 569, 571, 440 A.2d 220 (1981). The legislature only rebuts this presumption when it \u2018clearly and unequivocally\u2019 expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. <em>State v. Lizotte, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 741]; <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. v. Department of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 174 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 467-68, 556 A.2d 145 (1989); see <em>Little </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>158 Conn. 452, 457, 262 A.2d 174 (1969) (\u201c[t]he presumption is that statutes affecting substantive rights are intended to operate prospectively, and to furnish a rule for future cases only, unless they contain language unequivocally and certainly embracing past transactions\u201d). In light of the legislature\u2019s clearly expressed intention in P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, to have it apply to all employees injured \u201con or after October 1, 1969,\u201d we conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 27 to apply to the plaintiff and all those similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">\u201cWe have regularly recognized the right of the legislature retroactively to make legal and regular that which was previously illegal and irregular, provided that vested rights are not unjustly abrogated. <em>C.S.E.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Policy Board, </em>165 Conn. 448, 454-55, 334 A.2d 909 (1973); <em>Carvette </em>v. <em>Marion Power Shovel Co., </em>157 Conn. 92, 95-96, 249 A.2d 58 (1968) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) Enfield <em>Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 572. Our question then becomes whether the legislature, when it enacted Public Acts 1969, No. 696, \u00a7 5 (codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> created a vested right in the plaintiff to have her future COLAs calculated by the same method of calculation that existed on the date of her injury. \u201cWhen the legislature intends to surrender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>its power of amendment and revision by creating a contract and thereby binding future legislatures, it must declare that intention in <em>clear and unambiguous terms. </em>A relinquishment of this authority should not occur by legislative inadvertence or judicial implication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 415, 488 A.2d 803 (1985). We do not believe that, as enacted in 1969, the language in \u00a7 31-307a (a) \u2014 simply providing that \u201c[t]he weekly compensation rate of each employee . . . shall be adjusted annually as provided herein as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide such injured employee with a cost-of-living adjustment in his weekly compensation rate\u201d \u2014 indicates an intention on the part of the legislature to create a vested, contractual-like right to have one\u2019s COLA perpetually calculated as it was calculated on the date of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The plaintiff next contends that Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 21 (P.A. 93-228), which amended General Statutes \u00a7 31-309 (a), is relevant to our interpretation of P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27. She claims the following language is pertinent: \u201c[Wjeekly compensation received by an injured employee whose injury occurred before July 1, 1993, shall be computed according to the provisions of the law in effect at the time of his injury.\u201d Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 21. Because the definition of \u201ccompensation\u201d includes \u201cadjustment in benefits,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the plaintiff argues, the legislature clearly intended COLAs to be determined according to the law in effect on the date of injury. In further support of this argument, the plaintiff refers to an opinion letter of the attorney general, which interpreted that portion of P.A. 93-228 that altered the method for determining the maximum compensation rate for the ensuing years.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>general stated: \u201cCOLAs for 1994 and 1995 should be computed in the same manner that COLAs were computed for 1993, i.e., by comparing the maximum compensation rates under \u00a7 31-309 using 150% of the average production wage formula (the law in effect for injuries occurring prior to July 1, 1993) and applying whatever <em>percentage </em>increase there is to the claimant\u2019s weekly compensation rate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We find neither the plaintiffs argument concerning P.A. 93-228 nor the attorney general\u2019s letter compelling. In his letter, the attorney general addressed only the 1993 act and the proper method of computing the maximum compensation rate. Although the maximum compensation rate is used in calculating COLAs, the method of computing the maximum compensation rate is not an issue in this case. The attorney general\u2019s opinion letter, therefore, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The plaintiffs interpretation of the language in P.A. 93-228 and her attempt to utilize it to construe P.A. 91-339 is similarly inapposite. Public Act 93-228 addressed only the calculation of the maximum compensation rate and <em>not </em>the method of calculation of COLAs. The plaintiff would have us interpret P.A. 93-228, which addresses only one variable in the COLA equation, as evidence of the legislature\u2019s position on every variable in the COLA equation and its application date. We do not construe the language of P.A. 93-228 as supporting such a broad interpretation, particularly when we are confronted with unambiguous language in P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, that clearly and unequivocally makes \u00a7 27 applicable to claimants who were injured before its effective date.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In sum, we conclude that a perennial application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>of the flat dollar COLA for claimants injured before October 1, 1991, the effective date of P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, is not the appropriate interpretation of \u00a7 31-307a (a). Rather, we construe P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, as mandating percentage-based COLAs commencing October 1,1991, for all recipients of COLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The proper balance between preserving the \u201caccrued\u201d flat rate adjustments, as we believe we are bound to do by P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 50, and fairly construing P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, can be achieved by employing the following method of calculating COLAs. In order to arrive at the proper percentage of increase, the current maximum compensation rate should be divided by the maximum compensation rate effective on October 1, 1990 (the last maximum compensation rate before P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, became effective); that figure should be multiplied by the claimant\u2019s base compensation rate, i.e., the compensation rate as of the date of injury; the resulting figure should then be added to the claimant\u2019s COLA on October 1, 1990<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (this recognizes and preserves the claimant\u2019s accrued COLAs). This sum is the claimant\u2019s current adjusted compensation rate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This method preserves the 1990 flat dollar COLA by simply adding it to the claimant\u2019s adjusted compensation rate as calculated by the statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, it remains true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>to the statute by increasing the compensation rate that the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of injury by the percentage of the increase in the maximum compensation rate.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The only arguable alternative to the method set forth in the preceding paragraph for determining COLAs for claimants injured before October 1,1991, that preserves the 1990 COLA is the Arcudi method, which was followed by the payors and payees for four years.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Arcudi method protected a claimant\u2019s \u201caccrued\u201d flat dollar adjustments, but determined the subsequent percentage adjustments by multiplying the maximum compensation rate\u2019s percentage increase from the previous year by the adjusted compensation rate of the claimant for the previous year (the previous year\u2019s adjusted compensation rate would include \u201caccrued\u201d COLAs to that date).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Therefore, unlike the method we adopt, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>references the compensation rate at the time of injury to determine the present year\u2019s percentage adjustment, the Arcudi method referenced a claimant\u2019s base compensation rate plus all \u201caccrued\u201d COLAs to date to determine the present year\u2019s percentage adjustment. In essence, the Arcudi method continually updated the referenced compensation rate by adding to it the yearly dollar adjustments. This method not only protected the flat dollar 1990 COLA, but it also allowed that adjustment and all future percentage adjustments to be figured into subsequent COLAs as part of the referenced compensation rate. The legislature was clear in its intent to preserve a claimant\u2019s flat dollar COLA increases to 1990, but there is no support for the proposition that the 1990 flat dollar COLA and future COLAs must or should be used to increase the referenced compensation rate in a determination of the present years\u2019 adjustment. Our method of calculation more nearly conforms to the statute because it references the compensation rate at the time of injury; or as the statute provides, \u201cthe weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that COLAs for claimants injured prior to October 1, 1991, should be calculated according to the following formula: the percentage of increase of the maximum compensation rate is to be obtained by dividing the current maximum compensation rate by the maximum compensation rate effective on October 1,1990; that figure should then be multiplied by the claimant\u2019s base compensation rate and then added to the claimant\u2019s COLA as of October 1, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The plaintiffs COLAs should be adjusted from the date of reduction in December, 1995, to the present in accordance with the method set out in the preceding paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The judgment of the board is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">In this opinion NORCOTT, PALMER and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act can be found in chapter 568 of the General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 31-275 through 31-355a.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-307a (a), as amended by P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, provides: \u201cCost-of-living adjustment in compensation rates, (a) The weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as a result of an injury sustained on or after October 1, 1969, which totally disables the employee continuously or intermittently for any period extending to the following October first or thereafter, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subsection as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the injured employee with a cost-of-living adjustment in his weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309.

While we acknowledge these interpretive presumptions, we nonetheless decline to adopt the Arcudi method for two reasons. First, the industry\u2019s two interpretations of the Arcudi method; see footnote 20 of this opinion; undermine the presumption that the legislature has concurred with a particular interpretation. Second, there should be no deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation because the agency itself has issued inconsistent interpretations (compare the Arcudi method, <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>JAB Enterprises, </em>Inc., supra, 14 Conn.

Contrary to our clearly defined law, the court today adopts an interpretation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (act) pertaining to the method of calculating cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) urged upon us only by the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) and the American Insurance Association (AIA), two of the parties filing amicus curiae briefs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>method of calculating COLAs for persons injured prior to October 1,1991, will result in totally disabled workers, dependent surviving spouses, and minor children of workers killed in the course of their employment, receiving less in weekly compensation benefits. Indeed, the decision of the majority today means that from October 1, 1991, many of those beneficiaries received amounts in excess of that to which they were entitled and they conceivably could be required to repay those amounts. The second injury fund of the state of Connecticut (fund), which is obligated to make these payments to the plaintiff, Karyn Gil, does not, <em>before this </em>court, take the position adopted by the majority. Instead, the fund argues, in the first instance, for an inteipretation that is more moderate, leaving the plaintiff and other beneficiaries entitled to COLAs prior to October 1, 1991, in the same position that they were in before the state unilaterally decided to reduce their awards.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">We are required in this appeal to answer the following: (1) whether the provisions of \u00a7 27 of No. 91-339 of the 1991 Public Acts (P.A. 91-339), which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-307a (a), applies retroactively for COLA compensation involving injuries that occurred prior to October 1, 1991; and (2) if so, the method of calculating those COLAs.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">I will briefly restate the undisputed facts in this case.

The method of calculating the COLAs under \u00a7 31-307a (a) prior to October 1, 1991, was the flat grant accrual method \u2014 the annual COLA was based upon the difference between the maximum compensation in effect at the time of the adjustment and the maximum in the preceding October 1. The compensation was therefore the base rate plus the sum of each annual COLA (flat grant method). In this case, under the flat grant method, the plaintiff would receive as of October 1, 1995, her base rate of $93.35 plus the sum of the annual COLAs in the amount of $239,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> totaling $332.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The legislature adopted P.A. 91-339, thereby amending \u00a7 31-307a (a) by substituting a percentage adjustment for the flat grant. Public Act 91-339, \u00a7 27, provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under the provisions of section 31-309 ... to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injuiy, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury shall be increased by the percentage of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of section 31-309 . . . from the date of the injuiy to such October first. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">On October 30, 1991, commissioner John A. Arcudi, the former chairperson of the workers\u2019 compensation commission (commission), administratively issued a clarifying memorandum concerning P.A. 91-339 (Arcudi memorandum). Implicitly recognizing the \u201cdate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>injury rule\u201d with respect to compensation \u2014 which will be discussed later in this opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 he viewed COLAs as an \u201cadjustment,\u201d rather than \u201ccompensation.\u201d Arcudi concluded that P.A. 91-339 applied to injuries prior to October 1, 1991, reasoning that \u201c[i]n interpreting the law over the years, \u2018compensation rate\u2019 has come to mean the worker\u2019s base rate computed at the time of injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cost-of-living increase has been called an \u2018adjustment.\u2019 Therefore, when section 27 changes the computation of the \u2018adjustment\u2019 to a percentage increase rather than a dollar amount and has no saving clause as does [P.A. 91-339] section 29 when it refers to the compensation rate, the legislative intent is to have all cost-of-living adjustments computed after October 1, 1991 to be done on a percentage basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Arcudi memorandum, interpreting P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, also determined that the COLAs should be calculated for persons injured prior to 1991 in the following manner. The base rate plus the accumulated COLAs as of September 30, 1991, is multiplied by the percentage increase from September 30, 1991, to the year in question; this COLA is then added to the base rate plus the accumulated COLAs as of September 30, 1991, in order to determine the compensation rate for the year (Arcudi method). Applying the Arcudi method, as the fund did until 1995, would result in the plaintiff receiving, as of October 1,1995, the base rate of $93.35 and accumulated COLAs as of September 30,1991, of $134, plus apercentage increase of 21.9 percent in the amount of $49.79, totaling $277.14. All payors, including the fund with respect to the plaintiff, followed the Arcudi method, with a slight variation, which amounted to an insignifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>cant difference,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for calculating COLAs for persons injured prior to October 1, 1991, until 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">On June 5,1995, in <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>JAB Enterprises, Inc., </em>14 Conn. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rev. Op. 127 (1995), an opinion authored by Jesse M. Frankl, the chairperson of the commission, the workers\u2019 compensation review board (review board) held that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, required that the calculations be made as follows: the base rate multiplied by the percentage of increase between the maximum rate on the date of injury and the date of adjustment <em>(Wolfe </em>method). Id., 129-30. The fund, applying the <em>Wolfe </em>method, recalculated the plaintiffs compensation as of October 1,1995, which would result in the plaintiff receiving 169 percent of her base rate of $93.35, totaling $157.76. The plaintiff, contesting the redetermination of her weekly compensation, brought the matter before the commission for New Britain. The New Britain commission rejected <em>Wolfe </em>and ordered that the plaintiffs weekly compensation benefits be calculated under the Arcudi method.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The fund appealed from the New Britain commission\u2019s order to the review board. After the appeal was taken, on February 9, 1996, Frankl administratively issued a memorandum, essentially reversing his position in <em>Wolfe, </em>which provided that for all persons injured prior to October 1, 1991, their COLAs should be calculated in accordance with the Arcudi method. On May 1,1996, the review board<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concluded that the provisions of P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, were not retroactive and ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>that the plaintiffs compensation be recalculated based upon the flat grant method, thereby substantially increasing the weekly amount that would be allowed under <em>Wolfe </em>or the Arcudi method. Subsequently, the fund brought this appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">On appeal, the CBIA and AIA argue, and the majority agrees, that the COLAs for any given year should be calculated based upon the base rate, multiplied by the percentage increase in the maximum rate between 1991 and the year in question; that COLA is then added to the base rate plus the COLAs as of September 30, 1991, in order to determine the compensation rate for the year (CBIA/AIA method). Applying the CBIA/AIA method would result in the plaintiff receiving as of October 1, 1995, the base rate of $93.35 and the accumulated COLAs as of September 30,1991, of $134, plus apercentage increase of 21.9 percent of the base rate of $93.35 in the amount of $20.44, totaling $247.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In sum, the amounts the plaintiff would receive as of October 1, 1995, under each method are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\"><em>Wolfe </em>method $157.76</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">CBIA/AIA method $247.79</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Arcudi method $277.14</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">Flat grant method $332.35</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">Although I agree with the majority that the provisions for calculating COLAs pursuant to P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>retroactive, in my view, it is not as easy a call as the majority opinion would make it appear. Indeed, if we were writing on a clean slate and applied the plain language of P.A. 91-339,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which was confirmed by the legislative debates,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the \u201cdate of injury rule,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> our gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>eral rules of statutory construction,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and our longstanding rule liberally construing workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>laws,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I would be compelled to conclude that the review board was correct in holding that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, has no retroactive application and those who were injured prior to October 1, 1991, are entitled to COLAs based upon the flat grant method.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">I reach the same result as to retroactivity that the majority does, but I do so only because of the Arcudi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>memorandum. Arcudi, as the then chairperson of the commission, interpreted P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, as applying retroactively to those who were injured prior to October 1, 1991. \u201c[T]he interpretation of a statute by an agency created to administer that statute is traditionally accorded great deference.\u201d <em>E.I.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration for Professional &amp; Land Surveyors, </em>200 Conn. 145, 148, 509 A.2d 1056 (1986); see <em>Crochiere </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>227 Conn. 333, 354, 630 A.2d 1027 (1993). \u201cIt is a familiar rule of statutory and constitutional construction that such usage, while not absolutely binding upon the courts, is entitled to great weight. <em>Water Commissioners </em>v. <em>Curtis, 87 </em>Conn. 506, 511, 89 Atl. 189 [1913] .... Where the law has contemporaneously been put into operation, and in doing so a construction has necessarily been put upon it, this construction, especially if followed for some considerable period, is entitled to great respect, as being very probably a true expression of the legislative purpose, and is not lightly to be overruled, although it is not conclusive. 2 Cooley, Taxation (4th Ed.) pp. 1111, 1112, \u00a7 502.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Savings Bank of Rockville </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>117 Conn. 188, 194-95, 167 A. 709 (1933). In this case, it is particularly appropriate to give deference to Arcudi\u2019s interpretation that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, has retroactive application for those injured before October 1, 1991, because during the four year period that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, was applied, the commission, payors and beneficiaries did not challenge that determination. Id., 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Further, the legislature revisited COLAs on two separate occasions before the date of the review board decision in this case, and took no action to reverse the retroactive interpretation that the Arcudi memorandum placed on P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27. In 1992, the legislature amended the COLA provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 (a) (2) in order to substitute the percentage method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>for the flat grant method, which was similarly adopted in P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, for compensation to dependents of deceased workers. See Public Acts 1992, No. 92-31, \u00a7 4. Subsequently, in 1993, the legislature revisited COLAs and eliminated them for injuries sustained on or after July 1, 1993. See Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">We have stated that there \u201cis the inference of legislative concurrence with the agency\u2019s interpretation to be drawn from legislative silence concerning that interpretation, especially where the legislature makes unrelated amendments in the same statute.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>176 Conn. 191, 198, 405 A.2d 638 (1978). Indeed, it is clear from its action that the legislature was greatly concerned about the status of workers\u2019 compensation and the escalating costs on business and industry during the intervening period. Because the Arcudi memorandum \u201caffects so many of the state\u2019s citizens, and because of the interest evidenced by the . . . General Assembly . . . we may not assume that the members of the General Assembly . . . were unaware of, or ignored\u201d the Arcudi method. Id., 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">\u201cWe, therefore, construe the legislative silence as legislative concurrence in that interpretation. That legislative concurrence is \u2018presumptive evidence\u2019 of the correctness of the administrative interpretation. 2A Sutherland, [Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1973) \u00a7 49.10], pp. 261-62. This \u2018presumptive evidence\u2019 of correctness we add to the persuasive effect normally given to an administrative interpretation. Coupled, these two considerations outweigh any arguments that might be advanced for a contrary interpretation.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 199. Here, where the legislature twice revisited \u00a7 31-307a (a) and failed to take any action to reverse Arcudi\u2019s interpretation, the legislature is presumed to have acquiesced in its retroactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>application. Accordingly, on the basis of the above reasoning, I concur with the majority that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, has retroactive application to those injured before October 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The same rules of statutory construction used to arrive at the conclusion that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, applies retroactively to persons who were injured prior to October 1,1991, must be applied to determine the legislative intent with respect to the method to be used in order to calculate COLAs for those beneficiaries. The legislative silence with respect to the Arcudi method, which creates presumptive evidence of its correctness, coupled \u25a0with the four years of consistent administrative interpretation, leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the legislature intended that COLAs be calculated for those beneficiaries in accordance with the Arcudi method. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control </em>Authority, supra, 176 Conn. 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The majority rejects the Arcudi method, however, because (1) there was a slight variation in calculating the COLAs under this method, and (2) the review board had issued an inconsistent interpretation. First, the fund itself, which advocates for the Arcudi method in this appeal, points out that the two interpretations in calculating the Arcudi method resulted in an insignificant variation in the amount of benefits. See footnote 6. Furthermore, it can be presumed that the legislature concurred in the Arcudi method, despite this interpretational variation, because the two times that the legislature revisited COLAs, first in 1992 and then in 1993, it neglected to tinker with the Arcudi method.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Second, subject to this insignificant variation, the industry calculated COLAs from October 1,1991, to the date of the decision in this case in accordance with the Arcudi method. It is correct, as the majority points out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>that on June 5, 1995, the review board decided <em>Wolfe, </em>changing the COLA calculation. That decision, however, was short-lived. Frankl, the author of <em>Wolfe, </em>issued a memorandum dated February 9, 1996, to all commissioners and payors that COLAs calculated prior to October 1, 1991, were to be based on the Arcudi method. Therefore, the majority\u2019s reliance on the aberrant <em>Wolfe </em>decision cannot be justified to overcome four years of adherence to the Arcudi method.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Furthermore, in adopting the method of calculation urged upon us only by the CBIA and the ALA, the majority fails to acknowledge our long-standing rule that the act should be liberally interpreted. \u201c[W]e are mindful of the principles underlying Connecticut practice in workmen\u2019s compensation cases: that the legislation is remedial in nature . . . and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). \u201cBecause the [act] is a remedial statute, this court should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u201d <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">In my view, there is no basis for the CBIA/AIA method of calculating the COLAs for those who were injured before October 1, 1991, thus the calculation that would provide the plaintiff with weekly compensation of $247.79 should be rejected. Rather, the plaintiff\u2019s COLAs should be calculated based on the Arcudi method, a method followed by all payors for a period of over four years, which would provide weekly compensation to the plaintiff in the amount of $277.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Accordingly, I concur that P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27, applies retroactively to those who were injured prior to October 1, 1991, but disagree as to the method of calculating the COLAs for those beneficiaries.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-11\"> The Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association was also granted permission to appear as amicus curiae and filed a brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\"> See footnote 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> The annual increases in maximum compensation were: 1984 \u2014 $36; 1985 \u2014 $16; 1986 \u2014 $11; 1987 \u2014 $21; 1988 \u2014 $18; 1989 \u2014 $15; 1990 \u2014 $17; 1991 \u2014 $12; 1992 \u2014 $22; 1993 \u2014 $16; 1994 \u2014 $38; and 1995 $17, totaling $239.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b724-7\"> See footnote 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b724-8\"> Arcudi, however, did not take into account Public Acts 1991, No. 91-32, \u00a7 1, adopted earlier in the legislative session, which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-275, and defined \u201ccompensation\u201d under the act to include \u201cany actfustment in benefits or payments required by this\u201d act.

The fund now argues that the Arcudi method correctly implements P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 27. Indeed, the attorney general in his brief states that the Arcudi method \u201cappropriately follows the Compensation Commission\u2019s long-standing interpretation of \u00a7 31-307a, and results in the greatest fairness to the maximum number of claimants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b727-6\"> \u201cIn construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. . . .

This format complies with the requirements of [General Statutes] \u00a7 2-18 that an act altering a statutory subsection set out that subsection in its entirety, with changes clearly marked.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Public Act 91-339, \u00a7 27, provides: \u201cSubsection (a) of section 31-307a of the general statutes, as amended by section 24 of public act 91-32, is repealed and the following is substituted in lieu thereof:</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">\u201c(a) The weekly compensation rate of each employee entitled to receive compensation under section 31-307 as amended by section 23 of [this act] PUBLIC ACT 91-32 AND SECTION 26 OF THIS ACT, as a result of an injury sustained on or after October 1, 1969, which totally disables the employee continuously or intermittently for any period extending to the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>October first or thereafter, shall be adjusted annually as provided in this subsection as of the following October first, and each subsequent October first, to provide the injured employee with a cost-of-living adjustment in his weekly compensation rate as determined as of the date of the injury under section 31-309, AS AMENDED BY SECTION 29 OF THIS ACT. If the maximum weekly compensation rate as determined under the provisions of section 31-309, AS AMENDED BY SECTION 29 OF THIS ACT, to be effective as of any October first following the date of the injury, is greater than the maximum weekly compensation rate prevailing as of the date of the injury, the weekly compensation rate which the injured employee was entitled to receive at the date of the injury shall be increased by the [dollar amount] PERCENTAGE of the increase in the maximum weekly compensation rate required by the provisions of section 31-309, AS AMENDED BY SECTION 29 OF THIS ACT, from the date of the injury to such October first. The cost-of-living increases provided under this subsection shall be paid by the employer without any order or award from the commissioner. The adjustments shall apply to each payment made in the next succeeding twelvemonth period commencing with the October first next succeeding the date of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">It is simply wrong to conclude that, because the starting date for COLAs was in the statute when it was originally enacted, the legislature intended the amendment to apply to iryuries that occurred back to October 1, 1969. This \u201creasoning\u201d would then lead to the conclusion that the legislature intended all COLAs, dating back to October 1, 1969, to be calculated on a percentage basis. This result, however, is what the legislature specifically disavowed in enacting P.A. 91-339, \u00a7 50. Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (u) provides: \u201cThe passage or repeal of an act shall not affect any action then pending.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> \u201c[W]e are mindful of the principles underlying Connecticut practice in workmen\u2019s compensation cases: that the legislation is remedial in nature . . . and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>General Dynamics Corp., </em>222 Conn. 62, 67, 607 A.2d 431 (1992). \u201cBecause the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is a remedial statute, this court, should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u201d <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d 690 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
