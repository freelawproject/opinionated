We conclude that although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00a7 46b-59 lacks specific language imposing any threshold requirement, established rules of statutory construction, the context of the statute and its legislative history support the incorporation of a requirement that plaintiffs must demonstrate disruption of the family sufficient to justify state intervention. In the absence of any attempt by the plaintiffs here to satisfy this threshold requirement, we conclude that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue of visitation and, therefore, properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The undisputed facts are as follows. Pursuant to \u00a7 46b-59, the plaintiffs, Jean and Julius Castagno, parents of the defendant Tina Wholean, brought this action against Wholean and her husband, the defendant William J. Wholean, seeking grandparent visitation with the defendants\u2019 minor children. The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that because both parents were still alive, and were not currently involved in any court proceedings that might affect the custody of the children, nor in a state of de facto separation, \u00a7 46b-59 did not confer any right to visitation upon the plaintiff grandparents. The trial court determined that unless the family unit had been disrupted by death or de facto separation, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-59 and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 action. The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>ant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court misconstrued \u00a7 46b-59 to contain threshold requirements not expressed in the plain language of the statute. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the application of \u00a7 46b-59 is not limited by any threshold requirements, and that the sole criterion for application of the statute is the best interest of the child. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that <em>any </em>third party who seeks state intervention, in the form of a court\u2019s grant of visitation rights, may petition the court at <em>any </em>time, and need not present any allegations that the minor child\u2019s family is no longer intact. The plaintiffs further maintain that, because the language of \u00a7 46b-59 is clear and unambiguous, it was inappropriate for the trial court to rely on the legislative history of the statute to establish any threshold requirements. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">When we set out to interpret the meaning of a statute, \u201cour fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. <em>M. DeMatteo Construction Co. </em>v. <em>New London, </em>236 Conn. 710, 714-15, 674 A.2d 845 (1996); <em>see Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 120, 676 A.2d 825 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22-23, 670 A.2d 851 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>234 Conn. 78, 86-87, 662 A.2d 80, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1009, 116 S. Ct. 565, 133 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 663, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996). Although we first look to the language of the statute, if the application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>statute to a particular situation reveals a latent ambiguity or inconsistency, we will go beyond the text to determine the statute\u2019s meaning. Id., 665. Moreover, we will not limit ourselves to a literal application of the statute if to do so would render other legislation meaningless or superfluous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>237 Conn. 613, 621, 678 A.2d 473 (1996). In addition, if a literal reading would place the statute in constitutional jeopardy, this court will go beyond the face of the statute to determine whether it may be construed so as to \u201cachieve its purpose in a manner which is both effective and constitutional.\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Reading the statute literally, as the plaintiffs would have us do, \u00a7 46b-59 allows any person, under any circumstances, to petition the court for visitation rights, no matter how remote his or her connection to the child. It is only <em>after </em>the matter is brought before the court that he or she would have to show that such visitation would be in the best interest of the child. Such a construction would be a radical departure from the common law and from the deeply ingrained tradition of family autonomy in such matters, would raise serious concerns about the effect of the statute on intact families and the constitutionally protected privacy interests of those families, and would ignore companion statutes that would be made superfluous by its application. We therefore construe the statute to avoid such an unreasonable interpretation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 27; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 437, 668 A.2d 348 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We begin with the common law background against which the visitation statutes were enacted. At common law, grandparents, or third parties in general, have no right to visitation. Rather, the decision as to who may or may not have access to a minor child has been deemed an issue of parental prerogative. M. Quintal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cCourt-Ordered Families: An Overview of Grandparent Visitation Statutes,\u201d 29 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 835 (1995); see also C. Bostock, \u201cDoes the Expansion of Grandparent Visitation Rights Promote the Best Interests of the Child?: A Survey of Grandparent Visitation Laws in the Fifty States,\u201d 27 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 319, 326 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The common law reflects the belief that the family unit should be respected, and its autonomy and privacy invaded through court action only in the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>pressing circumstances. \u201cThat right [of the parents to determine the care, custody, and control of their children] is recognized because it reflects a strong tradition founded on the history and culture of Western civilization, and because the parental role is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 503 n.12, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All families may have, at one time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>or another, unhappy conflicts and disputes among adult relatives that might result in an absence of contact between those adults and their minor relatives \u2014 be they grandchildren, nieces or nephews, cousins, etc. \u2014 but longstanding tradition holds that, absent compelling circumstances justifying some state intervention in the form of a judicial order, the parents\u2019 decision, whether wise or not, prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The plaintiffs concede that the common law of Connecticut does not provide for grandparent visitation. The plaintiffs also acknowledge the common-law right in Connecticut of parents to raise their children without excessive government interference. \u201cThis right to family integrity includes \u2018the most essential and basic aspect of familial privacy \u2014 the right of the family to remain together without the coercive interference of the awesome power of the state.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 284, 455 A.2d 1313 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>(1983). \u201cIt is an established rule of statutory construction that statutes are not readily interpreted as abrogating common-law rights.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>199 Conn. 537, 548, 508 A.2d 728 (1986). The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 46b-59 would abrogate that right entirely. Given the tradition of parental authority over family matters and the common-law background that it expresses, we are hesitant to read statutory language literally so as to abrogate it entirely, without convincing evidence that the language was intended to do so. There is no such evidence here. Indeed, what evidence there is before us is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The right to family autonomy and privacy acknowledged in the common law has been recognized as so fundamental as to merit constitutional protection. Consequently, any legislation affecting it is strictly scrutinized. See <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 220-21, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (1925); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399-400, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 2d 1042 (1923); <em>McGaffin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>193 Conn. 393, 400, 479 A.2d 176 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1747, 84 L. Ed. 2d 813 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We ordinarily read statutes \u201cto avoid, rather than to create, constitutional questions.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 534, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). Moreover, courts \u201care bound to assume that the legislature intended, in enacting a particular law, to achieve its purpose in a manner which is both effective and constitutional.\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 185 Conn. 128. \u201c[T]his presumption of constitutionality imposes upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the trial court, as well as this court, the duty to construe statutes, whenever possible, in a manner that comports with constitutional safeguards of liberty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 88, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 construction of \u00a7 46b-59 would allow the court to intrude upon an intact family that has not already opened itself to such intrusion through the type of disruption contemplated by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 46b-57.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The literal application of the statute in this case could place the statute in constitutional jeopardy. Any potential constitutional infirmity is avoidable if we construe \u00a7 46b-59 to incorporate threshold requirements similar to those of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>This construction would allow \u00a7 46b-59 to be invoked only in those instances in which the integrity of the family already has been disrupted. Because \u00a7 46b-59 operates in the delicate realm of parent-child relationships, we prefer a construction that minimizes state intrusion. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>supra, 223 Conn. 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In addition to the common-law and constitutional considerations that undermine a literal interpretation of \u00a7 46b-59, that section\u2019s contextual interplay further compels us to incorporate a threshold requirement. \u201c \u2018It is a basic tenet of statutory construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Szymkiewicz, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 621. \u201c[I]n construing statutes, we presume that there is a purpose behind every sentence, clause, or phrase used in an act and that no part of a statute is superfluous.\u201d <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 58, 480 A.2d 425 (1984). These same principles lead us to believe that the legislature does not ordinarily intend to leave in effect statutes that have been rendered superfluous by later enactments. This is, however, precisely the conclusion the plaintiffs ask us to reach in regard to the companion visitation statutes to \u00a7 46b-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 46b-59, visitation rights were addressed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7\u00a7 46-42 and 46-47, now \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 46b-57.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These sections remained in effect subsequent to the passage of \u00a7 46b-59. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57, when the issue of the custody or care of a minor child is before the court, a third party may be granted visitation rights. These sections apply only to situations in which a controversy is already pending before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Although \u00a7 \u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57 establish the threshold requirement of a pending controversy that must be satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>fied before a third party may intervene to achieve the care, custody or visitation of minor children, the plaintiffs would have this court hold that \u00a7 46b-59 contains no such threshold requirement. If that were true, however, we would be hard-pressed to understand why any party would seek visitation under \u00a7 46b-56 or \u00a7 46b-57, given their higher standard, or to see why the legislature would not have repealed that aspect of those statutes upon the passage of \u00a7 46b-59. We must \u201cassume that the legislature acted with knowledge of existing statutes and with an intent to create one consistent body of laws.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>First Federal Bank, FSB </em>v. <em>Whitney Development Corp., </em>237 Conn. 679, 691-92, 677 A.2d 1363 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Our examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 46b-59 further challenges the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation. In 1978, the Connecticut legislature passed No. 78-69 of the 1978 Public Acts, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning Visitation Rights of Grandparents in Case of Death or Separation.\u201d That public act was codified as \u00a7 46b-59, one of a series of statutes related to the dissolution of marriage, legal separation and annulment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When it was initially introduced in the legislature, the bill\u2019s first paragraph contained language referring to situations in which the family was no longer intact, either through death or de facto separation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That language was removed, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ever, in the process of amendment, prior to the bill\u2019s passage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is no indication in the legislative history to explain why the language referring to death or de facto separation was deleted from the final version of the bill. In fact, Senator Lewis B. Rome, the proponent of Senate Amendment B, the amendment that deleted the language, stated that the only purpose of the amendment was to clarify the fact that the bill applied to both legitimate and illegitimate minor children. 21 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1978 Sess., p. 763. Moreover, when the Senate amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives for adoption, it was done so with the limiting language intact: \u201cSenate Amendment Schedule \u2018B\u2019 just indicates that the Superior Court may grant rights of visitation to grandparents in the case of a separation of a husband and wife or in the case when a husband or wife has died leaving a minor child whether or not such child or children are legitimate, and that\u2019s the substantive difference between the amendment and the file copy.\u201d 21 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1978 Sess., p. 1992, remarks of Representative Ernest N. Abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Thus, although the express language concerning death and de facto separation had been removed by the time the bill was signed into law, it is clear from the floor discussions in both the House of Representatives and the Senate that the legislators had been focusing on providing a remedy for those grandparents who sought visitation under circumstances analogous to those already addressed by \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57, but in which the jurisdiction of the trial court had not already been invoked. \u201c[T]he existing law is . . . that the grandparents can intervene in a divorce action or an annulment or legal separation and move to have visitation rights with the children . . . .\u201d 21 S. Proc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Pt. 2, 1978 Sess., pp. 765-66, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano. \u201cWhat this bill attempts to do is simply to extend it to the situation . . . where the parties just split up and they begin no divorce action and they begin no action for legal separation.\u201d Id., pp. 768-69, remarks of Senator George C. Guidera. \u201cThis General Assembly last year- enacted the bill that permitted grandparents to have visitation rights in the event of divorce. It did not, however, deal with the case . . . where there was no divorce but one parent died.\u201d Id., p. 771, remarks of Senator Barbara D. Reimers.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Any voiced opposition to the bill was confined solely to the effect <em>any </em>court battle over visitation might have on a young child and cautioning against expanding the circumstances in which a grandparent might seek visitation. As one opponent stated: \u201c[This bill] expands the possibilities of a contentious kind of litigation where ultimately the children are the victims, and there ought to be the ability on the part of the parents to run their own households. This kind of thing, which opens up to judicial second guess a decision which should properly be left in the home, is certainly going to create more opportunity than now exists for the kind of seesaw battle which so very often involves children in other kinds of domestic cases.\u201d Id., pp. 764-65, remarks of Senator Joseph P. Flynn. Although Senator Flynn\u2019s remarks could be read to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the statute was understood to be broader than the interpretation we are here adopting, we cannot read the senator\u2019s words so as to override all the other commentary in favor of our more limited reading, particularly when there is no convincing evidence to support the plaintiffs\u2019 literal interpretation and to do so would undermine the aforementioned common-law and constitutional considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">At no time did any member of the Senate or House of Representatives suggest that the bill would or should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>allow grandparents to seek visitation with minor grandchildren no matter what the circumstances. Rather, the legislative history indicates solely the desire on the part of the General Assembly to address a specific problem \u2014 how to provide access to the courts for grandparents whose grandchildren\u2019s families have been disrupted in a manner similar to that addressed by \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57, but in which the courts have not yet become involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Since its initial enactment, \u00a7 46b-59 has been twice amended: first in 1979, to clarify that visitation was not to be made contingent upon any payment of support,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and again in 1983, to extend standing to petition to any person.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The discussion in the legislature as to these amendments, although minimal, nonetheless indicates a legislative understanding that the threshold require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ment of death or de facto separation was part of the legislation. One supporter of No. 79-8 of the 1979 Public Acts, which established that visitation could not be tied to support payments, voiced his understanding of that intent, stating: \u201cThis honorable body, I believe, last year passed a bill granting grandparents the opportunity to have reasonable visitation of their grandchildren in a situation where the . . . husband and wife are either divorced or if the family is broken up.\u201d 22 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1979 Sess., p. 447, remarks of Senator Salvatore C. DePiano.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The most recent amendment, No. 83-95 of the 1983 Public Acts, which extended standing to any third person, was passed with very little comment in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, but appears to have been in response to perceived concerns that persons other than grandparents should be allowed to seek visitation. The plaintiffs correctly point out that \u00a7 46b-59, as so amended, has been cited by this court as providing standing to third parties who seek visitation rights. In all of those cases, however, there had already been some intrusion by the court or the state into the privacy of the child\u2019s family. See generally <em>Michaud </em>v. <em>Warwick, </em>209 Conn. 407, 551 A.2d 738 (1988) (biological mother permitted visitation with child following child\u2019s adoption); <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>208 Conn. 404, 544 A.2d 629 (1988) (former boyfriend who originally brought action seeking custody of former girlfriend\u2019s child, mistakenly believed to be his, permitted to amend his claim to one seeking visitation); see also <em>In re Jennifer P., </em>17 Conn. App. 427, 553 A.2d 196, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 801, 559 A.2d 1136 (1989) (former foster parent permitted to seek visitation).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We see nothing in the legislative history to suggest that the subsequent amendments were enacted in an effort to depart from the initial legislative intent to confine the application of \u00a7 46b-59 to situations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>which the family already has been somehow disrupted, warranting the state\u2019s intrusion upon the integrity of the family unit, thus confirming our conclusion that \u00a7 46b-59 by implication contains such a threshold requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Our application of the rules of statutory construction and our examination of the legislative record lead us to conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 46b-59 to afford the trial court jurisdiction to entertain a petition for visitation only when the minor child\u2019s family life has been disrupted in a manner analogous to the situations addressed by \u00a7 \u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-57. At this time we need not state precisely which circumstances will suffice to invoke the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-59. Although the death of a parent or the de facto separation of the parents may allow an action, there may be other times when an action is also warranted, such as when there has been a good faith allegation by a third party of abuse or neglect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A party seeking visitation rights must, however, in the pleadings, set forth with specific<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ity the factual bases for the petition before the court can determine whether such threshold conditions have been met. In this case, the plaintiffs did not rely on any such allegations to invoke the trial court\u2019s authority.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN, NORCOTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59 provides: \u201cThe superior court may grant the right of visitation with respect to any minor child or children to any person, upon an application of such person. Such order shall be according to the court\u2019s best judgment upon the facts of the case and subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable, provided the grant of such visitation rights shall not be contingent upon any order of financial support by the court. In making, modifying or terminating such an order, the court shall be guided by the best interest of the child, giving consideration to the wishes of such child if he is of sufficient age and capable of forming an intelligent opinion. Visitation rights granted in accordance with this section shall not be deemed to have created parental rights in the person or persons to whom such visitation rights are granted.

See <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 229-34, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1972); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L.

As such, it is facially and hopelessly unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">When originally introduced in 1978 as Substitute Senate Bill No. 48, \u00a7 46b-59 provided in part: \u201cWhenever any husband and wife, who have any minor child or children, are living apart, or whenever a person has died leaving a minor child or children surviving, the superior court, upon motion of any grandparent of such minor child or children, may order the right of visitation of such child or children to such grandparent. . . .\u201d The language of the bill limiting visitation rights to grandparents where the family was no longer intact was removed, however, prior to the bill\u2019s passage. The legislature further broadened \u00a7 46b-59 in 1983 when it extended visitation rights from grandparents to \u201cany person.\u201d Public Acts 1983, No. 83-95. These changes leave \u00a7 46b-59 in striking contrast to the laws of our sister states that require exceptional circumstances before the state may intrude upon parental rights and grant visitation rights to grandparents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The plain language of \u00a7 46b-59 now creates the broadest possible right of visitation. It provides that any person may petition, even absent exceptional circumstances, for visitation rights no matter how remote the connection to the child and may do so repeatedly. In order to save the statute, the majority here adds the salutary requirement that \u201cany person\u201d must make a threshold showing of exceptional circumstances. The addition of the threshold requirement is not legislative interpretation but direct legislation, engrafting to the legislative text language simply not found or suggested by the plain words of \u00a7 46b-59. In effect, the majority inserts into the statute some of the very same language removed from the bill as it went through the legislature. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>See <em>Local 218 Steamfitters Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988); <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 503-504, 542 A.2d 700 (1988); <em>Schurman </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>188 Conn. 268, 273, 449 A.2d 169 (1982); <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 251, 363 A.2d 121 (1975); see also <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 790, 629 A.2d 357 (1993) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>with whom <em>Katz, J., </em>joins, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The majority has struggled rightly to consider the sympathetic circumstance of a grandparent\u2019s desire to visit a grandchild in the face of a family disruption. The majority, however, is unable to narrow the statute\u2019s application in the case of rebellious teenage romances, meddling distant relatives and in-laws, total strangers and overly controlling friends and neighbors. It would also allow repeated and expensive court battles that may wear down the parent, totally disrupt the family discipline and put a judge continuously and unconstitutionally into the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Section 46b-59, admitted by all parties to be as broad an invasion of the family autonomy and privacy as could be drawn, is, in my opinion, beyond saving. It provides a vehicle for too much mischief and meddling in a family\u2019s constitutionally protected private business. The trial court struggled with the plain words of \u00a7 46b-59 and this court has now taken on the task, better left to the legislature, of solving the problem created by those plain words. We dodged the bullet in <em>Lehrer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>214 Conn. 232, 238, 571 A.2d 691 (1990), by holding that the constitutionality of \u00a7 46b-59 could not be decided in a factual vacuum. The time has now come, however, to consign this unconstitutional, intrusive and vexatious legislation to its deserved fate. See, e.g., <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Yoder, </em>supra, 406 U.S. 205; <em>Meyer v.
