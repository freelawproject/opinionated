The trial court concluded that the waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity contained in General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>parties contracting directly with the state was intended also to waive the state\u2019s sovereign immunity to allow third party actions by a general contractor, premised upon the <em>conditional </em>liability of the general contractor to a subcontractor. We disagree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. On November 30, 1983, Peabody entered into a contract with the state for the reconstruction of Route 8 and the Commodore Hull Bridge between Shelton and Derby. Peabody thereafter entered into a subcontract with Standard Structural Steel, Inc. (Standard), for the supply and erection of structural steel on the project. During the course of the project, Standard allegedly incurred extra costs for labor, equipment and materials, as well as increased overhead and other assorted costs resulting from delays, work stoppages, and errors and revisions in the plans and specifications for the project. Peabody asserts that the state, not Peabody, was responsible for the delays and errors that caused Standard\u2019s unanticipated expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In May, 1993, the plaintiff, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as the receiver of the New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company and the successor in interest to Standard, brought the underlying action against Peabody, seeking approximately $14.8 million in damages allegedly suffered by Standard. Thereafter, Peabody answered the plaintiffs complaint and moved to implead the state. The trial court, <em>L. Sullivan, J., </em>granted Peabody\u2019s impleader motion, and Peabody served its third party complaint upon the state. The state moved to dismiss the third party complaint and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Peabody moved to amend that complaint. The trial court, <em>Corradino, J., </em>granted the motion to amend and denied the motion to dismiss. The state appealed from the judgment of the trial court to this court upon the granting of certification by the Chief Justice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The resolution of this appeal turns upon the sufficiency of Peabody\u2019s pleadings to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In denying the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court took cognizance of both Peabody\u2019s initial third party complaint and its amended third party complaint. As a preliminary matter, we must first decide which of Peabody\u2019s two third party complaints should be considered in deciding the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">In Peabody\u2019s answer to the plaintiffs complaint and in its initial third party complaint, Peabody denied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>liability to Standard for Standard\u2019s damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Peabody alleged, however, that <em>if </em>it were hable to Standard, it should be indemnified by the state. In its amended third party complaint, Peabody admitted its liability to Standard <em>to the extent that Peabody recovered damages from the state </em>based upon Standard\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This \u201cadmission\u201d is, of course, actually not an admission at all, but only a statement of the obvious. Furthermore, it is merely a restatement of Peabody\u2019s allegations in its original third party complaint to the effect that Peabody would be liable to Standard in the event that Peabody was successful in its third party action against the state based upon damages incurred by Standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Regardless, however, of the substantive similarity between Peabody\u2019s two third party complaints, it was nonetheless inappropriate for the trial court to consider Peabody\u2019s amended third party complaint, rather than its initial complaint, when acting on the state\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \u201cAs we have stated many times before, the doctrine of sovereign immunity implicates subject matter jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Amore </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>228 Conn. 358, 364, 636 A.2d 786 (1994); <em>Lussier </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>228 Conn. 343, 349-50, 636 A.2d 808 (1994); <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). \u201cItis axiomatic that once the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is raised, it must be immediately acted upon by the court. \u201d <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 545, 590 A.2d 914 (1991); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>211 Conn. 232, 245, 558 A.2d 986 (1989); <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985). \u201cWhenever the absence of jurisdiction is brought to the notice of the court or tribunal, cognizance of it must be taken and the matter passed upon before it can move one further step in the cause; as any movement is necessarily the exercise of jurisdiction. . . . The point has been frequently made.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co. </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>186 Conn. 295, 297-98, 441 A.2d 183 (1982); see also <em>Kohn Display &amp; Woodworking Co. </em>v. <em>Paragon Paint &amp; Varnish Corp., </em>166 Conn. 446, 448, 352 A.2d 301 (1974); <em>Woodmont Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>85 Conn. 517, 524, 84 A. 307 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Consequently, when the state moved to dismiss Peabody\u2019s initial third party complaint because of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the trial court was obligated to construe that complaint in the manner most favorable to Peabody and to rule upon the state\u2019s motion before considering Peabody\u2019s motion to amend. <em>Gurli</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>acci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 545 (\u201cthe trial court should not have allowed the amendment [to the complaint] before ruling on the motion to dismiss [for lack of subject matter jurisdiction]\u201d); see <em>Antinerella </em>v. <em>Rioux, </em>229 Conn. 479, 489, 642 A.2d 699 (1994); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 68, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981). If the state\u2019s motion had been granted, as we are persuaded it should have been, the trial court would have been without jurisdiction to allow Peabody to amend its pleadings. <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>supra, 545; <em>Woodmont Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>supra, 85 Conn. 524. We must, therefore, focus on Peabody\u2019s initial third party complaint to determine whether that complaint fits within the parameters of the limited waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 4-61 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The state claims that the allegations of Peabody\u2019s third party complaint are, on their face, insufficient to allege a waiver of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity because they fail to allege that Peabody itself has a disputed claim under its contract with the state as required by \u00a7 4-61 (a). The state argues that Peabody was required to admit liability to Standard before proceeding with an action against the state. The state claims that in the absence of such an admission, Peabody would not have a \u201cdisputed [claim] under [its] contract\u201d with the state within the meaning of \u00a7 4-61 (a) because it would have no obligation to pay Standard. The state contends that because Peabody did not admit liability to Standard, Peabody\u2019s third party complaint lacked an essential jurisdictional element, and the trial court was required to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Peabody contends, to the contrary, that it has adequately pleaded the existence of a disputed claim under its contract with the state so as to bring it within the purview of the statutory waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of sovereign immunity provided by \u00a7 4-61 (a). We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Section 4-61 (a) waives sovereign immunity for any \u201cperson, firm or corporation which has entered into a contract with the state ... for the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state . . . .\u201d Such an entity \u201cmay, in the event of any disputed claims under such contract . . . bring an action against the state ... for the purpose of having such claims determined.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-61 (a). The issue presented by this appeal is whether a general contractor has a \u201cdisputed [claim] under [its] contract\u201d with the state, within the meaning of \u00a7 4-61 (a), if the general contractor\u2019s claim against the state takes the form of a claim for indemnification that is based upon the pending claim of a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Our analysis of this issue is \u201cguided by settled principles of statutory construction that assist us in ascertaining the intent of the legislature. . . . The legislative intent is to be discerned by reference to the language of the statute, its legislative history and surrounding circumstances, the policy the [statute] was designed to implement, and the statute\u2019s relationship to the existing legislation and common law principles governing the same subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 152, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Our analysis is more specifically illuminated by the well settled principle that \u201cthe sovereign is immune from suit unless the state, by appropriate legislation, consents to be sued. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>176 Conn. 362, 364, 407 A.2d 987 (1978); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>162 Conn. 295, 298, 294 A.2d 290 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>50 Conn. 89, 90-91, 47 A. 622 (1882). When the state waives that immunity by statute ... a party attempting to sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>under the legislative exception must come clearly within its provisions, because [statutes in derogation of sovereignty should be strictly construed in favor of the state, so that its sovereignty may be upheld and not narrowed or destroyed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berger, Lehman Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>State, </em>178 Conn. 352, 356, 422 A.2d 268 (1979). \u201cWhere there is any doubt about [the] meaning or intent [of a statute in derogation of sovereign immunity, it is] given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners </em>v. <em>CFC Constmction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). Section 4-61 (a) expressly states that it shall apply only to \u201cdisputed claims\u201d arising under certain types of construction contracts between the state and a party with whom the state has contracted. In this case, only Peabody, the general contractor, has a contract with the state. Standard had no contract with the state and, therefore, could not sue the state directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Recognizing the state\u2019s undisputed sovereign immunity as to the subcontractor under \u00a7 4-61 (a), the plaintiff, the subcontractor\u2019s successor in interest, brought suit against the general contractor, with whom it does have a contract. The only existing \u201cdisputed claim\u201d at this point, therefore, is between the general contractor and the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In \u00a7 4-61 (a), the legislature did not, as it has done in the context of private sector claims, allow suits invoking the contingent liability of parties who \u201cmay be hable\u201d at some point in the future. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-102a (defendant in civil suit may move court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>permission to file third party complaint upon any person not party to action \u201cwho is or <em>may be </em>liable to him for all or part of the plaintiffs claim against him\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, under the plain language of \u00a7 4-61 (a), and applying the strict construction that we must apply to statutory language in derogation of sovereign immunity; see <em>Struckman </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>205 Conn. 542, 558, 534 A.2d 888 (1987) (clear intent to waive sovereign immunity must be disclosed \u201c \u2018by the use of express terms or by force of a necessary implication\u2019 \u201d); we are persuaded that a general contractor who has entered into a contract with the state cannot bring a third party action against the state based on the mere prospect that the contractor <em>may be </em>liable to a subcontractor at some point in the future. That scenario does not constitute a disputed claim by the contractor against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Our conclusion finds support in the legislative history of \u00a7 4-61. That history reflects the narrow and limited purpose for the exception to sovereign immunity contained in \u00a7 4-61 (a), and indicates that impleaders like that in the present appeal were not contemplated. At the time \u00a7 4-61 (a) was enacted, suits against the state by contractors were not countenanced because of sovereign immunity. Individualized legislative authorization to sue was required to be sought by petition before an action could be brought against the state. The legislature enacted \u00a7 4-61 in 1957 because of the mounting prevalence of these petitions for permission to sue the state. 7 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1957 Sess., p. 1636. \u201cThe legislature wanted to reduce the number of petitions for permission to sue the state that it received involving suits over state construction contracts. 7 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1957 Sess., p. 1937.\u201d <em>DeFonce Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 189, 501 A.2d 745 (1985). Another reason for allowing parties who had contracted with the state to sue the state directly without seeking legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>authorization was the hope that affording contractors the right to sue would reduce the costs of construction projects to the state by ehminating the cost of the lengthy legislative authorization process that was often built into state construction contracts. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 2, 1957 Sess., p. 436, remarks of Representative Merrill S. Dreyfus. Nothing, however, in the 1957 legislative history of \u00a7 4-61 or in the legislative history of the subsequent revisions to that statute; see 34 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1991 Sess., p. 2165; 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 22, 1991 Sess., pp. 8531-35; hints at the possibility that the legislature intended to allow a general contractor to implead the state in a suit between the contractor and a subcontractor, and thereby to permit the subcontractor to do indirectly what it could not do directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">If general contractors on state construction projects were allowed to deny liability to subcontractors and then simply implead the state each time a subcontractor brought suit against them, the subcontractors effectively would be able to prosecute their claims against the state indirectly through the general contractors, increasing the complexity and volume of litigation against the state. Section 4-61 (a) expressly grants the right to sue the state only to contractors who have \u201centered into a contract with the state\u201d and who have a dispute \u201cunder such contract.\u201d Nowhere in \u00a7 4-61 or elsewhere in the General Statutes is there any provision that grants a subcontractor, who does not have a contract with the state, the right to sue the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u201c[T]he state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed, by the use of express terms . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 312-13. In the absence of an expressed legislative intent to the contrary, it would be incongruous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>for the legislature in enacting \u00a7 4-61 (a) to have limited the right to sue the state to contractors having a direct contract with the state, but to allow subcontractors who have no contract with the state to sue the state indirectly through the procedural vehicle of a third party complaint. We conclude, therefore, that a contractor cannot implead the state in an action against the contractor by a subcontractor unless the contractor admits liability to the subcontractor and incorporates the subcontractor\u2019s claim into its own, so that the contractor then has a disputed claim under its own direct contract with the state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the third party complaint and to render judgment thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In this opinion PETERS, C.

See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 175 and 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Similarly, this court has held that when a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is contingent on the finding of certain facts, the court must conduct an evidentiary hearing before dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Standard Tallow Corp. </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 56, 459 A.2d 503 (1983) (\u201c[w]hen issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court\u2019s jurisdiction, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held\u201d). It should then follow that, if a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is dependent upon a plaintiffs pleadings, and those pleadings are insufficient, a corrective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>amendment to the pleading should be allowed before ruling on the motion to dismiss. Accordingly, I would decide the issue on appeal in light of the amended third party complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the trial court did below.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Nevertheless, the initial third party complaint provides the trial court with jurisdiction. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-61, \u201c[a]ny person, firm or corporation which has entered into a contract with the state . . . for the design, construction, construction management, repair or alteration of any highway, bridge, building or other public works of the state ... in the event of <em>any disputed claims under such contract . . . </em>[may] bring an action against the state to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the relevant allegations in the initial third party complaint against the state are as follows: \u201cTo the extent [the] plaintiff [Standard Structural Steel, Inc. (Standard), a subcontractor<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] incurred the damages and expenses as alleged, such damages and expenses were caused by [the] acts and/ or omissions of the State of Connecticut and not by any acts and/or omissions of [the defendants and third party plaintiffs Peabody International Corporation and Peabody, N.E., Inc. (collectively, Peabody), the general contractor]. ... To the extent that [Peabody is] found responsible to Standard for all or part of the claims set forth in [the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s] Complaint asserting Standard\u2019s claims, [Peabody is] entitled under the law and under the terms and conditions of [its] Contract with the State of Connecticut to recover all such sums from the State of Connecticut Department of Transportation.\u201d In other words, Pea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>body alleges that if it is held liable to Standard, then the state is liable for those damages sustained by Standard pursuant to Peabody\u2019s contract with the state. Albeit contingent, Peabody surely alleges a \u201cdisputed claim\u201d with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The majority narrowly construes the term \u201cdisputed claim,\u201d and adopts a definition that is not in the best interest of the state. Specifically, the majority holds that a \u201cdisputed claim\u201d exists, thereby allowing a general contractor, who has contracted with the state and who is being sued by its subcontractor for damages for which the state would alternatively be responsible, to implead the state as a third party defendant, only if the general contractor admits liability in the action brought by the subcontractor. I disagree. This decision will likely encourage general contractors to increase their rates when contracting with the state, so that they may insure themselves against the burden the court now imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The majority\u2019s holding places a general contractor in an unacceptable \u201ccatch-22\u201d situation. The general-contractor must either defend against the subcontractor with the hope that the statute of limitations provided for in \u00a7 4-61 does not expire before any adverse judgment is rendered against it, or admit liability to the subcontractor in the hope that it will be able to recover against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 153, 460 A.2d 26 (1983) (\u201c \u2018[t]hereisno canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean\u2019 \u201d). This principle is equally applicable to statutes that constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity. In this case, common sense dictates that the legislature did not intend to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>disputes involving contingent liability from the term \u201cdisputed claims\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 4-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-9\"> I recognize that <em>Woodmont Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>85 Conn. 517, 524, 84 A. 307 (1912), decided eighty-four years ago, supports the majority\u2019s holding today. Interestingly, however, in that case, Justice Wheeler in dissent a1 tempted to usher the court into the twentieth century: \u201cA complaint, defective for lack of a jurisdictional fact, and capable of amendment, should not be dismissed, but the defect left to be met by plea or demurrer which admit of amendment. Our statutes of amendment, as construed by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>decisions, invite the amendment of every form of defect which will make apleading good. We make no exception where the defects are jurisdictional.\u201d Id., 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The majority also relies on <em>Gurliacci </em>v. Mayer, 218 Conn. 531, 545, 590 A.2d 914 (1991), for its holding with respect to this issue. The statement cited by the majority, however, is <em>pure dicta </em>because in <em>Gurliacci, </em>the court determined that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction.
