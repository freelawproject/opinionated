We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to determine that the third party declarant was unavailable and, because the trial court did not decide whether her statement was trustworthy, we remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The defendant, Heriberto Lopez, was charged with murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-48,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and having a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Following a jury trial, he was convicted of all three counts, and a total effective sentence of forty-five years imprisonment was imposed. The defendant thereafter appealed to this court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>38 Conn. App. 434, 435, 662 A.2d 792 (1995). The Appellate Court held, inter alia, that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of an out-of-court statement that allegedly was the confession of a third party was not improper. Id., 436-39. The defendant thereafter petitioned this court for certification to appeal, which we granted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court sets forth some of the relevant facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cOn May 8, 1991, at approximately 7:30 p.m., the victim, Elvis Cmkovic, and his brother Paul Cmkovic, were playing basketball at the corner of Winthrop and Davenport Avenues in New Haven. Elvis, who was sixteen years old, and Paul, who was seventeen years old, lived across the street from a vacant building on which a basketball rim was nailed. While they were playing, a brown car drove up with the defendant in the front passenger seat holding a .38 caliber revolver. A second car, a gray Mazda, also approached. The Mazda was driven by Jorge Orta, and David Morales was a passenger. Shots were fired from both cars and Elvis was hit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>in the back as he and his brother attempted to run away. The bullet was a \u2018hollow point\u2019 that entered his lower back and came to rest just beneath the skin of his left collarbone. Elvis was taken to the hospital where he died as a result of his wounds. The defendant was one of the shooters.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Id., 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">One of the state\u2019s key witnesses at trial was Lenise Nestir, who testified on May 13 and 14, 1993.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nestir testified that she had been in the Liberty Street area prior to the shooting, and that she had seen Alex Romero drive up in a brown vehicle. According to Nestir, Romero, who claimed to have had a gun in his possession, asked whether anyone wanted to accompany him to Davenport Avenue. Nestir explained that there was a group of young people in the Liberty Street area that did not get along with another group of young people that congregated in the Davenport Avenue area. Nestir testified that the defendant accompanied Romero and that, although she declined Romero\u2019s invitation to get into the car, she walked to within one block <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of the shooting in order to be a spectator. Although she claimed to have been on friendly terms with the victim\u2019s family, Nestir failed to warn the Cmkovic brothers, who were outside playing basketball, of the impending danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">When Nestir reached the intersection of Winthrop and Davenport Avenues, she saw Romero\u2019s brown car approach, heading eastbound on Davenport Avenue. Because the car passed by so quickly, she could not identify its occupants and could only see shots being fired from within that vehicle. Although the state introduced evidence that there also was a gray car at the scene from which shots had been fired, Nestir testified that she never saw a gray car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She learned later that Elvis had died as a result of that shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Soon after the shooting, Nestir saw Romero driving a vehicle with the defendant and another male named Andrew as the vehicle approached a nearby dumpster, where Nestir witnessed Andrew empty shells from a gun into the dumpster. Later that same day, Romero gave the gun to Nestir to dispose of it. Instead of discarding it, Nestir testified that she kept the gun, hoping to exchange it for a car. Subsequently, the New Haven police, who had been notified of the proposed transaction, seized the gun from her but never charged her with an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The defendant had intended to call Nestir as his first witness at the conclusion of the presentation of the state\u2019s case-in-chief. On Friday, May 14, 1993, Nestir\u2019s second day of testimony as a state\u2019s witness, the defendant subpoenaed Nestir to appear in court on Monday, May 17, 1993. When she failed to appear on May 17, the state represented to the court and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that Nestir\u2019s mother, Sophie Nestir, had contacted the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and had stated that she had not seen her daughter the entire weekend. The defendant subsequently sought, and was granted, a capias.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On May 19, when the state rested its case, the defendant notified the court that the capias had not been served. Rather than calling Nestir to testify, therefore, the defendant began his defense by calling another witness. Toward the end of the day, the defendant notified the court, outside the presence of the jury, that the sheriff had been unable to locate Nestir at her mother\u2019s home \u2014 445 Poplar Street in New Haven \u2014 in order to serve the capias. The defendant then called Robin Shade, a close friend of Nestir, to make an offer of proof, hoping that the court would allow Shade to testify regarding incriminating statements that Nestir had made to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Shade testified that one and one-half days after the shooting, Nestir had told her about Elvis\u2019 killing. Nestir had told Shade that Paul Crnkovic, Elvis\u2019 brother, had hit Nestir in the face. Nestir remarked to Shade that she was going to retaliate by \u201cgetfting] some boys from Liberty Street to beat his butt.\u201d Shade further testified that Nestir told her that on the day of the incident, Nestir and \u201csome boys from Liberty Street\u201d drove down Davenport Avenue and saw Paul and Elvis playing basketball. According to Shade, Nestir had stated that she \u201cgot a car full of guys and she said that one of them had the gun shooting it out the window up to the sky and she grabbed it from the guy and pointed it to Paulie and it didn\u2019t hit Paulie it hit someone else and she said it was his brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">At the time of her testimony, Shade had known Nestir for nine years. Although they were not actually related, Nestir referred to Shade as her aunt. Shade took care of Nestir eight years earlier, one time for nine months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>and another time for eleven months. She stopped taking care of Nestir because Nestir \u201clikefd] to go on the streets constantly.\u201d Shade testified that Nestir had been a poor influence on her daughters and had involved them in some petty criminal behavior. Furthermore, upon questioning Nestir about these episodes, she sometimes caught Nestir telling lies. Even after Nestir no longer lived with Shade, she continued to visit Shade\u2019s home, and came often during 1993. Shade believed that she knew Nestir well and that she knew when Nestir was telling the truth and when she was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">At the conclusion of this offer of proof, which constituted the defendant\u2019s first attempt to get Shade\u2019s testimony into evidence, the state argued, in reliance on recent cases<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from this court outlining the requirements for introducing third party statements against penal interest into evidence, that \u201ceven if the court should find that Miss Nestir is unavailable . . . [t]his kind of statement is clearly completely unreliable . . . [because Shade] couldn\u2019t trust anything that she said . . . .\u201d The defendant argued in response that, based on cases addressing the admission of third party exculpatory evidence; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 548-49, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); he did not need to establish the unavailability of the declarant and therefore had not focused on whether Nestir was unavailable. The court concluded that it would leave the issue of the declarant\u2019s reliability for the jury to decide and focused instead on the unavailability prong of the test, concluding that \u201cin light of her having testified here . . . the court is of the opinion that it cannot make a finding that [Nestir] is unavailable . . . .\u201d Following the court\u2019s ruling, the defendant acknowledged his burden of prov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>ing the declarant\u2019s unavailability and sought additional time \u201cto have the sheriffs once again try to locate and serve the capias and effect a capias upon Miss Nestir and if that\u2019s \u2014 if they are incapable of doing that, then I would put on the showing of unavailability and then offer Miss Shade after that . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The defendant proceeded with additional witnesses and, following the afternoon recess on May 20, advised the court that he had \u201cnot had any luck in getting the capias [executed] nor this court\u2019s order authorizing the arrest of Miss Nestir. I delivered it or the sheriff took possession of it on Monday [May 17] when the order was entered. It was not received by a deputy sheriff for service until Wednesday [May 19]. That sheriff went to 445 Poplar Street, attempted to serve Miss Nestir, she was not there. The deputy sheriff returned here and informed me of that much and left the capias back downstairs at the sheriffs office. I picked it up again at the end of the day yesterday and took it back to my office with me. I called Deputy Sheriff [Harold] Pepper last night. He has not returned my call. I called him two or three times this morning and again at the break advising him to come to the courthouse and pick up this court\u2019s order to arrest Miss Nestir and he has not been here. I can\u2019t get anyone to [execute] the order issued by this court on Monday.\u201d He added that he had taken it downstairs to the sheriffs office but had been told to \u201clook through the Rolodex and find a sheriff who will serve it.\u201d The defendant asked the court to help effectuate the order. Because the sheriffs department was apparently concerned about the possibility of keeping Nestir overnight, the defendant asked the court to order the police department, which could more easily house Nestir and bring her to court the next morning, to serve the capias. The court did not believe that it had the authority to order the police to take Nestir into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The defendant further explained that he had given the capias to the sheriff who \u201cmailed it to someone. That person ended up leaving the capias there overnight. I took it back in my possession. The person who was supposed to be serving it, Deputy Pepper, hasn\u2019t returned six of my phone calls.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When informed by the state that inspectors from the public defender\u2019s office were used to serve capiases, the defendant responded: \u201cI can\u2019t use them because the public defender\u2019s office has a conflict in this case. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in on it. So what I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m begging the court \u2014 this is an order from Your Honor. This is issued from you, judge.\u201d The court expressed frustration, but refused to declare Nestir unavailable. Rather the court suggested that the defendant have the sheriff select another deputy and again try to serve the capias.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The defendant then informed the court that Shade had heard from Nestir and Nestir\u2019s mother following Shade\u2019s testimony and that Nestir had threatened Shade\u2019s life. The defendant sought to present Louis Spina, a private investigator, to testify about a conversation that he had had with Nestir\u2019s mother the previous evening. Although the testimony would have pertained to Nestir\u2019s unavailability, the trial court refused the defendant the opportunity to put Spina on the stand, concluding that \u201c[i]t may be germane at some point. At this point it is not.\u201d Defense counsel, obviously extremely frustrated by the situation, asked to be appointed as an \u201cindifferent person\u201d to effectuate the capias. The court continued to suggest that the defendant do more by way of the sheriffs department to effectuate the order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">On Friday, May 21, the attempts to locate Nestir continued. Defense counsel represented to the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>his law partner had contacted the New Haven police department, where he had delivered the capias for Nestir, but that the police did not yet have her in custody. Accordingly, he requested a continuance to allow the police to arrest Nestir over the weekend. The state reminded the court, however, that that was the day that Nestir was to be in the New London courthouse for sentencing on an unrelated matter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant asked for confirmation of that fact by the prosecutor who the week before had arranged to have the New London case continued to May 21 to allow Nestir to finish her testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. The court denied the request for a continuance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The defendant then recited for the record the history of his attempts to have Nestir brought to court. Although this recitation is perhaps repetitive, the defendant\u2019s efforts bear repeating. He began with the subpoena, followed by the issuance of the capias. The defendant then explained: that the capias had been given to Deputy Sheriff Frank Kinney on May 17; that on May 19, Deputy Sheriff Pepper of Seymour received the capias, which had been mailed to him by the sheriffs office in New Haven; that Pepper went to 445 Poplar Street and returned the capias to the sheriffs office in New Haven because he had been unable to locate Nestir at that address; that the defendant\u2019s counsel went to the sheriffs office at approximately 4:45 p.m. on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>19 and was told that that office would not attempt service after 5 p.m.; that the defendant\u2019s counsel then took the capias back and telephoned Pepper six times, receiving no word back from him that day; that the defendant then telephoned Spina to ask him to locate Nestir; that Spina spoke with Nestir\u2019s mother who informed him that she had telephoned the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on May 17 regarding her daughter\u2019s attendance in court and that Nestir\u2019s mother had been told that Nestir\u2019s presence that day was not required;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that Spina advised Sophie to have Nestir in court on May 20, before 10:30 a.m.; that the defendant\u2019s counsel then telephoned Pepper several times on May 20, and that when he received no response, he asked Kinney for assistance; that Kinney advised him to use another sheriff; that the defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the court for assistance in effectuating its order, which request the court refused; that he then had Shade available to testify regarding the threats that Nestir had made against her; and that the defendant\u2019s counsel advised the court of his inability to use the public defender\u2019s office to serve the capias. At the conclusion of this recitation, the defendant asked for a continuance and for a search and seizure warrant to be issued, as was done in the case of another state\u2019s witness, Ivanez Virvet, who, following her arrest in her home after she had failed to honor a subpoena, subsequently testified for the state. The court left open the issue of a search warrant, indicating that the court would decide that question when and if presented with a warrant in proper form.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The court then questioned the defendant about whether the decision not to ask Nestir about her statements to Shade while she had been in court on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>13 and 14 had been tactical. Furthermore, the court expressed concern, for the first time, about the trustworthiness of Nestir\u2019s statement to Shade in light of Shade\u2019s characterization of Nestir as a liar.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court never decided whether Nestir\u2019s possession of the murder weapon provided a significant connection to the crime as to constitute corroboration of the statement to Shade, although it certainly recognized the significance of that evidence. The defendant responded that he did not have any knowledge of Nestir\u2019s admission to Shade until after Nestir had testified for the state. Specifically, the defendant stated that at the time of his cross-examination of Nestir, \u201cI was not presented with Miss Shade\u2019s information.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court responded that \u201cas far as I\u2019m concerned she was here . . . last week and you had ample opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Thereafter, in the presence of the jury, the defendant called Shade, who was permitted to testify only that Nestir had lived with her for extended periods of time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>that she knew Nestir very well, and that she was able to determine when Nestir was lying to her and when Nestir was being truthful based upon Nestir\u2019s behavior and body language.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> No evidence pertaining to Nestir\u2019s statement to Shade was permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Finally, near the end of the day, the defendant presented Robert Sisson, an investigator in the public defender\u2019s office, who testified that after having conducted a computer search of all pending criminal matters throughout the state, he found nothing pertaining to Nestir. All criminal matters against Nestir had been disposed of prior to the trial in the present case. Sisson also telephoned the public defender\u2019s office at the New London courthouse and learned that Nestir was not on any client list to appear in court. In fact, the public defender\u2019s office in New London had never heard of her. When the defendant asked the state whether the criminal matter for which Nestir was to be sentenced on that day was on the youthful offender docket, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>court responded that it was the defendant\u2019s responsibility to locate Nestir and not the state\u2019s.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The court then concluded that it would not reconsider its determination that Nestir was not unavailable, and it denied the defendant\u2019s request for a continuance until Monday, May 24. With no other witnesses, the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The state then announced that its three rebuttal witnesses were currently unavailable. The court continued the case until May 24 and indicated that it would consider allowing the defendant to reopen its case at that time if Nestir should appear. On Monday, May 24, Nestir was not present but the defendant had further information to offer in connection with his attempts to locate her. The defendant asked to call Sergeant Carol Marci of the New Haven police department to the stand to explain the attempts the police department had made to locate Nestir. The court denied the request, and denied the defendant the opportunity to make a record regarding those attempts to locate Nestir, concluding that those efforts were not \u201csufficiently probative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The law regarding the admissibility of third party statements against interest is well settled. \u201cA <em>trustworthy </em>third party statement exculpatory of the accused and against the penal interest of the declarant is admissible at the trial of the accused if the declarant is unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>214 Conn. 132, 138, 570 A.2d 1125 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>204 Conn. 571, 576, 529 A.2d 673 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 389-90, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>692, 523 A.2d 451 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 630, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 450-51, 426 A.2d 799 (1980); see also Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (3). The determination of whether such a statement is sufficiently trustworthy to be admitted into evidence at trial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoyos, </em>573 F.2d 1111, 1115 (9th Cir. 1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 577; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 390; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 694; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u201cOur present rule allowing the admission of trustworthy third party statements against penal interest has its genesis in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973). Prior to <em>Chambers, </em>such third party statements were per se inadmissible as hearsay. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stallings, </em>154 Conn. 272, 287, 224 A.2d 718 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mosca, </em>90 Conn. 381, 387, 97 A. 340 (1916); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaudet, </em>53 Conn. 536, 551, 4 A. 237 (1886). In State v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, [179 Conn. 449], we interpreted <em>Chambers </em>as forbidding the mechanistic application of the hearsay rule to exclude all third party statements against penal interest exculpatory of an accused. We concluded, however, that <em>Chambers </em>did not mandate the admission of every such statement but required the admission only of those statements that, after a careful examination, were determined in the sound discretion of the trial court to be trustworthy. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u201cFour considerations have been deemed relevant when examining the trustworthiness of declarations against penal interest: (1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; (3) the extent to which the declaration is really against the declarant\u2019s penal interest; [and] (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guillette, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>547 F.2d 743, 754 (2d Cir. [1976]), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 839, 98 S. Ct. 132, 54 L. Ed. 2d 102 [1977]. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Oropeza, </em>564 F.2d 316, 325 (9th Cir. [1977]) [cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1080, 98 S. Ct. 1276, 55 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1978)]; <em>Henson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>399 A.2d 16 [19] (D.C. App.) [cert. denied, 444 U.S. 848, 100 S. Ct. 96, 62 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1979)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>66 Ill.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430,433,493 A.2d 865 (1985). The Appellate Court based its decision on its determination that the trial court had found that Nestir\u2019s statement was not trustworthy. Although the Appellate Court noted that the trial court had found that Nestir was not unavailable, it did not determine the propriety of that decision. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 438 n.5. Our review of the record demonstrates that the trial court focused almost exclusively on the issue of Nestir\u2019s unavailability, and did not expressly make a finding on the trustworthiness of the statement. Because we conclude that the Appellate Court abused its discretion by engaging in a de novo review to conclude that Nestir\u2019s statement was not trustworthy, and because we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in deciding that she was not unavailable, we remand the case for a determination by the trial court on the issue of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">After Shade testified in connection with the defendant\u2019s first offer of proof, the trial court suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Nestir\u2019s statement was not trustworthy but made no specific findings to support that suggestion. Moreover, the court expressly left unanswered whether Nestir\u2019s possession of the murder weapon served as sufficient corroboration, pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 633, of the trustworthiness of her statement. See footnote 14 of this opinion. Thereafter, each time the defendant made any requests in connection with the introduction of Nestir\u2019s statement, the court addressed only the efforts he had made to procure her presence. As the Appellate Court recognized: \u201cThe trial court made no findings relative to the first two factors [in determining whether a third party statement is trustworthy] .... Although the record might be sufficient to determine when such a statement may have been made and to whom, it is not sufficient to determine whether the person to whom the statement was made was one in whom the declarant would naturally confide . . . whether Nestir and Shade had a close and confidential relationship . . . and whether corroborative evidence existed that was more than a minimal amount or speculative in nature.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 438-39. Indeed, because as the record amply demonstrates, the trial court had focused almost exclusively on the issue of Nestir\u2019s unavailability, concluding that the defendant had not proved that she was unavailable, the trial court did not need to decide whether Nestir\u2019s statement was trustworthy. On the record before it, therefore, the Appellate Court could not properly have determined whether the trial court had abused its discretion in connection with the trustworthiness aspect of Nestir\u2019s statement. Only by conducting a de novo review was the Appellate Court able to conclude that the trustworthiness component of the <em>Gold </em>analysis had been satisfied. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marquis, </em>235 Conn. 659, 661-62, 668 A.2d 710 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 579-80; see also Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>We, nevertheless, could affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment if the trial court\u2019s determination regarding Nestir\u2019s unavailability had been proper. The Appellate Court, however, never reached that issue. Although we could remand the case to that court for an initial determination, because the record is clear, we will examine it ourselves. Our examination of the record in this case leads us to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to decide that Nestir was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The state has never contested that the statement Nestir allegedly made to Shade was against her penal interest.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The conflict about the admissibility of her statement centered predominately around the issue of Nestir\u2019s unavailability. Requiring that the unavailability of the declarant be established in order to admit a hearsay statement fulfills the necessity factor that is part of any exception to the hearsay rule. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 390, 521 A.2d 555 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 440. The most common forms of unavailability are set out in rule 804 (a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have previously decided to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>employ those definitions \u201cin determining the unavailability of a [declarant] where the admissibility of statements against . . . interest is in issue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 482. In this case, the defendant claims that he has established Nestir\u2019s unavailability under subdivision (5) of rule 804 (a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">In describing what the proponent of the hearsay exception must do to fall within rule 804 (a) (5), we have stated that \u201c[d]ue diligence to procure the attendance of the absent witness [is] ... an essential . . . predicate of unavailability.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinrib, </em>140 Conn. 247, 252, 99 A.2d 145 (1953). To take advantage of the hearsay exceptions requiring unavailability, the proponent must show a good faith, genuine effort to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>220 Conn. 408, 411, 599 A.2d 1060 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 484. This showing necessarily requires substantial diligence. In determining whether the proponent of the declaration has satisfied this burden of making reasonable efforts, the court must consider what steps were taken to secure the presence of the witness and the timing of efforts to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance. We conclude that, unlike cases in which unavailability was not established; <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, 483 (no capias, request for continuance or request of court or state for assistance); the defendant in the present case \u201cexercise [d] a reasonably diligent attempt to serve an absent witness.\u201d Id., 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>It is evident from the record that Nestir was clearly not eager to cooperate with the defense. During cross-examination, she admitted that although she had spoken with the state\u2019s attorney and his investigator, she would not speak with the defense counsel prior to trial. Nestir provided various excuses for avoiding defense counsel, including that she would not talk with defense counsel without her mother\u2019s presence, and that she had lost his business card. Nestir conceded, however, that she had made no efforts to obtain defense counsel\u2019s telephone number from the defendant\u2019s mother, whom she acknowledged was her friend. Although proof of a witness\u2019 reluctance to come to court voluntarily is not enough to establish unavailability; see <em>Bartruff v. State, </em>528 N.E.2d 110, 115 (Ind. App. 1988); the defendant in the present case made several good faith efforts to procure the declarant by process or other reasonable means. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">After Nestir had testified for the state on May 14, and the defendant had learned of her admission to Shade, Nestir failed to honor the defendant\u2019s subpoena. She did not return to her mother\u2019s home and her only contact was to make telephone calls to Shade threatening Shade not to discuss what Shade had learned from her about the killing. Additionally, because the defendant was not aware of the statement Nestir had made to Shade until after Nestir had testified for the state, the state cannot seriously contend that Nestir\u2019s unavailability resulted from the defendant\u2019s tactical choice not to question her when she was testifying on May 13 and 14 as a state\u2019s witness. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 444-47 (because declarant\u2019s unavailability resulted solely from defense\u2019s tactical strategy, defense could not contend that declarant was unavailable) . The defendant\u2019s several attempts over a seven day period to serve the capias and to have Nestir arrested to ensure her testimony were frustrated by reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>beyond his control, including the refusal of the sheriffs department to respond on several occasions, the refusal of the court to grant additional time to have the capias served, and the refusal of the court to allow the introduction of evidence of the efforts the police department had made to serve the capias.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The efforts made in the present case are similar to the attempts made in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>191 W. Va. 648, 447 S.E.2d 583 (1994). In that case, the state had subpoenaed the declarant to testify at trial. Id., 659. Although she appeared in court, on the first day of trial, the declarant was not called to testify that day and she did not return. \u201c[T]he State ordered several policemen to locate her, but the police were unsuccessful.\u201d Id. Despite the issuance of a capias by the court, the state could not procure the declarant\u2019s attendance. Consequently, the trial court deemed her unavailable and that finding was affirmed by the Supreme Court of West Virginia. Id.; see also <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>State, </em>321 Ark. 167, 174-75, 901 S.W.2d 802 (1995) (unavailability properly determined based upon unsuccessful attempts by two investigators from prosecutor\u2019s office and police officer to serve subpoena at witness\u2019 reported location); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schilling, </em>474 N.W.2d 203, 205 (Minn. App. 1991) (unavailability properly found based upon failure of witness to honor subpoena for first trial date and on return of unserved subpoena for second trial date); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nielson, </em>316 Or. 611, 618-19, 853 P.2d 256 (1993) (unavailability properly decided based upon police attempts to subpoena declarant at various locations and on persistent checks of police computer system to determine arrests, if any, on outstanding warrants); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 413 (where, inter alia, no attempt by defendant to seek police assistance in locating declarant, court determined declarant not unavailable).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">A proponent\u2019s burden is to demonstrate a diligent and reasonable effort, not to do everything conceivable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to secure the witness\u2019 presence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Potamitis, </em>739 F.2d 784, 789 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 918, 105 S. Ct. 297, 83 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1984). On the basis of the record before us, we conclude that the defendant did not conduct merely a cursory threshold inquiry into Nestir\u2019s whereabouts. Rather, he exercised due diligence in making a good faith effort to secure Nestir\u2019s attendance and thereby sufficiently demonstrated Nestir\u2019s unavailability. The sheriffs failed to serve the capias and refused to return the defendant\u2019s telephone calls, and the court would not allow the police to explain what efforts they had made. Admittedly, Spina, a private investigator who had spoken with Nestir\u2019s mother in his attempts to locate Nestir but who had not been allowed by the court to testify in connection with those efforts, did not travel to New London on May 21. Sisson, however, who worked for the public defender\u2019s office with which the defendant had a conflict and who could not do extensive work for the defendant because of that conflict, had access to the public defender\u2019s computer that provided \u201cthe entire clerk system and everything [except the youthful offender docket] that happens in the court system.\u201d Unfortunately, Sisson could not get any confirmation from the computer or the public defender\u2019s office in New London that Nestir was due in court there that day. Therefore, there was little reason to send Spina to New London. Although Sisson failed to search the youthful offender docket, the state, having obtained a continuance of Nestir\u2019s case for its own purposes, knew whether she was being treated as a youthful offender. The state, however, was all but told by the court that it did not have to provide the defendant with such information.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Under the circumstances of this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Sisson\u2019s omission did not undermine the reasonable efforts of the defendant to locate Nestir.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Our decision today does not alter what we have stated many times: it is within the discretion of the trial court to accept or to reject the proponent\u2019s representations regarding the unavailability of a declarant and the trial court\u2019s ruling will generally not be disturbed unless the court has abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 412. In the present case, however, it appears that the trial court (1) improperly relied on the fact that Nestir had been available during the presentation of the state\u2019s case to decide that she consequently remained available; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Eufracio-Torres, </em>890 F.2d 266, 270 (10th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1008, 110 S. Ct. 1306, 108 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1990) (prior deposition testimony did not preclude finding of unavailability where witness failed to honor promise to return); (2) improperly denied the defendant the opportunity to create a record regarding the efforts of the New Haven police department to locate Nestir; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 34, 425 A.2d 560 (1979) (court has no discretion to deprive aggrieved party of proper record for appeal); and (3) improperly foreclosed the defendant\u2019s inquiry of the state regarding Nestir\u2019s court appearance in New London. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant demonstrated a genuine, diligent, reasonable and good faith effort to secure Nestir\u2019s presence and that, therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in failing to determine that Nestir was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In this opinion BERDON and NORCOTT, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\"> As a result of our conclusion, we need not consider today whether the exclusion of that evidence deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to due process of law.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5j\">joins, dissenting. I dissent from the majority opinion because I cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion when it determined that the defendant had failed to meet his burden of proving that Lenise Nestir, the declarant of an out-of-court statement, was unavailable to testify in this case and that the defendant had made all reasonable efforts to procure Nestir\u2019s appearance at trial. I also disagree with the majority that the trial court \u201cdid not decide whether [Nestir\u2019s] statement was trustworthy\u201d and that we should remand this case to the trial court for that determination. I would conclude that the trial court did determine that even if Nestir were unavailable, her purported statement to Robin Shade was untrustworthy and therefore inadmissible and that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Nestir\u2019s statement. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">In any analysis of the admissibility of a declaration against penal interest, the trial court must first determine whether the declarant is unavailable. Only if unavailability has been shown by the proponent of the proffered hearsay statement will the court proceed to an examination of trustworthiness. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>179 Conn. 431, 443, 426 A.2d 799 (1980) (\u201c[w]e have been unable to find a case . . . where an appellate court has dispensed with the unavailability of the declarant as a condition precedent to admitting such declarations\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>182 Conn. 476, 480-81, 438 A.2d 735 (1980). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>481, we recognized five of the most common situations in which the declarant will be deemed unavailable. The only one of those situations relevant here is where the declarant is \u201cabsent from the hearing and the proponent of [her] statement has been unable to procure [her] attendance ... by process or other reasonable means.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIn interpreting \u2018reasonable means,\u2019 we have held that the proponent must exercise due diligence and, at a minimum, make a good faith effort to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 391, 392, 521 A.2d 555 (1987), citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinrib, </em>140 Conn. 247, 252, 99 A.2d 145 (1953), and <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 445. The trial court has broad discretion in determining whether the proponent has shown a declarant to be unavailable. \u2018Only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion will this court set aside on appeal rulings on evidentiary matters.\u2019 <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>204 Conn. 303, 324, 528 A.2d 1123 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>220 Conn. 408, 411-12, 599 A.2d 1060 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">I disagree with the majority that the trial court clearly abused its discretion when it concluded that the defendant had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the declarant could not be located and her presence could not be procured by reasonable efforts on his part. By repeating several times the halfhearted attempts that the defendant had made to locate Nestir, the majority creates the illusion that the defendant undertook substantial efforts to locate the seventeen year old witness who seemingly, according to the defendant, had disappeared from New Haven into thin air. Repetition, however, does not add significance to the defendant\u2019s endeavors to locate Nestir.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The defendant\u2019s efforts can be stated simply and concisely. First, on Friday, May 14, 1993, the defendant prepared a subpoena for Nestir to appear in court as a defense witness on Monday, May 17. The subpoena <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was served as Nestir was leaving court after having testified pursuant to the state\u2019s subpoena during the state\u2019s case-in-chief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nestir did not honor the defendant\u2019s subpoena. At the defendant\u2019s request, therefore, the trial court issued a capias for Nestir. On May 19, Deputy Sheriff Harold Pepper went to Nestir\u2019s home at 445 Poplar Street in New Haven to serve the capias but was unable to locate Nestir at that time. Pepper then returned the capias to the sheriffs office in the courthouse. At 4:45 p.m. on May 19, defense counsel retrieved the capias from the sheriffs office and, after having been informed that the sheriffs office normally would not attempt service after 5 p.m., placed several telephone calls to Pepper, who did not return the calls. Also on May 19, the private investigator who worked with defense counsel on various aspects of the defendant\u2019s case, telephoned Nestir\u2019s mother and asked her to have Nestir report to court the next morning despite the mother\u2019s representation that she did not know Nestir\u2019s whereabouts. On May 20, defense counsel asked Frank Kinney, the high sheriff, to procure another sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>iff to serve the capias. Kinney told defense counsel that counsel was free to contact another deputy sheriff and provided him with a Rolodex containing the names of deputy sheriffs who could serve the capias. Defense counsel, however, inexplicably chose not to contact any of those sheriffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">On May 21, Nestir had a scheduled court date in the New London courthouse. The defendant had been aware of Nestir\u2019s May 21 court appearance since May 13, when the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office had informed him that it was going to have a scheduled May 14 New London court appearance for Nestir switched to May 21, in order to accommodate the court\u2019s schedule in the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant made no efforts to verify the time and exact courtroom location of Nestir\u2019s New London appearance until May 21. The defendant moreover made no effort to have anyone present at the New London courthouse to serve the capias on Nestir. Instead, the defendant asked Robert Sisson, an investigator from the public defender\u2019s office, to find out, on the morning of her scheduled appearance, if Nestir would be in the New London courthouse that day. Sis-son ran a search on a statewide computer system that lists pending cases and was unable to find any pending cases against Nestir. That system, however, does not include cases on the youthful offender docket and Nestir was only seventeen years old at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. Sisson also called the New London public defender\u2019s office but was informed by the receptionist that she did not know Nestir. Sisson did not call the New London clerk\u2019s office or any other court functionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Lastly, on Friday, May 21, the defendant requested that \u201ca search and seizure warrant issue so that [the authorities] may enter [Nestir\u2019s home] in the event she is there and take her into custody.\u201d The defendant did not present the court with a warrant application at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>time. The court replied: \u201cWith regard to the search warrant, if one is presented to the court, I will certainly consider it if it is in proper form. That probably should have been done this morning.\u201d Despite the court\u2019s willingness to consider a warrant application, the defendant never presented one to the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">I am not persuaded that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s efforts fall below the standard of due diligence represents a clear abuse of discretion by the trial court. The defendant\u2019s failure to attempt to engage another sheriff to serve the capias after Pepper had failed to do so did not constitute due diligence. The defendant\u2019s failure to call the clerk\u2019s office or to send his investigator or anyone else to New London on the day of Nestir\u2019s scheduled appearance could also be found not to constitute due diligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>defendant\u2019s failure to prepare a search and seizure warrant for Nestir and her home despite the trial court\u2019s express willingness to sign such a warrant supports a finding of a lack of due diligence. I would therefore uphold the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling that the defendant had not established that Nestir was unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthe trial court . . . did not expressly make a finding on the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d After concluding that Nestir was available, the trial court found, in the alternative, that the statement was untrustworthy. The court stated: \u201c[T]he testimony by Miss Shade was unequivocal that the declarant was decidedly untrustworthy in her eyes. And so there\u2019s a matter of trustworthiness even if you get past the fact that she seems to be available. . . . [Shade] said [she] wouldn\u2019t accept anything that [Nestir] said without proof. . . . The conclusion I reach is that she (a) is available and that (b) if she were unavailable the trustworthiness is seriously, seriously in doubt.\u201d I am not persuaded, in light of the record, that the trial court abused its broad discretion in its ruling on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The trial court based its conclusion of untrustworthiness on Shade\u2019s own testimony that Nestir often lied to her and that she did not trust Nestir.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>conclusion is further supported by its observance of Nestir\u2019s demeanor, particularly her vacillation during her testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Having read that testimony, I am not surprised that the trial court concluded that Nestir was untrustworthy. Nestir\u2019s testimony revealed her to have, at best, only a passing acquaintance with the truth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">In addition to other factors such as observation to assess a declarant\u2019s general trustworthiness or lack thereof, \u201c[flour considerations have been deemed relevant when examining the trustworthiness of declarations against penal interest: (1) the time of the declaration and the party to whom the declaration was made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence in the case; (3) the extent to which the declaration is really against the declarant\u2019s penal interest; [and] (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Rosado, 218 Conn. 239, 244-45, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The timing of Nestir\u2019s purported statement, which supposedly occurred one and one-half days after the shooting, supports its untrustworthiness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nevertheless, upon consideration of <em>all </em>the evidence before the trial court, I am not persuaded that Shade was a person in whom Nestir would naturally confide, a conclusion that weighs heavily against the admissibility of the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ment. \u201c[T]he witness testifying as to the statement must be one in whom the declarant would naturally confide.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 392, 528 A.2d 794 (1987). \u201cThere must be a relationship in which the two parties to the conversation had a close and confidential relationship.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Conn. 58, 70, 602 A.2d 571 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The burden of establishing the requisite relationship rests on the proponent of the statement. See id., 70-71. I fail to see a \u201cclose and confidential relationship\u201d between Shade and Nestir. To the contrary, the evidence supports the opposite conclusion. Shade testified that Nestir had a habit of shoplifting and had embroiled Shade\u2019s children in trouble with the law. Shade also testified that she had blamed Nestir for one of her daughter\u2019s arrests for several petty offenses, and that she believed that Nestir was a bad influence on her children. Shade further testified that she knew Nestir well, that she did not trust Nestir and that Nestir had often lied to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Although Shade had once taken care of Nestir for a period of eleven months and, shortly thereafter, again for a period of nine months, her care for Nestir had occurred when Nestir was only eight or nine years old, <em>eight years prior to when Nestir made the alleged statement to Shade. </em>In addition, although Shade testified that Nestir <em>used to </em>tell other people that Shade was her \u201caunt,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the absence of any known time frame when that occurred and in the context of the other evidence adduced regarding the relationship between Shade and Nestir, testimony that Nestir at some time may have called Shade \u201caunt\u201d is of little significance. To determine whether a person is one in whom a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>declarant would naturally confide, we consider relationships as they actually exist rather than the labels attached to the relationship, and have concluded that even blood relatives may not possess such a confidential relationship. See id. (sibling relationship did not establish close and confidential relationship where brothers did not grow up together or get along well, and where one brother had burglarized other brother\u2019s apartment). Shade testified that she had stopped taking care of Nestir <em>eight years before the shooting </em>because Nestir \u201clike[d] to go on the streets constantly.\u201d Although Nestir occasionally visited Shade\u2019s residence,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Shade herself testified that those visits were limited to about one hour in length and confined to certain areas of the house. Moreover, Shade did not always allow Nestir into her residence when Nestir visited. It is reasonable to infer from this evidence that, although Nestir and Shade knew one another and were more than mere acquaintances, a certain hostility existed between them and that Shade was not a close friend of Nestir or a person in whom Nestir would naturally confide. See id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>204 Conn. 571, 578-79, 529 A.2d 673 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>200 Conn. 721, 726, 513 A.2d 653 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I also would not conclude that Nestir\u2019s alleged statement was sufficiently corroborated. \u201cThe corroboration requirement for the admission of a third party statement against penal interest <em>is significant and goes beyond minimal corroboration. </em>Third party statements exculpating an accused are suspect and the requirement of corroboration, to effectuate its propose of circumventing fabrication, must be construed as requiring <em>cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>roborating circumstances that clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the proffered </em>statement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 249. Shade testified that Nestir had told her that: (1) a fight between her and the victim\u2019s brother had instigated the shooting; (2) she had enlisted the help of a group of young men to beat the victim\u2019s brother; (3) immediately prior to the shooting, she and a group of young men had driven around in an automobile to search for the victim\u2019s brother; and (4) when she and the group of men found the victim and his brother, she had seized a gun from another occupant of the automobile and had fired the gun at the victim\u2019s brother, hitting the victim instead.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> None of these crucial components of Nestir\u2019s alleged statement was corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The proper focus of a reviewing court\u2019s analysis is the existence of corroborating evidence to substantiate the truth of the facts contained in the statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 579; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 392. Few circumstances in this case are relevant to the issue of corroboration, and the amount of corroboration provided thereby is minimal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>The only evidence corroborative of any aspect of Nestir\u2019s statement is: (1) the undisputed fact that Nestir possessed the murder weapon eight days after the shooting;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) the testimony by one witness \u2014 contradicted by the unequivocal testimony of the four other witnesses to the shooting who testified that they had seen the shooter \u2014 that Nestir was present in the automobile from which <em>another person </em>had fired the fatal shots. This evidence is minimal and speculative and fails to ensure trustworthiness. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 246-49 (few corroborating factors to indicate trustworthiness of statement); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 579-80 (same). Unlike the two cases in which we have concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in failing to admit a third party declaration against penal interest into evidence and in which \u201ca myriad of corroborating circumstances\u201d actually existed and evinced the trustworthiness of the third party statement; <em>State v. Bryant, </em>202 Conn. 676, 701, 523 A.2d 451 (1987) (robbery victim\u2019s stolen pocketbook and driver\u2019s license seen by several witnesses in third party\u2019s possession after robbery, third party fit general description of assailant and knew location of victim\u2019s apartment, similar inculpatory statements repeated to several persons, and inculpatory statements contained particular and verified details of crime); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 634, 635-36, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980) (witnesses saw bloody shirt in third party\u2019s possession on night of murders, third party identified running from scene of crime by disinterested witness, evidence that third party left state after murders, third party\u2019s confession overheard by other person, and similar inculpatory statements repeated to several persons); the record in the present case reveals few cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>roborating circumstances indicative of the trustworthiness of Nestir\u2019s alleged statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The evidence of \u201cnoncorroboration\u201d is far more compelling in this case. Of the five eyewitnesses to the shooting who testified at trial, none identified a female as the shooter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, of the three eyewitnesses who identified a particular shooter, all unequivocally identified someone other than Nestir as the shooter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Jeanette Ayala testified that a man named Moses had fired the fatal shots.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Ivanez Virvet testified that the defendant had fired the fatal shots.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Last, Alex Romero testified that the fatal shots had come from the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>he had been driving and that the shooter had been David Morales.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">There is also no corroboration for other key elements of Nestir\u2019s alleged statement: that the motive for the shooting was Nestir\u2019s earlier fight with the victim\u2019s brother<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that Nestir had solicited help from several young men to \u201cget even\u201d with the victim\u2019s brother. Moreover, there is no independent evidence that corroborates that Nestir had made the statement to Shade, or even that she had spoken to Shade at any time subsequent to the shooting. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 726. There is likewise no evidence that Nestir, at any time prior to or subsequent to her supposed statement to Shade, repeated her statement either in whole or in part. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 70 (lack of reiteration of confession vitiates trustworthiness); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 578 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>In light of the weak nature of the corroborative evidence to support the trustworthiness of Nestir\u2019s alleged statement, I cannot say that the trial court abused its broad discretion in concluding that Nestir\u2019s alleged statement was not sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">To reiterate, our primary function in this appeal is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to admit Shade\u2019s testimony. The Appellate Court, in a unanimous decision, concluded that the trial court had not abused its discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>38 Conn. App. 434, 439, 662 A.2d 792 (1995). As did the Appellate Court, I would defer to the trial court on that issue. The trial court heard the testimony and, therefore, was able to assess credibility before exercising its discretion to exclude Shade\u2019s testimony. The trial court\u2019s ruling should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\"> When asked later why he had not simply cross-examined Nestir about the purported statement to Shade when he had the opportunity to do so, the defendant argued in the alternative that either: (1) he had not known of the statement at that time and had merely prepared the subpoena for the next court day in the event that someone would fortuitously come forward over the weekend with new evidence pertaining to Nestir; or (2) he had considered the topic of Nestir\u2019s alleged statement to Shade to be beyond the scope of the state\u2019s direct examination and did not feel that the court would allow him to cross-examine on that subject. The defendant concedes that the only one of the eighteen witnesses who testified for the state and was subject to cross-examination by him, and who the defendant subsequently subpoenaed, was Nestir. At no point during the proceedings before either this court or the trial court has the defendant offered any reason why he had prepared the subpoena for Nestir without having known that there was additional ground to be covered with her. If it is the case that the defendant did know of the statement purportedly made to Shade at the time that he cross-examined Nestir during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, then his tactical decision to pursue that line of inquiry at a later time precludes a finding of unavailability. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 445-47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\"> I take issue with the majority\u2019s use of the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s Friday, May 21 request for a continuance in order to malee efforts to locate Nestir over the weekend. Although the trial court did deny the request for a continuance, the court also indicated to the defendant that if he were able to locate Nestir over the weekend, the court would consider allowing the defendant to reopen his case on Monday. \u201c \u2018The determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>[supra, 202 Conn. 394].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 239, 636 A.2d 760 (1994). The court denied the request for a continuance only to prevent further delay in the case, without any harm to the defendant who was, in fact, given the weekend to find Nestir. There is no indication in the record that the defendant made any efforts to locate Nestir that weekend. I would not conclude that the trial court abused its broad discretion in \u201cdenying\u201d the requested continuance until Monday when the trial court expressly indicated that it would consider allowing the defendant to present Nestir on Monday if she were present at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b110-8\"> I am puzzled at the majority\u2019s assertion that \u201cthere was little reason to send [Louis] Spina to New London.\u201d I would think that the possible presence at the courthouse of the person who had allegedly confessed to the crime with which the defendant had been charged would have provided the defendant with ample reason to send his private investigator or someone else to New London to attempt to serve the capias, if the defendant actually wished to locate her. The defendant failed to pursue the most obvious avenue of confirming Nestir\u2019s presence at the courthouse, namely, whether the seventeen year old Nestir was on the youthful offender docket for the day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that she was supposed to be at court. The defendant\u2019s attempts at other, inapplicable, avenues cannot seriously be considered due diligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AQx\"> Shade testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: And you wouldn\u2019t believe her because a lot of times she would lie to you, isn\u2019t that true?</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">\u201c[Shade]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"A6j\">\u201cQ.

[She] and [the victim\u2019s brother] had a fight. [The victim\u2019s brother] was supposed to smack her in the face and she said that no F-body is going to smack her in the face and she is going to get some boys from Liberty Street to beat his butt. As far as I know she got a car full of guys and she said that one of them had 1he gun shooting it out the window up to the sky and she grabbed it from the guy and pointed it to [the victim\u2019s brother] and it didn\u2019t hit [the victim\u2019s brother] it hit someone else and she said it was [the victim].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On cross-examination, Shade testified: \u201c[Nestir] said that her and [the victim\u2019s brother were] having a fight and [the victim\u2019s brother] was supposed to slap her and she didn\u2019t like that.

A third witness for the state, Perry Moore, identified the shooter as an unknown Latino male. A fourth eyewitness for the state, Angelo Virvet, corroborated the details provided by the other three witnesses for the state, but did not see who was in the automobile from which the shots had been fired. Alex Romero, a witness for the defense, testified that David Morales had fired the shots that had killed the victim.

See footnote 5. The majority\u2019s use of this evidence as a corroborative circumstance, therefore, is puzzling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"A95\"> Romero testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ABY\">\u201c [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: What happened as you proceeded westbound on Davenport Avenue?</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\u201c[Romero]: As soon as I got to the light \u2014 there\u2019s a light on Winthrop Avenue and Davenport.
