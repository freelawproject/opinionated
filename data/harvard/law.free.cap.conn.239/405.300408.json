At the defendant\u2019s trial, the court admitted into evidence, for impeachment purposes, a statement made to the police by the defendant shortly after the crime had taken place. In making its ruling, the trial court determined that the defendant\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>ment was voluntary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming, inter alia, that the statement was involuntary within the meaning of article first, \u00a7 8, of the state constitution and, therefore, that the trial court had improperly admitted it into evidence for impeachment purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>34 Conn. App. 368, 379, 641 A.2d 818 (1994). In connection with his claim, the defendant argued that the voluntariness determination under article first, \u00a7 8, should be governed by the totality of the circumstances test set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 477, 512 A.2d 189 (1986),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than by the test espoused in <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986), which requires coercive police conduct as a predicate to finding that a confession is not voluntary under the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>supra, 380-81. The Appellate Court declined to reach the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim, concluding that the record was inadequate to review it. Id., 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We granted certification to consider, inter alia, whether the record was sufficient to review the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim and, if it was, whether the defendant should have prevailed on that claim. We concluded that it was unclear whether, in determining that the defendant\u2019s statement was voluntary, the trial court had applied the test in <em>Connelly, </em>or the totality of the circumstances test in <em>Smith. State </em>v. <em>Byrd, </em>233 Conn. 517, 522-23, 659 A.2d 1201 (1995). Accordingly, we remanded the case to the trial court for the \u201cpurpose of articulating whether it found the defendant\u2019s statement to be voluntary because of the absence of police misconduct, or on the basis of the totality of the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>stances\u201d and, if it employed the latter standard, to \u201carticulate specifically what facts it relied upon in making that finding.\u201d Id., 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">On July 8,1996, the trial court responded to our order for articulation stating that it had determined that the defendant\u2019s statement to the police was voluntary under the <em>pre-Connelly </em>totality of the circumstances test used in <em>Smith. </em>The court further stated that it had relied on the following facts in reaching its conclusion: \u201c(a) [the] defendant [was] given time by police to calm himself; (b) police provided the defendant with food and coffee; (c) [the] defendant [was] allowed contact with family members who were present; (d) police did not restrain the defendant (handcuffs not applied); (e) [the] defendant was calm, spoke freely, and did not exhibit slurred or incoherent speech; (1) [the] defendant appeared to understand all questions, was responsive thereto, and, as to such, did not refuse to answer any; and (g) [the] defendant had no difficulty completing [the] Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> waiver form by correctly initialing the form where required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Because the trial court in this case applied the pre-<em>Connelly </em>totality of the circumstances test that the defendant had urged it to adopt as the voluntariness standard under the state constitution, we need not decide whether, as a general matter, the standard for voluntariness under article first, \u00a7 8, is different from the federal standard enumerated in <em>Connelly. </em>The defendant\u2019s sole remaining claim in the present appeal is that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntariness. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u201cThe state bears the burden of proving the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 484, 92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 39, 554 A.2d 263 (1989). The trial court\u2019s findings as to the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s interrogation and confession are findings of fact . . . which will not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>[235 Conn. 748, 759, 670 A.2d 276 (1996)]. On the ultimate issue of voluntariness, however, we will conduct an independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Chung, </em>[202 Conn. 39, 54, 519 A.2d 1175 (1987)] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>237 Conn. 694, 728, 678 A.2d 942 (1996). Our independent review of the record leads us to concur in the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\"> The trial court did not specify whether it was deciding the voluntariness issue under the state or the federal constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 465, was decided by this court prior to the publication of <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 479 U.S. 167. <em>Smith </em>was decided solely on federal constitutional grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.
