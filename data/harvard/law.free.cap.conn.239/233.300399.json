We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">The plaintiff, Albert Molnar, was a part-time employee of Domino\u2019s Pizza in May, 1988, when he severely injured his leg in the course of his employment. He thereafter collected temporary total benefits from his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier until June, 1994, when he was declared eligible to return to work. The plaintiff subsequently applied for unemployment compensation benefits effective July 10,1994, and was found ineligible by an unemployment compensation examiner due to his lack of wages during the base period applicable to those individuals receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-230. The plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed that decision within the agency, first to an appeals referee and later to the employment security board of review (board). He subsequently appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The trial court concluded that the board did not act arbitrarily in affirming the referee\u2019s determination that workers\u2019 compensation benefits received by an employee during a period of incapacity do not qualify as wages within the meaning of \u00a7 31-222 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The plaintiff also raised an equal protection claim to the trial court, arguing that no rational basis exists for the legislature's determination that only the recipient of workers\u2019 compensation benefits whose \u201clast most recently worked calendar quarter is no more than twelve calendar quarters prior to the date\u201d of the individual\u2019s initiating claim could subsequently receive unemployment compensation benefits once he or she was declared eligible to return to work. See General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 31-230. Finding that there was a rational basis for the twelve quarter cutoff, the trial court rejected that claim. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Our examination of the record and the briefs and arguments of the parties on appeal persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The central issues relating to the proper interpretation of the relevant statutes and the constitutionality of the classification contained in \u00a7 31-230 were properly resolved in the trial court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. <em>Molnar </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>44 Conn.
