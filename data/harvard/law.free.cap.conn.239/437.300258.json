We conclude that the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c) are directory in nature, and that, where timely actual notice of an agency\u2019s decision has been provided, the agency\u2019s failure to follow those provisions to the letter does not prevent its decision from becoming effective for the purpose of calculating the time period in which an appeal of that decision must be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The plaintiffs, Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. (Crest), and Morande Brothers, Inc. (Morande), appeal separately from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of their joint appeal of a ruling by the defendant department of motor vehicles (department)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granting a license to the defendant Gorin\u2019s Sports Car Center, Inc. (Gorin), to sell automobiles distributed by the defendant Mazda Motor of America, Inc. (Mazda), at Gorin\u2019s business location at 170 Weston Street in Hartford.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>filed their appeal forty-nine days after the department\u2019s decision was mailed, four days beyond the time allotted for appeal of such decisions; see General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The following facts are undisputed. On November 14, 1991, the department issued Gorin a license to sell Mazda automobiles. On November 21, 1991, Gorin and Mazda entered into a dealership agreement under which Gorin would sell Mazda automobiles at Gorin\u2019s established Jaguar-Alfa Romeo dealership located at 170 Weston Street in Hartford.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to this agreement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Gorin purchased the assets of a Mazda dealer in East Windsor. Neither Mazda, Gorin, nor the department notified the plaintiffs, who were also Mazda dealers, of the dealership agreement or license application.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On November 22, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a formal protest with the department because Mazda had not notified them of the agreement and because there had been no hearing as allegedly required by General Statutes \u00a7 42-133dd (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The department declined to grant a hearing because it considered the Mazda-Gorin agreement to be a relocation of an established dealership within that dealership\u2019s area of responsibility under \u00a7 42-133dd (b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, therefore, exempt from the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>requirements of \u00a7 42-133dd (a). The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, and the trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>ordered the department to conduct a hearing to determine whether the Mazda-Gorin agreement established a new dealership and, if so, to hold a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 42-133dd (a) in order to determine whether there was good cause to deny Gorin a license to sell Mazdas. The department thereafter held the first hearing over two days, September 10,1992, and November 4, 1992, after which the department hearing officer ruled that the Mazda-Gorin agreement had established a new dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Between May 12,1993, and August 4,1993, the second hearing pursuant to \u00a7 42-133dd (a) was conducted before hearing officer Brian C. Carey. On July 27, 1994, Carey rendered a decision concluding that there was no good cause to deny Gorin a license to sell Mazdas. Carey\u2019s final decision was mailed to the parties and their attorneys via \u201cbulk certified mail\u201d on Wednesday, July 27, 1994.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By Friday, July 29, 1994, all parties had received copies of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On September 6, 1994, within forty-five days of the mailing of the decision, the plaintiffs served notice of their appeal on all parties. On September 14,1994, forty-nine days after the decision had been mailed and forty-seven days after all parties had received it, the plaintiffs filed an appeal of the decision in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Prior to oral argument on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the trial court, sua sponte, raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal appeared to have been filed beyond the statutory time limit. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c). All of the defendants except Gorin promptly filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 30, 1995, the trial court, concluding that the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c) were merely directory and, thus, that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal was untimely, dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs appealed separately from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeals to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court improperly concluded that the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c) (\u201cUnited States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested\u201d) were merely directory and that the department\u2019s failure to comply with the mailing provisions did not free the plaintiffs from the statutory requirement that they file their appeal within forty-five days of the mailing of the department\u2019s decision. Specifically, the plaintiffs assert that: (1) the subsection\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in setting forth the mailing provisions indicates their mandatory nature; (2) the mailing provisions are related to matters of substance and not merely an attempt to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings; and (3) the legislative history of the statute indicates a legislative intent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the provisions be mandatory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In response, the defendants argue that the mailing provisions are merely directory in that they were established for the convenience of the parties, and not to affect any substantive rights, and that the legislative history supports this interpretation. In addition, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs cannot claim prejudice because they had timely notice of the decision and, therefore, could have filed then-appeal within the forty-five day period mandated by \u00a7 4-183 (c). We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The plaintiffs recognize that failure to comply with this time limitation normally would deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. See footnote 9. They assert, however, that the limitation period of \u00a7 4-183 (c) should not be applied to their appeal because the department did not mail the hearing officer\u2019s final decision by \u201ccertified or registered [mail], postage prepaid, return receipt requested,\u201d as required by \u00a7 4-180 (c).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Section 4-180 (c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe [agency\u2019s] final decision shall be delivered promptly to each party or his authorized representative, personally or by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. The final decision shall be effective when personally delivered or mailed or on a later date specified by the agency.\u201d The plaintiffs argue that the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is indicative of the mandatory nature of the section. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u201cWell established principles of statutory construction govern our determination of whether [a statute\u2019s provisions are] mandatory or directory. Our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent: intent of the legislature. <em>Ambroise </em>v. <em>William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 757, 764, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993); <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 258, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992); <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 200, 585 A.2d 96 (1991).\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>237 Conn. 71, 76-77, 676 A.2d 819 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201cWhile we generally will not look for interpretative guidance beyond the language of the statute when the words of that statute are plain and unambiguous; <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54, 523 A.2d 477 (1987); our past decisions have indicated that the use of the word \u2018shall,\u2019 though significant, does not invariably create a mandatory duty. <em>Fidelity Trust Co. </em>v. <em>BVD Associates, </em>196 Conn. 270, 278, 492 A.2d 180 (1985); <em>Tramontano </em>v. <em>Dilieto, </em>192 Conn. 426, 433-34, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>472 A.2d 768 (1984).\u201d <em>Hall Manor Owner\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>212 Conn. 147, 152, 561 A.2d 1373 (1989). In order to determine whether a statute\u2019s provisions are mandatory we have traditionally looked beyond the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d and examined the statute\u2019s essential purpose. Id. \u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. . . . If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995). Furthermore, if there is no language that expressly invalidates any action taken after noncompliance with the statutory provisions, the statute should be construed as directory. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the mailing provisions go to matters of substance because \u00a7 4-180 (c) must be read in conjunction with \u00a7 4-183 (c). We disagree. Section 4-183 (c) does not state that the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c) must be followed strictly, nor does it contain any language that would indicate a tolling of the statutory time for appeal if those provisions are not followed. Rather, it simply makes clear that the provision in \u00a7 4-180 (c) stating that an administrative decision is effective upon mailing or personal delivery establishes the date upon which the judgment becomes final for purposes of appellate review. Aggrieved parties then have forty-five days in which to file an appeal. Practice Book \u00a7 4000. Neither \u00a7 4-180 (c) nor \u00a7 4-183 (c) contains language that would invalidate an action that failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>comply strictly with the mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c). This omission indicates a legislative intent that the provisions operate to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">All of the parties assert that the legislative history of \u00a7 4-180 (c) supports their diametrically opposed interpretations of the statute. They each rely on the legislative history of the statute as amended during the 1988 February legislative session. The plaintiffs argue that the legislature would not have changed the language of \u00a7 4-180 (c) requiring the use of certified mail unless it had intended that change to have substantive effect. The defendants respond that the legislative change was simply a matter of making the process more convenient for the parties to an administrative appeal. It is understandable how these disparate arguments maybe drawn from the legislative history, because that history is sparse at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The mailing provisions at issue were added to \u00a7 4-180 (c) in 1988, as part of an overall restructuring of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq. Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317, \u00a7 17. The sole evidence of any possible legislative intent behind the amendment of \u00a7 4-180 (c) is in a report presented to the joint committee on the judiciary by the law revision commission (commission). Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 2, 1988 Sess., pp. 377, 382-83. In 1985, the commission had begun a review of amendments to the UAPA that had been proposed by the Administrative Law Section of the Connecticut Bar Association. Id., p. 377. The commission report was the result of that review, and in the report the commission recommended a number of changes to the UAPA, some of which set new standards or procedures, others of which merely clarified previously established procedures. The amendments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>mailing provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c) were of the latter type. The commission explained in its report that the change in mailing procedures was designed to \u201cmake it <em>easier </em>to establish the mailing date of a decision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 383. We note that nowhere in the report or in any of the legislative discussion regarding the proposed changes to the UAPA, what little there was, did anyone mention that there should be a penalty for noncompliance with the proposed mailing provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In the absence of any language or history of \u00a7 4-180 (c) to indicate a legislative intent that the mailing provisions be mandatory, we conclude that those provisions are designed to promote order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, and as such are purely directory.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Failure to abide by those provisions does not, therefore, toll the period in which an aggrieved party must file an appeal of the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-180 (c) provides: \u201cA final decision in a contested case shall be in writing or orally stated on the record and, if adverse to a party, shall include the agency\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to its decision. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence in the record and on matters noticed. The agency shall state in the final decision the name of each party and the most recent mailing address, provided to the agency, of the party or his authorized representative. The final decision shall be delivered promptly to each party or his authorized representative, personally or by United States mail, certified or registered, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>postage prepaid, return receipt requested. The final decision shall be effective when personally delivered or mailed or on a later date specified by the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> The commissioner of motor vehicles was also named as a defendant in the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> Gorin is no longer in business at this location. At oral argument the question was raised, sua sponte, as to whether this fact made the appeal moot. \u201cBecause courts are established to resolve actual controversies, before a claimed controversy is entitled to a resolution on the merits it must be justiciable. Justiciability requires . . . that there be an actual controversy between or among the parties to the dispute: Courts exist for determination of actual and existing controversies, mid under the law of this state the courts may not be used as a vehicle to obtain judicial opinions on points of law. . . . [WJhere the question presented is purely academic, we must refuse to entertain the appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hallas </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>212 Conn. 338, 347, 562 A.2d 499 (1989). \u201cA case becomes moot when due to intervening circumstances a controversy between the parties no longer exists.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 347-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">We may retain jurisdiction, however, where the matter being appealed creates collateral consequences prejudicial to the interests of the appellant, even though developments during the pendency of the appeal would otherwise render it moot. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Lamothe, </em>225 Conn. 757, 765, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>627 A.2d 367 (1993). In this case, the plaintiffs have filed a separate action in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain, in which they are claiming damages, including loss of profits, arising from the department\u2019s granting of license to Gorin to sell Mazdas. Because, as the parties agree, the outcome of that action may be substantially affected by our ruling on the present appeal, we conclude that there are collateral consequences sufficient to allow this court to retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c) provides: \u201cWithin forty-five days after mailing of the final decision under section 4-180 or, if there is no mailing, within forty-five days after personal delivery of the final decision under said section, a person appealing as provided in this section shall serve a copy of the appeal on the agency that rendered the final decision at its office or at the office of the attorney general in Hartford and file the appeal with the clerk of the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain or for the judicial district wherein the person appealing resides or, if that person is not a resident of this state, with the clerk of the court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain. Within that time, the person appealing shall also serve a copy of the appeal on each party listed in the final decision at the address shown in the decision, provided failure to make such service within forty-five days on parties other than the agency that rendered the final decision shall not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Service of the appeal shall be made by (1) United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, without the use of a sheriff or other officer, or (2) personal service by a proper officer or indifferent person making service in the same manner as complaints are served in ordinary civil actions.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> The Weston Street location is approximately eight miles from Crest\u2019s dealership in Newington and approximately seven miles from Morande\u2019s dealership in Manchester.

Morande adopts Crest\u2019s arguments and adds the argument that, even if the plaintiffs had actual notice of the decision, there was insufficient evidence to prove that they had actual notice of the <em>date </em>on which that decision had been mailed. We are not persuaded by Morande\u2019s subsidiary claim, which is disingenuous at best. Even if we were to decide that the decision did not become effective until received by the plaintiffs, the record is replete with evidence that the plaintiffs had notice of the decision on Friday, July 29, 1994, forty-seven days before the appeal was filed. Indeed, the plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they had actual notice as of July 29, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In addition to its aforementioned claims, Crest argues that the department\u2019s decision was never final because the department did not first render a proposed decision pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-179 and did not render its decision within ninety days pursuant to \u00a7 4-180 (a). These are claims the trial court would have considered if it had had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. Because these claims were neither addressed nor decided by the court below, however, they are not properly before this court. See <em>Connecticut Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>217 Conn. 371, 385, 585 A.2d 1216 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 81, 502 A.2d 388 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b470-8\"> At oral argument, the plaintiffs asserted that, because the strictures of \u00a7 4^180 (c) had not been followed, the decision was <em>never </em>final or effective and, thus, the statutory period in which to file an appeal never began to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>run, even after all parties had actual notice of the decision. The defendants point out that such an interpretation could lead to absurd results, such as the filing of an appeal six months or one year after the decision was mailed, even though all parties had actual notice of the decision. Indeed, if it were the case that the decision was never final, there would be the further absurd result that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of that decision to the Superior Court could never be timely or appropriate. See Practice Book \u00a7 4000; <em>Stroiney </em>v. <em>Crescent Lake Tax District, </em>197 Conn. 82, 86, 495 A.2d 1063 (1985) (lack of final judgment is jurisdictional defect; court must dismiss appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> The plaintiffs rely heavily on our decision last year in <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996). Their reliance is misplaced. In that case, we determined that General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) should be read as mandatory, not only because of the presence of the word \u201cshall\u201d but also because those statutes contained penalties for noncompliance. Furthermore, the extensive legislative history of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 and 46a-84 clearly indicated the intent of the legislature that the provisions be mandatory. Such is decidedly not the case with \u00a7 4-180 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b474-8\">MCDONALD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aev\">concurring. I concur in the result reached by the majority for the following reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The plaintiffs concede that they had actual notice of the decision of the department of motor vehicles (department) more than forty-five days before filing their appeals. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>court has held on numerous occasions that actual notice is sufficient to overcome potential defects in statutorily prescribed manners and forms of notice. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>R. N. Russell Welding, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 508, 512, 627 A.2d 1344 (1993); <em>Okee Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Grange Mutual Ins. Co., </em>225 Conn. 367, 375-78, 623 A.2d 483 (1993); <em>Jefferson Garden Associates </em>v. <em>Greene, 202 </em>Conn. 128, 138, 148-49, 520 A.2d 173 (1987); <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>195 Conn. 543, 549, 489 A.2d 368 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 4-180 (c) provides that a decision shall be delivered \u201cpersonally or by United States mail, certified or registered, postage prepaid, return receipt requested.\u201d The entire thrust of the statute is to ensure that the parties receive actual notice of the effective date of the decision, and the prescribed statutoiy requirements act to create testimonial or documentary evidence of the time of delivery. Since the plaintiffs had actual notice of the department\u2019s decision more than forty-five days before filing their appeals, they cannot complain that the agency failed to abide by the provisions of \u00a7 4-180 (c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
