The defendant claims that: (1) \u00a7 21a-278 (a) violates the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions and, therefore, his conviction of that offense should have been set aside; and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of possession of marijuana with intent to sell. We are not persuaded by either claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Pursuant to a search warrant, on February 21, 1992, state and local law enforcement officials executed a search of an apartment in Bridgeport that the defendant shared with Mary Dudac and Sean Lay.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the course of that search, the police seized a black duffel bag and a paper bag from a living room closet. Inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>these bags police found 6002 vials containing a substance that appeared to be crack cocaine. The contents of two of the vials were field-tested and showed a positive reaction for cocaine. The total weight of the contents of all the vials was 443.21 grams, or approximately 14.223 ounces.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Subsequently, fifteen of the 6002 vials were tested at the Connecticut department of health and addiction services. The contents were found to weigh a total of 1.07 grams, 0.92 grams of which was pure cocaine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The evidence officer who participated in the search, Detective Esther Ramos of the Bridgeport police department, testified that the cocaine was packaged in the vials for street sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">While searching the kitchen cabinets, a police officer found a metal tin that contained a plastic bag filled with a plant-like substance. Another, larger, plastic bag found with the tin contained twenty-five small \u201czip-lock\u201d bags containing a plant-like substance that appeared to be marijuana. The total weight of the zip-lock bags was 658 grams. Ramos conducted two field tests on the plant-like substance found in the kitchen, one at the apartment and the other at the police station. Both tests evidenced a positive reaction for marijuana. Ramos further testified that the marijuana had been packaged for street sale. A search of Dudac\u2019s clothing revealed additional marijuana. Although none of the marijuana itself was offered as evidence at trial,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> photographs of the tin container, the plastic bags and the plant-like material were presented as evidence by the state and testified to by Ramos.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The defendant\u2019s two housemates provided the police with statements that the black duffel bag belonged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the defendant. Additionally, Dudac testified at trial that she had seen the defendant place the duffel bag in the closet where it was later found by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Following his conviction of the three crimes with which he was charged, the defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> claiming, inter alia, that \u00a7 21a-278 (a) violates the state and federal equal protection and due process clauses because there is no rational basis for providing the same penalty for possession of one-half gram of free-base, or crack, cocaine as for possession of one ounce of powder cocaine. The trial court initially concluded that it lacked authority to rule on the defendant\u2019s motion but, at the defendant\u2019s insistence, allowed him to make an offer of proof in order to establish a record for appeal. The defendant offered the testimony of John Paul Morgan, a professor of pharmacology at the City University of New York Medical School. Morgan testified as to the differences, both physical and chemical, between cocaine in powder form and free-base cocaine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He stated that the essential difference between free-base and powder cocaine is that free-base cocaine volatilizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>at a much lower temperature than does powder and thus may be smoked. When asked about the different effects the various forms of cocaine might have on the human body, he replied that there was no essential difference but that any apparent difference in effect would be due to how the cocaine was \u201cdelivered.\u201d According to Morgan, cocaine that is injected or smoked has a more immediate effect than that which is inhaled or ingested. Consequently, a smaller dose may be more effective if injected or smoked than a larger dose that is snorted. In other words, a cocaine user who smoked the drug rather than snorted it could achieve a more rapid \u201chigh\u201d from a smaller, less expensive dose. Morgan suggested that this economic difference was a substantial factor in the popularity of cocaine in free-base form. He further stated that, in his opinion, there was no difference between the powder and free-base forms of cocaine in terms of their overall effect on the body and that the dangers associated with the use of either form were equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s offer of proof, the trial court stated that the defendant did not appear to have met his burden of proving the unconstitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt. Because, however, the issue had not been properly preserved, the trial court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the statute. This appeal followed. Further facts will be provided as warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly failed to set aside the judgment of conviction under \u00a7 2 la-278 (a) because that statute violates his equal protection rights under the state and federal constitutions. Specifically, he claims that there is no rational basis for the disparate sentencing provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>of \u00a7 21a-278 (a), which provides the same penalty for possession with intent to sell one-half gram of cocaine in free-base form as it does for possession with intent to sell one ounce or more of powder cocaine. In response, the state argues that: (1) this court should decline to decide the constitutional issue because it was improperly raised posttrial by way of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 902; (2) this court should refrain from deciding the constitutional issue because the defendant possessed more than 400 grams of crack cocaine, well over one ounce; and (3) if it does reach the merits, this court should uphold the constitutionality of \u00a7 2 la-278 (a) by following the overwhelming number of federal courts that have found a rational basis for federal legislation that provides disparate sentencing similar to that provided by \u00a7 2 la-278 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s failure to raise this issue prior to trial deprived him of the opportunity to raise the claim in posttrial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The disposition of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is controlled by Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 810,815 and 902. Section 815 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe following defenses or objections, if capable of determination without a trial of the general issue, shall, if made prior to trial, be raised by a motion to dismiss the information ... (8) Claim that the law defining the offense charged is unconstitutional . . . .\u201d Section 810 provides that the \u201c[fjailure by a party, at or within the time provided by these rules, to raise defenses or objections or to make requests that must be made prior to trial shall constitute a waiver thereof, but a judicial authority, for good cause shown, may grant relief from such waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>. . . .\u2019\u2019The defendant failed to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 21a-278 (a) by way of a motion to dismiss as required by \u00a7 815 (8). Without a demonstration of good cause for such failure, \u00a7 810 dictates that his claim that the statute is unconstitutional is waived. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 201-202, 479 A.2d 237 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The fact that the trial court allowed the defendant to call a witness does not constitute relief from the waiver. The trial court allowed the defendant to present Morgan\u2019s testimony solely as an offer of proof in support of the defendant\u2019s claim. Although the state cross-examined Morgan, and the defendant argued the merits of his position, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe issue under [\u00a7] 902 is not properly before the court. Therefore, the court does not have any need to rule on it. What I have allowed you to do is make an offer of proof that you can do with as you please. I did not want to deny that. After all, you brought this gentleman down from New York, and I saw no reason why this should not be done.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court never found, and indeed was never asked to find, that the defendant had demonstrated good cause for his failure timely to raise his claim pursuant to a motion to dismiss under \u00a7 815 (8). Consequently, pursuant to \u00a7 810, the claim was waived.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Moreover, because the purpose of a hearing on a \u00a7 902 motion for a new trial is to determine whether the court, in the course of the trial, committed error and thereby deprived the defendant of a fair trial, the trial court could not properly decide the issue before it. \u201cSection 902 contemplates <em>court error </em>of such magnitude as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial and in the use of the term \u2018shall grant the motion\u2019 mandates a new trial if such error exists. The trial court was never asked to rule on the [claim] asserted by the defendant in his postverdict motion for a new trial and therefore could not have committed an error based on the defendant\u2019s postverdict \u00a7 902 motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curley, </em>25 Conn. App. 318, 330, 595 A.2d 352, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 925, 598 A.2d 366 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 729-30, 535 A.2d 808 (1988). Because the defendant\u2019s claim did not allege an error made in the course of the trial, a motion for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 902 was not the proper vehicle by which to pursue the claim. Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 810, 815 and 902, the defendant\u2019s failure at the trial court level properly to raise and pursue the claim that \u00a7 21a-278 (a) is unconstitutional precludes further review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim on appeal is that the evidence presented at trial as to his possession of marijuana was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt under \u00a7 21a-277 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 257-58, 681 A.2d 922 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In this case, Ramos, the police officer in charge of seizing evidence discovered during the search, testified that the investigating officers who searched the kitchen had found a plant-like substance that she identified as marijuana. Ramos further testified that this substance was packaged as if for sale. In addition to this testimony, the state offered into evidence photographs of the kitchen, the cabinets and containers in which the plastic bags were found and the bags themselves. The defendant claims that because the plant-like substance itself was not offered into evidence, the jury reasonably and legally could not have found that the defendant possessed and intended to sell marijuana. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u201cWe do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Rather, we must defer to the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses based on its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991). This court cannot substitute its own judgment for that of the jury if there is sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>198 Conn. 424, 427, 503 A.2d 588 (1986).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mejia, </em>233 Conn. 215, 224, 658 A.2d 571 (1995). Ramos testified that she had served for nine years in the Bridgeport police department\u2019s drug unit. The jurors reasonably could have found that, on the basis of her experience and the results of the field tests, Ramos had correctly identified the plantlike substance found in the kitchen as marijuana packaged for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Despite the fact that Ramos\u2019 testimony about the field test directly followed her testimony as to the discovery of the marijuana in the kitchen, the defendant argues that there is nevertheless some question as to whether the material tested actually came from the kitchen or from Dudac\u2019s clothing. We are not persuaded. \u201cIn viewing evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the fact finder is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence, but may draw whatever inferences from the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>236 Conn. 514, 539, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (a) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of heroin, methadone or cocaine or an aggregate weight of one-half gram or more of cocaine in a free-base form or a substance containing five milligrams or more of lysergic acid diethylamide, except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not, at the time of such action, a drug-dependent person, shall be imprisoned for a minimum term of not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and, a maximum term of life imprisonment.

Indeed, he makes no excuse for the procedural default and briefs the issue as though the trial court had considered the claim on its merits. At oral argument, the defendant asked that we review the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). In tMs case, the trial court properly determined that Practice Book \u00a7 902 was confined to errors made in the course of the trial and that the motion for a new trial was not properly before the court. See our previous discussion of tMs matter. Although the defendant made an offer of proof, it was clear that the trial court did not invite the state to respond to the claim on the merits and offer its own expert evidence to support the sentencing distinction under attack. Consequently, the record is not adequate for review. Id., 240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\"> See footnote 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
