Harris, from the unauthorized practice of law. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment thereon in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the defendant had violated General Statutes \u00a7 51-88 by performing acts commonly understood to be the practice of law. It was undisputed that the defendant, who is not an attorney, ran an advertisement in the Hartford Courant, titled \u201cUncontested Pro se Divorce,\u201d in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>he represented that \u201cParalegals prepare all papers for your signing and step you through the self-help divorce.\u201d The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The defendant renews on appeal the challenges that he raised below to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person and to the merits of the judgment rendered by the trial court. The trial court, <em>Hon. Frances Allen, </em>state trial referee, considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s jurisdictional and constitutional challenges, and the trial court, <em>Norko, J., </em>considered and denied his motion to open the judgment and motion to vacate the judgment against him. Upon a careful review of the record and the briefs and arguments of the parties on appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be sustained. See <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>239 Conn. 251, 683 A.2d 1359 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\"> The defendant, filed a brief which rendered us no assistance and did not discuss the issues at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
