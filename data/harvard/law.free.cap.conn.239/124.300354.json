The plaintiffs sought permission from the commissioner to cut down the trees on the property, which is located within the stream channel encroachment lines along the Connecticut River, in order to make the land suitable for farming.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs requested a determination by the commissioner that their proposed land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>use was exempt from regulation by the department under \u00a7 22a-349 or, if not, that they were entitled to a permit under \u00a7 22a-342 authorizing them to clear-cut the fifty-five acres. The commissioner concluded that the exemption for agricultural or farming use established under \u00a7 22a-349 was not applicable to the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed clear-cutting and also denied their permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the ground that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claims because the commissioner\u2019s decision was not an appeal-able final decision under General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court rejected the defendants\u2019 jurisdictional argument, but concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without merit and, accordingly, dismissed their appeal. The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment of the trial court and the defendants have cross appealed from the denial of their motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Some of the facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal are set forth in our opinion in <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 577 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>A.2d 1017 (1990). \u201cThe plaintiffs own [approximately] two hundred acres of land in Cromwell bordering the Connecticut River. In 1988, the plaintiffs sought permits from the [commissioner], pursuant to \u00a7 22a-342, for permission to develop a portion of their land for a subdivision and golf course within the stream channel encroachment lines. On June 21, 1988, the commissioner granted the plaintiffs permission to develop a subdivision but denied with prejudice permission to construct a golf course. The construction of a golf course would have involved cutting the floodplain forest within the stream channel encroachment lines. The commissioner\u2019s decision stated, inter alia, that, since 1976, floodplain forests have been recognized as critical habitats and that this particular floodplain forest is a resource of \u2018special ecological significance, both in itself and through its function as a buffer to the adjacent Dead Man\u2019s Swamp, another critical habitat.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u201cOn July 5, 1988, the plaintiffs notified the commissioner that they intended to cut trees within the stream channel encroachment lines in order to expand their agricultural crop land. On July 8, 1988, the commissioner issued, ex parte, a cease and desist order, directing the plaintiffs to stop cutting trees because they had failed to apply for a permit as provided in \u00a7 22a-342.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u201cOn July 18 and 19,1988, a hearing was held, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> before a hearing officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>designated by the commissioner to determine whether the cease and desist order should be upheld. The Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc., intervened in support of the cease and desist order. On July 29,1988, the hearing officer issued a final decision upholding the order until the plaintiffs filed a permit application and [the department] had taken final action on it. From this decision, the plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183.\u201d Id., 618-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The trial court in that earlier case, sua sponte, dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. Id., 620. The plaintiffs appealed and we affirmed the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Thereafter, on August, 16,1990, the plaintiffs submitted to the commissioner the stream channel encroachment line permit application involved in this appeal. Attached to the completed application form was a three page cover letter addressed to Steven Derby, the supervising civil engineer of the inland waters resources division of the department, in which the plaintiffs<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> sought to \u201cclarify several points of fact to facilitate [the department\u2019s] review of [the] application\u201d and \u201cto define exactly what the legal obligations are of the [department] regarding [the] application.\u201d In particular, the plaintiffs indicated that they were seeking either a determination by the department that their intended land use was exempt from the permit process by virtue of \u00a7 22a-349 or, if the commissioner concluded otherwise, a permit under \u00a7 22a-342 allowing them to cut down and clear the trees on the fifty-five acre parcel so that they could use the land for farming.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Following a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application, the department hearing officer issued his proposed final decision in which he concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed clear-cutting of the fifty-five acre parcel of property \u201cwould be an obstruction or encroachment . . . within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-342 [because] [t]he record clearly indicate[d] that that activity could create flood hazards such as [\u00a7\u00a7 22a-342 through 22a-348] are meant to prevent.\u201d The hearing officer, however, \u201crecommended that the [Commissioner issue a [f]inal [decision . . . recognizing that the [applicants\u2019] proposed clearing of trees and growing of crops constitute an agricultural use for which they do not need to obtain a \u00a7 22a-342 permit because of \u00a7 22a-349, and (b) setting forth appropriate prohibitions on any non-essential, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>non-agricultural aspects of that activity that might have adverse flooding effects.\u201d Thereafter, the commissioner issued a final decision rejecting the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation. After reviewing the legislative history of \u00a7 22a-349 and noting that exemptions to this statute are to be strictly construed, the commissioner concluded that \u00a7 22a-349 exempts only those farming or agricultural uses that were in existence at the time of the establishment of the stream channel encroachment lines. The commissioner further concluded, however, that \u201c[e]ven assuming . . . that \u00a7 22a-349 exempts new as well as existing farming uses, the [plaintiffs\u2019] proposal remains subject to the permit requirement . . . because, while the cultivation of crops constitutes farming, clear-cutting [fifty-five] acres of forest to develop farmable land does not.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The commissioner then concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden of establishing that they were entitled to a permit under \u00a7 22a-342 and, accordingly, denied the plaintiffs\u2019 permit application.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The plaintiffs appealed from the decision of the commissioner to the trial court. The defendants moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the commissioner\u2019s decision was not a final decision in a contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>case<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and, therefore, was not appealable under \u00a7 4-183 (a). Specifically, the defendants claimed that the plaintiffs\u2019 request for permission to clear-cut their property was merely a permit application under \u00a7 22a-342 and that, because the hearing held on the plaintiffs\u2019 application was not statutorily required, the application did not give rise to a contested case. In response, the plaintiffs claimed that their request, although not so denoted, constituted a petition under \u00a7 4-176 (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> for a declaratory ruling by the commissioner that their proposed land use was exempt from the permit process and, moreover, that the commissioner had treated their request as such. The plaintiffs further claimed that their application for a permit under \u00a7 22a-342 was merely an adjunct to their request for a declaratory ruling and that they had filed the permit application in light of the possibility of an adverse ruling by the commissioner on the question of whether they were exempt from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>the permit process. The plaintiffs claim that because a declaratory ruling is an appealable \u201cfinal decision\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 4-183 (a) and 4-166 (3), the trial court had jurisdiction over their administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, concluding that the plaintiffs had requested, and the commissioner had issued, a declaratory ruling determining the applicability of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption to the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed land use. In so holding, the trial court stated that \u201c[although the plaintiff[s] did not state specifically that [the] August, 1990 letter to the [department was a petition for a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176, it was in essence, and unmistakably, just such a petition.\u201d The trial court noted, as evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 request constituted a petition for a declaratory ruling, that the commissioner, before acting upon the plaintiffs\u2019 permit application, had first determined the applicability of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption to the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed clear-cutting and, furthermore, that the defendants had not previously challenged the form or legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a determination by the commissioner under \u00a7 22a-342.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Upon consideration of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the trial court concluded that the record supported the commissioner\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed clear-cutting of their property was not an agricultural or farming use within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-349, and that the plaintiffs were, therefore, not exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 22a-342.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In accordance with this conclusion, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that they were not entitled to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>exemption from the \u00a7 22a-342 permit process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On the cross appeal, the defendants maintain that the trial court improperly failed to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with the trial court both that it had jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and that the commissioner reasonably determined that the plaintiffs were not entitled to an exemption from the permit process. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Because the defendants mount a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court, we must first address that claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As we have indicated, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ants contend that the trial court was required to grant their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the ground that the commissioner\u2019s decision was not an \u201cagency determination in a contested case\u201d under \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A); see footnote 6; but, rather, the denial of a permit application. The plaintiffs do not challenge the defendants\u2019 contention that their permit application did not give rise to a final decision under \u00a7 4-166 (3) (A). They maintain, instead, that they had also sought and obtained a declaratory ruling from the department on the applicability of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption to their proposed land use and, consequently, that the commissioner\u2019s decision is an appealable final decision under \u00a7 4-166 (3) (B) and \u00a7 4-183 (a). Our resolution of this issue, therefore, depends on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 submission constituted a petition for a declaratory ruling by the department on the applicability of \u00a7 22a-349 to their proposal to clear-cut, and then to farm, the fifty-five acre parcel of property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs\u2019 request constituted a petition for a declaratory ruling as to the applicability of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption and that the commissioner\u2019s decision constituted such a ruling. In both their formal submission and the accompanying cover letter, the plaintiffs expressly requested a decision from the commissioner as to whether their proposed use of the fifty-five acres was exempt from regulation by the department under \u00a7 22a-349. Such a request falls squarely within the purview of \u00a7 4-176 (a).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, a review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of the commissioner\u2019s written decision reveals that he considered the plaintiffs\u2019 request as comprising two separate and distinct components: the commissioner characterized the plaintiffs\u2019 request as \u201can application . . . for (1) a determination that a permit is not required under \u00a7 22a-342 to clear-cut and subsequently farm [fifty-five] acres of floodplain forest within the stream channel encroachment lines along the Connecticut River in Cromwell, or, in the alternative, (2) a permit under \u00a7 22a-342 for those activities.\u201d Indeed, the majority of the commissioner\u2019s decision is devoted to an analysis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of entitlement to an exemption under \u00a7 22a-349 and his reasons for rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The defendants contend that the record mandates a contrary conclusion. In particular, the defendants point out that neither the plaintiffs nor the commissioner complied strictly with the notice requirements that, at the time, related to declaratory rulings. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 22a-3a-l (c) (2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The defendants fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ther note that, if the plaintiffs had regarded their request as one for a declaratory ruling under \u00a7 4-176, they likely would have initiated a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court after the commissioner had failed to issue a ruling within 180 days of their filing, as was their right under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-175 (a) (3) and 4-176 (i).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The fact that the plaintiffs and the commissioner failed to comply with the notice requirements regar ding declaratory rulings is not dispositive of the jurisdictional issue.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Although the commissioner did not issue a notice of the hearing precisely as required by the terms of the regulation then in effect, he did cause notice to be published in the Hartford Courant and, in addition, notified several public officials of the hearing.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Moreover, the record does not reveal, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>defendants do not claim, that any interested person was prejudiced by the parties\u2019 failure to adhere strictly to the terms of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The defendants\u2019 argument regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to invoke \u00a7 4-175 (a) (3) is also unpersuasive. The defendants\u2019 assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, it was perfectly reasonable for the plaintiffs, rather than seeking a judicial determination regarding the applicability of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption immediately upon the expiration of the 180 day period following the date of their submission, to choose instead to await a decision by the commissioner. Thus, no inference regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 legal conception of their submission to the commissioner can fairly be drawn from the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to seek a declaratory judgment under \u00a7 4-175 (a) (3).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Because the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs sought and obtained a declaratory ruling by the commissioner regarding the applicability of \u00a7 22a-349 to their proposed land use, and because a declaratory ruling is an appealable final decision under \u00a7 4-183 (a), the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Accordingly, we now turn to the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The plaintiffs contend that the trial court improperly dismissed their appeal on its merits. They maintain instead that the commissioner improperly concluded that the clear-cutting of the plaintiffs\u2019 fifty-five acres of floodplain forest to make it suitable for farming is not an agricultural or farming use within the meaning of \u00a7 22a-349. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Section 22a-349 provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of sections 22a-342 to 22a-348, inclusive, shall not be deemed to restrict <em>agricultural or farming uses </em>of lands located within the stream channel encroachment lines including the building of fences, provided this section shall not apply to farm buildings and farm structures.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs claim that, because they intend to farm the fifty-five acre parcel, the clear-cutting necessary to effectuate that purpose must also be considered a farming or agricultural use and, consequently, that such clear-cutting is exempt from regulation under \u00a7 22a-349. The defendants, on the other hand, claim that razing the trees on fifty-five acres of forest land to make the property suitable for farming does not fall within the ambit of the \u00a7 22a-349 exemption. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u201cOur resolution of this issue is guided by the limited scope of judicial review afforded by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.; to the determinations made by an administrative agency. [W]e must decide, in view of all of the evidence, whether the agency, in issuing its order, acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or illegally, or abused its discretion. <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 397, 604 A.2d 351 (1992). Even as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 774, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988). Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law ... it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . <em>. Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986); see also <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 773-74; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 342-43, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse Commission </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>233 Conn. 28, 39, 657 A.2d 630 (1995); <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>228 Conn. 158, 164-65, 635 A.2d 783 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Furthermore, because our resolution of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim requires the application of a statutory provision, namely, \u00a7 22a-349, to a specific factual scenario, we are also guided by well established tenets of statutory interpretation. \u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>lature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Starr </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>236 Conn. 722, 737, 675 A.2d 430 (1996). \u201cIn seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>231 Conn. 77, 92, 646 A.2d 1308 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). Furthermore, in construing this statute, we are mindful that exemptions to statutes are to be strictly construed. <em>Conservation Commission </em>v. <em>Price, </em>193 Conn. 414, 424, 479 A.2d 187 (1984); <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 549, 441 A.2d 30 (1979). Finally, common sense must be used in statutory interpretation, and \u201ccourts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>229 Conn. 500, 515, 642 A.2d 709 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 320, 630 A.2d 593 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Applying these principles, we are persuaded, as was the trial court, that the commissioner reasonably concluded that the clear-cutting of the plaintiffs\u2019 fifty-five acres of floodplain forest in order to develop farmable land is not the type of land use that the legislature contemplated to be eligible for an exemption under \u00a7 22a-349. In reaching this conclusion, we look for guidance to General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (q), which defines the words \u201cagriculture\u201d and \u201cfarming\u201d to \u201cinclude cultivation of the soil, dairying, forestry, raising or harvesting any agricultural or horticultural commodity . . . the operation, management, conservation, improvement or maintenance of a farm ... or salvaging timber or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>cleared land of brush or other debris left by a storm, as an incident to such farming operations . . . the production or harvesting of . . . any agricultural commodity, including lumber, as an incident to ordinary farming operations . . . .\u201d We agree with the commissioner that the large-scale clear-cutting of forest land, undertaken solely to prepare the land for farming and otherwise unrelated to any agricultural endeavor, including forestry, is not of the same kind or character as the activities enumerated in \u00a7 1-1 (q). See <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>235 Conn. 448, 457, 668 A.2d 340 (1995). As the commissioner concluded in rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 22a-349, \u201c[t]he clear-cutting proposed [by the plaintiffs] is not \u2018forestry,\u2019 which, according to Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, is the \u2018science of developing, caring for, or cultivating forests\u2019 or the \u2018management of growing timber.\u2019 Nor is the clear-cutting a salvaging operation incidental to a farming operation. Nor does it involve harvesting or producing a tree-related agricultural commodity in the course of a farming operation. Indeed, the [plaintiffs] view the floodplain forest on their property not as an agricultural commodity<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> but as an <em>obstacle </em>to the production of agricultural commodities \u2014 an obstacle the [plaintiffs] seek to eliminate in order to allow them to commence the production of agricultural commodities, namely, hay and vegetables.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Furthermore, in light of the magnitude of the clear-cutting contemplated by the plaintiffs, it is apparent that their proposal, if effectuated, would drastically and permanently change the topography of their fifty-five acres of floodplain forest. While readying land to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>it suitable for farming may, in some circumstances, constitute a farming or agricultural use exempt from regulation under \u00a7 22a-349, a preparatory activity that changes the essential nature and character of the property does not.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In addition, the interpretation of \u00a7 22a-349 urged by the plaintiffs would, in effect, allow a property owner to circumvent the \u00a7 22a-342 permit process, without regard to ecological considerations, any time a landowner expressed an intention to convert his or her property to a farming or agricultural use. \u201c[T]he intent of the legislature is to be found not in an isolated phrase or sentence but, rather, from the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 226, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995); see also <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Garnett, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 90 (\u201c[i]n determining the meaning of a statute, [it] must be considered as a whole, with a view toward reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation [internal quotation marks omitted]\u201d). The statutory construction espoused by the plaintiffs would be inconsistent with the public policy, clearly enunciated in \u00a7 22a-342, against unreasonable encroachments on our floodplains and inland waterways.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Finally, a review of the relevant legislative history supports our conclusion that the commissioner\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. For example, in his remarks to the legislature concerning the scope of the exemption, Representative Rufus Allyn stated that \u201c[t]he establishment of stream channel encroachment lines in the Connecticut streams have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>left farmers who own farms or such land in a position of uncertainty regarding the future ability to use such land for its full farming potential. No assurances have ever been provided that they may continue to carry on <em>normal farming activities </em>without future restrictions. This Bill allows them to build fences and continue <em>other farming activities </em>on such land . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 18 H.R. Proc., Pt. 4, 1975 Sess., pp. 1914-15. This statement of legislative purpose is inconsistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the clear-cutting of fifty-five acres of floodplain forest to render it suitable for farming activities is itself an exempt farming or agricultural use under \u00a7 22a-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\"> The attorney general of the state of Connecticut, the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, the Cromwell Fish and Game Chib, the Connecticut River Watershed Council, Inc., and the Mattabeseck Audubon Society intervened in the administrative proceedings pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19, and also are defendants in this case.
