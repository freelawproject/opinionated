App. 645, 648-51, 666 A.2d 831 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The state charged the defendant, James Darden, with assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 and 53a-48 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>evidence before the jury that the assault had taken place in prison, where the defendant and another inmate repeatedly stabbed a fellow inmate with \u201cshanks,\u201d or prison-made knives. The two shanks and a paper bag in which they were found were destroyed before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Because the trial court did not conduct an <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, we do not have its findings of fact concerning the destruction of the evidence. There was evidence, however, that the victim delayed reporting the incident, during which time the items were discovered in a routine search of a cubicle adjoining the defendant\u2019s and the paper bag was discarded. There was also evidence that the shanks were destroyed pursuant to a court order when a codefendant\u2019s case was concluded. After defense counsel learned that the state had destroyed the two shanks and the paper bag, he filed a motion to dismiss the case and requested, in the alternative, an adverse jury instruction. The trial court denied the motion and refused to charge as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Following a guilty verdict and judgment of conviction, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, arguing, inter alia, that the trial court failed to find that the destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence violated his right to due process under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. While the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, we decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 657 A.2d 585 (1995), holding that in determining whether a defendant has been afforded due process of law under the Connecticut constitution, a court should \u201cemploy the <em>Asherman </em>balancing test, weighing the reasons for the unavailability of the evidence against the degree of prejudice to the accused.\u201d Id., 727. The Appellate Court held that because the trial court had not conducted the necessary balancing test, the judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Darden, </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 650-51. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and now reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The state argues that the Appellate Court improperly ordered a new trial. We agree. The Appellate Court reasoned that, given the circumstances, a remand for the purpose of performing the balancing test would have been inappropriate and, therefore, concluded that the only available remedy was a new trial. Id. We conclude that the Appellate Court should have remanded the case to the trial court for a full evidentiary hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s due process claim. The trial court could consider the evidence presented at trial as well as any additional evidence that the parties might present; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, 38 </em>Conn. App. 531, 536, 662 A.2d 150, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 906, 665 A.2d 903 (1995); and then decide if a remedy not afforded was required after balancing the <em>Asherman </em>factors. The <em>Asherman </em>factors include the \u201c \u2018materiality of the missing evidence, the likelihood of mistaken interpretation of [the evidence] by witnesses or the jury, the reason for its nonavailability to the defense and the prejudice to the defendant caused by the unavailability of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 727. The trial court could then properly decide if a new trial is required because of a violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the absence of a hearing, the <em>Asher</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>man </em>factors were not before the Appellate Court and are not before this court. It may be unnecessary and a waste of judicial resources to retry a defendant whose case may have already been resolved fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court to consider the defendant\u2019s due process claim by applying the appropriate balancing test in light of <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 707. The Appellate Court is directed to retain jurisdiction of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 724, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S.
