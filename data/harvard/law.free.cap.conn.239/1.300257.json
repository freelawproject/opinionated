The plaintiff, Cagiva North America, Inc. (Cagiva), a wholesale distributor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>of motorcycles, appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court denying its application to vacate or modify an arbitration award made under the Lemon Law in favor of the defendant, Edward Schenk, a motorcycle purchaser. Cagiva claims that the trial court improperly concluded that a motorcycle is a passenger motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 42-179.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree with Cagiva that a motorcycle is not a passenger motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 42-179 and, consequently, is not within the purview of the Lemon Law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The following facts and procedural histoiy are undisputed. Cagiva is the exclusive importer and wholesale distributor of Ducati motorcycles in the United States. On May 16, 1992, Schenk purchased a 1992 Ducati motorcycle from a dealer in Norwalk. Over the next several years, Schenk experienced repeated mechanical problems with his motorcycle. As a result, in 1995, Schenk initiated compulsory arbitration proceedings against Cagiva pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-181,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the Lemon Law arbitration procedure of the department of consumer protection (department). At the arbitration proceedings, Cagiva argued that claims regarding motorcycles are not covered by the Lemon Law and, therefore, that the department could not require Cagiva <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>to arbitrate Schenk\u2019s claim. The arbitration panel rejected this contention, and after a hearing, rendered a decision in favor of Schenk.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Cagiva filed an application with the trial court for an order vacating, correcting or modifying the arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>award. The department intervened as a party defendant pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 99<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 52-107.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the trial court, Cagiva renewed its claim that the Lemon Law does not cover motorcycles. Cagiva also claimed that certain of the arbitration panel\u2019s factual conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence. The trial court rejected all of Cagiva\u2019s legal and factual claims, and confirmed the arbitration award. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The Lemon Law is a remedial statute that protects purchasers of new passenger motor vehicles. It was designed to compel manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles to fulfill all express warranties made to consumers, and to facilitate a consumer\u2019s recovery against the manufacturer of a defective vehicle should a dispute arise.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Lemon Law directs that \u201c[i]f a new motor vehicle does not conform to all applicable express warranties, and the consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer . . . during the period of two years following the date of original delivery of the motor vehicle to a consumer or during the period of the first eighteen thousand miles of operation, whichever period ends first, the manufacturer . . . shall make such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>repairs as are necessary to conform the vehicle to such express warranties . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-179 (b). The Lemon Law also establishes an arbitration procedure, under the auspices of the department, that a consumer can invoke in the event of a dispute over these warranties with a motor vehicle manufacturer. General Statutes \u00a7 42-181. If the arbitration panel finds that the manufacturer has failed to meet its warranty obligations, the statute authorizes a variety of remedies, including a refund of the purchase price. General Statutes \u00a7 42-179 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Whether a motorcycle is a \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 (40) is a question of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This is a question of law over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 22, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. <em>In re Valerie D., </em>223 Conn. 492, 512, 613 A.2d 748 (1992); <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 459-60, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 431-32, 650 A.2d 557 (1994).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Meriden-Wallingford Hospital, </em>237 Conn. 259, 266, 676 A.2d 857 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>On appeal, Cagiva\u2019s primary claim is that the department lacks the authority under the Lemon Law to compel arbitration with regard to motorcycles, because a motorcycle is not a passenger motor vehicle as defined in \u00a7 42-179 and General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (59). Cagiva first claims that \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2) incorporates the current definition of passenger motor vehicle, namely that contained in \u00a7 14-1 (59). Cagiva notes that General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 42-179 was amended in 1993, subsequent to the 1990 changes in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1, and relies on the principle that \u201c[t]here is a presumption that the legislature, in enacting a law, did so in view of existing relevant statutes and intended it to be read with them so as to make one consistent body of law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Citrano </em>v. <em>Berkshire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 248, 255, 368 A.2d 54 (1976). Cagiva also asserts that the plain language of the current definition excludes motorcycles.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Finally, Cagiva argues that motorcycles are not covered under the Lemon Law even if \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2) incorporates the pre-1990 definition of passenger motor vehicle, because that definition is limited to the class of vehicles commonly known as \u201cautomobiles.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The department<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> does not contend that a motorcycle is a passenger motor vehicle under the definition con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tained in \u00a7 14-1 as amended in 1990. The department argues, instead, that the pre-1990 \u00a7 14-1 definition of passenger motor vehicle is still incorporated in \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2). The department relies on the proposition that \u201c[a]s a general rule, the . . . modification ... of a statutory provision adopted by another statute through incorporation by reference is inoperative so far as the adopting statute is concerned, in the absence of expressed or implied legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 498, 280 A.2d 351 (1971). The department further argues that the pre-1990 definition ought to be liberally construed, in light of the fact that the Lemon Law is a remedial statute. See <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 594-95, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989). Thus, the department argues, because the language of the pre-1990 definition, liberally construed, can be read to include motorcycles, consumers of motorcycles are protected by the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We conclude that the phrase \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d as originally defined in 1982, and retained until 1990; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 (40); refers only to automobiles and larger versions thereof and not motorcycles. Because the parties agree that motorcycles also do not satisfy the definition of passenger motor vehicle in effect in 1990,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we further conclude that a motorcycle is not a passenger motor vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and thus that a motorcycle is not a passenger motor vehicle for the purposes of the Lemon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>We begin our analysis with the language of \u00a7 42-179 and the pre-1990 definition of passenger motor vehicle in General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 (40). Section 42-179 (b) provides that the protections of the Lemon Law apply to \u201cnew motor vehicles.\u201d A \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purpose of the Lemon Law is defined in \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2) as <em>\u201ca passenger motor vehicle </em>or a <em>passenger and commercial motor vehicle, </em>as defined in section 14-1, which is sold or leased in this state.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 (40) defines a \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d as \u201ca motor vehicle which has a capacity of carrying not more than ten passengers, and which is designed and used for the purpose of transporting persons with their necessary personal belongings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We first note that the pre-1990 \u00a7 14-1 contains separate definitions for \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and \u201cpassenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>motor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Although the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is broad enough to include motorcycles,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the addition of the word \u201cpassenger\u201d in the phrase \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d suggests that the legislature meant something different, and to limit the scope of that phrase. We generally read statutes so that no word is \u201ctreated as superfluous, void or insignificant unless there are impelling reasons . . . why this principle cannot be followed.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Mulquin, </em>134 Conn. 118, 126, 55 A.2d 732 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Reading General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 as a whole strongly suggests that motorcycles are not \u201cpassenger motor vehicles.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> First, \u00a7 14-1 contains a distinct, explicit definition of \u201cmotorcycle.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Including motorcycles in the class of \u201cpassenger motor vehicles\u201d would, therefore, be redundant. Second, no definition in \u00a7 14-1 expressly refers only to automobiles. Yet the drafters of \u00a7 14-1 surely intended to be able to refer with specificity to this important predominant class of vehicles in the statute. The only definition in \u00a7 14-1 that implicitly fills this role is that of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle.\u201d Thus, if automobiles were not the exclusive category of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle,\u201d there would be no specific definition of an automobile in \u00a7 14-1, a rather bizarre circumstance. We do not ordinarily read statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tory language to work bizarre results. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>237 Conn. 81, 102, 675 A.2d 866 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Indeed, other motor vehicle statutes indicate that the legislature uses the phrase \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d to refer specifically to automobiles, while it uses the separate term \u201cmotorcycle\u201d when intending to refer to those vehicles. When construing a statute, we may look for guidance to other statutes relating to the same general subject matter, as the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law. <em>Vecca </em>v. <em>State, </em>29 Conn. App. 559, 564, 616 A.2d 823 (1992). For example, General Statutes \u00a7 14-49 (a) governs fees for \u201cpassenger motor vehicles,\u201d while \u00a7 14-49 (b) specifically governs fees for \u201cmotorcycles.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 14-100a (a), which governs safety belts, refers only to \u201cpassenger motor vehicles,\u201d providing that \u201c[n]o new passenger motor vehicle may be sold or registered in this state unless equipped with at least two sets of seat safety belts for the front and rear seats of the motor vehicle . . . \u201cPassenger motor vehicle\u201d logically must be read in context as referring only to automobiles, because motorcycles are not generally equipped, or required to be equipped, with seat belts. Thus, \u00a7 14-100\u00e1 (a) exemplifies a situation in which the legislature intended to refer specifically and exclusively to automobiles, and used the phrase \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The legislative history of the Lemon Law also supports our conclusion that the phrase \u201cpassenger motor vehicles\u201d covers only what are commonly thought of as automobiles, and larger versions thereof such as station wagons and vans, but not motorcycles. The definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle,\u201d as incorporated by the Lemon Law, must be read in fight of the purpose of the incorporating legislation. The legislative history of the Lemon Law indicates that it was designed to protect consumers of new automobiles and that, despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the arguably ambiguous language of the 1982 definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle,\u201d its language was not intended to be read literally so as to apply to all motor vehicles that could conceivably fit within it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">During the committee hearings on House Bill No. 5729, the bill that ultimately became the Lemon Law, Representative John J. Woodcock, the bill\u2019s sponsor, described its purpose as follows: \u201cThe legislative proposal before you fills a major gap in our consumer law . . . [b]ecause it will give our new <em>car </em>buying public relief from defective new <em>cars </em>.... What the bill does is establish a standard for when a reasonable number of repair attempts have been undertaken by a new <em>car </em>warrantor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, General Law, Pt. 2, 1982 Sess., p. 233. Indeed, all of the testimony before the committee regarding the proposed Lemon Law, including testimony from members of the general public, specifically involved defective cars. See generally id., pp. 232-311.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Woodcock later described the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. He explained that the law was intended to address the problem of \u201clemon <em>cars\u201d; </em>(emphasis added) 25 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1982 Sess., p. 3117; and that the bill was designed \u201cto strengthen the <em>new car </em>consumer\u2019s hand.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 3118. He noted that, \u201c[t]he rationale behind the lemon bill has been to improve and enhance the responsiveness an[d] accountability of <em>automobile </em>manufacturers to consumer complaints with defective new <em>cars.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 3161. \u201cThe lemon bill . . . givejs the] consumer rights against . . . the party responsible for the defective <em>car.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., p. 3123.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Woodcock also read into the record a number of consumer letters supporting the bill, all of which specifically described problems the writers had experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>with lemon <em>cars. </em>Id., pp. 3125-35. At no time during the House proceedings were motorcycles, or <em>any </em>vehicles other than cars, mentioned. Comments made on the floor of the Senate<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> further demonstrate that the Lemon Law was intended to protect only consumers of automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is true, as the department argues, that the Lemon Law is a remedial statute that ought to be read broadly in favor of those consumers whom the law is designed to protect. But a recitation of that general principle merely begs the question of <em>which </em>consumers the Lemon Law was, in fact, designed to protect. We agree that the law should be read broadly in favor of automobile consumers. Given the language, purpose, and legislative history of the Lemon Law, however, we are not persuaded that its remedial purpose is broad enough to include motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We conclude, therefore, that motorcycles are not passenger motor vehicles within the meaning of \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2) and General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 14-1 (40). Accordingly, we agree with Cagiva that the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">In this opinion PETERS, C. J., and CALLAHAN, NORCOTT, KATZ and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-179 provides in relevant part: \u201cNew motor vehicle warranties.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s narrow construction of Connecticut\u2019s Lemon Law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which excludes motorcycles from the statute\u2019s protection. In my view, this construction of the Lemon Law is contrary to the plain language of the statute and is inconsistent with its underlying policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">I begin my analysis by recognizing the remedial purpose of the Lemon Law. General Statutes \u00a7 42-179 (b) explicitly provides that the Lemon Law was enacted to provide effective remedies for consumers \u201c[i]f a <em>new motor vehicle </em>does not conform to all applicable express warranties . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 594, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989) (Lemon Law was enacted \u201cto provide for consumer purchasers of new motor vehicles an alternative to civil litigation\u201d). The court\u2019s analysis, however, fails to apply the long-standing canon of statutory construction: \u201c[Rjemedial statutes . . . are to be liberally construed in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit.\u201d <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. Brown, 164 Conn. 497, 503, 325 A.2d 228 (1973). Accordingly, the Lemon Law should be liberally construed to protect consumers who have purchased <em>new motor vehicles </em>that do not conform to their express warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The Lemon Law provides that \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d shall be defined as \u201ca passenger motor vehicle or a passenger and commercial motor vehicle as defined in section 14-1 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-179 (a) (2). Although the statutory definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d has been amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we are required to apply the defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>tion that existed in \u00a7 14-1 at the time the Lemon Law was enacted:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAs a general rule, the subsequent modification or repeal of a statutory provision adopted by another statute through incorporation by reference is inoperative so far as the adopting statute is concerned, in the absence of express or implied legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 248, 278 A.2d 766 (1971); see also <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>160 Conn. 492, 498, 280 A.2d 351 (1971); <em>Legat </em>v. <em>Adorno, </em>138 Conn. 134, 150, 83 A.2d 185 (1951); 2 J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th Ed. 1992) \u00a7 51.08. As early as 1838, the Supreme Court of the United States; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>United States, </em>37 U.S. 524, 624, 9 L. Ed. 1181 (1838); explained the rationale in support of this canon of construction: \u201cAnd such adoption has always been considered as referring to the law existing at the time of adoption; and no subsequent legislation has ever been supposed to affect it. And such must necessarily be the effect and operation of such adoption. No other rule would furnish any certainty as to what was the law; and would be adopting prospectively, all changes that might be made in the law.\u201d Thus, the definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d that was in existence in 1984, the year the Lemon Law was enacted, must govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u201cPassenger motor vehicle\u201d is specifically defined in General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 14-1 (35) as \u201ca motor vehicle having a capacity of carrying not more than ten passengers, designed and used for the purpose of transporting persons with their necessary personal belongings.\u201d Undoubtedly, a motorcycle is a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Additionally, it is beyond dispute that a motor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>cycle cannot carry more than ten passengers and is designed and used to transport persons along with their personal belongings. Consequently, as the plaintiff Cagiva North America, Inc., conceded both in the trial court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in its appellate brief to this court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> motorcycles fall within the purview of the pre-1990 definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Rather than apply the specific definition of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d set forth in \u00a7 14-1, the majority fabricates an argument that was never advanced by the plaintiff and that was never briefed by the parties. In an effort to exclude motorcycles from the purview of \u201cpassenger motor vehicle,\u201d the court searches \u00a7 14-1 for other definitions contained in that provision. In doing so, the majority concludes that a motorcycle is not a passenger motor vehicle within the meaning of the Lemon Law because motorcycles are separately defined within \u00a7 14-1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If \u00a7 14-1 defined terms solely for the purpose of the Lemon Law, a component of our consumer protection laws, it would be appropriate to consider this separate definition in our analysis. Section 14-1, however, is the definitional statute for chapter 246, which contains 390 separate statutes (not including subsections) regarding the registration, operation, taxation and design of motor vehicles, as well as the use of Connecticut\u2019s highways. The legislature could not have reasonably intended that we should define \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d by referencing any subsection other than the specific definition of the term. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the legislature commenced \u00a7 14-1 with an express qualifying preface: \u201cTerms used in this chapter shall be construed as follows . . . <em>unless the construction is inconsistent with the manifest intention of the general assembly </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d is clearly defined within \u00a7 14-1, we should restrict ourselves to that specific definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">More importantly, because the legislature has specifically defined \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 14-1, this court is bound to accept and apply that literal definition. It is a fundamental tenet that \u201c \u2018[w]hen legislation contains a specific definition, the courts are bound to accept that definition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986), quoting <em>International Business Machines Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134, 355 A.2d 236 (1974); <em>Toll Gate Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Milk Regulation Board, </em>148 Conn. 341, 347, 170 A.2d 883 (1961). If this court does otherwise, it exceeds its constitutional limitations by infringing on the legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Indeed, I am sure that the legislature will be surprised to learn, as a result of today\u2019s majority decision, that it never intended to protect under the Lemon Law consumers who purchased motorcycles. It defies reason to believe that the legislature, in adopting the Lemon Law, did not intend to protect all purchasers of consumer motor vehicles.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-179 through 42-186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-8\"> In 1990, \u00a7 14-1 was amended to define \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d as \u201ca motor vehicle used for private transportation of persons and their personal belongings, designed to carry occupants in comfort and safety, with not less than fifty per cent of the total area enclosed by the outermost body contour lines, excluding the area enclosing the engine, as seen in a plain view, utilized for designated seating positions and necessary legroom with a capacity of carrying not more than ten passengers including the operator thereof.\u201d Public Acts 1990, No. 90-263, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\"> The plaintiffs sole argument with respect to the inclusion of motorcycles within the protection of the Lemon Law focused on the statutory change to the definition enacted in 1990, which, as indicated, is contrary to our canons of construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\"> In the June 12, 1995 trial brief in support of its application to vacate, correct or modify the arbitration award and for an order to show cause, the plaintiff stated: \u201cObviously, a motorcycle would easily fit into [the 1984] definition [of passenger motor vehicle].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b43-10\"><em> </em>In its appellate brief, the plaintiff stated: \u201cArguably, a motorcycle could fit into [the 1984] definition [of passenger motor vehicle].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b43-11\"> I note that \u201ctruck\u201d is also separately defined in \u00a7 14-1, which, given the majority\u2019s analysis, raises the question of whether owners of pickup trucks are covered by the Lemon Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\"> \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended.\u201d <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 153, 460 A.2d 26 (1983) (\u201c \u2018there is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean\u2019 \u201d). In this case, common sense leads one to conclude that motorcycles were intended to be covered by the Lemon Law.
