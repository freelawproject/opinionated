The defendant, Judith S. Marks, the executrix of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>estate of the decedent, Frances Seraf\u00edn, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, the state of Connecticut, on its claim for full reimbursement against the entire estate. The defendant asserts that the plaintiffs claim is limited to 50 percent of the assets of the estate. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The facts are undisputed. During the lifetime of the decedent, the plaintiff, pursuant to the medical assistance program known as Medicaid, made public assistance payments on her behalf in the amount of approximately $131,000. The decedent died on September 8, 1994. She was predeceased by her son, John Seraf\u00edn, who had died intestate on March 23, 1993. The sole asset of his estate was a house, which passed to the estate of the decedent by virtue of the laws of intestacy. At the time of the decedent\u2019s death, the house was the sole asset of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Following the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff timely presented a claim to the defendant for the full amount of the public assistance payments that it had made. The defendant disallowed the claim, arguing that, pursuant to \u00a7 17b-94 (b), the plaintiff is entitled to only 50 percent of the estate as reimbursement. The plaintiff thereupon brought this action and moved for summary judgment. The trial court rendered summary judgment for the full amount of the plaintiffs claim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The defendant claims that the case is controlled by the provision of \u00a7 17b-94 (b) that, under certain circumstances, limits the state\u2019s reimbursement for public assistance payments to \u201cfifty per cent of the assets of the estate payable to the beneficiary or the amount of such assets equal to the amount of assistance paid, whichever is less . . . See footnote 4. The defendant argues that this provision applies in this case, based on the reference in \u00a7 17b-94 (b) to the provisions of \u201c17b-79 to 17b-103, inclusive,\u201d and the fact that, upon her son\u2019s death, title to the house vested in the decedent. The defendant thus asserts that the estate of the decedent should not be disadvantaged by the fact that she died, and that, therefore, the estate should be treated essentially the same as if the plaintiffs claim had been presented against the decedent during her lifetime. The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 17b-94 (b) applies only to living public assistance beneficiaries and that the claim is controlled by \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 and 17b-95. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We agree with the plaintiff that \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93,17b-94 and 17b-95 must be read together because they set out a general statutory scheme for reimbursement to the state for public assistance payments that the state has made to or for the benefit of public assistance beneficiaries. Section 17b-93 provides the general rule for reimbursement. Under that provision, subject to certain exceptions stated therein, if a public assistance beneficiary \u201chas or acquires property of any kind or interest in any property, estate or claim of any kind, the state of Connecticut shall have a claim . . . against such beneficiary for the full amount paid . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17b-93 (a). Thus, the general rule is that the state has a claim, for the full amount of its payments, against a public assistance beneficiary who \u201chas or acquires property of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Section 17b-95 provides another, more specific application of this general rule, namely, the case in which someone who at any time has been a public assistance beneficiary dies leaving an estate. Under that section, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, \u201cupon the death of any person who has <em>at any time </em>been a beneficiary of [public assistance] . . . the state shall have a claim against such . . . person\u2019s estate for all amounts paid on behalf of . . . such person . . . for which the state has not been reimbursed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17b-95. Thus, under this section, upon the death of a person who, at any time, was a public assistance beneficiary, the state may make a claim against that person\u2019s estate for the full amount of the public assistance payments made to or for the benefit of that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Section 17b-94 (b), upon which the defendant relies, provides one of the exceptions to the general rule of full reimbursement to the state. That subsection provides that, \u201c[i]n the case of an inheritance of an estate by a beneficiary of [public assistance] . . . <em>fifty per cent of the assets of the estate payable to the beneficiary or the amount of such assets equal to the amount of assistance paid, whichever is less, </em>shall be assignable to the state for payment of the amount due under section 17b-93.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 17b-94 (b). Thus, under this subsection, if a person who is receiving public assistance benefits inherits an estate from someone else, the lesser of one half of that inheritance or the amount of the public assistance benefits paid to the recipient is assignable by the beneficiary to the state toward the full amount reimbursable under \u00a7 17b-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Unlike the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 (a) and 17b-95, however, under which the state\u2019s claim against the public assistance beneficiary or his or her estate is for the full amount of the state\u2019s public assistance payments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the maximum amount assignable under \u00a7 17b-94 (b) may be for an amount considerably less than that full amount. The purpose of this provision is to encourage public assistance beneficiaries who inherit property from others to seek and accept that property. In the absence of such a provision, public assistance beneficiaries would in many cases have no incentive to obtain their inheritances, because in many cases the entire inheritance would be subject to the state\u2019s claim for full reimbursement under \u00a7 17b-93. In such cases, the public assistance beneficiaries who have inheritances coming to them would likely waive or forgo them because those inheritances would ultimately go to the state pursuant to the state\u2019s claims for full reimbursement. Under \u00a7 17b-94 (b), however, a public assistance beneficiary has incentive to take an inheritance, as he or she gets to retain the unassigned balance of that inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Concomitantly, this provision benefits the state. First, even while the public assistance beneficiary is alive, the state does receive up to 50 percent of the inheritance, whereas, if the beneficiary refused the inheritance, the state would receive nothing. Second, a public assistance beneficiary, by retaining the balance of his or her inheritance, may in many cases thereby become ineligible for continued public assistance due to applicable asset limitation rules. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 552, 680 A.2d 113 (1996); <em>Forsyth </em>v. Rowe, 226 Conn. 818, 823, 629 A.2d 379 (1993). In those cases, therefore, the state would save money by not having to continue to pay public assistance benefits. Thus, as the plaintiff argues, \u00a7 17b-94 (b) applies to living public assistance beneficiaries, because they are the persons to whom this calculus of incentives and benefits applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">This common sense reading of this statutory scheme is supported by the legislative genealogy and legislative history of \u00a7 17b-94. As originally enacted in 1969 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 17-83f, and until 1982, what is now \u00a7 17b-94 applied only to causes of action held by public assistance beneficiaries, and not to inheritances by such beneficiaries, and provided for reimbursement to the state for the full amount of the proceeds of any such cause of action. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) \u00a7 17-83f. In 1982, the statute was amended by adding a provision regarding inheritances by public assistance beneficiaries, and the same rule of full reimbursement to the state out of such inheritances was applied. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 17-83f. In 1984, the statute was again amended to reduce the amount of the state\u2019s lien against the proceeds of causes of action held by public assistance beneficiaries to the lesser of 50 percent thereof or the amount of assistance paid, but the amendment did not disturb the rule of full reimbursement out of inheritances by such beneficiaries. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 17-83f. The obvious purpose of reducing the amount of the state\u2019s lien on such proceeds and, thereby, affording some of the recovery to the public assistance beneficiary, was to give an incentive to the beneficiary to prosecute his or her cause of action, thus benefiting the beneficiary and, possibly, the state as well, as described previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In 1985, however, by enacting No. 85-564 of the 1985 Public Acts, the legislature inserted the 50 percent rule into the provision regarding <em>inheritances </em>by public assistance beneficiaries as well, thereby providing that such beneficiaries could retain at least 50 percent of their inheritances, just as they could retain at least 50 percent of the proceeds of their causes of action. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 17-83f. The legislative debate on the bill supports the inference we have drawn from the structure and genealogy of the statutory scheme, namely, that the purpose of the 50 percent rule is to give an otherwise absent incentive to public assistance beneficiaries to take their inheritances, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>benefiting both the beneficiaries and the state. See 28 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1985 Sess., p. 3527, remarks of Senator Joseph C. Markley; 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 31,1985 Sess., pp. 11401-11402, remarks of Representative James T. Fleming.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">This discussion leads us to conclude that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, \u00a7\u00a7 17b-93 and 17b-95 apply to the plaintiffs claim in this case, and that \u00a7 17b-94 (b) does not apply. The general rule of full reimbursement embodied in \u00a7 17b-93, as specifically applied to the estate of a deceased public assistance beneficiary under \u00a7 17b-95, governs the plaintiffs claim. We hold that the provisions of \u00a7 17b-94 (b) apply only to inheritances by living public assistance beneficiaries because they are the persons to whom the calculus of incentives contemplated by \u00a7 17b-94 (b) is aimed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Moreover, this does not, contrary to the suggestion of the defendant, disadvantage the estate of the decedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>simply because she died before the plaintiff asserted its claim. Had the decedent, or someone acting on her behalf, taken advantage of the 50 percent rule of \u00a7 17b-94 (b) before her death, and thereby retained the balance of her inheritance, her estate would nonetheless have been liable to the plaintiff under the provisions of \u00a7 17b-95 for that balance, or at least any unspent portion thereof, because under that section the state would have had a claim for the amount of public assistance payments \u201cfor which the state has not been reimbursed . . . .\u201d Also contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, this discussion of the statutory scheme does not depend on whether the decedent\u2019s inheritance consisted of real estate, personal property, or both. Thus, the fact that, as a formal matter, title to the house in question vested in the decedent at the death of her son, subject to the payment of just claims; see <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>186 Conn. 32, 42, 438 A.2d 1186 (1982); <em>Brill </em>v. <em>Ulrey, </em>159 Conn. 371, 375, 269 A.2d 262 (1970); is simply irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-93 (formerly \u00a7 17-83e) provides in relevant part: \u201cClaim of state for repayment of aid.
