We conclude that since the commission failed to establish that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d at the time of the enactment of the statute creating the Commission in 1971 was \"a term 'of art\u2019 in the health care field having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here,\u201d the statute provides no authority to the Commission to regulate the professional fees here under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">For a clear understanding of the issue currently before the Court we first refer to <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>283 Md. 677, 393 A.2d 181 (1978), <em>\"Holy Cross </em>I.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We opened that opinion by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">We are here involved as a matter of statutory construction with the question of whether fees charged by physicians in certain medical specialties to hospital patients, which fees are placed on hospital accounts and billed by the hospitals in such amounts to the patients, constitute a part of \"the total costs of the hospital\u201d so as to be considered as \"reasonably related to the total services offered by the hospital\u201d and thus whether the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (the Commission) is empowered to review and set charges by these physicians in the specialties of cardiology, pathology, and radiology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">The Commission was created by Chapter 627 of the Acts of 1971. Certain revisions have been made since that date. See Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol., 1978 Cum. Supp.) Art. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 568H-568Z. <em>[Id. </em>at 679-80.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">After public hearings relative to Holy Cross, the Commission on December 1, 1976, issued a proposed opinion and order in which it found \"that the salaries of the radiologists, pathologists and cardiologists [were] subject to [its] review as a part of [the Commission\u2019s] legislative charge to assure the public that total costs are reasonably related to total services provided.\u201d This was subsequently modified \"to read 'compensation\u2019 rather than 'salary\u2019 .. ..\u201d Holy Cross sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Certain physicians were permitted to intervene. Three issues were addressed by that court, (1) whether the Commission had jurisdiction to determine the rate charged by pathologists, radiologists, and cardiologists for their services rendered to patients of Holy Cross, (2) whether the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sion\u2019s restructuring of the rate schedules was so arbitrary and capricious as to deny the hospital and physicians due process of law, and (3) whether the Commission\u2019s action in excluding patient telephone charges from the basic room rate was arbitrary and capricious. The trial judge found for the Commission on the first and third issues but against it on the second issue. Hence, he reversed the order of the Commission and remanded the case to it for further proceedings. Since the circuit court\u2019s determination on the first issue was adverse to them, Holy Cross and the physicians appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted the writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">In <em>Holy Cross </em>I we pointed out that a number of contentions were made to us by the hospital and the physicians as to why the Commission might not do that which it sought to do. We focused, however, \"only on the question of whether the charges by these specialists are a part of 'the total costs of the hospital,\u2019 since if they [were] not there [was] no need to consider the other objections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>283 Md. 683. We examined the statute in question and reviewed our cases relative to statutory construction. We then pointed out that \"for the Commission to have the power it seeks it must be determined that the charges of these physicians constitute a part of 'the total costs of the hospital ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>283 Md. at 688. After examination of the definitions of the noun \"cost\u201d and the preposition \"of\u2019 appearing in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language (2d ed. unabr. 1959) we concluded that\" 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 means the Hospital\u2019s expenditures or outlays of money in connection with the operation of the Hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. We then determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">[O]n the record before \u00fcs we are unable to agree with the conclusion of the trial judge or the conclusion of the Commission that the fees charged by these pathologists, radiologists, and cardiologists are a part of the \"costs of the hospital,\u201d the term being used here in the sense of cost of operation of a hospital. On the other hand, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>rule out the possibility that at the time of the enactment of this statute the words \"total costs of the hospital\u201d might have been a term \"of art\u201d in the health care field having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here. Therefore, we think that the ca use of justice would be best served by a remand of this case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County under Maryland Rule 871 without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings in which the Commission would be afforded an opportunity to present evidence of such an understanding of the meaning of the term within the field of health care at the time this statute was enacted, if such testimony in fact is available. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, we point out that if the services here under consideration were not understood in the health care field as embraced within 'Total costs of the hospital\u201d at the time of the enactment of this statute, the Commission has exceeded the power vested in it by the General Assembly. <em>[Id. </em>at 689-90.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On the remand the trial judge heard about nine days of testimony and considered numerous exhibits. He issued a comprehensive opinion in which he concluded in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">2. The words \"total costs of the hospital\u201d as contained in the statute enacted in 1971 (Art. 43, \u00a7 568 U (a), Ann. Code of Md. 1957 Ed., 1980 Replacement Volume) constitute a term of art which at that time had a well understood meaning within the field of health care different from its common significance, and as such, included the professional fees of hospital based radiologists and pathologists.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">He went on, however, to direct the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">[T]o exclude from their cost review determination with respect to Holy Cross Hospital, the professional fees of those radiologists, pathologists and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>electrocardiologist which are billed to the patients directly by the physicians in question ... and are not carried as allowable costs on reports or the audited financial statement of the hospital for purposes of reimbursement by third-party payors, or for hospital accounting purposes ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The Commission appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to hearing in that court the Commission petitioned us for the writ of certiorari. Notwithstanding the provision of Maryland Rule 811 a 3 (d) that a petition for that writ shall contain \"[t]he questions presented for review,\u201d the Commission framed no question in its petition. It did \"contend[ ] that since the Circuit Court concluded that 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 was a term of art in the health care field at the time the Commission\u2019s statute was enacted which term included the fees of hospital-based radiologists and pathologists, it was error to conclude further that the direct billing of such fees would escape Commission jurisdiction.\u201d It further \"contended] that based on the finding of the Circuit Court, the Commission does have the jurisdiction to regulate the fees charged by hospital-based radiologists, pathologists and electrocardiologists to hospital patients, no matter how billed.\u201d The answer to the petition stated that if we determined to issue the writ \"the Physician Respondents w[ould] demonstrate that the Circuit Court did not err, as suggested by the Commission, in finding that the fees of the Physician Respondents were not subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, but rather in finding that the words 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 as contained in the Commission\u2019s enabling statute was a term of art having a well understood meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In this Court the Commission claims that \"[hjaving determined that 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 are subject to Commission jurisdiction, including the professional fees of hospital-based radiologists and pathologists, the lower court erred by concluding that these physicians could escape Commission jurisdiction by contracting with the hospital as to the manner of billing.\u201d Holy Cross and the physicians contend that \"[t]he circuit court erred in concluding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>statutory phrase 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 was a term of art in Maryland in 1971.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The Commission moved to strike that portion of the brief of Holy Cross and the physicians which deals with the latter point. Rule 813 b (1) is applicable. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">In cases pending in the Court of Special Appeals where no decision has been rendered by it, if the original petition for certiorari is filed by the appellant, this Court will ordinarily consider only the issues which have been raised in the petition and any cross petition and which have been preserved for appellate review, unless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This rule was extensively discussed in <em>Offutt v. Montgomery Co. Bd. of Ed., </em>285 Md. 557, 563-64, 404 A.2d 281 (1979), <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 501-04, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979), and <em>State v. Raithel, </em>285 Md. 478, 482,404 A.2d 264 (1979). We consider the contention of the Hospital and the physicians here to have been embraced within that portion of the Commission\u2019s petition which claimed \"that based on the finding of the Circuit Court, the Commission does have the jurisdiction to regulate the fees charged by hospital-based radiologists, pathologists and electrocardiologists to hospital patients, <em>no matter how billed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, as long as there is compliance with Rule 813 a, an appellee, without taking a cross-appeal, is entitled to argue as a ground for affirmance of a trial court judgment a matter that was resolved against the appellee at trial. <em>Offutt </em>n. 4 at 564, <em>St. Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. </em>v. <em>Amecom Div., </em>278 Md. 120, 123, n. 2, 360 A.2d 1 (1976), and <em>Capron v. Mandel, </em>250 Md. 255, 259, 241 A.2d 892 (1968). Hence, the motion to strike certain portions of the brief is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Since in our view the trial court erred in determining that the statutory phrase \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art in Maryland in 1971, we need not address the Commission\u2019s contention that the trial judged erred by directing the Commission \"to exclude from their cost review determination with respect to Holy Cross Hospital, the professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>fees of those radiologists, pathologists and electrocardiologist which are billed to the patients directly by the physicians in question ... and are not carried as allowable costs on reports or the audited financial statement of the hospital for purposes of reimbursement by third-party payors, or for hospital accounting purposes ...</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The term \"words of art\u201d is defined in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1439 (5th ed. 1979) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">The vocabulary or terminology of a particular art or science, and especially those expressions which are idiomatic or peculiar to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Further light is shed by 2A <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.31 (4th ed. C. Sands, 1973) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Although questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law which are decided by the judge instead of a jury and concerning which a court is not bound by the testimony of witnesses, the trade or commercial meaning of a term is treated as a fact to be proved in each case. Until such fact is proved, an alleged commercial or trade meaning of a common term is presumed to be the same as the common meaning. Futhermore, in order that an alleged trade or commerical meaning of a term shall prevail, it must appear that such commercial meaning is the result of established usage in commerce and trade, and that, at the time of the passage of the act, such usage was definite, uniform, and general, and not partial, local, or personal. There is no presumption that the trade or commercial meaning once established, continues. <em>[Id. </em>at 156.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">An example of a word as a term of art is found in an earlier generation when the word \"telephone\u201d had only recently appeared on the American scene and it was held in <em>Hockett v. State, </em>105 Ind. 250, 263, 5 N.E. 178 (1886), to be one of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On the remand the Commission presented <em>no </em>evidence that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was one of art. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>did produce numerous witnesses to testify that the phrase \"total costs of hospital services\u201d was a term of art.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At a pretrial conference counsel for Holy Cross and the physicians suggested the proper question to be decided but the Commission succeeded in persuading the trial judge to the contrary. Later in the trial, however, he did correctly focus on the issue, stating, \"I am dealing with a very narrow issue which has been sent back to me by the Court of Appeals and it revolves around this concept of <em>cost of the hospital </em>and not the philosophical decisions as between a physician and someone else.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Numerous witnesses produced by Holy Cross and the physicians testified that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was not a word of art within the health care field at the time the statute was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As previously indicated, in <em>Holy Cross </em>I we pointed out that since the term \" 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 means the Hospital\u2019s expenditures or outlays of money in connection with the operation of the Hospital,\u201d the Commission exceeded its power in attempting to control the fees or charges here and there involved <em>unless </em>\"the words 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 might have been a term 'of art\u2019 in the health care field having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here.\u201d It was for that reason and that reason only that in the interest of justice we invoked Maryland Rule 871 and remanded the case to the trial court without affirmance or reversal in order that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>might be afforded an opportunity to present evidence of such an understanding of the meaning of the term within the health care field at the time the statute was enacted \"if such testimony in fact is available.\u201d To avoid any possible misunderstanding we then went on to indicate that <em>unless </em>such fact were proven \"the Commission has exceeded the power vested in it by the General Assembly.\u201d It follows that under the terms of the remand that the extensive testimony adduced about \"total costs of hospital services\u201d as a term of art, various federal statutes concerning health care, methods used relative to reimbursement by insurers, the understanding by some people in the health care field of what the statute was intended to mean and the like were irrelevant and immaterial to the issues before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Since the Commission failed to prove that the words \"total costs of the hospital\u201d were a term of art so as to cause them to have a meaning in the statute different from the common, ordinary signification of the term, it follows that the Health Services Cost Review Commission exceeded its authority in the case at bar and its order must be reversed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The General Assembly is presumed to be fully familiar with the holdings of this Court. <em>Bingman v. State, </em>285 Md. 59, 65, 400 A.2d 765 (1979), and cases there cited. There have been two sessions of the General Assembly since our opinion was filed in <em>Holy Cross </em>I. Nevertheless, the General Assembly has not seen fit to change the statute.

As previously indicated, <em>Holy Cross </em>II concerned the attempt of Maryland Radiological Society and others to intervene after our remand in <em>Holy Cross </em>I.

Cognizance is taken of the dissent. We shall not prolong this opinion by writing a rebuttal to each and every proposition advanced by the dissent. We make but two comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The dissent would lead one to believe that it was not until \"7 January 1980, [that] the Commission, at long last, became aware .of the existence and full impact of the corrected opinion.\u201d We have already pointed out in the text of this opinion, \"At a pretrial conference counsel for Holy Cross and the physicians suggested the proper question to be decided but the Commission succeeded in persuading the trial judge to the contrary.\u201d As a matter of fact, the attorney for one of the intervening physicians called to the attention of the trial judge at that time that the word \"services\u201d was not in the statute in question and that this was the reason for the correction. The assistant Attorney General who was present representing the Commission acknowledged his cognizance of the corrected version which had been quoted in <em>Holy Cross II. </em>Had anyone been willing to pull from the shelf the appropriate volume of the <em>Maryland Reports </em>or the <em>Atlantic Reporter </em>the opinion in its proper form would have readily appeared, even had one looked at an \"advance sheet.\u201d This conference took place on October 5,1979. The dissent quotes, adding emphasis, the statement of the trial judge on December 18,1979, to the effect that he did not know by which opinion he was bound, the published, corrected opinion or the original one. Why, may one ask, would the Court have distributed corrected versions of the opinion if it were not that this corrected version was to bind the parties? Indeed, just what does the word \"correction\u201d mean? In common parlance the issuance of the correction slip would mean that the Court had detected an error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Despite the purpose of the remand the Commission simply elected to question its experts relative to \"total cost of hospital services\u201d as a term of art in the health care field, not \"total costs of the hospital.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>Davidson, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A95\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Before discussing the merits of this case, it is necessary to review its unfortunate procedural history that resulted in a deficient record that, in my view, has severely prejudiced the outcome. In <em>Holy Cross Hospital of Silver Spring, Inc. v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>283 Md. 677, 393 A.2d 181 (1978) <em>(Holy Cross I), </em>the question presented was whether the Health Services Cost Review Commission (Commission) had the authority to regulate the costs of services of pathologists, radiologists, and cardiologists (hospital-based physicians)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at Holy Cross Hospital (Hospital). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The evidence showed that these hospital-based physicians had a contract with the Hospital under which they were compensated on a fee-for-service basis with the Hospital billing the patients for the costs of their services, collecting payment from the patients, and then reimbursing the hospital-based physicians. The trial court held that the Commission had the authority to regulate the costs of services of hospital-based physicians when the hospital billed the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Court of Appeals disagreed. Focusing on the question whether the costs of services of hospital-based physicians were part of the \"total costs of the hospital,\u201d it held that the Commission had no authority to regulate the costs of these services because they were not part of the \"total costs of the hospital,\u201d a term that this Court defined as \"the Hospital\u2019s expenditures of money in connection with the operation of the Hospital.\u201d <em>Holy Cross </em>I, 283 Md. at 689, 393 A.2d at 187. In an opinion filed 6 November 1978 (original opinion), this Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\"[W]e do not rule out the possibility that at the time of the enactment of this statute the words <em>\u2019total costs of hospital </em>services\u2019 might have been a term 'of art\u2019 in the health care field having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here. Therefore, we think that the cause of justice would be best served by a remand of this case to the Circuit Court ... for further proceedings in which the Commission would be afforded an opportunity to present evidence of such an understanding of the meaning of the term within the field of health care at the time this statute was enacted, if such testimony in fact is available.\u201d [Slip op. at 12 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>In a correction filed 16 days later on 22 November 1978 (corrected opinion), the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was substituted for the term \"total costs of hospital services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZQO\">On 5 October 1979, a pretrial conference was held in order to define the issue and narrow the ra pe of the evidence to be admitted at trial. Despite the fact that by this time it should have been patently clear that the question presented was whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art, by some vagary neither the parties nor the trial court understood the full impact of the corrected opinion. The Hospital contended that the question presented was whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art. However, it did not rely upon the language of the corrected opinion. Instead, it relied upon the fact that in a quotation from <em>Holy Cross I </em>that appears in <em>Maryland Radiological Society, Inc. v. Health Services Cost Review Commission, </em>285 Md. 383, 389, 402 A.2d 907, 909 (1979) <em>(Holy Cross II), </em>the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was substituted for the term \"total costs of hospital services.\u201d The Commission argued that the correct term was \"total costs of hospital services,\u201d which appeared in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The trial court refused to limit the issue to the question whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\"I am going to listen to any witness that either of you want to produce, within reason. Now, if I don\u2019t agree with your definition of the issue, I am still going to listen to the witness ... I am not making any ruling at all today.... <em>This matter is a matter of extreme importance... </em>and if you think I am not going to listen to everything on this matter with that kind of an issue involved, you better have another think coming.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">After a final attempt by the Hospital \"to persuade [the trial court] to follow the Court of Appeals\u2019 language,\u201d the trial court responded, \"If I knew what they meant, I might follow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>On 8 October 1979, the trial on the merits began. Apparently still unaware of the corrected opinion, the Commission presented extensive testimony to prove that the term \"total costs of hospital services\u201d was a term of art. This evidence included detailed testimony as to the established usage and general practices concerning the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services in the health care field in 1971. On 11 October 1979, the Commission rested its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The Hospital moved for a directed verdict. The Hospital, quoting from the original opinion, pointed out that the Commission had been required to show that the term \"total costs of hospital services\u201d was a term of art. It argued that the Commission had failed to carry its burden of proof on this issue. The trial court denied the motion. Thus, at the time the Commission rested, the parties and the trial court were still unaware of the impact of the corrected opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">On 18 December 1979, when the trial resumed, the Hospital indicated to the trial court that it had become aware of the existence and full impact of the corrected opinion because a \"clerk doing some research in connection with this case ... came upon the reported [corrected] decision....\u201d The trial court stated that subsequent to the issuance of the original opinion, it had received corrections but that it had not been aware that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d had been substituted for the term \"total costs of hospital services.\u201d The trial court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">\"The only thing that I can suggest to you to do is to take it up with the Court of Appeals because I am bound by \u2014 well, <em>I don\u2019t know which I am bound by, actually, either the published </em>[the corrected opinion] <em>or this one </em>[the original opinion].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">I suggest that you gentlemen confer with the Court of Appeals and find out what they meant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\"><em>Now I am going to proceed on the assumption that we have been trying this case on right along, </em>and we will continue on that assumption and if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>gets </em>changed, well, it gets changed. But you might point out when you do refer this matter to the Court of Appeals that <em>we have four days of trial on the assumption that the word \u2019services\u2019 is in the opinion.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Thus, as late as 18 December 1979, although the trial court knew of the existence of the corrected opinion, it was still unaware of its impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The hospital proceeded to present its case. It presented evidence to show that neither the term \"total costs of hospital services\u201d nor \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art. It argued that physicians\u2019 services and hospital services were different; that a physician service could never be a hospital service; and that the costs of hospital services were part of the total costs of the hospital but that the costs of physicians\u2019 services were not. It contended that nonsalaried hospital-based physicians performed physicians\u2019 services, not hospital services, and, consequently, that the costs of nonsalaried hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were not a part of either the \"total costs of hospital services\u201d or the \"total costs of the hospital.\u201d However, while the Hospital insisted that salaried hospital-based physicians also performed physician services, not hospital services, it, nonetheless, conceded that the costs of salaried hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were a part of the total costs of the hospital. The only reasons offered to explain this illogical conclusion were that a physician service could never be a hospital service and, therefore, a part of the total costs of the hospital because \"a hospital certainly cannot practice medicine\u201d but that, nevertheless, the costs of salaried hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were part of the total costs of the hospital because such hospital-based physicians are \"on the payroll.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">On 7 January 1980, during the Hospital\u2019s presentation, the trial court indicated that it had received clarification of the issue from the Clerk of the Court of Appeals, who told it that the corrected opinion was \"the accurate one.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\"[T]he phrase which is to be used is 'cost of the hospital\u2019 not 'cost of hospital services\u2019 <em>which is a little bit different from what we all thought for a while. </em>And, what the effect of this may be on the outcome, I have no way of knowing at this time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Thus, on 7 January 1980, the Commission, at long last, became aware of the existence and full impact of the corrected opinion. As a result of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the Commission understood for the first time that it had been required to show that the term \"total costs of the hospital,\u201d and not the term \"total costs of hospital services,\u201d was a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On 22 January 1980, the Commission presented rebuttal evidence. It began a line of questioning that, in my view, was designed to elicit an opinion from an expert as to whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art that included the costs of services of hospital-based physicians. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\"Q. [COUNSEL FOR COMMISSION]: [D]o you have an opinion as to whether or not the term 'total cost of the hospital\u2019 includes radiologists and pathologists who are hospital-based physicians?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">[COUNSEL FOR HOSPITAL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">THE COURT: That will be sustained. That is not rebuttal. You should have brought him in the principal case if you wanted to get his opinion on it. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">[COUNSEL FOR COMMISSION]: Well, Your Honor \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">THE COURT: I have sustained the objection. All right, go ahead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Thus, the trial court, which had steadfastly refused to rule that the question presented was whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art until after the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>mission had presented its entire case, prevented the Commission from offering evidence on that critical issue during rebuttal. As a result, despite the trial court\u2019s awareness that because the Commission represented the public interest, this case was a \"matter of extreme importance,\u201d it, nonetheless, caused an unfortunate deficiency in the record that, in my view, has severely prejudiced the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Notwithstanding the deficiency of the record in this respect, the trial court found, based upon evidence of established usage and general practices in the health care field in 1971, that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art with respect to the costs of services of hospital-based physicians. It concluded that the Commission had the authority to regulate the costs of services of hospital-based physicians when the hospital billed patients, but not when the hospital-based physicians billed patients directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Based upon the deficient record before it, the majority here <em>(Holy Cross </em>III) disagrees. It finds that there is \"no evidence that the term 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 was one of art\u201d (emphasis in original) and, therefore, that the Commission lacks the authority to regulate the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services whether billed by the hospital or by the hospital-based physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Even if I agreed with the majority that there was \"no evidence that the term 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 was one of art\u201d (emphasis in original), I would not, on the basis of the deficient record here, conclude that the Commission lacks the authority to regulate such costs. I would instead remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings to afford the Commission the opportunity that was denied by the trial court during the trial on remand from <em>Holy Cross I </em>to present evidence of the understanding of the meaning of the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d in the health care field in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">However, despite the deficient record, I, unlike the majority, agree with the trial court that there was sufficient evidence to show that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>a term of art. I disagree with the trial court that the Commission lacks the authority to regulate the costs of services of hospital-based physicians who bill patients directly. In my view, the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d included the costs of services of all hospital-based physicians whether billed by the hospital or by the hospital-based physicians. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), Art. 43, \u00a7 568H, effective 1 July 1971, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\"In creating the Health Services Cost Review Commission, the intent of the Maryland General Assembly shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">(2) From and after July 1, 1974, an additional responsibility of this Commission is to <em>assure all purchasers of health care hospital services that the total costs of the hospital are reasonably related to the total services offered by the hospital; </em>that the hospital\u2019s aggregate rates are set in reasonable relationship to the hospital\u2019s aggregate costs; and that rates are set equitably among all purchasers of services without due discrimination.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Section 568U (b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\"(b) In order to properly discharge these obligations, the Commission shall have full power to review and approve the reasonableness of rates established or requested by any hospital subject to the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">This Court has recognized that the Commission was created for the purpose of protecting patients by \"assuring the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>sonableness of rates set by hospitals.\u201d <em>Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n v. Franklin Square Hosp., </em>280 Md. 233, 234-35, 372 A.2d 1051, 1052 (1977). More particularly, this Court has stated that \"the provisions of the Act reflect the legislative intent that the Commission have broad authority over the financial affairs o\u00ed hospital;/\u2019 in order to effectuate tl* \u25a0 ,ct\u2019s purpose of protet i pr- its by \"insuring] that rate;, charged to patients iicdect iamy the cost of care provided the patients.\u201d <em>Blue Cross of Md., Inc. v.

State, </em>288 Md. 579, 589, 420 A.2d 261, 266 (1380); <em>James </em>v. <em>Prince George\u2019s County, Md., </em>288 Md. 315, 335, 418 4.2d 1173, 1184 (1980); 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 60.01-02 (4th ed. C. Sands 1974), the majority here uses a narrow, rigid, and formalistic approach in interpreting the term \"total costs of the hospital.\u201d Initially, it determines that the terms \"total costs of hospital services\u201d and \"total costs of the hospital\u201d were not interrelated and were different in meaning. It then concedes that the Commission produced \"numerous witnesses to testify that the phrase 'total cost of hospital services\u2019 was a term of art.\u201d However, it determines that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was not a term of art because \"the Commission presented <em>no </em>evidence that the term 'total costs of the hospital\u201d was one of art.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Throughout this litigation the phrase \"term of art\u201d has been defined in various ways. Initially, in <em>Holy Cross I, </em>283 Md. at 689-90, 393 A.2d at 187, this Court stated \"that at the time of the enactment of this statute the words 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 might have been a term 'of art\u2019 in the health care field having a <em>well understood meaning different from its common signification\u201d </em>which the Court defined as \"the <em>Hospital\u2019s expenditures or outlays of money </em>in connection with the operation of the Hospital.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Court remanded the case to the Circuit Court to afford the Commission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\"an opportunity to present evidence of such an understanding of the meaning of the term within the field of health care at the time this statute was enacted....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Finally, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\"In order that there may be no misunderstanding, we point out that if the services here under consideration <em>were not understood in the health care field </em>as embraced within 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 at the time of the enactment of this statute, the Commission has exceeded the power vested in it by the General Assembly.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Thus, <em>Holy Cross I </em>establishes that on remand the Commission was to adduce evidence to show what professionals in the health care field generally understood the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d to have meant in 1971, the time of the enactment of the statute. The Commission was not required to adduce evidence comprised of explicit, conclusionary statements by such professionals, whose training and experience do not necessarily qualify them to draw a conclusion whether the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d constituted a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">On remand, the Hospital, when questioning various witnesses, repeatedly defined the phrase \"term of art\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\"a word or phrase which has a particular meaning within a given industry or profession which it would not have to the ordinary person not a member of that industry or profession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Thus, the Hospital also recognized that conclusionary statements that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art were insufficient and that it was necessary to adduce evidence to show what professionals in the health care field understood that term to mean in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Finally, in <em>Holy Cross III, </em>the majority, in defining the phrase \"term of art,\u201d quotes from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary and from 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.31 (4th ed. C. Sands, 1973), the latter of which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>\"[I]n order that an alleged trade or commercial meaning of a term shall prevail, it must appear that such commercial meaning is the result of <em>established usage </em>in commerce and trade, and that, at the time of the passage of the act, such usage was definite, uniform, and general, and not partial, local, or personal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Thus, the majority recognizes that in order to establish that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art, the Commission was required to show the \"established usage\u201d or, in other words, the general practices that existed in the health care field at the time of the enactment of the statute. Such evidence, rather than some ritualized litany, would have demonstrated what professionals in the health care field understood the term to mean. Nevertheless, the majority fails to take into account any of the extensive evidence presented to show the established usage and general practices that existed in the health care field in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">1 disagree with the majority that the terms \"total costs of hospital services\u201d and \"total costs of the hospital\u201d were not interrelated and had different meanings. There is uncontradicted evidence to show that all \"costs of hospital services\u201d were part of the \"total costs of the hospital.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Therefore, I would take into account all the evidence produced by the \"numerous witnesses\u201d who testified \"that the phrase 'total costs of hospital services\u2019 was a term of art.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In addition, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s finding that there is \"no evidence that the term 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 was one of art.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The record shows that there was at least one witness who made an explicit, conclusionary statement that the term was a term of art<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and another whose testimony inferentially supports that conclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the record abounds with evidence that shows the established usage and general practices in the health care field in 1971, and, therefore, the understanding of professionals in that field at that time. All of this evidence is more than sufficient to show that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Distinguished physicians, hospital administrators, health care educators, third party payors, hospital cost analysis experts, and accountants testified as to established usage and general practices in the health care field in 1971.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They initially pointed out that the relationship of hospital-based physicians to hospitals was unlike that of other members of the medical profession. The services of hospital-based physicians had historically and consistently been required in order for a hospital to be accredited and licensed. Hospital-based physicians generally practiced under a contractual arrangement with the hospital that, in essence, created a monopoly. Ordinarily, all hospital patients received the services of hospital-based physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">As a result of these differences, hospitals had traditionally and consistently compensated hospital-based physicians differently from other physicians. Throughout the 1960s, hospital-based physicians were compensated by either a salary, a percentage of the gross or net departmental revenue, or a fee-for-service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Most hospitals traditionally billed patients for the costs of services of both salaried and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>nonsalaried hospital-based physicians, although in a few hospitals, hospital-based physicians billed patients directly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Many of the experts testified that traditionally hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were a part of hospital services and, therefore, the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were consistently and traditionally treated as part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> More particularly, these experts further testified that traditionally the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were part of the total costs of the hospital whether the hospital-based physicians were compensated by a salary, a percentage of the departmental income, or a fee-for-service <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and whether the hospital billed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the patients for the services or the hospital-based physicians billed the patients directly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">There was other evidence to show that as a matter of established usage and general practices, the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were a part of the total costs of the hospital. Statistical data and studies established that hospitals traditionally billed patients for the costs of services of both salaried and nonsalaried hospital-based physicians <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and treated the costs of those services as part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accounting standards estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>lished by the American Association of Hospitals indicated that the costs of services of both salaried and nonsalaried hospital-based physicians should be treated as part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In addition, third party payors traditionally included the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services as part of the total costs of the hospital. Thus, Blue Cross, which reimbursed only for hospital costs, and not for the costs of physicians\u2019 services, took the costs of services of salaried and nonsalaried hospital-based physicians into account in determining its premium rates<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and until 1972, paid the costs of such services<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> whether billed by the hospital or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the hospital-based physicians.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The United States Congress recognized that in the late 1960!s the established usage and general practices in the health care field were to treat the costs of services of salaried or nonsalaried hospital-based physieinns as part of the total costs of the hospital. Before the enactment of the Social Security Act of 1965 (Medicare Act), Title XVIII, Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (codified in scattered sections of 26, 42 &amp; 45 U.S.C. (1976)), the costs of services of hospital-based physicians were reimbursed by insurers of the payment of the costs of the hospital (such as Blue Cross), whereas the costs of services of all other physicians were reimbursed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>insurers of the payment of the costs of physicians\u2019 services (such as Blue Shield). When the Medicare Act was enacted in 1965, it provided that the costs of services of hospital-based physicians, like those of all other physicians, were required to be reimbursed by insurers of the payment of the costs of physicians\u2019 services (such as Blue Shield). Because this requirement was contrary to the established usage and general practices in the health care field, confusion concerning reimbursement ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">In 1968, the Medicare Act was amended by the Social Security Amendments of 1968, Title XVIII, Pub. L. No. 90-248, 81 Stat. 821 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13951 (a) (1) (B) (1976)).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The purpose of that amendment was to conform the methods by which hospital-based physicians were reimbursed under the Act to the methods by which they were reimbursed under established usage and general practices. One result of the amendment was that, unlike the costs of services of other physicians, the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were accounted for as if they were hospital services and, therefore, part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the costs of these services were reimbursed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>insurers of the payments of the costs of the hospital (such as Blue Cross). Another result was that the costs of hospital-based physicians, like other costs of the hospital, were 100 percent reimbursable, while the costs of the services of all other physicians remained 80 percent reimbursable.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Such reimbursement was allowed to both salaried and nonsalaried hospital-based physicians<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> whether the hospital or the hospital-based physicians billed for the costs of their services.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Finally, statistical data and studies on health care costs, utilized and relied upon by various United States Government agencies working in the health care field, established that the costs of hospital-based physicians\u2019 services were part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In addition to all of the evidence adduced to show that in 1971 in the health care field the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d included the costs of services of hospital-based phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>sicians including those who billed patients directly, there was also evidence to show that at that time the well-understood meaning of the term was different from its \"common signification\u201d as \"Hospital expenditures or outlays of money in connection with the operation of the Hospital.\u201d Witnesses representing a variety of health care professions testified that in 1971 in the health care field the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was not generally understood as being confined to the ordinary accounting notion of cost as an expense or an outlay of money.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, those professionals said that it was generally understood that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d referred to the costs traditionally and customarily paid to the hospital by patients as part of the costs of hospitalization.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> More particularly, one witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>specifically testified that the costs of services of hospital-based physicians who billed patients directly, while not \"accounting\u201d costs, nonetheless, traditionally were included as part of the total costs of the hospital,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> while three others testified that the costs of services of hospital-based physicians who billed patients directly traditionally were included as part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>All of this evidence overwhelmingly establishes that in 1971 in the health care field it was a virtually universal practice to include the costs of services of salaried or nonsalaried hospital-based physicians whether billed by the hospital or the hospital-based physicians as part of the total costs of the hospital. I recognize that there was some evidence to show that in the few hospitals in which hospital-based physicians billed patients directly, the costs of their services were not considered to be part of the total costs of the hospital.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> At best, this evidence showed a relatively minor deviation from the established usage and general practices that was not sufficiently significant to support the conclusion that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d did not have a well-understood meaning. In my view, a term can have a well-understood meaning within a field even when there are relatively minor deviations from what is otherwise a virtually universal practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">I further recognize that there was some evidence to show that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d had different meanings to different people within the health care field. When viewed in context, most of this testimony, in my view, established that some hospital-based physicians and some accountants understood that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d did not include the costs of services of hospital-based physicians.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> At best, this evidence showed a relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>minor deviation from the general understanding of the term that was not sufficiently significant to support the conclusion that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d did not have a well-understood meaning. In my view, a term can have a well-understood meaning within a field even when there are relatively minor deviations from what is otherwise a virtually uniformly accepted meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Here, the established usage and general practices, as well as the uniformly accepted meaning of the term, were so extensive and pervasive and so permeated the field that there can be no question that in 1971 the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d had a well-understood meaning within the health care field that included the costs of services of all hospital-based physicians. In addition, there was more than enough evidence to show that the well-understood meaning of the term was different from its common signification.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The record here establishes that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art in the health care field in 1971. Thus, the Legislature intended the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d to include the costs of services of salaried or nonsalaried hospital-based physicians whether billed by the hospital or by the hospital-based physicians. Such a construction is consonant \"with the legislative intent that the Commission have broad authority over the financial affairs of hospitals.\u201d <em>Blue Cross of Md., Inc., </em>277 Md. at 109, 352 A.2d at 809. It is also consonant with the beneficent purpose of the Act which is to protect patients \"by assuring the reasonableness of rates set by hospitals.\u201d <em>Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n v. Franklin Square Hosp., </em>280 Md. at 234-35, 372 A.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The majority\u2019s holding in <em>Holy Cross III </em>is contrary to the purpose of the Act. The majority, in essence, establishes a principle that in the absence of more than one explicit, conclusionary statement that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art, overwhelming evidence of a virtually universal practice and a virtually uniformly accepted meaning is insufficient to establish that that term was a term of art. The practical result is the total deregulation of the costs of services of all hospital-based physicians, which presently represent approximately 20 percent of the total costs of the hospital. In addition, the application of this principle to other hospital-based professionals such as nurses, pharmacists, and dieticians (other hospital-based professional) may well result in the deregulation of a large proportion of the total costs of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">I recognize that in dicta in <em>Holy Cross I, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\"Some expenses of it patient\u2019s hospital stay traditionally have been included in the bill submitted to the patient by a hospital. For that reason, these expenses would come within the term 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 as those words are commonly understood, even if there were to be an attempt on the part of any hospital to enter into an independent contract for those services to be supplied through such hospital to its patients. For instance, it is known that some hospitals today contract with independent catering firms to supply meal services to hospital patients. We <em>do not think for one instant that it would be possible to remove meal costs from 'total costs of the hospital\u2019 so that hospitals might bill patients separately for meals, based upon charges to them of the caterer, and thus to remove such costs from the control of the Commission.\u201d [Holy Cross I, </em>283 Md. at 689, 393 A.2d at 187 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">However, the majority\u2019s holding in <em>Holy Cross III </em>casts doubt upon the continued viability of this concept. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>result of its holding here, the question whether the Commission has authority to regulate other hospital-based professionals remains open with its resolution dependent upon proof that in 1971 in the health care field the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art that included the costs of the services of other hospital-based professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">It is conceivable that in the future some other hospital-based professionals might seek to become deregulated by charging a fee-for-service and having the hospital bill, or by billing directly for these services.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There, as here, by some vagary, only one expert might happen to make the explicit, conclusionary statement that the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d was a term of art that included costs of services of other hospital-based professionals in 1971 in the health care field. There, as here, ample evidence might be adduced to show a virtually universal practice in which hospitals billed for the services of such hospital-based professionals in 1971. There, as here, there might be ample evidence of a virtually uniformly accepted meaning of the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d as including the costs of services of such hospital-based professionals. There, as here, there might be ample evidence to show that the well-understood meaning of the term was different from its common signification.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Nevertheless, under the principle established by the majority here, the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d would not be held to be a term of art with respect to the services of such hospital-based professionals. The ultimate result of such a holding would be that the Commission would be deprived of the authority to regulate the costs of services of other hospital-based professionals. The practical effect of such a holding would be that the Commission would lose the authority to regulate most of the total costs of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Similarly, the trial court\u2019s holding that the Commission lacks the authority to regulate the costs of services of hospital-based physicians who bill patients directly is contrary to the purpose of the Act. The trial court, in essence, develops a principle that hospital-based physicians may avoid regulation of the costs of their services by electing to bill patients directly. This principle, which makes the Commission\u2019s authority to regulate depend upon the method by which hospital-based professionals elect to bill, \"would elevate mere form over substance,\u201d <em>Blue Cross of Md., Inc., </em>277 Md. at 106, 352 A.2d at 806, and could well result in the total deregulation of the costs of services of all hospital-based physicians. In addition, the application of this principle to other hospital-based professionals may well result in the deregulation of a large proportion of the total costs of the hospital if such professionals elect to bill directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">On the basis of the record before me, I find no reason and do not choose to join either the majority or the trial court in the possible destruction of the Commission. For five consecutive years, that agency, by effective regulation, has kept Maryland\u2019s percentage increase in hospital costs lower than that of the rest of the nation <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and, thus, has protected the citizens of Maryland by \"assuring the reasonableness of rates set by hospitals.\u201d <em>Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n v. Franklin Square Hosp., </em>280 Md. at 234-35, 372 A.2d at 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In my view, the Health Services Cost Review Commission has the authority to regulate the costs of services of salaried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>or nonsalaried hospital-based physicians whether billed by the hospital or by the hospital-based physicians. Accordingly, I would reverse that portion of the trial court\u2019s 6 May 1980 judgment that prohibited the Commission from regulating the costs of services of Holy Cross Hospital\u2019s hospital-based physicians who billed patients directly, and affirm the trial court in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Judge Eldridge authorizes me to state that he joins me in the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Credentials of Commission\u2019s Witnesses Quoted in Dissenting Opinion (in alphabetical order)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">MR.

In the appended motion for reconsideration it points to positions taken by the Health Services Cost Review Commission since the filing of our opinion in this case. For instance, in one matter the staff recommended to the Commission, purportedly based upon our opinion, that \"the Commission remove all physician cost and only approve an emergency room rate for the hospital service,\u201d adding, \"The hospital or the physician may separately bill whatever they want for the physician cost. Those costs and revenues should be treated as an auxiliary enterprise if the hospital bills.\u201d In another cas\u00e9, according to Blue Cross, the Commission staff recommendation \"states flatly that the [Commission] lacks the power to regulate any radiology services however billed.\u201d In yet another instance Blue Cross says the staff recommendation \"contends that physician\u2019s services are not hospital services.\u201d We are not advised as to the context in which that statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Blue Cross says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">If <em>Holy Cross III </em>means that <em>all </em>physician services are not hospital costs and therefore not hospital services, Blue'Cross subscribers may be left without coverage for such services under their Blue Cross contracts. If <em>Holy Cross III </em>means that the determination of which physician services are hospital costs and therefore hospital services depends on the compensation arrangements, then there is a pressing need for an immediate judicial determination of the exact [perimeters] of the <em>Holy Cross III </em>decision. Without such further definition or clarification, Blue Cross subscribers will not be able to ascertain if a substantial portion of their hospital bills will be covered. Blue Cross will be forced to make claims decisions without any real guidance as to its legal obligations or the legal rights of its subscribers. [(Emphasis added.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Blue Cross recognizes that \"the issues raised by the <em>Holy Cross III </em>decision could be resolved by the institution of new litigation,\u201d but contends \"such litigation would be extremely costly and time consuming and would almost certainly return to this Court as Holy Cross IV, V and/or VI,\u201d adding that \"such a course of action would leave the rights of Blue Cross subscribers in limbo for several years and would result in piecemeal legal determinations which would greatly exacerbate the situation.\u201d It requests that we \"reconsider [our] decision ... for the purpose of clarifying under what circumstances if any, the services of physicians are hospital costs and therefore subject to regulation by the [Commission].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">We point out that in <em>Holy Cross </em>I, <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 393 A.2d 181 (1978), we had but a single issue before us. There was no room for misunderstanding on that since the very first paragraph of the opinion read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>We are here involved as a matter of statutory construction with the question of whether fees charged by physicians in certain medical specialties to hospital patients, which fees are placed on hospital accounts and billed by the hospitals in such amounts to the patients, constitute a part of \"the total costs of the hospital\u201d so as to be considered as \"reasonably related to the total services offered by the hospital\u201d and thus whether the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission (the Commission) is empowered to review and set charges by these physicians in the specialties of cardiology, pathology, and radiology. <em>[Id. </em>at 679.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">After discussion of the facts of that case and the statute we concluded, \" '[T]otal costs of the hospital\u2019 means the Hospital\u2019s expenditures or outlays of money in connection with the operation of the Hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. We went on to add:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-5\">Some expenses of a patient\u2019s hospital stay traditionally have been included in the bill submitted to the patient by a hospital. For that reason, these expenses would come within the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d as those words are commonly understood, even if there were to be an attempt on the part of any hospital to enter into an independent contract for those services to be supplied through such hospital to its patients. For instance, it is known that some hospitals today contract with independent catering firms to supply meal services to hospital patients. We do not think for one instant that it would be possible to remove meal costs from \"total costs of the hospital\u201d so that hospitals might bill patients separately for meals, based upon charges to them of the caterer, and thus to remove such costs from the control of the Commission. However, on the record before us we are unable to agree with the conclusion of the trial judge or the conclusion of the Commission that the fees charged by these pathologists, radiologists, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>cardiologists are a part of the \"coots of the hospital,\u201d the term being used hero in the sense of cost of operation of a hospital. On the other hand, we do not rule out the possibility that at the time of the enactment of this statute the words \"total costs of the hospital\u201d might have been a term \"of art\u201d in the health care field having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here. <em>[Id. </em>at 689.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">We concluded that the cause of justice would best be served by a remand to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County under Maryland Rule 871 without affirmance or reversal for further proceedings in order that the Commission might \"be afforded an opportunity to present evidence of such an understanding of the meaning of the term within the field of health care at the time this statute was enacted, if such testimony in fact [was] available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689-90. The concluding sentence of the opinion said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">In order that there may be no misunderstanding, we point out that if the services here under consideration were not understood in the health care field as embraced within \"total costs of the hospital\u201d at the time of the enactment of this statute, the Commission has exceeded the power vested in it by the General Assembly. <em>[Id. </em>at 690.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Thus, this present case, now dubbed <em>Holy Cross </em>III, arose in the context of that remand. Since the Commission failed to establish an understanding in the health care field of the term \"total costs of the hospital\u201d as \"having a well understood meaning different from its common signification which would include the fees of the physicians here,\u201d we held that on the facts of this case the Commission had exceeded its powers. The opinion held no more, despite what the Commission may attempt to read into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Our jurisdiction, with certain narrow exceptions not here pertinent, is exclusively appellate. <em>Shell Oil Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Supervisor, </em>276 Md. 36, 40-44, 343 A.2d 521 (1975). We decide cases upon the basis of the points or questions tried and decided below. Maryland Rule 885. This Court has said repeatedly that it does not sit to express opinions on abstract propositions. In other words, it does not give advisory opinions. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Gen. v. A. A. Co. School Bus, </em>286 Md. 324, 327-28, 407 A.2d 749 (1979); <em>Bishop v.

Shields, </em>49 Md. 301, 305 (1878).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">We cannot prevent the Commission from construing <em>Holy Cross </em>III as in some manner deciding something other than the single issue which we plainly set forth as before us for decision any more than we can be responsible for the fact that at the trial on the remand in <em>Holy Cross </em>I it chose to ignore the plain language of the printed opinion in <em>Holy Cross </em>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Judge Davidson dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\">.
