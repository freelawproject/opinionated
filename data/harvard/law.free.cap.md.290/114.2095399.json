This same jury next sentenced him to suffer death. In addition to the death penalty, Poole was sentenced to life imprisonment, twenty years (concurrent), and fifteen years (consecutive). Because Poole was sentenced to die, all of his convictions and sentences are directly reviewable by this Court. Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum. Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The parties have set forth the circumstances giving rise to the charges in the following statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">David Creel, an eighteen year old student, was working at MacLarty\u2019s Pharmacy on the evening of October 22,1979. According to Creel, at about eight o\u2019clock that evening, two black men came into the store. One put a mask over his head as he walked down some steps to the backroom where Dr. David MacLarty was preparing prescriptions. The other (identified by Creel as Appellant) walked up to Creel who was behind a counter and pointed a shotgun at him. The man, not wearing a mask, told Creel to lock the front door. Creel walked to the front door with the gunman holding his belt and pointing the shotgun at his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">After the man watching Creel had closed and locked the front door, Creel heard two shots fired in the backroom. Dr. MacLarty said \"Is there anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>else out there?\u201d The gunman ordered Creel to say no and then forced Creel to walk ahead of him into the backroom where they found the masked man (Steven Horad) lying on the floor breathing hard and with a head wound. Dr. MacLarty stood by the safe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">Creel\u2019s assailant stepped in front of him and shot MacLarty in the chest with a shotgun. MacLarty fell to the floor and lay there, having trouble breathing. Creel was ordered to get the money. The assailant picked up a gun lying beside MacLarty and pointed it at MacLarty\u2019s head. Creel said \"You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d The man, holding the gun an inch from MacLarty\u2019s face, pulled the trigger twice without result. Creel surrendered about $150 to the assailant who left the premises. Both MacLarty and Horad later died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Mark Blob recalled that at about the time of the shooting he and some friends were sitting on a curb in the vicinity of MacLarty\u2019s when he noticed three black men drive slowly by in a \"late '60\u2019s\u201d silver Cadillac with a black vinyl roof. Blob remembered the incident because the men in the car were \"looking at us, looking at us real hard.\u201d On March 25, 1979, Blob participated in a photographic identification procedure wherein he selected two photographs as looking \"like\u201d the men in the car. The photographs selected were of Appellant and David Brown (unrelated to this case). Blob identified Horad as the man sitting in the back seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Two address books were taken from Horad\u2019s pocket. In one of these, containing a hundred or so listings, was the name \"Poole\u201d with two telephone numbers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-9\">When told of the shooting incident the next day, Appellant showed \"no reaction whatsoever.\u201d Appellant also said that he had not seen Horad since the afternoon of the day of the shooting. Further, Appellant said that at the time of the shooting he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>was with his girlfriend, Jennifer Lanier, and her roommate, Tamara White, at 3-H Neptune Court in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">At the time of the shooting Appellant was signed out of his residence at \"Dismas House\u201d on a six hour pass for 3-H Neptune Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Both Tamara White and Jennifer Lanier denied that Appellant had been at 3-H Neptune Court on the evening of the shooting. Lanier also testified that she knew that sometimes Appellant used her address as a \"sign out\u201d location but went other places. Lanier did not recall ever having seen Appellant operating an automobile. White, however, said she remembered having seen Appellant operating a large \"darkish gray\u201d car of undetermined vintage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">Yvonne Bethea testified for the defense. Bethea stated that on the evening of the shooting Appellant was at her residence at 1604 East Monument Street (about a \"ten minute walk\u201d from Dismas House) helping her with school work with which she was having difficulty. (Appellant was a student at Morgan State University at the time of the incident at MacLarty\u2019s Pharmacy.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Poole has raised eight issues <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in this appeal; however, because of the disposition we make of his fifth issue it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>be unnecessary for us to address any of the other issues in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Poole contends the trial court committed reversible error in allowing the State to impeach its own witness, thereby prejudicing his defense and depriving him of a fair trial. He maintains the trial court permitted the State to violate the so-called witness \"voucher\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">There exists in this State the general rule that a party who produces a witness in court vouches for that witness\u2019 credibility and trustworthiness, and no direct attack upon his veracity should be made by the producing party in the absence of surprise, hostility, or deceit. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>State, </em>275 Md. 563, 570, 342 A.2d 660 (1975); <em>Proctor Elec. Co. v. Zink, </em>217 Md. 22, 32, 141 A.2d 721 (1958). Recourse to the right to impeach in such circumstances is strictly limited to those cases in which the party calling the witness has been misled and surprised, or entrapped, to his prejudice. <em>Fleming v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>277 Md. 655, 678, 358 A.2d 892 (1976); <em>Green v. State, </em>243 Md. 154, 157, 220 A.2d 544 (1966); <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 95, 145 A.2d 428 (1958). To avoid prejudice, a trial court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, permit a party to impeach its own witness upon a showing (1) that the calling party is surprised; (2) that the witness\u2019 testimony is contrary to prior statements made by this witness to a party, his attorney, or a person to be communicated to them; and (3) that the statement involves facts material to the case. <em>Fleming v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>277 Md. at 677; <em>Sellman v. State, </em>232 Md. 344, 348, 192 A.2d 788 (1963). Central to the operation of the exception, however, is the element of prejudice. It is not sufficient to show that the evidence of the witness is not beneficial to the calling party, or that it disappoints his expectations, even though justified. <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>277 Md. at 678-79; <em>Travelers Ins. Co. v. Hermann, </em>154 Md. 171, 179-80, 140 A. 64 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">It is only when all of the above requirements have been met that the trial court, in its discretion, may allow the surprised and damaged party to examine the witness in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>order to establish the fact that the witness has made a prior statement inconsistent with his present statement from the witness stand. Proof of the prior statement is permitted, not for the purpose of impeaching the general character of the witness, but rather to show why the party has called him. The purpose of this showing is to protect the party who has put him on the stand. <em>Fleming v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>277 Md. at 678; <em>Green v. State, supra, </em>243 Md. at 157; <em>Murphy v. State, </em>120 Md. 229, 233, 87 A. 811 (1913); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Briscoe, </em>65 Md. 561, 568-69, 5 A. 334 (1886).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">It is within this framework that the witness may be cross-examined by the calling party as to his prior contradictory statement, and, if the witness denies having made the statement, the calling party may offer independent proof thereof. <em>Patterson v. State, supra, </em>275 Md. at 571; <em>State, use of Chenowith v. Balto. Contracting Co., </em>177 Md. 1, 15, 6 A.2d 625 (1939). Such proof, however, is not substantive evidence; its only evidentiary effect is to impeach the credibility of the witness. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In the instant case, the determinative issue arose out of the following factual setting. The State established that on October 22, 1979, Poole signed out of Dismas House, the half-way correctional facility where he resided, and gave Lanier\u2019s address as his destination. The State produced Detective March who testified that Poole told him he was with Jennifer Lanier and Tamara White, at their house, on the night of the shooting. However, when White took the stand, she testified that Poole had not been there. Lanier, the State\u2019s final witness, also testified that Poole was not there the night Horad and MacLarty were shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Poole contended at trial (and the State\u2019s witness, Lanier, admitted) that it was common practice for him to sign out for Lanier\u2019s house when in fact his destination was elsewhere. Thus, when confronted by police the morning after the shooting, it may have been natural for him to say he was at Lanier\u2019s house so that his story would be consistent, not only for the police, but also for the officials at Dismas House. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>However, Poole\u2019s alibi was <em>not </em>that he had been with Lanier the night of the shootings, but rather that he had been with Yvonne Bethea (his sole witness, upon whom he rested his entire defense) helping her with homework at her house. Yvonne Bethea so testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It is with this backdrop that we analyze the impact of the prosecution\u2019s examination of Jennifer Lanier, the State\u2019s final witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-15\">MR.

If that\u2019s what he is doing, I think it\u2019s incumbent upon the State to proffer to the Court that it is surprised, caught by surprise by the witness\u2019 testimony. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s proper for the State to impeach his own witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">Well, the State\u2019s in the position where this witness has given several stories concerning what has occurred, and I\u2019m really calling her to explain which is true and why. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m attempting to impeach her. I\u2019m not claiming surprise because whereas Mr. Cardin has heard stories that she\u2019s told, she is a necessary witness and I\u2019m calling her to explain what occurred and what she said before and why. Well, it seems to me in this case that although you may have had more than one story and Mr. Cardin objected, you didn\u2019t have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>any choice but to ask the question, and then having asked it you now \u2014 the matter which is inconsistent apparently with the first statement given. I really don\u2019t think this amounts to anything other than to demonstrate to the Court that she is trying to help the defendant if she could \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\">MR. ANDERS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN\">COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">MR. ANDERS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">Q.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">Beg your pardon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">I said I think it\u2019s pretty obvious to the Court that she is in a tough spot and it is certainly obvious to the Jury that she\u2019s in a tough spot. She apparently is trying to help the defendant if she can. It\u2019s only natural since they\u2019re boyfriend, girlfriend. To that extent I think you have demonstrated to the Court that you did have knowledge of another statement and she had said that she made other statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">I sustained the objection that Mr. Cardin made when I thought he was right and I overruled it when I thought he was wrong. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re impeaching your witness by bringing out more than one story, which everybody knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">(Whereupon the conference at the bench is concluded, and the following proceedings were had:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">Jennifer, to clear this up, you indicated that you told the police originally that Timothy had come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>over to your house and asked you to tell the Police that he was at your house the night before, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">Q-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">Q-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-14\">A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">And he was not at your house before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-13\">And your testimony today is that you just had a general conversation concerning what on October 23rd when he came over to your house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-15\">School mostly, because I wasn\u2019t going to school that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">We agree with Poole that, when the State elicited Lanier\u2019s prior statement, after her sworn testimony that she had never conversed with Poole about his whereabouts on the day of the shootings, this constituted impeachment. It is also apparent from this dialogue that the State was not surprised by Lanier\u2019s sworn testimony; in fact, surprise was expressly disclaimed. Equally clear is the basis for our conclusion that Lanier\u2019s in-court testimony was not prejudicial to the State\u2019s case. Lanier\u2019s \"No,\u201d meaning that she had not conversed with Poole about his whereabouts, was simply not beneficial. The State had established all of the elements of its case; Lanier\u2019s \"No,\u201d did nothing to advance or hinder it. In short, two of the prerequisites for invoking the exception to the voucher rule were absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-17\">Nevertheless, the State contends, Poole\u2019s statement to Lanier constituted an \"admission by conduct,\u201d and as such, is not excludable as hearsay, but is independently admissible as substantive evidence. What the State overlooks is that it is not Poole\u2019s statement with which we are concerned. It is Lanier\u2019s prior, out-of-court statement which is at issue here. Thus, even if Lanier had been properly examined on direct, her prior, unsworn statement would not have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>admissible to prove the existence of Poole\u2019s statement, which was contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Green v. State, supra, </em>no error was found in allowing the State to impeach its own witness on the basis of surprise; however, treating the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statement as having substantive value on the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence was held to constitute prejudicial error. On this basis, Green\u2019s conviction was reversed. Thus, even where surprise is shown, \"[p]rior statements produced at the trial to show the party calling the witness has been surprised by the witness\u2019 testimony, and why the witness was called, are not probative evidence on the merits and are not treated as having any substantive or independent testimonial value.\u201d 243 Md. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">The State\u2019s rejoinder is that, in any event, Lanier\u2019s statement that Poole had told her to say that he had been at her house was harmless as merely cumulative to other evidence which tended to show that Poole was not with Lanier on the night of the shootings. We disagree. This statement is more than just cumulative to White\u2019s and Lanier\u2019s testimony; it cuts far deeper. This evidence permitted the jury to infer not only that Poole was not at Lanier\u2019s house, but also that he had done something that night, the fact of which he wanted to hide and for which he needed to invent an alibi. It permitted the jury to infer that Poole had no innocent explanation for his whereabouts \u2014 that he had gotten himself involved in some kind of serious trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It is also apparent to us that Lanier\u2019s prior statement cast a shadow over the credibility of Yvonne Bethea. If the jury believed Poole attempted to persuade Lanier to lie, might not they also conclude that Bethea\u2019s testimony was perjured? Without Lanier\u2019s prior statement Poole had, at least, the opportunity to present to the jury a defense untainted by the suggestion that he had a propensity to tamper with witnesses. We find that the admission of Lanier\u2019s statement was fraught with prejudice. Because of this error, the judgments must be reversed and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>While the disposition we make of Poole\u2019s fifth issue makes it unnecessary to address the other points raised, we believe that since a new trial must be had it will be of some guidance to the trial court to make two observations with respect to the sentencing phase of a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">First of all, Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">In the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">This provision applies to the trial stage of the proceeding and refers explicitly to the evidence necessary to sustain a conviction. It does not apply to the jury\u2019s role in a sentencing proceeding. <em>See Stevenson v. State, </em>289 Md. 167, 423 A.2d 558 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Secondly, we strongly discourage any comment by counsel in their arguments to the jury concerning appellate review of a death sentence. Such comments have no relevance to the jury\u2019s duty of determining the existence of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, and in deciding whether, upon balancing these factors, a death sentence should be imposed; rather, they tend to encourage the jury to believe that it can shift part of its responsibility to another body. We view such arguments as improper. <em>See Shoemaker v. State, </em>228 Md. 462, 180 A.2d 682 (1962); <em>see also Moore v. State, </em>240 Ga. 807, 243 S.E.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 903, 99 S. Ct. 268, 58 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1978); <em>State v. Berry, </em>391 So. 2d 406 (La. 1980); <em>State v.
