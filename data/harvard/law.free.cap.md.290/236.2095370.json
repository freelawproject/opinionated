Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 32, provided that one convicted of \"breaking a storehouse . . . with an intent to commit murder or felony therein, or with the intent to steal... goods of another of the value of\u2019 $100.00 or more shall be guilty of a felony and subject to imprisonment not exceeding ten years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the same time, Art. 27, \u00a7 342, provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that if one \"shall break into any shop, storehouse... with intent to steal any money, goods or chattels under the value of\u2019 $100.00, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to imprisonment for not more than eighteen months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The defendant, Garett Nicholas Grimes, was charged in a two count indictment by a Montgomery County grand jury with violating Art. 27, \u00a7 32. The first count charged that the defendant, on May 22, 1978, \"unlawfully did break the storehouse, the premises of Paul Darroch T/A Wildwood Manor Barber Shop, located at 10227A Old Georgetown Road, Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland, with intent to commit a felony therein, in violation of Article 27, Section 32 . . . .\u201d The second count accused Grimes of an <em>attempt </em>to break the same storehouse with an intent to commit a felony therein, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">At the trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on count two, the attempt charge, was granted. As'to count one, the court, at the prosecutor\u2019s request and over the defendant\u2019s objection, instructed the jury that the charge of storehouse breaking with intent to commit a felony, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 32, included within it the charge of storehouse breaking with intent to steal goods worth under $100.00, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>violation of then Art. 27, \u00a7 342. The jury was authorized to convict Grimes of the \u00a7 342 misdemeanor even though that offense was not specifically charged in the indictment. Grimes was found guilty under Art. 27, \u00a7 342, and was sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that \"a charge under \u00a7 32 carries with it a charge under \u00a7 342\u201d and that \"fa]ppellant was indeed charged with the crime of which he was convicted.\u201d <em>Grimes v. State, </em>44 Md. App. 580, 585, 586, 409 A.2d 767 (1980). The intermediate appellate court initially pointed to the proposition adopted by that court in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>38 Md. App. 100, 109, 379 A.2d 436 (1977), that \"conviction of a necessarily included lesser offense is permissible under a document charging a greater offense.\u201d After reviewing several of this Court\u2019s opinions dealing with \u00a7\u00a732 and 342, however, the Court of Special Appeals stated (44 Md. App. at 584-585) that \u00a7 342 cannot be regarded as a lesser included offense of \u00a7 32. The court took the position, based on the history of the two statutes, that they are not different offenses but represent different degrees of the same offense. The Court of Special Appeals thus stated <em>(id. </em>at 585):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\"We traced the history of these two provisions in <em>Prevatte v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 623 (1978). We there pointed out that the original storehouse breaking offense, as enacted by the General Assembly in 1809, made no distinction between an intent to commit grand or petit larceny. Both were then felonies, and what the statute prohibited was storehouse breaking with intent to commit a felony. Only when, in 1933, the Legislature made petit larceny a misdemeanor did it become necessary, in order to maintain the existing ambit of the storehouse breaking offense, to divide it into two sub-offenses \u2014 one where the intent was to commit a felony (including, of course, grand larceny) and the other where the intent was to commit only petit larceny, now a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\"From this history, and from a simple analysis of the two statutes, it seems clear that they involve not different offenses but the same offense in different degrees. . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The court concluded that its holding in <em>Johnson, </em>regarding greater and lesser included offenses, would also apply to different degrees of the same offense. Thus, under this ruling, one charged under one statutory provision may be convicted under another statutory provision if the latter is held to be a lesser degree of the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in order to determine the validity, under Maryland law, of the general proposition adopted by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>38 Md. App. at 109, and in the present case, namely that a defendant charged with one offense may be convicted of any lesser included offense, or any lesser degree of the same offense, even though the lesser included offense or lesser degree is not mentioned in the charging document. However, upon further consideration, we believe that the validity of this general proposition cannot be decided in the present case. With regard to a storehouse breaking with intent to commit larceny, the relationship of \u00a7 342 (now 33A) to \u00a7 32 is neither that of a lesser included offense nor a lesser degree of the same offense. Whatever may be the rule with respect to other related statutory offenses, as to these two sections one cannot be convicted under one if he is charged only under the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>223 Md. 479, 164 A.2d 917 (1960), the defendant was charged in count one of the indictment with breaking a storehouse with intent to steal goods valued at $25.00 or more, which was then the monetary minimum set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 32. Between 1952 and 1960, and at the time of the offense in <em>Johnson, </em>there was a degree of monetary overlap between \u00a7 32 and \u00a7 342, as the latter statute then covered an intent to steal goods under the value of $100.00. A charge that the defendant broke a storehouse with the intent of stealing goods valued at more than $25.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>but less than $100.00 may have then stated an offense under either statute. Consequently, if count one of the indictment in <em>Johnson </em>had stood alone, it could at that time have charged an offense under either \u00a7 32 or \u00a7 342. However, in count two of the indictment in <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant was charged with larceny of the same goods, valued at $142.00. The defendant pled guilty to count one and was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. He then attacked the conviction, arguing that count one also charged an offense under \u00a7 342, that the maximum prison sentence under \u00a7 342 was only eighteen months, and that he intended to plead guilty to a \u00a7 342 offense. In rejecting this argument, this Court pointed to count two of the indictment which informed the defendant that the value of the goods involved was $142.00. 223 Md. at 482. In light of this valuation, the Court held that the indictment plainly charged a violation of \u00a7 32 and not a violation of \u00a7 342. The Court stated that, except within the area of monetary overlap then existing, \u00a7\u00a732 and 342 were \"complementary and mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481. <em>See also Vandegrift v. State, </em>226 Md. 38, 41 n. 1, 171 A.2d 713, 91 A.L.R.2d 507 (1961) (indicating that when the charge was breaking with intent to steal goods, it would encompass a violation of both \u00a7 32 and \u00a7 342 only if the value alleged fell within the area of overlap existing between 1952 and 1960, in which case the sentence would be limited to the maximum specified in \u00a7 342).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Although in a different factual context, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State </em>clearly holds that a charge under \u00a7 32, beyond the monetary maximum set forth in \u00a7 342, does <em>not </em>also encompass a charge under the latter statute. Thus, the decisions of the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals in the present case cannot be reconciled with the position previously taken by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\"><em>Wersten v. State, </em>232 Md. 164, 192 A.2d 286 (1963), is also inconsistent with the idea that, with respect to storehouse breaking with an intent to commit larceny, \u00a7 342 is a lesser included offense or a lesser degree of the same offense as \u00a7 32. The defendant in <em>Wersten </em>was charged in the first count with breaking a storehouse with intent to steal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>property worth $100.00 or more in violation of \u00a7 32, and in the second count with breaking into a storehouse with intent to steal property worth less than $100.00 in violation of \u00a7 342. In a nonjury trial, the defendant was found guilty on both of these counts, and, on appeal, he contended that the verdicts were inconsistent and could not stand. This Court agreed, saying (232 Md. at 165-166):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\"The appellant\u2019s first contention is sound. \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 342 of Art. 27 are complementary and mutually exclusive, as they were prior to 1952 and as they have been since the amendment of 1960 of \u00a7 32 brought the $100.00 line of demarcation under that section into accord with the $100.00 limit of \u00a7 342, which had been established in 1952. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>223 Md. 479, 481, 164 A.2d 917. A breaking and entering may be with intent to steal property worth $100 or more or with intent to steal property worth less than $100.00, but not with both of these intents. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Court remanded the case for the trial judge to determine whether the defendant was guilty on count one or on count two. If \u00a7 342 had been viewed as a lesser included offense, or a lesser degree of the same offense, such a remand would not have been necessary; instead, the conviction on the lesser count would have merged into the conviction on the greater. <em>See also Turner </em>v. <em>State, </em>242 Md. 408, 415, 219 A.2d 39 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The Court of Special Appeals in the present case acknowledged that, in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wersten v. State, supra, </em>\u00a7 342 could not be treated as a lesser included offense of \u00a7 32. Nevertheless, because the storehouse breaking statute as enacted in 1809 made no distinction between the value of the goods intended to be taken, and because the distinction did not appear until the enactment of \u00a7 342 in 1933, the same year petit larceny was made a misdemeanor, the Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>concluded that \u00a7\u00a732 and 342 are \"the same offense in different degrees.\u201d 44 Md. App. at 585.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The view that different statutory provisions may constitute the same crime,-although in different degrees, has been taken by this Court with respect to certain common law offenses. Typically, this arises when the Legislature deals with a single common law offense and, without changing the basic common law elements of that offense, divides it for purposes of punishment because of the presence or absence of aggravating or mitigating factors. Thus, murder was one offense at common law, but, for purposes of punishment depending upon the presence or absence of premeditation and deliberation, the Legislature has classified it into two degrees. Similarly, robbery remains a single common law offense, but the Legislature, in separate statutory sections (Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 486 and 488) has provided greater punishment if a dangerous or deadly weapon is used. However, with regard to such offenses, the greater degree includes the lesser degree. The lesser degree of the same offense \"must be treated as a lesser included offense,\u201d <em>Sweetwine v. State, </em>288 Md. 199, 201 n. 1, 421 A.2d 60, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1017, 101 S. Ct. 579, 66 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1980), and cases cited. Because of the consistent holdings of this Court that \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 342 are mutually exclusive insofar as they encompass storehouse breaking with larcenous intent, the two statutes could not constitute different degrees of the same offense as this Court has used that concept.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, neither statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>embodies a common law offense. Rather, the offenses embraced by the two statutes are legislative creatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Although the General Assembly might deal with a single legislatively created offense in two different statutory provisions, so that the provisions represent different degrees of the same offense, there is no indication that \u00a7\u00a732 and 342 fall into such category. On the contrary, for many years the Court has held that \u00a7\u00a7 32 and 342 embody <em>separate, </em>mutually exclusive offenses, and the General Assembly, presumably aware of those holdings and amending the provisions in other respects, has not modified this view of the two statutes. Furthermore, the differences between the two statutes are too great for any inference that the Legislature intended them to represent the same offense. While both deal with storehouse breaking with intent to commit larceny, each statute contains dissimilar other offenses or alternate elements. Thus, \u00a7 32 includes breaking with intent to commit murder or any other felony, whereas the intent provision of \u00a7 342 does not extend beyond stealing. On the other hand, \u00a7 342 embraces the distinct offense of breaking into and actually stealing goods under the value of five dollars. There is no comparable offense under \u00a7 32. Article 27, \u00a7 33, is the statute which prohibits the breaking and actual stealing of goods worth more than five dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In sum, we adhere to the view expressed in <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>223 Md. 479, that \u00a7 32 and \u00a7 342 (now 33A) are separate offenses, and that a charge under \u00a7 32 does not include a charge under \u00a7 342. As one may not be found guilty of a crime which is not included in the charging document, <em>Turner v. State, supra, </em>242 Md. at 414, the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 342 must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed, and case remanded to that Court with directions to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>Montgomery County to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\">.

The statutory section, as of May 1978, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\"\u00a7 342.

Chapter 687, \u00a7 4, of the Acts of 1979, substituted the sum of $300.00 for $100.00 in the first part of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-7\">. Por a comprehensive history of the storehouse breaking, and related statutes, <em>see </em>Moylan, <em>Maryland's Burglary and Larceny Laws, 4 </em>U. Balt. L. Rev. 28 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\">. In addition to the mutually exclusive monetary limits, there may be another reason why the storehouse breaking offense under \u00a7 342 cannot be regarded as a lesser degree of the crime under \u00a7 32. The offense under \u00a7 342 might contain a distinct element or requirement not present in \u00a7 32. Although neither statute expressly requires an entry, \u00a7 342 contains the language that the breaking must be \"into\u201d a shop, storehouse, etc. The word \"into\u201d is left out of \u00a7 32 with regard to everything except a boat. Because of the absence of the word \"into\u201d in \u00a7 32, the Court of Special Appeals in Sample v. State, 33 Md. App. 398, 365 A.2d 773 (1976). held that \u00a7 32 encompassed the breaking <em>out </em>of a storehouse with a larcenous intent, even though there was no breaking \"into\u201d the storehouse. Whether \u00a7 342 would cover the same activity, or instead whether the word \"into\u201d represents an additional element to be proved, has not been considered by the Court of Special Appeals or by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
