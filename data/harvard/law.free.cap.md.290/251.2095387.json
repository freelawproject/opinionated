All of these charges were based upon the same course of conduct occurring on May 16, 1978, in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Prior to trial, the State filed a notice that, if the defendant were convicted, it would seek a mandatory maximum sentence pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum. Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c), providing a mandatory maximum sentence without the possibility of parole for persons convicted of a crime of violence who have previously been convicted on two separate occasions of crimes of violence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prior convictions of crimes of violence were alleged in the State\u2019s notice as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\"1. Attempt to commit robbery on October 18, 1974 in the District of Columbia. Case #73794-74A. Sentenced on December 17, 1974 under Federal Youth Correction Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">\"2. Robbery on March 26, 1976 in the District of Columbia. Case #82645-75; sentenced to 18 months on May 7, 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\"3. Two counts of first degree rape on November 16, 1978 in Montgomery County, Maryland. Criminal Trial #21238. Defendant was sentenced to life plus fifteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Temoney guilty on four counts: first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, robbery with a deadly weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure. During the subsequent sentencing hearing, the State introduced certified copies of the docket entries in the prior cases and urged that the court sentence the defendant under \u00a7 643B (c), as one who has been convicted on two separate prior occasions of crimes of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient, in several respects, to bring the case within \u00a7 643B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The sentencing hearing concluded with the trial court saying that it was \"taking into consideration those three prior offenses\u201d in imposing sentences in the present case. However, the court stated that it would not decide whether Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c), applied under the circumstances, and the court expressly refused to impose a sentence, without eligibility for parole, under that statutory provision. The court imposed a life sentence for rape, a consecutive life sentence for the first degree sexual offense, a consecutive twenty year sentence for armed robbery, and a three year sentence, to run concurrently with the robbery sentence, for carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The State appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, contending that the trial court erred in not sentencing under the mandatory provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its appeal, the State conceded that, in order to bring the case within \u00a7 643B (c), it had the burden of proving that Temoney was previously convicted twice of separate crimes of violence and had served one term of confinement for a crime of violence. The State relied exclusively on the two District of Columbia robbery convictions as the predicate for the application of \u00a7 643B (c), claiming that the docket entries and the presentence investigation report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>conclusively showed that these two robbery convictions qualified under \u00a7 643B (c). Since, in the State\u2019s view, it had met the burden of proving that the case came within \u00a7 643B (c), it sought a remand for the imposition of a mandatory sentence under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defendant, in his appellee\u2019s brief addressed to the sentencing issue, argued to the Court of Special Appeals that the trial court\u2019s ultimate refusal to sentence under \u00a7 643B (c) should be upheld. Although not defending the trial court\u2019s unwillingness to rule on the applicability of \u00a7 643B (c), the defendant argued that the refusal to sentence under \u00a7 643B (c) was correct for a different reason, namely the insufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence to make a prima facie case under the mandatory sentencing statute. The principal asserted deficiency in the evidence was the State\u2019s alleged failure to prove that the District of Columbia convictions constituted \"crimes' of violence\u201d within the meaning of the Maryland statute. The defendant argued that the statutory crime of robbery under District of Columbia law is broader than the common law crime of robbery applicable in Maryland, and that the District of Columbia offense encompasses activity which would not amount to robbery or any other crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 643B (c). The defendant claimed that nothing before the trial judge disclosed the underlying nature of the District of Columbia robbery convictions. The defendant further maintained that, in several other respects, the State\u2019s evidence was insufficient to bring the case within \u00a7 643B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In addition to defending as an appellee the sentences imposed, the defendant took a cross-appeal claiming that there were several errors contributing to the guilty verdicts. None of these asserted errors, however, related to the propriety of the sentences imposed. The defendant\u2019s position in the Court of Special Appeals was that if the guilty verdicts were to be upheld, then the sentences imposed should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The Court of Special Appeals, with regard to Temoney\u2019s cross-appeal, found no reversible error relating to the guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>verdicts. <em>State v. </em>Temoney, 45 Md. App. 569, 572-580, 414 A.2d 240 (1980). As to the State\u2019s appeal from the sentences, however, the intermediate appellate court did not rule on the issue presented by both sides, <em>i.e., </em>the sufficiency of the evidence to bring the case within \u00a7 643B (c). Instead, after pointing out that the trial court erred in not deciding the applicability of \u00a7 643B (c), the Court of Special Appeals remanded the case \"for the trial court\u2019s reconsideration of the facts under the provisions of article 27, section 643B (c)\u201d and \"for resentencing.\u201d 45 Md. App. at 585. The reason given for not deciding whether the State had made a prima facie case was that the \"Court is limited to appellate review and is not empowered to make original factual findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Thereafter, this Court granted Temoney\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, which challenged only that portion of the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals remanding the case for resentencing. The precise question presented in the petition for certiorari is, \"Did the Court of Special Appeals err in remanding for a new sentencing hearing without determining whether the evidence was sufficient to find Petitioner a subsequent offender under Art. 27, \u00a7 643B?\u201d The State filed no cross-petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Temoney\u2019s position in this Court, as it was in the Court of Special Appeals, is that there was insufficient evidence to make a prima facie case for mandatory sentencing under Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c), and that for this reason, the sentences imposed by the trial court should have been affirmed. In addition, Temoney argues that because the evidence was insufficient, a remand giving the State an opportunity to relitigate the issue violates that principle of double jeopardy law set forth in <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978), and <em>Greene v. Massey, </em>437 U.S. 19, 98 S. Ct. 2151, 57 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1978).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In making this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>latter argument, Temoney seems to construe the opinion and judgment of the Court of Special Appeals as authorizing on remand the presentation of <em>additional </em>facts relating to the applicability of Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">In response, the State in its brief initially asserts that the case involves no issue concerning the applicability of the double jeopardy principle announced in <em>Burks v. United States, supra, </em>because the \"limited remand\u201d by the Court of Special Appeals does not contemplate \"further proceedings to allow the State another opportunity to prove his [the defendant\u2019s] status as a subsequent violent offender.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief, p. 6.) Instead, the State contends that the trial court\u2019s determination on remand is limited to considering \"the facts adduced by the State at the original sentencing\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 9). The State goes on, however, to agree with the defendant that robbery in the District of Columbia is a statutory crime encompassing conduct which would not amount to a \"crime of violence\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 643B. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 10.) Next, contrary to the basis for its appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, the State now concedes that its proof at the sentencing hearing concerning the nature of the District of Columbia convictions was \"legally defective.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The State contends, however, that despite the limited nature of the remand order or the principle of <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>the State may properly remedy the defect on remand by introducing transcripts of the evidence, or transcripts of the factual bases for the guilty pleas, in the two District of Columbia cases. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 11.) At oral argument, the State clarified somewhat its seemingly contradictory positions by adopting the view that neither the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 remand order nor the <em>Burks </em>principle would preclude the presentation of additional evidence if judicial notice could be taken of that additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Much of the discussion by both sides before this Court has concerned the applicability of the double jeopardy principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>set forth in <em>Burks v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>Greene v. Massey, supra, </em>to preclude affording the State a second opportunity to supply facts bringing the case within Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c), if it failed to produce sufficient evidence at the first sentencing hearing. Although the Supreme Court has not ruled upon this question, some state courts, including the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, have held that the <em>Burks </em>principle is applicable to a sentencing proceeding such as one under \u00a7 643B. <em>Butler v. State, </em>46 Md. App. 317, 324, 416 A.2d 773 (1980), <em>cert. granted, </em>288 Md. 732 (1980). but subsequently dismissed upon the State\u2019s motion; <em>Crawley v. Kunzman, </em>585 S.W.2d 387, 388 (Ky. 1979); <em>Reed v. State, </em>581 S.W.2d 145, 149 (Tenn. Grim. 1978). <em>But cf. State </em>v. <em>Braithwaite, </em>92 Wash. 2d 624, 600 P.2d 1260, 1261 (1979) (stating generally that a sentencing proceeding under a habitual criminal statute is not affected by the double jeopardy prohibition, but not involving the <em>Burks </em>principle, as \"the facts with respect to the prior convictions were a matter of record and were not in dispute\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, for several reasons, the issue concerning the applicability of <em>Burks </em>to a \u00a7 643B proceeding need not, and therefore will not, be decided in this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">First, the State has in this Court expressly disclaimed any interest in introducing further evidence at a second \u00a7 643B proceeding except for such evidence of which judicial notice may be taken. And the only items of evidence allegedly in this category which the State wants to submit are the transcripts of testimony, or statements of fact, at the two District of Columbia robbery trials. However, judicial notice cannot be taken of the testimony or factual statements made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>in unrelated trials in other jurisdictions. Although a certified copy of such transcripts may be sufficient for purposes of authentication, their admissibility is otherwise subject to the ordinary rules of evidence. <em>Fletcher v. Flournoy, </em>198 Md. 53, 60, 81 A.2d 232 (1951), <em>cert. denied, </em>343 U.S. 917, 72 S. Ct. 649, 96 L. Ed. 2d 1331 (1952). <em>See also </em>Code (1974, 1980 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 10-204 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Second, the remand under the opinion and mandate of the Court of Special Appeals clearly does not contemplate a proceeding at which the State may introduce additional evidence. Instead, because the intermediate appellate court believed that it should not pass upon the facts previously adduced, the remand was limited to the \"trial court\u2019s reconsideration of <em>the </em>facts\u201d and the trial court\u2019s resentencing the defendant. Nothing in the opinion or mandate of the Court of Special Appeals suggests that there should be a new evidentiary hearing. Moreover, there is no exception in the opinioji and mandate for another evidentiary hearing confined to new evidence of which judicial notice may be taken.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And if there were such an exception, it would not help the State here, as judicial notice could not be taken of the trial transcripts in the prior District of Columbia cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There is a third and more basic reason why the applicability of the <em>Burks </em>principle to a \u00a7 643B proceeding need not be decided in this case. The question concerning the applicability of <em>Burks </em>would ordinarily be presented in a case involving the imposition of a sentence under \u00a7 643B, an appeal by the defendant, and a reversal on the ground that the sentence was erroneous because of insufficient evidence. In this case, however, the trial court refused to impose a sentence under \u00a7 643B, and the State appealed, claiming that the evidence conclusively demonstrated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>defendant came within \u00a7 643B (c). The defendant, on the other hand, as the appellee, maintained that the trial court was correct, although for a different reason, <em>i.e., </em>the insufficiency of the evidence to make a prima facie case, and that, therefore, the trial court should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">If the State\u2019s position in the Court of Special Appeals were correct, namely that the evidence as a matter of law brought the defendant within the mandatory sentencing requirement of \u00a7 643B (c), then the case should have been remanded simply for the imposition of a mandatory sentence under that statute. <em>See State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 527, 325 A.2d 573, 73 A.L.R.3d 454 (1974). On the other hand, if the evidence were sufficient for a prima facie case under \u00a7 643B (c), but nevertheless conflicting or subject to conflicting inferences so that a trier of facts could reasonably go either way, then the case should be remanded for the trial court to make a factual determination and impose the appropriate sentence depending upon that factual determination. However, if the State\u2019s evidence were insufficient to permit a finding that the defendant came within \u00a7 643B (c), then the trial court\u2019s judgment was warranted (although on a different ground than relied on by the trial court) and should be affirmed. The question of the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a prima facie case is, of course, a question of law appropriate for resolution at the appellate level. If the defendant-appellee\u2019s position concerning the deficiency in the evidence is correct, the case comes within the settled rule that an appellate court will ordinarily <em>affirm </em>a trial court\u2019s judgment on any ground adequately shown by the record, even though the ground was not relied on by the trial court. <em>Health Services Cost Review Commission v. Holy Cross Hospital, </em>290 Md. 508, 515, 431 A.2d 641, (1981) <em>Offutt v. Montgomery Co. Bd. of Ed., </em>285 Md. 557, 563 n. 3, 564, no. 4, 404 A.2d 281 (1979); <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S. Ct. 680, 62 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1980), and cases there collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>None of the three possible alternatives discussed above would involve a second evidentiary hearing at which the State would have an opportunity to remedy an insufficiency of the evidence. Consequently, the issue whether <em>Burks </em>applies to a \u00a7 643B proceeding is clearly not presented for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Instead, the question before us is whether the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to permit a trier of facts to determine that the requirements of \u00a7 643B (c) were met. If it was, then the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, remanding for such determination, should be affirmed. If the evidence was not sufficient, then we should affirm the judgment of the trial court even though this was not the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The State\u2019s concessions, that the statutory crime of robbery in the District of Columbia encompasses conduct which would not constitute robbery or another crime of violence under Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that its evidence showing the nature of the two District of Columbia robbery convictions was defective, were fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">District of Columbia Code (1973), \u00a7 22-2901, sets forth the statutory definition of robbery as follows (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\"\u00a7 22-2901. Robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">Whoever by force or violence, whether against resistance or by sudden <em>or stealthy seizure or snatching, </em>or by putting in fear, shall take from the person or immediate actual possession of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>anything of value, is guilty of robbery, and any person convicted thereof shall suffer imprisonment for not less than two years nor more than fifteen years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The terms of this section have been interpreted to include acts, such as pickpocketing for example, which involve stealth but not violence or putting in fear. <em>Jackson v. United States, </em>359 F.2d 260 (D.C. Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 877, 87 S. Ct. 157, 17 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1966); <em>Turner v. United States, </em>16 F.2d 535, 536 (D.C. Cir. 1926). In Maryland, on the other hand, mere pickpocketing would be larceny <em>(not </em>a \"[c]rime of violence,\u201d as enumerated by Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 643B), rather than robbery. <em>Cooper v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 478, 480, 265 A.2d 569 (1970). <em>See also Murray v. State, </em>214 Md. 383, 387, 135 A.2d 314 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Article 27, \u00a7 643B, enumerates specifically those crimes which are crimes of violence for purposes of the mandatory sentencing statute, all of which involve force or threat against person or property. The language used by the Legislature shows an intent to limit the application of \u00a7 643B to repeat offenders of crimes actually involving force or violence. While the defendant\u2019s District of Columbia convictions may in fact have been violent crimes, this is not necessarily so, nor is it discernible from the docket entries received into evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State has thus failed to introduce evidence showing that the District of Columbia convictions were \"[clrimes of violence\u201d within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 643B. Without the use of the District of Columbia convictions for robbery and attempted robbery as prior convictions of violent crimes, the evidence in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>is insufficient to support a mandatory sentence under the provisions of \u00a7 643B (c). Thus, the sentences imposed upon Temoney for his Prince George\u2019s County convictions of first degree rape, first degree sexual offense, robbery with a deadly weapon, and carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure, were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals vacated, and case remanded to that court with directions to aff\u00edrm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Prince George\u2019s County to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">.

Apparently because an appeal from the Montgomery County conviction was then pending, the State primarily relied upon the two District of Columbia robbery convictions to bring the case within \u00a7 643B (c). However, in the trial court the State did assert that the Montgomery County conviction could be used as one of the prior convictions despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>pendency of the appeal, although it did not take this position during the appellate proceedings in the present case. The Court of Special Appeals, in Butler v. State, 46 Md. App. 317, 322. 416 A.2d 773 (1980), held that if an appeal from a prior conviction were pending at the time of the sentencing, such prior conviction could not serve as a predicate for the application of \u00a7 643B. The State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in <em>Butler </em>was granted by this Court, 288 Md. 732 (1980), but, before any further proceedings in this Court, it was dismissed on the State\u2019s motion. Consequently, we have not ruled on this issue and have no occasion to do so in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b277-8\">. Code (1974, 1980 Repl.

Ed. 2d 328 (1980), the Supreme Court recently upheld, against a double jeopardy challenge, a statutory authorization for the Government to appeal in a dangerous special offender sentencing proceeding. The appeal in that case was from the alleged failure of the trial court to impose the correct sentence in light of the trial court\u2019s own factual findings. Although not involving the question of the applicability of <em>Burks, </em>the Supreme Court noted that under the statute before it, the \"appellate court... is empowered to correct only a legal error.\u201d (101 S. Ct. at 439.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">. We have on many occasions emphasized that we will not decide constitutional issues unnecessarily. Simms v. State, 288 Md. 712, 725, 421 A.2d 957 (1980), and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">. Similarly, in situations where the <em>Burks </em>principle is applicable, we doubt that the Supreme Court in <em>Burks </em>contemplated an exception for a second trial where the prosecution could present additional evidence as long as that additional evidence is subject to \"judicial notice\u201d under the law of the particular jurisdiction involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\">. If the issue is encompassed within a petition for certiorari, or if it is otherwise before us under Maryland Rule 813, the principle that an appellate court \"will normally affirm a trial court on a ground adequately shown by the record, even though that ground was not the one relied upon by the trial court,\u201d is as fully applicable in this Court as in the Court of Special Appeals. Robeson v. State, <em>supra, </em>285 Md. at 503-504.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b284-12\">. The State made a similar concession regarding the District of Columbia offense of robbery in Calhoun v. State, 46 Md. App. 478, 484, 418 A.2d 1241 (1980), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 1, 425 A.2d 1361 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. The only other \"evidence\u201d before the trial court at the sentencing hearing was the presentence investigation report, and this report contained nothing disclosing the facts underlying the District of Columbia convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">With regard to some of the other claims of evidentiary insufficiency made by the defendant at the hearing, the parties were in dispute as to whether the trial court could properly consider the presentence report in determining whether the State met its burden of proving compliance with the requirements of Art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c). However, in light of our disposition of this case, it is unnecessary to consider the disputed issue concerning the presentence investigation report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
