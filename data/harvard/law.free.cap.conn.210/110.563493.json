At the close of the state\u2019s case, the defendant made an oral motion for judgment of acquittal on all six counts. Over the state\u2019s objection, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the two counts charging him with first degree sexual assault and the count charging him with carrying a dangerous weapon. The state excepted to the trial court\u2019s granting of the defendant\u2019s motion. At the close of all the evidence, the trial court, pursuant to the state\u2019s request, dismissed with prejudice the two first degree sexual assault counts and the count of carrying a dangerous weapon, and granted the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal.

Evidence pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>sented during the state\u2019s case revealed that the defendant and the complainant were married in May, 1978. Three children were born to them during their marriage. In April, 1986, the couple agreed to be divorced as a result of marital difficulties. On two occasions during April and May, 1986, the complainant took the children and left the marital home in North Haven to stay elsewhere because of her deteriorating relationship with the defendant. After leaving their North Haven home the second time, the complainant returned when the defendant moved out to stay with relatives. During this period, the defendant filed a divorce action, notice of which was served on the complainant. When he later intimated that he wished to withdraw the divorce action, the complainant filed a cross complaint for divorce. In addition, in May, 1986, the complainant obtained restraining orders ordering the defendant to refrain from harassing or assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The several charges against the defendant arose from incidents alleged to have taken place on May 25 and 26,1986. The state presented evidence that the defendant had sexually assaulted the complainant on May 25, 1986, in the North Haven marital home. Ultimately, the trial court found the defendant not guilty of count two, kidnapping in the first degree, but found him guilty of kidnapping in the second degree with a firearm, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94a (a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>included offense of count one, and count five, assault in the third degree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s convictions on those charges are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Facts Pertaining to the State\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In making his oral motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 884,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the defendant argued that he was exempt from prosecution for violating \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-70a(a) because, under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d applicable to those offenses is expressly limited to persons who are not married to each other. The state claimed, however, that the marital exemption was inapplicable because the parties no longer maintained a \u201cviable\u201d marriage despite their continued legal marital status, and that the marital exemption of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) conceivably violated equal protection guarantees. In granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the two first degree sexual assault counts, the trial court stated: \u201cI would make it quite clear, however, on the record, that the Court[\u2019s] granting of [the defendant\u2019s] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal . . . is based on the fact that the evidence demonstrates quite clearly that these two people were married on [the] day [of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>alleged assault]. Certainly there is ample evidence at this point for the court to find that the other, the basic elements of the rape have been proven. The basis of the ruling as I indicated is the opinion of the Court that the spousal exemption is valid and the evidence indicates clearly . . . that these parties were still legally married on that day, and it is for that reason I am granting the Judgment of Acquittal as to these two counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The state excepted to the court\u2019s ruling and requested permission to appeal. It argued that an appeal was not barred by double jeopardy because the question of the marital exemption\u2019s applicability was \u201csimply a legal question.\u201d The defendant, however, claimed that an appeal was improper because the trial court\u2019s ruling was based on a flaw in the state\u2019s evidence. The trial court reserved a ruling on the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal, but stated: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would call it an evidentiary failing. What I did is grant [the defendant\u2019s] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal because I believe the statutory exemption ... is clear and . . . has been proven, the fact that they are legally married, and I did not accept [the state\u2019s] . . . legal argument that the exemption does not apply to people who are not married in fact .... I have no hesitation in finding [as] a fact that on the date of this offense these people were not married in fact. They were married in law but not in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">When the trial concluded on May 29,1987, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice the first degree sexual assault counts, and also granted the state\u2019s request to appeal. The judgment, filed on May 29, indicated that the defendant was acquitted of the sexual assault counts. Pursuant to the state\u2019s motion, however, the judgment file subsequently was amended to indicate that the trial court, on May 29, 1987, had dismissed with prejudice the first degree sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ual assault counts and had granted the state permission to appeal. On June 6, 1987, the state filed its appeal, indicating that it was appealing from the judgment, rendered on May 29,1987, acquitting the defendant of the first degree sexual assault counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">After filing its appeal, the state filed two questions seeking the trial court\u2019s articulation pertaining to the disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts. To the first question, \u201c[d]id the trial court evaluate the state\u2019s evidence on the elements of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-70a, and acquit the defendant on those counts, by making a determination of <em>factual </em>innocence,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201c[y]es.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To the second question, \u201c[d]id the trial court dismiss the sexual assault counts on the legal ground that the marital exemption barred prosecution,\u201d the trial court responded, \u201c[n]o.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">On appeal, the state reiterates the claims made at trial (1) that the marital exemption of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) does not apply to persons who are no longer married \u201cin fact,\u201d whether or not they are still legally married, and (2) that the marital exemption violates equal protection guarantees of the federal and Connecticut constitutions by denying to female victims married to their assailants the same protections accorded female victims not married to their assailants. Further, the state asserts that its appeal is proper because the trial court\u2019s disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts turned solely on the legal question of the applicability of \u00a7 53a-65 (2). The defendant asserts two jurisdictional defects to the state\u2019s appeal, claiming (1) that the state has not appealed from a final judgment, and (2) that double jeopardy bars appellate review of the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal. We conclude that there was a final judgment and that the judgment was a true acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, therefore barring us from reviewing the state\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The defendant first claims that the state improperly appealed from a \u201cpartial judgment.\u201d He argues that the state sought to appeal from the trial court\u2019s action granting the motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state\u2019s case. He further asserts that because the appeal was not taken from the imposition of a sentence, nor from an appealable interlocutory order; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983); the appeal was not taken from a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d and, therefore, must be dismissed. The state maintains that its appeal is from the trial court\u2019s judgment of May 29, 1987, dismissing with prejudice the first degree sexual assault counts. The state argues that the trial court had the authority to modify its prior action granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal to a dismissal with prejudice; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 437, 513 A.2d 620 (1986); and that a dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment from which the state may take an appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-96<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> permits the state to appeal from rulings and decisions of the Superior Court upon questions of law arising in criminal trials. Appellate jurisdiction is limited to appeals from final judgments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>See General Statutes \u00a7 52-263;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>191 Conn. 506, 508, 467 A.2d 920 (1983). \u201cThe appealable final judgment in a criminal case is ordinarily the imposition of sentence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31; <em>State </em>v. <em>Grotton, </em>180 Conn. 290, 293, 429 A.2d 871 (1980). We have recognized, however, in both criminal and civil cases, that certain otherwise interlocutory orders may be final judgments for appeal purposes. . . . \u2018An otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>179 Conn. 98, 99, 425 A.2d 574 (1979).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>supra, 509-10. Unless the appeal is authorized under the <em>Curcio </em>criteria, absence of a final judgment is a jurisdictional defect that results in a dismissal of the appeal. <em>Guerin </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>167 Conn. 282, 283, 355 A.2d 255 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The defendant incorrectly identifies the trial court\u2019s action granting the motion for judgment of acquittal as the order from which the state sought to appeal. The trial court did not render judgment on the granting of that motion, or grant the state permission to appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>until the conclusion of the trial on May 29,1987. Practice Book \u00a7 884 requires the trial court to rule on a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state\u2019s case at the time it is made, but does not require the court to render judgment on a ruling granting the motion at that time. Further, the state\u2019s appeal form, which indicates that the appeal was sought from the May 29, 1987 decision \u201cgranting the defendant\u2019s motions for judgment of acquittal,\u201d clearly demonstrates that the state has appealed from the judgment rendered on the motion at the conclusion of the trial. Thus, the record establishes that the state has appealed from the May 29,1987 judgment rendered on the trial court\u2019s mid-trial action granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The finality of a judgment of acquittal under General Statutes \u00a7 52-263 is self-evident. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 452, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980) (state appeals from judgment of acquittal rendered by trial court after setting aside jury verdict of guilty). Such a judgment concludes the rights of the parties regarding the charges of which the defendant has been acquitted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra. Further, a judgment of acquittal achieves the same finality as the imposition of a sentence since it terminates the prosecution of the charges to which it applies and negates the possibility of an imposition of a sentence. Because the present appeal was taken from a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>rendered at the conclusion of the trial, the state\u2019s appeal does not implicate the problems of \u201c \u2018delays and disruptions attendant upon intermediate appeal[s],\u2019 which the [final judgment] rule is designed to avoid . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>186 Conn. 547, 551, 442 A.2d 939, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Moeller </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>459 U.S. 838, 103 S. Ct. 85, 74 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1982); see also <em>Burger &amp; Burger, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murren, </em>202 Conn. 660, 663, 522 A.2d 812 (1987). We conclude that the judgment rendered on the trial court\u2019s action granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal was an appealable \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The defendant next claims that double jeopardy bars the state\u2019s appeal. The double jeopardy clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>fifth amendment to the federal constitution prohibits the prosecution of appeals from judgments of acquittal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S. Ct. 1349, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1977); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>205 Conn. 528, 537, 534 A.2d 1159 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 988, 108 S. Ct. 1292, 99 L. Ed. 2d 502 (1988) (double jeopardy protections incorporated into due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of Connecticut constitution). Although the trial court characterized its disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts during the trial as an \u201cacquittal\u201d and in the amended judgment file as a \u201cdismissal with prejudice,\u201d neither characterization is dispositive. This court must make its own inquiry into the trial court\u2019s disposition to determine, for double jeopardy purposes, whether the court \u201cacquitted\u201d the defendant of the two first degree sexual assault counts. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 96, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 883, 99 S. Ct. 226, 58 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1978) (trial court\u2019s characterization of action not dispositive); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 534 (issue is whether ruling resolved some or all of factual elements of offense charged, regardless of label).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict of acquittal . . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>163 U.S. 662, 671 [16 S. Ct. 1192, 41 L. Ed. 300] (1896).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>supra, 571. \u201cA judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 91. An \u201cacquittal\u201d results from \u201ca resolution, correct or not, of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>supra, 571; or from the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the state has failed to present sufficient evidence to rebut a defendant\u2019s essentially factual defense. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 97-98; <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 4, 16, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The state argues that double jeopardy does not bar its appeal because (A) the trial court\u2019s disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts was based on a legal matter unrelated to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence; (B) even if the marital exemption of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) requires proof of marriage, the exemption is a \u201cnon-exculpatory defense\u201d not implicating the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility; and (C) even if the defendant had been \u201cacquitted,\u201d a reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision would not subject the defendant to another trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">As noted above, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2), which defines the sexual intercourse prohibited under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-70a (a), excludes married people. Under this statutory scheme, a defendant married to the alleged assault victim cannot be found guilty of violating those sexual assault statutes. A finding of non-culpability based on the \u201cmarital exemption\u201d of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) necessarily depends upon proof of the fact that the victim and the defendant were legally married. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>11 Conn. App. 102, 119, 525 A.2d 1364, cert. denied, 204 Conn. 811, 528 A.2d 1157 (1987) (marital exemption not available where defendant failed to produce any evidence that he and victim were married). Under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-70a (a), a finding by the trier that the alleged offender and the victim were married exonerates the alleged offender, regardless of the proof of forcible sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>In the present case, the state\u2019s presentation of the complainant\u2019s testimony established that the defendant and the complainant were married on the day of the alleged assault. This evidence was, in essence, an admission by the state that the couple were married. As such, it constituted a \u201cfailure of evidence\u201d pertaining to the sexual assault counts. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s acquittal on the sexual assault counts turned on a factual basis related to his guilt or innocence of the offenses charged. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The state\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts was based solely on the court\u2019s <em>legal </em>conclusion that \u00a7 53a-65 (2) applied to exclude all married offenders and victims, regardless of the quality of their marital relationship, is directly controverted by the trial court\u2019s posttrial articulation. Although at trial the court indicated that it was \u201cnot sure [that its granting of the motion for judgment of acquittal was based on] an evidentiary failing\u201d of the state\u2019s case, the court\u2019s articulation, made upon the state\u2019s motion, definitely establishes that the court had based its disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts on <em>a factual </em>determination that the parties were married. As the state conceded before the trial court in a posttrial hearing, the court\u2019s articulation that its disposition was based on a \u201cfactual\u201d rather than \u201clegal\u201d ground rendered \u201cacademic\u201d the state\u2019s motion to amend the printed record to reflect that the trial court \u201cdismissed\u201d the first degree sexual assault counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Further, we disagree with the state\u2019s related argument that double jeopardy does not bar its appeal because the defendant deliberately chose to forego a pretrial hearing on his marital exemption claim. We first note that the record discloses that the defendant did seek to dismiss the sexual assault counts prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>trial, but that the trial court never ruled on his motion. Moreover, the tacit premise of the state\u2019s argument appears to be that it was the defendant\u2019s obligation to ensure that the state charged him with a crime corresponding to the facts likely to be adduced at trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are not persuaded that a criminal defendant must oblige the state in this manner in order to invoke the protections of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The state also claims that, under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, a defendant may not insulate a legal issue from appellate review by securing on his own initiative a mid-trial termination of the proceedings on a basis unrelated to his factual guilt or innocence. It also points to the language in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 96-97, that \u201can appeal is not barred simply because a ruling in favor of the defendant \u2018is based upon facts outside the face of the indictment\u2019 ... or because it \u2018is granted on the ground . . . that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged . . . . \u2019 \u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Our discussion above makes it clear that the trial court\u2019s action granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal at mid-trial terminated the prosecution of the sexual assault counts on a basis directly related to his guilt or innocence. Moreover, the language of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott </em>suggesting that an appeal is not barred simply because the trial court relies on facts outside the indictment in disposing of the charges cannot be fully comprehended without examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ing the facts of that case. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 84, the defendant moved to dismiss the first count of an indictment on the ground of pre-indictment delay. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss at the close of all the evidence. Upon the government\u2019s appeal, the defendant claimed that double jeopardy barred the appeal. The United States Supreme Court rejected this claim, concluding that the motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay was not related to the defendant\u2019s factual guilt or innocence of the crime charged. Id., 98-99. Similarly, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 533, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis that the state had failed to apprise the defendant of the exact date of the alleged sexual offense, thereby compromising the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective alibi defense. In granting the motion to dismiss, the trial court stated that \u201c \u2018[this decision] is in no way related to my opinion as to whether or not the defendant is guilty or not guilty of these charges. . . .\u2019 \u201d Id. We concluded that \u201c[b]ecause the motion to dismiss was granted at the request of the defendant, and because no evidence has been presented to enable the trier to make any factual determination in this case . . . the dismissal [does not bar] . . . the state\u2019s appeal . . . . \u201d Id., 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In the present case, the \u201cfact outside the indictment\u201d resulting in the defendant's acquittal was an evidentiary fact intrinsically related to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the offense charged. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, however, the dismissals were based on procedural matters unrelated to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. Thus, the principle that double jeopardy may not apply in certain circumstances even where the trial court refers to matters outside the information in disposing of the counts in the defendant\u2019s favor has no application to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The state also argues that an \u201cacquittal\u201d based on the marital exemption of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) is not an \u201cacquittal\u201d for double jeopardy purposes. Relying on <em>United States </em>v. Moore, 613 F.2d 1029 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 954, 100 S. Ct. 2922, 64 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1980), the state asserts that the marital exemption is a \u201cnon-exculpatory\u201d defense that has no bearing on the accused\u2019s factual guilt or innocence. The state\u2019s position, however, is flatly contradicted by judicial interpretation of \u00a7 53a-65 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 112, our Appellate Court held that \u201c[o]n the basis of the common law and statutory history from which General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-65 and 53a-70 (a) evolved, the logic of the various provisions of the sexual assault statutes, and case law in other jurisdictions, we conclude that the absence of a marital relationship between the defendant and the victim of a sexual assault is not an essential element of the crime. Rather, the existence of a marital relationship can be raised as an exemption or defense to prosecution for sexual assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-70 (a).\u201d The Appellate Court noted that \u201c[t]he general rule at common law was that . . . marriage [of the defendant and the victim] was a matter of defense\u201d; id., 113; and concluded that it was clear that \u00a7 53a-65 (2) incorporated the common law marital exemption as a defense to prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-70a. Id., 118.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>As the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra, noted, \u201cessentially factual\u201d defenses relating to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence include those which \u201c \u2018necessarily [establish] the criminal defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability.\u2019 \u201d Id., 1036, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 98. Under the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, \u00a7 53a-65 (2) does not merely operate as a procedural bar to prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-70a (a). The accused\u2019s marital relationship with the victim necessarily establishes his lack of criminal culpability under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-70a (a). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The state finally asserts that even if the trial court\u2019s action is deemed to be an acquittal, its appeal is not barred by double jeopardy because a reversal of the trial court\u2019s decision would not subject the defendant to a retrial. It argues that the trial court found as a fact that the other elements of the first degree sexual assault counts had been established. It claims that no retrial would be necessary because the trial court directed the defendant to present his evidence pertaining to the existing counts, that the defendant did so, and that in the course of doing so the defendant denied that the sexual assault had taken place. Consequently, the state maintains, if we reversed the trial court\u2019s acquittal on the legal ground that \u00a7 53a-65 (2) does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>exclude persons who are not married \u201cin fact,\u201d on remand the trial court could render a judgment of guilty on the first degree sexual assault counts. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We acknowledge that \u201cwhere a [state\u2019s] appeal [from an acquittal] presents no threat of successive prosecutions, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended . . . . \u201d Id., 569-70. Generally, this exception to the double jeopardy bar arises where the trial court renders a judgment of acquittal after setting aside a valid jury verdict of guilty. Id., 570. \u201cSince reversal on appeal would merely reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict, review of such an order does not offend the policy against multiple prosecution.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>420 U.S. 332, 344-45, 95 S. Ct. 1013, 43 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1975); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The fundamental flaw in the state\u2019s argument is that the trial court\u2019s comments, made at the close of the state\u2019s case, that \u201c[c]ertainly there is ample evidence at this point for the Court to find that the other, the basic elements of the rape have been proven,\u201d scarcely resemble a verdict of guilty. Moreover, the trial court did not direct the defendant to defend against the first degree sexual assault counts after it had granted the motion for judgment of acquittal. If the trial court\u2019s decision were reversed, further proceedings would be necessary to protect the defendant\u2019s due process rights to notice of the charges against him and to present a defense. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Flower, </em>176 Conn. 224, 226, 405 A.2d 655 (1978) (where no record upon which determination of guilt could be made without further proceedings, double jeopardy barred appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Because the trial court acquitted the defendant of the two first degree sexual assault counts, double jeopardy bars us from considering the state\u2019s claim that \u00a7 53a-65 (2) does not exclude from the definition of sex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ual intercourse persons who, although legally married, are separated and are no longer married \u201cin fact.\u201d Even assuming that the state\u2019s contention is correct, the trial court\u2019s acquittal of the defendant may not be reviewed on appeal \u201ceven if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.\u201d <em>Sanabria </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S. Ct. 2170, 57 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1978). As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit aptly stated, \u201c[ijnasmuch as we find the judgment below to be a true acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars appeal even if the [trial] court based the acquittal on an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles or upon legal principles which are themselves overturned.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schwartz, </em>785 F.2d 673, 678 (9th Cir. 1986); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 98 (acquittal resulting from erroneous interpretation of law affects accuracy of determination but does not alter its essential character).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The state\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

In <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 432-33, 513 A.2d 620 (1986), we addressed the question whether the trial court had jurisdiction to amend a finding in its original written memorandum of decision some three years after that memorandum had been filed. We stated that \u201c \u2018[djuring the continuance of a term of court the judge holding it has, in a sense, absolute control over judgments rendered; that is, he can declare and subsequently modify or annul them.\u2019 \u201d Id., 436. \u201cNeither our General Statutes nor our Practice Book rules define the period during which a trial court may modify or correct its judgment in a <em>criminal </em>case. On the <em>civil </em>side, however, Practice Book \u00a7 326 provides that any civil judgment . . . may be opened or set aside \u2018within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed.\u2019 We see no reason to distinguish between civil and criminal judgments in this respect, and we therefore hold that... a criminal judgment may not be modified in matters of substance beyond a period of four months after the judgment has become final.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 437. The state argues that, because the trial court \u201cmodified\u201d its original action granting the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal to a dismissal with prejudice within the four month period prescribed by <em>Wilson, </em>the controlling order for purposes of appeal was the trial court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice. Because we conclude below, however, that the trial court\u2019s disposition of the first degree sexual assault counts was a \u201ctrue\u201d acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, it necessarily follows that, once the court had granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, it could not thereafter \u201cmodify\u201d that order by \u201cdismissing\u201d the counts. As a consequence, <em>Wilson </em>is inapplicable to the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> We note that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70b, enacted in 1981; see Public Acts 1981, No. 81-27; provides in pertinent part: \u201c(b) No spouse or cohabitar shall compel the other spouse or cohabitar to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force ... .\u201d The limitation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2), excluding married persons from the definition of sexual intercourse, does not apply to prosecutions under \u00a7 53a-70b.

I agree with the conclusion of the majority that the acquittal of the defendant with respect to the two counts of first degree sexual assault in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70a and 53a-70 cannot be reviewed because it is a factually based determination entitled to constitutional protection against double jeopardy. It is quite clear from the transcript, however, that the finding of fact on which the trial court relied in acquitting the defendant was the existence of a marital relationship between him and the complainant. The court expressly found that \u201cthe basic elements of the rape had been proven\u201d but that \u201cthe parties were still legally married on that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The majority purports not to review the state\u2019s claim that the marital exemption in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) does not apply where the marriage has terminated \u201cin fact,\u201d although the legal relationship continues. The majority declares, nevertheless, that \u201cnonculpability based on the \u2018marital exemption\u2019 of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) depends upon proof of the fact that the victim and the defendant were legally married,\u201d a view that coincides with that expressed by the trial court in rejecting the state\u2019s claim. I, too, agree that the legislature intended the existence of the legal marital bond to preclude a prosecution for first degree sexual assault regardless of whether the marriage is viable in fact, but I disagree with the majority that the double jeopardy principle bars a review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">If the state\u2019s interpretation of the marital exemption provision were correct, the fact that the marriage between the defendant and the complainant had not terminated in law would be of no consequence. The undisputed existence of the legal bond would not, therefore, constitute an \u201cevidentiary insufficiency\u201d under <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S, 1,18, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978), or a factual determination related to guilt or innocence under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 92, 98 S. Ct. 2187, 57 L. Ed. 2d 65, reh. denied, 439 U.S. 883, 99 S. Ct. 226, 58 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1978). The trial court made it perfectly clear in granting the motion for acquittal that its determination rested wholly upon the undisputed fact that the marriage had not terminated legally and its legal conclusion that the marital exemption was therefore applicable. If that interpretation of the statutes were erroneous, it could not be said that the acquittal rested upon a finding of any fact pertaining to guilt or innocence, as is essential for double jeopardy to apply. Where it is clear that an acquittal is based on a ground other than the resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor of some or all of the fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tual elements of the offense charged, the state is not barred from seeking another trial. Id., 97; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kennings, </em>861 F.2d 381, 386 (3d Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">For similar reasons, I believe it is necessary to resolve the state\u2019s claim that a construction of the marital exemption to apply to marriages existing in law but terminated in fact violates principles of equal protection. If the claim were sound, this court would be obliged either to construe the exemption in accordance with the state\u2019s claim or to declare it ineffective as being constitutionally invalid, thus rendering immaterial the finding that the legal bond between the defendant and the complainant persisted. Having reviewed the state\u2019s constitutional claim in this respect, however, I conclude that it is absolutely meritless. It is too plain to require elaboration that the legislature had a rational basis for making the readily demonstrable existence of the legal matrimonial bond rather than the vagueness of such a standard as the viability of a marriage in fact the criterion for distinguishing the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70a and 53a-70 from the related offense of sexual assault in spousal or cohabiting relationships in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70b.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Accordingly, I agree with the result reached by the majority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
