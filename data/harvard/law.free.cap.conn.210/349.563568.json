The dispositive issue is whether DPUC correctly concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e required the plaintiff, Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P), to purchase all of the electrical output of the defendant Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority (SCRRRA) at the so-called \u201cmunicipal rate.\u201d We conclude that General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e does not require this and therefore order a remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Examination of the record discloses that on June 8, 1987, SCRRRA filed a petition with DPUC pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 16-243a (c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 16-243e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petition sought a declaratory ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>determining the amounts and the prices that CL&amp;P would be required to pay for the electrical output generated by the SCRRRA municipal solid waste disposal facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">In accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 16-2 (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the matter was assigned to a panel of three of DPUC's five commissioners for a hearing and decision. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-8 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a member of DPUC\u2019s staff, who was also a member of the Connecticut bar, was designated as a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing, ascertain the facts, and make a report thereon to the commissioners. Following six public hearings on the matter, the three commissioners issued their unanimous ruling on October 9,1987. The gravamen of their decision was that General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e mandated that (1) the plaintiff CL&amp;P was to purchase all of SCRRRA\u2019s electrical output, and (2) CL&amp;P was to pay SCRRRA for the electricity at the \u201cmunicipal rate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On November 5,1987, CL&amp;P filed an administrative appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>utes \u00a7\u00a7 16-35<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 4-183 (a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> naming as defendants, DPUC, consumer counsel and SCRRRA. Thereafter, on December 14, 1987, the trial court, <em>Shaughnessy, </em>Jgranted motions to intervene filed by the defendant towns of Groton, Guilford, East Lyme, Griswold, Ledyard, New London, North Stonington, Stonington and Preston. On April 11,1988, pursuant to their stipulation and at the request of all the parties, the court, <em>Allen, J., </em>reserved the matter for the consideration and advice of the Appellate Court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 4147<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 4148.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On August 4, 1988, we transferred the matter to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The defendant SCRRRA is a municipal resource recovery authority established by the joint resolution of its eleven member towns,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in accordance with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 7-273aa.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> SCRRRA proposes to build in the town of Preston a $72,000,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>private power production facility<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that is designed to dispose of municipal solid waste. The waste will be burned through the use of a mass-burning grate system and boiler combination to produce steam that will in turn energize turbines and thereby generate electricity. The Preston facility will not only serve the salutary function of producing electricity, but will also provide the member towns with a means of disposing of their solid waste at a time when their available landfill space is dwindling rapidly.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The plaintiff CL&amp;P is a public service company that sells gas and electricity to its various customers throughout Connecticut. It either purchases the electricity at a wholesale price or generates the electricity at a cost that is generally lower than the price for which it sells it to others. In regulatory parlance, this is called the \u201cavoided cost\u201d of the electricity. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This must be contrasted with the higher \u201cmunicipal rate\u201d which is the amount that CL&amp;P charges it municipal customers. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e, footnote 3, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">CL&amp;P\u2019s customers include residents in eight of the eleven communities belonging to SCRRRA. Its service area, however, does not include the town of Norwich, the Jewett City borough of Griswold or the entire city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>of Groton and a portion of the town of Groton. Approximately 30 percent of the total tonnage to be consumed at the SCRRRA solid waste facility will come from these three communities whose residents are not CL&amp;P customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">As owner of the proposed private power production facility, SCRRRA will be a private power producer within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 16-243b (a) (3).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> CL&amp;P, as a public service company, is required under the provisions of \u00a7 16-243a (b) to \u201c[p]urchase any electrical energy and capacity made available, directly by a private power producer [SCRRRA].\u201d The rate to be paid for the electricity generated by the private power producer is to be \u201cbased on the full avoided costs of the electric public service company . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">SCRRRA\u2019s facility, however, in addition to being a private power production facility will also be a resources recovery facility within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-260 (11).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This being the case, a public service company such as CL&amp;P is required to purchase the electrical output of such a facility \u201cat the same rate that the electric company charges the municipality or municipalities for electricity.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, by paying the higher \u201cmunicipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>rate,\u201d the stockholders and customers of public service companies subsidize the resources recovery facility by purchasing its electrical output at a price higher than the public service company could purchase it or generate it elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The DPUC ruling concluded that \u00a7 16-243e required CL&amp;P to purchase all of SCRRRA\u2019s electrical output for twenty-five years and to pay for the same at the \u201cmunicipal rate\u201d for the first twenty years of the contract. Over the term of the contract, the resulting CL&amp;P subsidy is estimated to be $105,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">CL&amp;P appealed this ruling contending that \u00a7 16-243e as construed by DPUC: (1) preempts the letter and purposes of the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 in violation of the supremacy clause of the United States constitution; (2) violates the commerce clause of the United States constitution; (3) unconstitutionally takes CL&amp;P\u2019s property for public use without just compensation; and (4) unconstitutionally deprives CL&amp;P of the equal protection of the laws. CL&amp;P further argues that DPUC misconstrued \u00a7 16-243e in entering its order. We agree with CL&amp;P that the statute was misapplied to the factual circumstances evident here and do not, therefore, reach the constitutional issues raised. We, therefore, remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">CL&amp;P argued to DPUC that only 70 percent of the municipal solid waste that would fuel the resources recovery facility came from municipalities served by CL&amp;P. CL&amp;P argued that it should therefore have to pay for only 70 percent of the electrical output at the higher municipal rate required by \u00a7 16-243e and that it should be able to purchase the remaining 30 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of the output at the avoided cost rate prescribed by \u00a7 16-243a. DPUC rejected this argument stating in its declaratory ruling that \u201c[t]he statute [\u00a7 16-243e] states simply that an electric company \u2018purchasing electricity\u2019 shall enter into contracts at the statutory rate. It makes no mention, by way of limitation on this obligation, in regard to where the waste for the electricity originates from.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Generally, this court accords \u201cconsiderable deference to the construction given a statute by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 115, 120, 513 A.2d 139, cert. denied sub nom. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>479 U.S. 964, 107 S. Ct. 466, 93 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986). However, \u201cthe construction of a statute on an issue that has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny is a question of law on which an administrative ruling is not entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 423, 521 A.2d 569 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e establishes a special rate to be paid by electric companies for the purchase of \u201celectricity generated by a resources recovery facility . . . owned by or operated by or for the benefit of a municipality . . . .\u201d This rate is \u201cthe same rate that the electric company charges the municipality or municipalities for electricity.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e. The special rate to be paid by the electric company under \u00a7 16-243e, therefore, is the same rate that it charges the municipality for electricity. We emphasize that these rates are to be equivalent. If the electric company is not charging the municipality anything for its electricity, it follows that the municipality may not charge the electric company under \u00a7 16-243e for the electricity it may produce. Since CL&amp;P was charging Groton, Norwich and Jewett City nothing for electricity, CL&amp;P is not required to pay SCRRRA at the munic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ipal rate prescribed in \u00a7 16-243e for the 30 percent of its electrical output that is forecast to be generated by the municipal solid waste contributed by those three communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">This, of course, is not to say that CL&amp;P has no obligation to purchase the electricity. General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach electric public service company . . . shall: (1) Purchase any electrical energy and capacity made available ... by a private power producer . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (c) (2) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe rates for electricity purchased from a private power producer shall be based on the full avoided costs of the electric public service company . . . regardless of whether the purchaser [electric public service company] is simultaneously making sales to the private power producer.\u201d Here there is no statutory linkage between the rate paid and the rate charged, simply a clear mandate to purchase all of the electricity at the avoided costs of the electric public service company.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">To the reserved question \u201cDoes the Decision of the Department of Public Utility Control, dated October 6, 1987, in Docket No. 87-06-12 (\u2018Decision\u2019) err in interpreting and applying Section 16-243e of the General Statutes by requiring plaintiff The Connecticut Light and Power Company (\u2018CL&amp;P\u2019) to purchase all of the electricity generated by defendant Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority (\u2018SCRRRA\u2019)?\u201d the answer is \u201cYes.\u201d There is error and the matter is remanded to DPUC for a recalculation of the rates to be paid by CL&amp;P to SCRRRA through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>application of both General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a and General Statutes \u00a7 16-243e.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-176 provides: \u201cdeclaratory rulings. Each agency may, in its discretion, issue declaratory rulings as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any regulation or order of the agency, and each agency shall provide by regulation for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions seeking such rulings. If the agency issues an adverse ruling, the remedy for an aggrieved person shall be an action for declaratory judgment under section 4-175 unless the agency conducted a hearing pursuant to sections 4-177 and 4-178 for the purpose of finding facts as a basis for such ruling, in which case the remedy for an aggrieved person shall be an appeal pursuant to section 4-183. If the agency fails to exercise its discretion to issue such a ruling, such failure shall be deemed a sufficient request by the plaintiff for the purposes of section 4-175. Rulings disposing of petitions have the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This section was subsequently revised by Public Acts 1988, No. 88-317.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-243a (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe department of public utility control, with respect to electric public service companies . . . shall establish rates and conditions of service for: (1) The purchase of electrical energy and capacity made available by a private power producer ....
