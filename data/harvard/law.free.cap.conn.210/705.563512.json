J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH6\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the doctrine of commercial impracticability excuses a developer from submitting construction plans when he discovers that necessary financing has become unavailable. The plaintiffs, Timothy E. Dills and the Neecon Corporation, sued the defendants, the town of Enfield (town) and the Enfield development agency (agency), to recover a $100,000 deposit Dills had paid the agency under an option and contract for sale. The trial court referred the case to Attorney J. Read Murphy, a state trial referee appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4). Following a hearing and the parties\u2019 submission of briefs, the referee reported his findings of fact and recommended that judgment enter for the plaintiffs. The trial court rejected the referee\u2019s recommendation, instead rendering judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff Neecon Corporation appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the case here pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">The relevant facts reported by the referee, accepted by the trial court and supported by the record are as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>follows. The town of Enfield instructed its development agency to solicit private developers for the Enfield Memorial Industrial Park to be constructed on town property. Pursuant to an earlier option agreement, on May 1, 1974, the plaintiff Dills and the development agency entered into a contract for the sale of the land to be developed. Dills at that time paid a $100,000 deposit toward the contract price of $985,900. The plaintiff Neecon Corporation, owned by Dills, was to perform the necessary work, and has become, by virtue of an assignment from Dills, the only remaining plaintiff in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Under the terms of the contract, the development agency agreed to convey the property to the developer sixty days after the fulfillment of two conditions: (1) the submission and approval of construction plans in accordance with section 301 of the contract;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the submission of evidence of financial capacity in accordance with section 304 of the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract also included provisions for its termination by either party. Section 702 (b) of the contract allowed the developer to withdraw and to reclaim his deposit if, after the preparation of construction plans satisfactory to the agency, the developer could not obtain the necessary mortgage financing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 703 (b) of the contract allowed the agency to terminate the contract, retaining the deposit as liquidated damages, if the developer failed to submit acceptable construction plans.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>Dills never submitted construction plans that were acceptable to the agency. A set of plans denominated \u201cpreliminary\u201d was rejected by the agency on June 24, 1974. The agency accepted a revised set of \u201cpreliminary plans\u201d and drawings three months later, but demanded the submission of full construction plans and specifications by early December. The referee found that the preliminary sets of plans did not themselves meet the definition of \u201cconstruction plans\u201d in section 301.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The referee agreed with the agency\u2019s interpretation of section 301 of the contract as requiring the developer to submit full construction plans within 210 days of the agency\u2019s approval of preliminary plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The reason Dills failed to submit construction plans was that, despite diligent efforts, he was unable to obtain mortgage financing. Thereafter, both parties attempted, with proper notification, to invoke the contract\u2019s termination clauses. On December 19, 1974, the agency, having been informed by Dills of his financial difficulties, voted to terminate the agreement pursuant to section 703 (b) of the contract of sale and to retain the $100,000 deposit as liquidated damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>December 22,1974, Dills\u2019 attorney notified the agency that, because of Dills\u2019 inability to obtain financing within the time specified in the contract,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dills was terminating the agreement pursuant to section 702 (b) of the contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">In the referee\u2019s view, although Dills had never submitted anything more than \u201cpreliminary plans,\u201d the fact that he could not obtain financing had become evident and \u201c[t]he costly rendition of detailed drawings and specifications which were part of the Construction Plans thus became a useless act.\u201d He concluded, therefore, that \u201c[t]he duty of [Dills] to provide full Construction Plans by December, 1974 was discharged by supervening impracticability.\u201d Accordingly, he recommended that the plaintiffs recover their $100,000 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">After unsuccessful efforts to persuade the referee to make material changes in his report, the defendants moved the trial court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 440, to reject the report and refer the case to another <em>referee </em>for a new trial, or to revoke the reference and leave the case to be disposed of in court. Alternatively, the defendants took exception in the trial court to the referee\u2019s report and findings of fact and moved the court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 439, to grant the corrections they had proposed in their motion to correct and to strike the corrections granted at the plaintiff\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">On July 14, 1988, the trial court issued its decision rejecting the referee\u2019s recommendation that judgment enter for the plaintiffs. The court accepted the referee\u2019s findings that the plans submitted by Dills were preliminary plans but not construction plans as defined by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>the contract. It also accepted the finding that Dills had unsuccessfully engaged in \u201cdiligent efforts\u201d to secure financing. Reviewing the history of the contract negotiations between the parties, the court held that the defendants were entitled to judgment. The court noted that the town had been concerned about the developer\u2019s reliability because an earlier option agreement between Dills and the town, concerning this same property, had failed to come to fruition. In response, Dills had publicly assured the town \u201cthat he was going to be putting $250,000 on the line,\u201d the contemplated cost of preparing the construction plans. Because the various contract provisions, including the furnishing of construction plans, had been bargained for, the court concluded that Dills could not invoke the doctrine of impracticability in this case. Absent a showing of the impracticability of preparing and submitting construction plans, the court held that \u201cthe facts found by the attorney-referee can only lead to one conclusion,\u201d i.e., judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">After the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the plaintiff Neecon took the present appeal. It claims that the trial court erred in (1) rendering judgment for the defendants, rather than either rendering judgment for the plaintiffs or revoking the reference to the attorney state trial referee and remanding the case for further findings by an appropriate factfinder, and (2) finding facts not found by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>attorney state trial referee. We conclude that the trial court did not err either procedurally or substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">In its procedural attack on the trial court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff proceeds from the premise that reference of a case to an attorney trial referee necessarily limits the subsequent authority of the trial court to address issues of law. According to the plaintiff, the issuance of a referee\u2019s report deprives the court of authority to render any judgment except that recommended by the referee. The plaintiff maintains that, if the court, disagreeing with the referee, decides to reject the report, the court must refer the case for a new trial either before a new referee or before another trial judge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">This court discussed the relationship between attorney trial referees and trial court judges in <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 496, 508 A.2d 415 (1986), in which we upheld the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 52-434 (a) (4), the statute authorizing the chief justice to appoint such referees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We concluded that, although attorney trial referees could act as fact-finders, in the same manner as committees appointed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-425; id., 504-505; they lacked the power to render judgments. Id., 502. The reports of referees are therefore \u201creviewable in accordance with well established procedures prior to the rendition of judgment by the court. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 428 through 445.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 250, 524 A.2d 610 (1987); <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Lenhart, </em>158 Conn. 611, 612, 259 A.2d 643 (1969). As provided in Practice Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>\u00a7 434, a referee\u2019s determinations of law in his or her report are not binding on the court. <em>Seal Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bozak, Inc., </em>supra, 509-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Our holding in <em>Seal Audio, Inc., </em>necessarily implies that the trial court has the power to render whatever judgment appropriately follows, as a matter of law, from the facts found by the attorney trial referee. The nondelegable judicial duty to render judgments is not limited to endorsement of the decision recommended by the referee. The trial court\u2019s unlimited authority in this regard is underscored by the first sentence of Practice Book \u00a7 443, which provides, without qualification: \u201cThe court shall render <em>such judgment as the law </em>requires upon the facts in the report as it may be corrected.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the remainder of Practice Book \u00a7 443 contemplates the possibility of further proceedings before a referee or a court, we construe that direction to apply only when a trial court discovers material errors in the referee\u2019s factual findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Rostenberg-Doern Co. </em>v. <em>Weiner, </em>17 Conn. App. 294, 300, 552 A.2d 827 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">We therefore conclude that the trial court had the inherent authority, even without a request for judgment by the defendants, to render whatever judgment was appropriate in light of the facts found by the attorney trial referee. There was no procedural impediment to the trial court\u2019s exercise of this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Even though the trial court had jurisdiction to render an appropriate judgment, the outstanding unre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>voked reference of the litigation to the attorney trial referee deprived the trial court of the authority to retry the case. The court could not find additional facts or reject others \u201cunless a material fact has been found without evidence or the [referee] has failed to find an admitted or undisputed fact, or has found a fact in such doubtful language that its real meaning does not appear.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 439; <em>see Bowman v. 1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>supra, 256-57; <em>Cohn v. Hartford, </em>130 Conn. 699, 704-705, 37 A.2d 237 (1944). Thus, our review of the substantive merits of the trial court\u2019s judgment devolves into two questions: (1) did the court exceed its authority by finding additional facts or rejecting facts found by the referee; and (2) did the court err in applying the law to the facts found?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly exercised the role of factfinder by concluding that: (1) the parties had \u201cbargained for\u201d the two contract provisions at issue herein (the provisions for submission of construction plans and for financing); and (2) the contract provisions were clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial court expressly disavowed such a role. We hold that the trial court did not exceed its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly found facts about the bargaining process that led to the contract in this case. The trial court did recount the history of the transaction, and noted the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>ants\u2019 allegation that Dills had indicated his readiness to invest $250,000 in procuring construction plans. The referee made no finding that the contract between the parties had resulted from the defendants\u2019 reliance on this representation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we fail to perceive how the plaintiff was injured by the trial court\u2019s comments. The referee never found that the parties had <em>not </em>bargained for the contractual provisions here at issue. What motivated the defendants to enter into the contract is unimportant in this case. What is important is that the parties intended that Dills assume full financial responsibility until such time as he submitted construction plans acceptable to the defendants, and the referee so found.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The plaintiff also contends that the trial court\u2019s statement that the \u201ccontract provisions are clear and unambiguous\u201d in effect rejects the referee\u2019s finding that they were indeed ambiguous. The plaintiff contends that the referee\u2019s findings that section 301 called for a two-step procedure (preliminary plans followed by full construction plans within 210 days) and that zoning approval led the developer to the next two steps (arranging financing and preparing detailed drawings and specifications sufficient to build the building) amounted to a finding of ambiguity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Examination of the reason given in the referee\u2019s report for discharging the plaintiffs of their contractual obligation demonstrates that the trial court read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the report correctly. The referee made no express finding that there was any ambiguity in the provisions in sections 303 or 702 (b) of the contract,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> which required the plaintiffs to submit acceptable construction documents <em>before </em>they could claim contractual relief because of financial adversity. Notably, the referee did not base his discharge of the plaintiffs on a finding that the parties had intended the termination clause in the contract to provide relief for the plaintiffs in the present circumstances. In invoking the doctrine of commercial impracticability, the referee determined that, although the contract unambiguously imposed on the plaintiffs a contractual duty to perform, the plaintiffs should nonetheless be excused from their nonperformance because of supervening circumstances.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The referee\u2019s earlier statements that other parts of section 301 were confusing did not contradict his implicit finding that the contract clearly made the submission of construction plans a condition precedent to recovering the deposit. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not exceed its authority by impermissibly engaging in fact-finding contrary to the report of the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Finally we must decide whether the trial court erred as a matter of law in rejecting the referee\u2019s determination, endorsed by the plaintiff on appeal, that the impracticability doctrine excused Dills\u2019 failure to deliver construction plans to the agency. The plaintiff contends that Dills\u2019 inability to obtain such financing made submitting the construction plans a \u201cfutile\u201d and \u201cuseless act,\u201d and therefore the doctrine of supervening imprac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>ticability discharged his duty to submit the plans. We hold, as did the trial court, that \u201c[t]he doctrine of impracticability and impossibility . . . [is] not relevant to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The impracticability<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> doctrine represents an exception to the accepted maxim of <em>pacta sunt servanda, </em>in recognition of the fact that certain conditions cannot be met because of unforeseen occurrences. Cf. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>206 Conn. 409, 413, 538 A.2d 219 (1988). A party claiming that a supervening event or contingency has prevented, and thus excused, a promised performance must demonstrate that: (1) the event made the performance impracticable; (2) the nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assumption on which the contract was made; (3) the impracticability resulted without the fault of the party seeking to be excused; and (4) the party has not assumed a greater obligation than the law imposes. 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 261; E. Farnsworth, Contracts (1982) \u00a7 9.6, p. 678. We discuss only the first two prongs of this test in disposing of the plaintiff\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Although courts in recent years have liberalized the requirements for such an excuse; see G. Gilmore, The Death of Contract (1972) pp. 80-81; H. Berman, \u201cExcuse for Nonperformance in Light of Contract Practices in International Trade,\u201d 63 Colum. L. Rev. 1413, 1414 (1963); only in the most exceptional circumstances have courts concluded that a duty is discharged because additional financial burdens make performance less practical than initially contemplated. See, e.g., <em>Neal-Cooper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>Grain Co. </em>v. <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., </em>508 F.2d 283, 294 (7th Cir. 1974) (party not allowed \u201cto escape a bad bargain merely because it is burdensome\u201d); <em>American Trading &amp; Production Corporation </em>v. <em>Shell International Marine, Ltd., </em>453 F.2d 939, 942 (2d Cir. 1972) (closing of Suez Canal requiring charterer to sail nearly twice as many miles at a cost of nearly one third more than the contract price does not excuse performance); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wegematic Corporation, </em>360 F.2d 674, 676-77 (2d Cir. 1966) (duty of manufacturer to produce revolutionary computer system not excused because of \u201cengineering difficulties\u201d requiring two years and $1.5 million to correct); <em>Peerless Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Weymouth Gardens, </em>215 F.2d 362, 364 (1st Cir. 1954) (increased costs caused by the unexpected outbreak of war does not constitute superior force ending obligation of contract); <em>Matter of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, </em>517 F. Sup. 440, 452-53 (E.D. Va. 1981) (duty to remove spent fuel not excused merely because reprocessing of the fuel became unprofitable); see also Connecticut General Statutes Annotated \u00a7 42a-2-614, comment 4; E. Farnsworth, supra, p. 680; 6 A. Cor-bin, Contracts (1962) \u00a7 1333; 16 S. Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. Jaeger 1978) \u00a7 1968; J. White &amp; R. Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (2d Ed. 1980) \u00a7 3-9, pp. 131-32. Thus, the fact that preparing the construction plans would have cost Dills a great deal of money (more than the deposit he sought to recover) did not excuse him from submitting them as the contract provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Furthermore, the event upon which the obligor relies to excuse his performance cannot be an event that the parties foresaw at the time of the contract. We have previously held that \u201c[t]he regular enforcement of conditions is . . . subject to the competing but equally well established principle that the occurrence of a condition may be excused in the event of impracticability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number><em>\u2018if the occurrence of the condition is not a material part of the agreed exchange </em>and forfeiture would otherwise result.\u2019 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 271; 6 Cor-bin, Contracts (1962) \u00a7 1362; 5 Williston, Contracts (3d Ed. 1961) \u00a7 793.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Grenier </em>v. <em>Compratt Construction Co., </em>189 Conn. 144, 148-49, 454 A.2d 1289 (1983); see also <em>West Haven Sound Development Corporation </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>201 Conn. 305, 313, 514 A.2d 734 (1986). Thus, the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d is whether the nonoccurrence of the alleged impracticable condition \u201cwas a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-615 (a);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 261;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> E. Farnsworth, supra, \u00a7 9.6, pp. 679-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In this case the contingency upon which fulfilling the contract allegedly depended was Dills\u2019 obtaining the requisite financing. We cannot conclude, however, that Dills\u2019 failure to obtain financing was \u201can event the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made.\u201d Indeed, section 702 (b) of the contract of sale demonstrates that the parties expressly contemplated that Dills might encounter financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>difficulties. The contract allowed Dills to terminate for this reason \u201cafter preparation of Construction Plans satisfactory to the Agency.\u201d If \u201can event is foreseeable, a party who makes an unqualified promise to perform necessarily assumes an obligation to perform, even if the occurrence of the event makes performance impracticable.\u201d E. Farnsworth, supra, p. 686.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">This case, like virtually every case involving discharge from an obligation to perform, concerns the issue of which party bears the loss resulting from an event that renders performance by one party uneconomical. See R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law (3d Ed. 1986) pp. 93-94; R. Posner &amp; A. Rosenfield, \u201cImpossibility and Related Doctrines in Contract Law: An Economic Analysis,\u201d 6 J. Legal Stud. 83, 86-87 (1977). \u201cDetermining whether the non-occurrence of a particular event was or was not a basic assumption involves a judgment as to which party assumed the risk of its occurrence .... In making such determinations, a court will look at all circumstances, including the terms of the contract.\u201d 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts, c. 11, introductory note. \u201cSince impossibility and related doctrines are devices for shifting risk in accordance with the parties\u2019 presumed intentions, which are to minimize the costs of contract performance, one of which is the disutility created by risk, they have no place when the contract explicitly assigns a particular risk to one party or the other.\u201d <em>Northern Indiana Public Service Co. </em>v. <em>Carbon County Coal Co., </em>799 F.2d 265, 278 (7th Cir. 1986); see also <em>Wasserman Theatrical Enterprise, Inc. </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>137 Conn. 371, 374-75, 77 A.2d 329 (1950). Where, as in this case, sophisticated contracting parties have negotiated termination pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>visions, courts should be slow to invent additional ways to excuse performance. We exercise such caution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\"> Section 301 of the contract of sale provided: \u201cplans for construction.

Our review of the record and the transcript of the plaintiffs postjudgment motion reveals that it did not bring these claims to the attention of the trial court, and therefore we do not review them.
