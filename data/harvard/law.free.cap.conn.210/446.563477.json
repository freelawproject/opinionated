Gonzalez, was found guilty by a jury of operating a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>1985) \u00a7 14-227a (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>14 Conn. App. 216, 541 A.2d 115 (1988), the Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his request for an instruction on the lesser offense of operating while impaired. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issues: \u201cDid the Appellate Court erroneously conclude (1) that General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (b) (Rev. to 1985) provides that one commits the offense of driving while impaired only when one\u2019s blood alcohol ratio falls between .07 and .1 percent, and (2) that driving while impaired is not a lesser included offense of driving while under the influence?\u201d We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The facts are fully set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra. In brief, on the night of June 21,1985, the Connecticut state police were conducting a \u201cspot check\u201d for drunk drivers at the West Haven toll plaza on Interstate 95. At approximately 11 o\u2019clock, the defendant pulled into the toll plaza in the eastbound lane. State police trooper Robert Peterson detected a strong odor of alcohol emanating from the defendant, and directed him to drive his car to an adjacent parking lot. At the trial, Peterson testifed that the defendant\u2019s walk was unsteady, his speech slurred, his eyes glassy, and his face flushed. Peterson conducted four field sobriety tests, including a test requiring the defendant, who claimed he knew English, to recite the alphabet in English and Spanish. The defendant was unable to recite the alphabet in either language. Peterson con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>eluded from the defendant\u2019s performance of the tests that he was intoxicated, and placed him under arrest for operating while under the influence in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (a). After the defendant had been advised of his rights, he told Peterson that he had consumed six beers and one half pint of rum on his drive from New York City to the toll plaza. Peterson testified that he had observed several empty beer cans and an empty rum bottle on the front seat of the defendant\u2019s car. There was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content admitted at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The defendant testified that he had driven his girlfriend from Wallingford to New York City and was returning home at the time he was stopped. He admitted that he had consumed some alcohol during the course of his trip down to New York, but claimed that he had not consumed any on the return trip and, further, that there were no empty alcohol containers in his car. He also testified that he had not told Peterson anything about having been drinking. He further stated that the alcohol he had consumed had not affected his driving and that he had walked without stumbling or swaying. The defendant\u2019s sister testified that the defendant had called her between 11:00 and 11:30 p.m. and had asked her to come to the toll plaza parking lot. She testified that when she arrived there, between midnight and 12:30 a.m., the defendant did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The defendant submitted a request to the trial court to charge the jury on the lesser offense of operating while impaired and on the meaning of \u201cimpaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (b). The trial court declined to instruct the jury as requested. The defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to ninety days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>imprisonment, execution suspended, two years of probation, and a $1000 fine, plus fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The test for determining whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense is well established. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) the evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 584, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 396-97, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">In the present case, a majority of the Appellate Court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s request for a lesser offense instruction. It held that a prosecution for the offense of operating while impaired under \u00a7 14-227a (b) is only warranted when evidence exists that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol ratio at the time of the alleged offense was greater than .07 percent but less than .1 percent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 222. It ruled, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claim failed the third prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test since there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol to justify a conviction under \u00a7 14-227a (b). Id., 222-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>As a predicate to his claim that operating a motor vehicle while impaired under \u00a7 14-227a (b) is a lesser included offense of operating while under the influence under \u00a7 14-227a (a), the defendant argues that the Appellate Court erred in concluding that driving while impaired under subsection (b) can be proven only with evidence that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol ratio falls between .07 and .1 percent. He claims that the language of subsection (b), which prohibited a person from operating a motor vehicle \u201cwhile his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor,\u201d proscribed behavior, and, therefore, a violation of subsection (b) may be proven with behavioral evidence alone. As a corollary to this point, the defendant contends that, because subsection (b) did not require proof of a blood alcohol content within the proscribed range, a defendant could be convicted for violating this section upon proof that his driving was \u201cimpaired\u201d in any degree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In analyzing the import of a statute, we first look to its plain language. Where that language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for interpretation and, hence, no need to resort to extrinsic sources as an aid to interpretation. See, <em>e.g., Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 455, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988). Our task is to construe a statute as a whole and to harmonize its disparate sections within the bounds of reason. See, e.g., <em>University of Connecticut Chapter, AAUP </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>200 Conn. 386, 399, 512 A.2d 152 (1986). Further, \u201c[cjriminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In reviewing the language of \u00a7 14-227a, several distinguishing features between the offense of operating while under the \u201cinfluence\u201d and the offense of oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ating while \u201cimpaired\u201d are immediately apparent. Operating under the influence was prohibited by \u00a7 14-227a (a), which provided that \u201c[n]o person shall operate a motor vehicle . . . while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection (b) provided that \u201c[n]o person shall operate a motor vehicle . . . while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor. A person shall be deemed impaired when at the time of the alleged offense the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was more than seven-hundredths of one per cent of alcohol, by weight, but less than ten-hundredths of one per cent of alcohol, by weight.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, we note the obvious absence of any language specifically defining the factor \u201cdeemed\u201d to constitute \u201cunder the influence\u201d in subsection (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided for the admissibility, under certain specified con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ditions, of blood alcohol content evidence in any prosecution for violating subsection (a) or (b). Under subsection (c) (7), chemical analysis evidence in a prosecution for operating while under the <em>influence </em>was admissible provided that \u201cadditional competent evidence is presented bearing on the question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both.\u201d Here, we note that this \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d provision was conspicuously omitted as a requirement in a prosecution under subsection (b), the operation while <em>impaired </em>subsection. Thus, unlike a prosecution for operating while under the influence, in order to admit blood alcohol content evidence in a prosecution for operating while impaired, subsection (c) did not require the production of additional competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provided for the evidentiary effect of different ratios of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>blood alcohol content. There are two aspects of this subsection critical to our analysis. First, subsection (d) (3) provided that evidence of a blood alcohol content greater than .07 percent but less than .1 percent \u201cshall constitute impairment within the meaning of this section.\u201d There were no other references to the term \u201cimpairment\u201d in subsection (d). Second, subsection (d) (2) provided that evidence of a blood alcohol content greater than .05 percent but less than .1 percent would not give rise to any presumption \u201cthat the defendant was or was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the defendant was under such influence within the meaning of this section.\u201d There was no such provision contemplating the use or need of \u201cother competent evidence\u201d in subsection (d) (3) pertaining to \u201cimpairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">A reading of subsections (a) through (d) of \u00a7 14-227a makes it clear that the language \u201cdeemed impaired\u201d of subsection (b) and \u201cshall constitute impairment\u201d of subsection (d) attached an exclusive definitional effect to the term \u201cimpairment\u201d as used in \u00a7 14-227a. Further, the admission and consideration of \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d only applied to prosecutions for operating under the influence under subsection (a). Consequently, a defendant could be convicted of operating while \u201cimpaired\u201d only when evidence was introduced demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was greater than .07 percent and less than .1 percent. Because the offense of operating while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cimpaired\u201d was defined, by operation of the terms \u201cdeemed\u201d and \u201cshall constitute,\u201d as operating while one\u2019s blood alcohol content fell within the proscribed range, and because the statute contemplated that \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d was necessary only in a prosecution for operating while under the influence, it necessarily follows that \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d additional to evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time he or she operated the motor vehicle was immaterial in a prosecution for operating while \u201cimpaired\u201d under subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that one could be proven to be \u201cimpaired\u201d on the basis of \u201cother competent evidence,\u201d and, therefore, one could violate subsection (b) if one\u2019s ability to drive is impaired in any degree, requires an unduly broad reading of subsection (b). Such a reading contravenes the principle that criminal statutes are to be narrowly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendant also argues that the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion is irreconcilable with: (A) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (f);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (B) General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227b,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the \u201cimplied consent law\u201d; and (C) our opinion in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 513 A.2d 638 (1986). We consider each of these arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant contends that the Appellate Court\u2019s reading of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (b) is inconsistent with \u00a7 14-227a (f). Subsection (f) provided that evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test was admissible in prosecutions for either operating while under the influence or operating while impaired. The defendant queries: why would the legislature authorize the use of an adverse inference from a defendant\u2019s failure to submit to a test if it did not contemplate that evidence other than blood alcohol content evidence would suffice to convict him of operating while impaired?</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Appellate Court attempted to explain subsection (f) by stating: \u201cIt is . . . likely . . . that the legislature knew that blood alcohol evidence which indicates impairment may come from sources other than a test administered by the police, such as a test conducted by a medical expert at the defendant\u2019s request. Impairment could thus be established even though the defendant elected not to take the test provided by the police.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 223-24 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Whatever the merits may be of the Appellate Court\u2019s explanation, we are not persuaded that the language of subsection (f) undercuts the unmistakable intent of the legislature as expressed in subsections (a) through (d) that operating while impaired exclusively meant operating while one\u2019s blood alcohol ratio fell within the proscribed range. Because subsection (f) presents us with an ambiguity, an analysis of the pertinent legislative history is in order. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The relevant provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a originated in 1983 in Substitute House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Bill No. 6420. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 225-33 <em>(Bieluch, J., </em>dissenting) (analyzing legislative history); Public Acts 1983, No. 83-534. The bill initially provided that the offense of operating while impaired was committed when a person operated a motor vehicle while his or her blood alcohol content was .05 percent or more but less than .1 percent. Significantly, the bill also required that \u201cadditional competent evidence [must be] presented indicating that . . . the ability of such person to operate . . . was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor.\u201d The bill further provided for the admission into evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to take a blood alcohol test in prosecutions for either operating while under the influence or operating while impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Subsequently, House amendment schedule \u201cA\u201d made the following changes: (1) the floor of the blood alcohol content to establish operating while impaired was raised from at least .05 percent to greater than .07 percent; (2) the \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d provision was struck and the present language that operating with the proscribed blood alcohol content would be \u201cdeemed impaired\u201d was added; and (3) a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a test was now admissible only in prosecutions for operating under the influence. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. .19,1983 Sess., pp. 6692-94. Thereafter, however, House amendment schedule \u201cD\u201d restored the original bill\u2019s provision allowing for the admissibility of evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a test in prosecutions both for operating while under the influence and for operating while impaired. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1983 Sess., p. 6725. As the dissenting opinion below correctly notes, the proceedings contain no explanation for the reappearance of this provision. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 227-28 <em>{Bieluch, J., </em>dissenting). The House of Representatives, however, subsequently rejected a further amendment, schedule \u201cL,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>would have made the designated blood alcohol content \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d of operating while impaired, replacing the \u201cshall constitute impairment\u201d language that became part of subsection (d). Further, schedule \u201cL\u201d would have restored the original language requiring \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d in a prosecution for operating while impaired. 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 19, 1983 Sess., p. 6820.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The Senate\u2019s proceedings respecting Public Acts 1983, No. 83-534, shed little light on the purpose of the provision in subsection (f) allowing the admission into evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a test in a prosecution for operating while impaired. The only relevant comment comes from Senator Owens, who remarked: \u201cIt makes the defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a chemical test admissible in court, something that the United States Supreme Court said there was nothing wrong with and made laudatory.\u201d 26 S. Proc., Pt. 13,1983 Sess., p. 4426, remarks of Senator Howard T. Owens, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Our review of the history of Public Acts 1983, No. 83-534, makes it quite clear that the legislature did not intend to make operating while impaired an offense requiring proof of behavior additional to proof of blood alcohol content. This history demonstrates that the house <em>twice </em>rejected a proposal that would have required \u201cadditional competent evidence\u201d in a prosecution for operating while impaired. Although the history of subsection (f) is unilluminating, we cannot conclude, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that the legislature, by virtue of making a defendant\u2019s refusal to submit to a chemical test admissible in a prosecution for operating while impaired, intended that a defendant could be convicted of that offense on any proof other than proof of blood alcohol content.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The defendant also asserts that the Appellate Court\u2019s analysis of \u00a7 14-227a (b) is irreconcilable with General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227b,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the \u201cimplied consent\u201d law. Subsections (b) through (d) of \u00a7 14-227b established that any person arrested for operating while under the influence or operating while impaired who refused to submit to a blood alcohol content test would lose his or her driver\u2019s license for a period of six months. Under subsection (d), the commissioner of motor vehicles was required to suspend the license upon receipt of a police officer\u2019s report disclosing the operator\u2019s refusal to submit to the test. Subsection (c) provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that \u201c[t]he report shall set forth the grounds for the officer\u2019s belief that there was probable cause to arrest such person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence ... or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor . . . . \u201d The defendant, relying on the. dissenting opinion below, argues that \u201c[s]uch a sworn report and administrative finding of probable cause for arrest in the event of a blood alcohol test refusal must of necessity relate to an arrest for operation while impaired based upon facts other than the proscribed blood alcohol percentages.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 233 <em>(Bieluch, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 14-227b is misplaced. As the state correctly points out, this statute dealt with the administrative requirements for suspending an operator\u2019s license upon his refusal to submit to a chemical analysis. Subsection (c)\u2019s requirement of a sworn report establishing the arresting officer\u2019s probable cause did not purport to be anything more than a prerequisite to the distinct administrative action of suspending the operator\u2019s license. It had nothing to do with a prosecution for the substantive offense of driving while impaired as defined in \u00a7 14-227a.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The defendant also argues that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>supra, 620, this court interpreted the \u201cdeemed impaired\u201d provision of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (b) as an evidentiary tool for presuming legal impairment and not as a means of defining the offense. He claims, therefore, that subsection (b) permits a conviction in the absence of blood alcohol content evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">In <em>Hancich, </em>the defendant was charged under subsection (a) with driving under the influence. The trial court refused to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of driving while impaired. Id., 619. We first observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>that General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 14-227a (d) (4)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> created a rebuttable presumption that a person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor if that individual\u2019s blood alcohol level equalled or exceeded .1 percent. Id., 620-21. \u201cWhile evidence of such an alcohol level was sufficient to establish the state\u2019s prima facie case, the defendant was formerly allowed to introduce evidence to show that, despite a blood alcohol level equal to or greater than .1 percent, he or she had not been <em>under the influence </em>of intoxicating liquor at the time of arrest.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 621. We deduced from this fact the proposition that \u201calthough in the present case the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level was measured at .165 percent, the possibility that she was merely impaired, and not under the influence, cannot be excluded as a matter of law under the former General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (d) (4).\u201d Id. We held, however, that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication \u201cwas such as to exclude completely the possibility that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and operated her vehicle while merely impaired;\u201d id., 621-22; although we noted that \u201c[i]f this were at all a close case, then we might be concerned with the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on the lesser offense of impairment.\u201d Id., 621. Consequently, we determined that the defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>supra, 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">As the defendant conceded at oral argument, because we concluded in <em>Hancich </em>that the defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction under <em>Whistnant, </em>our observation that \u201cthe possibility that [Hancich] was merely impaired, and not under the influence, cannot be excluded as a matter of law\u201d was dictum.
