Following a hearing in probable cause, the defendant pleaded not guilty and elected to be tried by a jury. On December 16, 1985, the trial court, <em>Stoughton, J., </em>ordered a competency evaluation for the defendant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The evaluation was conducted by a clinical team from the department of mental health comprised of a psychiatrist, a pyschiatric social worker and a psychologist. In its report to the court, the team was unanimous in its opinion that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s presumption of competency has been sustained through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>this examination, and that he both understands the legal proceedings against him and can cooperate with counsel in his own defense.\u201d On December 31, 1985, the trial court, <em>Barall, J., </em>ruled that the defendant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">On March 21,1986, the defendant\u2019s counsel, Richard Kelly, filed a motion to withdraw from the case. Attorney Kelly informed the court that if he were \u201cforced to proceed in this particular case, it may well be placing counsel in an irreconcilable ethical conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Barall, J., </em>denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On April 17,1986, two days after the trial began, the defendant pleaded guilty to murder under the doctrine established in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A plea canvass followed. On April 21, 1986, the defendant filed a pro se motion seeking to withdraw his prior guilty plea, electing a trial and requesting the appointment of a special public defender. The trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On May 14,1986, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion requesting a diagnostic psychiatric examination pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-244.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>diagnostic team at the Whiting Forensic Institute concluded that the defendant \u201cwas not mentally ill to an extent that he posed a danger to himself or to others. The team decline[d] to recommend probation and returned] the defendant for sentencing in accordance with his conviction.\u201d On August 20, 1986, the trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to a term of twenty-five years of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea; (2) failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the factual basis for his motion to withdraw his guilty plea; and (3) denying defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw from the case. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Practice Book \u00a7 721 specifies circumstances under which a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea after it has been entered.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[0]nce entered, a guilty plea cannot be withdrawn except by leave of the court, within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>sound discretion, and a denial thereof is reversible only if it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 23, 355 A.2d 49 (1974) . \u201cThe burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>169 Conn. 38, 46, 362 A.2d 499 (1975) .</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The defendant argues that he did not intelligently and voluntarily enter his plea because at the time he entered it he was simply following his attorney\u2019s instructions and did not understand that he would receive a minimum sentence of twenty-five years. He claims, therefore, that he has a plausible reason for withdrawing his plea. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Due process requires that a plea be entered voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S 238, 243 n.5, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L. Ed. 2d 418 (1969); <em>Oppel </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>200 Conn. 553, 556, 512 A.2d 888 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>197 Conn. 337, 341, 497 A.2d 390 (1985). \u201cBecause every valid guilty plea must be demonstrably voluntary, knowing and intelligent, we require the record to disclose an act that represents a knowing choice among available alternative courses of action, an understanding of the law in relation to the facts, and sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences of the plea.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>198 Conn. 598, 604, 504 A.2d 497 (1986). \u201cA determination as to whether a plea has been knowingly and voluntarily entered entails an examination of all of the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 287, 542 A.2d 299 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">The trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>canvassed the defendant concerning the voluntariness of his plea pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 711 through 713 and <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Ala</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>bama, </em>supra. This canvass \u201cnecessarily implies that [the trial court] has made an inquiry into the defendant\u2019s competence to plead.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra. An examination of the plea canvass reveals the following: The defendant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea. The defendant explained to the court that an <em>Alford </em>plea \u201cmeans that they have enough evidence against you.\u201d The court expanded upon the defendant\u2019s definition<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and asked him if he had discussed this with his attorney. The defendant said that he had and that he was satisfied with the advice that his attorney had given him. The court then asked the defendant if he understood that he was giving up his right to a trial by court or jury, along with his right to face and cross-examine witnesses against him, and to bring in any witnesses to testify on his behalf, and that by entering this plea he was incriminating himself and waiving his right against self-incrimination. The defendant responded that he understood the ramifications involved. The state\u2019s attorney then delineated the factual basis that would be produced to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The court then asked the defendant if he was familiar with the maximum penalty that the court could impose on a conviction of murder in the first degree. The defendant responded that it was \u201csixty-years.\u201d The court then asked the defendant if he understood what the minimum sentence would be. He responded that it would be \u201ctwenty-five.\u201d The court then read the defendant the definition of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Finally the court asked the state if there was an agreement as to the penalty to be imposed. The state informed the court that it would be making a recommendation at the time of sentencing of twenty-five years. The defendant stated, in response to the court\u2019s inquiry, that he knew this at the time he entered his plea. The defendant also informed the court that he was not under any threats to plead guilty, that his attorney had been a \u201cgreat lawyer\u201d and had done everything possible to protect his interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In concluding the plea hearing, the court stated that it \u201cwill make a finding that [the defendant] has been advised by competent counsel, he understands his constitutional rights and has waived those rights. He understands fully that he has a right to a trial by Court or jury and has waived it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On April 21,1986, the defendant mailed to the court a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In that motion he stated that he had not intelligently and competently entered his plea and that his attorney had led him astray. The defendant claimed that he had been led to believe that he would receive substantially less than the twenty-five year sentence. On May 7, 1986, a hearing was held on this motion and the trial court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>subsequently denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">A review of all the relevant circumstances clearly indicates that the defendant had intelligently and voluntarily entered his <em>Alford </em>plea. The trial court\u2019s determination on December 31,1985, that he was competent to stand trial, lays to rest any question about the defendant\u2019s capacity to comprehend the charges against him and the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Furthermore, aside from his bald assertion, the defendant produced no evidence that he was simply following his attorney\u2019s instructions when he entered his plea. \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>he was told what to say by his lawyer. To warrant consideration, the defendant must allege and provide facts which would justify permitting him to withdraw his plea . . . . \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Deboben, </em>187 Conn. 469, 474, 446 A.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Finally, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that he was confused at the time he entered the plea. Significantly, it was the defendant and not the trial court who first mentioned that the minimum sentence for a conviction of murder is twenty-five years. Additionally, the defendant told the court that he knew that the state would be recommending a twenty-five year prison term and that he had known this at the time he entered his plea. We are therefore unpersuaded when he now claims that he did not understand that he would receive a twenty-five year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. He argues that the voluntariness of his plea is questionable in light of his mental capabilities and the inadequacy of the trial court record. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of determining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, the court should ordinarily assume any specific allegations of fact to be true. If such allegations furnish a basis for withdrawal of the plea under [Practice Book] \u00a7 721, and are not conclusively refuted by the record of the plea proceedings and other information contained in the court file, then an evidentiary hearing is required.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185-86, 438 A.2d 46 (1980). In light of the record of the plea canvass, the hearing on the motion to withdraw the plea, and examination of the court file, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim of error is conclusively refuted within the meaning of <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The trial court conducted a complete canvass in accordance with the rules of practice and was satisfied that the defendant\u2019s plea had been knowingly and voluntarily entered. As noted above, the defendant\u2019s dialogue with the trial court at the plea canvass furnishes a more than adequate basis for determining his full understanding of his plea and its ramifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Finally, three months prior to the defendant entering his plea, the trial court ordered the commissioner of mental health to effect a competency examination on the defendant. In a unanimous opinion a clinical team found that the defendant \u201cboth understands the legal proceedings against him and can cooperate with counsel in his own defense.\u201d In light of this evaluation, we are unpersuaded that the trial court had an insufficient record upon which to base its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">We find, therefore, that the defendant failed \u201cto sustain his burden of coming forward with sufficiently specific unrefuted factual allegations to require an evidentiary inquiry into his alleged incompetence at the time of the acceptance of his guilty [plea].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>supra, 613-14. Accordingly, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case. The defendant argues that as a result, he did not receive representation free of conflict because his attorney believed him guilty. He further claims that his counsel was ineffective in his representation. We reject both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u201cWhere a constitutional right to counsel exists, our Sixth Amendment cases hold that there is a correlative right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>450 U.S. 261, 271, 101 S. Ct. 1097, 67 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>191 Conn. 622, 626-27, 469 A.2d 1181 (1983). The record here is clear that the reason Attorney Kelly asked to withdraw from the case was not because he believed that the defendant was guilty as the defendant claims, but because the defendant had told him that he, the defendant, wanted to perjure himself on the witness stand. Any conflict which may have existed between the defendant and his attorney \u201cwas one imposed on the attorney by the client\u2019s proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony . . . . \u201d <em>Nix </em>v. <em>Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 173, 106 S. Ct. 988, 89 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1986). Such a conflict, when created by the defendant, does not require the appointment of new counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 684, 535 A.2d 345 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 84, 518 A.2d 1194 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">As the trial court noted, any counsel representing the defendant would have been confronted with the same dilemma. Allowing this attorney, and then all subsequent attorneys, to withdraw from this case would have impaired the defendant\u2019s right to be represented by counsel. This we cannot condone.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u201cWhether the circumstances warrant the appointment of new counsel is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 683. \u201c[Ajbsent a factual record revealing an abuse of [the court\u2019s] discretion, the court\u2019s failure to allow new counsel is not reversible error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>supra, 83; <em>El Idrissi </em>v. <em>El Idrissi, </em>173 Conn. 295, 302-303, 377 A.2d 330 (1977). We note that the motion to withdraw was made and denied in advance of the defendant\u2019s trial. Later, at the time of the plea canvass, the defendant expressed his complete satisfaction with the advice he had received from his attorney. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in denying defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and the defendant was not thereby prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The defendant\u2019s further claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is inappropriate on a direct appeal. Such claims are properly pursued on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, or on a petition for a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>206 Conn. 685, 707, 539 A.2d 561 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tirado, </em>194 Conn. 89, 92-93, 478 A.2d 606 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 578-79, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982). Accordingly, we do not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides: \u201cmurder defined, affirmative defenses, evidence of mental condition, classification, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u201c(b) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, mental defect or other mental abnormality is admissible, in a prosecution under subsection (a), on the question of whether the defendant acted with intent to cause the death of another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\u201c(c) Murder is punishable as a class A felony in accordance with subdivision (2) of section 53a-35a unless it is a capital felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-56d provides in part: \u201ccompetency to stand trial, (a) competency required, definition.
