We hold that the oath must appear in writing on the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien for it to be valid under the statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in upholding the validity of a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien that contained no written oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-34,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on November 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>1987, the defendant electrical contractor filed a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien in Danbury for $494,768, as security for electrical work in the construction of a J. C. Penney store in Danbury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 25, 1988, the plaintiff, J. C. Penney Properties, Inc., filed an application to discharge or reduce the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien. General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a. At the hearing on the application, the plaintiff argued that the certificate failed to satisfy the requirement that it be sworn in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C). The defendant argued that the statute requires only a signing under oath, and that the oath need not be set forth in the document itself. Clifford Gideon, the defendant\u2019s officer who signed the certificate, testified that Richard Raphael, an attorney, had administered an oath prior to the signing of the certificate. Raphael also testified that he had taken Gideon\u2019s statement under oath. The court, <em>Hickey, J., </em>in an oral opinion, denied the plaintiff\u2019s application. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The parties do not dispute that Gideon acknowledged the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien before Raphael.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor is there any question that such an acknowledgment is not equivalent to an oath swearing to the contents of the certificate. \u201cIt is not uncommon for the legislature to require that certain documents be acknowledged or verified. Such an acknowledgment is a public declaration or a formal statement of the person executing an instrument made to the official authorized to take the acknowledgment that the execution of that instrument was his free act and deed. ... On the other hand, a requirement that a document be \u2018sworn to\u2019 contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>plates the execution of an affidavit that the facts contained in it are true. 3 Am. Jur. 2d 380, Affidavits, \u00a7 2.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolfe, </em>156 Conn. 199, 205, 239 A.2d 509 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u201cAn acknowledgment is a verification of the fact of the execution of the instrument but not of its contents. 1 Am. Jur. 316 \u00a7 2, 343 \u00a7 70; 1 Words &amp; Phrases 620; <em>Pittis </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>129 N.Y.S.2d 216, 217 [1954]. A verification, on the other hand, is a sworn statement of the truth of the facts stated in the instrument verified. It always involves the administration of an oath. 1 Am. Jur. 942 \u00a7 13, 949; 44 Words &amp; Phrases 138, 142.\u201d <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>23 Conn. Sup. 296, 298, 182 A.2d 339 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We have long endorsed a policy favoring liberal construction of claimed inadequacies in certificates of mechanics\u2019 liens in order to achieve the remedial purposes of the mechanics\u2019 lien statutes. \u201cProvisions of mechanics\u2019 lien law should be liberally construed so as to reasonably and fairly implement its remedial intent.\u201d <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 553, 441 A.2d 171 (1981). We have also recognized, however, that such a policy has limitations: \u201c[T]he principles that guide our interpretation of mechanic\u2019s lien legislation are well settled. Although this legislation creates a statutory lien in derogation of the common law ... its remedial purpose to furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials requires a generous construction. . . . Generosity of spirit does not, however, permit departure from reasonable compliance with the specific provisions of the statute. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>[141 Conn. 188, 191, 104 A.2d 545 (1954)]; <em>City Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Borsuk, </em>[131 Conn. 640, 645, 41 A.2d 775 (1945)].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Camputaro </em>v. <em>Stuart Hardwood Corporation, </em>180 Conn. 545, 550-51, 429 A.2d 796 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In accordance with this policy, our courts have been liberal in validating liens despite claimed errors on the face of the lien certificate where the mistake was made in good faith and no resulting prejudice was claimed. See, e.g., <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Lutz Engineering Co., </em>supra, 155-56 (copy of certificate served on owner by a subcontractor failed to state its intent to file a lien); <em>Morici </em>v. <em>Jarvie, </em>137 Conn. 97, 102, 75 A.2d 47 (1950) (misstatement of amount due); <em>Pierce, Butler &amp; Pierce Mfg. Corporation </em>v. <em>Enders, </em>118 Conn. 610, 615, 174 A. 169 (1934) (subcontractor mislabeled as contractor and agent); <em>Burque </em>v. <em>Naugatuck Lumber Co., </em>113 Conn. 350, 353, 155 A. 414 (1931) (defect in description); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>89 Conn. 554, 556-57, 94 A. 981 (1915) (inclusion of extra land in certificate); <em>Westland </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>47 Conn. 83, 86 (1879) (erroneous date of completion of work). The defendant, however, has cited no Connecticut case in which a court has validated a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien despite the clear absence of a necessary statutory element of the certificate, nor have we found such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Three Connecticut cases lead us to conclude that the liens in this case are invalid. <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heyward-Robinson Co., </em>supra, is the closest on point. In that case, the Superior Court held that a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien that was merely acknowledged, but not sworn to, was invalid. The only distinction between the present case and <em>Bell &amp; Zajicek, Inc., </em>is the attempted validation of the certificate in this case by the testimony of the oath taker.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The case of <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Alling, </em>84 Conn. 487, 80 A. 782 (1911), is persuasive by analogy. In <em>Kelly, </em>General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 4138<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> allowed the defendant prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>erty owner credit for all the payments he may have made in good faith to an original contractor before receiving notice of a claim of lien by a subcontractor. We held that the notice referred to in \u00a7 4138 referred only to the statutory notice described in General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 4137.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We concluded that oral notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>and notice by letter were not proof that payments by the owner to the contractor, in accordance with the contract, were not made in good faith, and that the letter was properly excluded from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We reach back 169 years for the most cogent analogy. In <em>Pendleton </em>v. <em>Button, </em>3 Conn. 406 (1820), the defendant proposed to prove that title to certain land was in one Stoddard, and to this end offered in evidence a deed that had never been acknowledged in writing, together with accompanying testimony that a parol acknowledgment was actually made. We stated: \u201cThis evidence was rejected; and most correctly. It is provided by statute, that no deed shall be accounted complete in law, to convey real estate, but such as is written witnessed, <em>acknowledged, </em>and recorded. <em>Tit. </em>142, <em>c. </em>1. <em>s. </em>7. The acknowledgment, to be recorded, must necessarily, be in writing; and such is the invariable practice. To the record all men recur, for the purpose of ascertaining the title of lands; and to satisfy the enquiry, a written acknowledgment is indispensably necessary.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We conclude that a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien under General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 is sufficiently like a deed of land to make <em>Pendleton </em>dispositive of this case. Section 49-34 (1) provides that the \u201ccertificate in writing . . . shall be recorded by the town clerk with deeds of land . . . . \u201d Unlike the effect of a mere notice, as claimed by the defendant, a lien certificate may effect a transfer of land title by means of a foreclosure of the lien. See <em>City Lumber Co. of Bridgeport, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>120 Conn. 16, 19, 179 A. 339 (1935) (\u201c[i]n all essential respects the attributes of foreclosure of mortgages apply to mechanics\u2019 liens\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Moreover, our conclusion accords with common sense. \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational <em>result.\u201d Stoni v. Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 376-77, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). The defendant argues that the statute does not require that the swearing to the contents of the certificate be in writing. In considering a stat-' ute that authorizes a certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien in writing, however, we cannot ascribe to the legislature an intent that an essential part of this certificate need not be in writing. Such a certificate may take precedence over prior encumbrances and may furnish the basis for a foreclosure of the subject premises. General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 describes the contents of such a certificate with great detail. To validate a certificate without a written oath would invite confusion, delay and uncertainty into an area where certainty and complete compliance with the statutory requirements are of paramount importance to interested parties and the general public. As the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said, in a case concerning a statutory lien arising out of labor or materials furnished in a public building project: \u201cThere are practical considerations of importance .... The sworn statement is designed in part to be the basis of action by others who are entitled to like relief and by public officers. To hold there need be no [sworn statement] attached would open the door to fraud difficult to detect.\u201d <em>Cook Borden &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>293 Mass. 174, 180, 199 N.E. 551 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We hold that the mechanic\u2019s lien at issue in this case is invalid because it did not contain a written oath that it had been sworn to by the signer.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment discharging the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-15\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 49-34. certificate of lien to be recorded and notice given to owner. A mechanic\u2019s lien is not valid, unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>person performing the services or furnishing the materials, (1) within ninety days after he has ceased to do so, lodges with the town clerk of the town in which the building, lot or plot of land is situated a certificate in writing, which shall be recorded by the town clerk with deeds of land, (A) describing the premises, the amount claimed as a lien thereon, the name or names of the person against whom the lien is being filed and the date of the commencement of the performance of services or furnishing of materials, (B) stating that the amount claimed is justly due, as nearly as the same can be ascertained, and (C) subscribed and sworn to by the claimant, and (2) within the same time, or prior to the lodging of the certificate but not later than thirty days after lodging the certificate, serves a true and attested copy of the certificate upon the owner of the building, lot or plot of land in the same manner as is provided for the service of the notice in section 49-35.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-6\"> The defendant filed an identical second certificate on November 19,1987, to cure a perceived defect in service. We consider both certificates as one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\"> The plaintiff briefed the issue as follows: \u201cWhether the trial court erred in denying plaintiff\u2019s application for discharge or reduction of mechanic\u2019s lien, by finding the defendant complied with Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C) requiring the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien be sworn to, on the basis of parol evidence, when the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien itself does not indicate an oath was administered or otherwise sworn to.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>defendant stated the issue as follows: \u201cWhether the trial court erred in considering parol evidence to determine that the certificate of mechanic\u2019s lien was sworn to as required by Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 (1) (C).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\">We believe the parties have misstated the issue. This case is not about the parol evidence rule. It concerns simply the validity of an oath on a mechanic\u2019s lien not in writing on the certificate of lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> The last portion of the defendant\u2019s Exhibit 3 provides: \u201cOn this the 16th day of November, 1987, before me, RICHARD H.
