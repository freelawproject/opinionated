After commitment and confinement from January 9, 1985, to January 7,1986, the defendant was presented in court, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17-251 (b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>whether he was eligible for discharge from Whiting and to determine his disposition if discharged. As a consequence, he was returned to the custody of the commissioner of correction to serve the balance of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>erred in determining that it had no discretion to release the defendant from incarceration pursuant to \u00a7 17-251. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that the trial court had no discretion to release the defendant because he was not otherwise eligible for release under the penal code. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>12 Conn. App. 32, 45, 529 A.2d 720 (1987). This court granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to determine whether the Appellate Court erred in affirming the judgment of the trial court. We reverse the decision of the Appellate Court and remand the case with direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Although the facts that the trial court could reasonably have found are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, we summarize those facts pertinent to the issues in this appeal. The defendant was charged with two counts of attempted murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-54a and 53a-49 and one count of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll. He was tried to the court, <em>Hale, J., </em>and acquitted of the two counts of attempted murder, but found guilty of the count of arson in the first degree. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>course of the trial, the court heard psychiatric testimony from two physicians regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state. On January 9,1985, after considering a report from the Whiting Forensic Institute, the testimony presented and the arguments of both counsel, the trial court sentenced the defendant to the custody of the commissioner of correction for a term of fifteen years. Because the court also found that Hanson was dangerous to himself and to others, it ordered him confined to the Whiting Forensic Institute for custody, care and treatment in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 17-245.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court stated: \u201cIf the Director should find that the defendant is sufficiently improved to be discharged from the institute, it is the strong recommendation to the Court hearing the matter under [General Statutes \u00a7 17-251] that the defendant serve at least a portion of this sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On January 7,1986, the defendant appeared before the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-251 and asked the court to enter an order transferring him to another institution, such as Connecticut Valley Hospital, or in the alternative to heed Judge Hale\u2019s recommendation at sentencing and require him to serve some lesser portion of his fifteen year sentence. Judge Kelly, however, discharged the defendant from Whit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>ing and transferred him to the commissioner of correction to serve the remainder of his fifteen year sentence, stating that he could not resentence the defendant because \u201c[h]e has already been sentenced.\u201d The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court claiming that the trial court erred in finding that it lacked the authority to release the defendant before he was eligible for release under his original fifteen year sentence. The Appellate Court sustained the trial court ruling and concluded that the trial court had no discretion to release the defendant because he was not otherwise eligible for release under the penal code. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the Appellate Court erred in concluding that in a proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 17-251, the court may not modify the sentence previously imposed if modification is otherwise prohibited under the penal code.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Under \u00a7 17-251 (b), a hearing is held to determine whether a defendant who is confined to Whiting for psychiatric care under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-244<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 17-245 should be discharged from the institute. If the court determines that the patient should be discharged, it must then determine whether the patient should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>released, granted parole or returned to the custody of the commissioner of correction. The Appellate Court concluded that the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 17-251 (b) was to be read in conjunction with its use in the penal code, and therefore \u201cto vest the court with discretion, upon its determination that the defendant should be discharged from the institute, to modify the original sentence of the defendant if he would otherwise be eligible for release under the penal code.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 45. The Appellate Court upheld the denial of relief to the defendant under \u00a7 17-251 (b) by concluding that the defendant was ineligible for release under the penal code for two reasons. We find error in both reasons offered by the Appellate Court and disagree in its reading of the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 17-251 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The first ground relied upon by the Appellate Court was that the defendant\u2019s conviction of a class A felony made him ineligible for conditional or unconditional release under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 53a-29.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The Appellate Court did not consider the possibility of a suspended sentence and probation, apparently assuming that such a sentence would be contrary to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 53a-29 (a). This court, however, in <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 511 A.2d 321 (1986), held that a sentencing court has discretion to enter a suspended sentence for a first degree arson conviction. In <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>we found that the trial court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion to consider any suspension <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>of a sentence for first degree arson was a violation of the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the defendant was convicted for first degree arson, he could have received a suspended sentence. Therefore, the Appellate Court erred in concluding that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-28 and 53a-29 prohibited the defendant\u2019s release under \u00a7 17-251 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The second ground relied upon by the Appellate Court was that General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> prohibits the early release of a defendant who has been sentenced to a definite term exceeding three years. Noting that the defendant had been convicted and sentenced under the penal code to a definite sentence of fifteen years, the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant was therefore ineligible for discharge or intensive probation under \u00a7 53a-39. While the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>accepted that the court could grant parole to an eligible defendant, or order him to be returned to the custody of the commissioner of correction pursuant to \u00a7 17-251 (b), it concluded that the word \u201crelease\u201d in the statute must be construed in accordance with the statutes regarding sentencing and punishment, for \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would lead to the bizarre and irrational result that persons who are criminally responsible for their actions, who have been convicted and sentenced and who would not be otherwise eligible for discharge from the custody of the commissioner of correction, might serve only six months in a psychiatric institute, and then upon reexamination and a hearing, be released from any further confinement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>supra, 46. The Appellate Court concluded, therefore, that \u00a7 53a-39 served to limit the discretion of the trial court to order release under \u00a7 17-251 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We find our decision in <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>205 Conn. 27, 529 A.2d 1302 (1987), dispositive on the issue of the correct interpretation of the word \u201crelease\u201d in \u00a7 17-251 (b). While <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes </em>dealt with the application of statutory sentence reduction credit to individuals sentenced and confined at Whiting for custody, care and treatment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-245 (c), we noted that \u201cthe benefit of early release under \u00a7 17-251 is in addition to, not in lieu of, the statutory sentence reduction credit that automatically accrues to all prisoners,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that there are two <em>different </em>statutory release systems does not compel the conclusion that they are inconsistent or conflict with each other.\u201d (Emphasis <em>added.) Murray </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 35-36. The possibility of release through sentence modification under \u00a7 53a-39 is distinct from the possibility of release under \u00a7 17-251 (b). Although both statutes operate similarly by giving the court discretion to order release, they are different mechanisms for release.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The word \u201crelease\u201d as used in \u00a7 17-251 (b) is clear and unambiguous. To find support for the Appellate Court\u2019s position, this court would have to ignore its previous decisions that have held that if the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, courts cannot, by construction, read into statutes provisions that are not clearly stated. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>197 Conn. 358, 363, 497 A.2d 402 (1985); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 314, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We acknowledge the Appellate Court\u2019s concern that reading \u201crelease\u201d under \u00a7 17-251 (b) independent of the penal code could result in the release of a defendant convicted and sentenced under the penal code from any further confinement after six months at Whiting. If, for instance, an individual were convicted and sentenced to a nonsuspendible sentence of ten years in the Connecticut correctional institution at Somers, that individual would not be eligible for sentence reduction and would serve the full ten year term. If that same individual had been found to be in need of custody, care and treatment under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-244 and 17-245, early release from his previously imposed sentence of ten years would be possible upon his discharge from Whiting pursuant to \u00a7 17-251 (b). Furthermore, an individual found to be in need of observation and treatment in a mental hospital following sentencing and transferred to such a facility pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-194d or 17-194e must be returned to the custody of the commissioner of correction to complete his sentence upon recovery and discharge from the mental hospital. General Statutes \u00a7 17-194f.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Although we might disfavor the inconsistent results outlined above, \u201c[i]t is not the function of this court to alter the will of the legislature merely because the results are unfair.\u201d <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Haynes Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 327, 334, 471 A.2d 646 (1984). \u201cWhere statutory language is clearly expressed . . . courts must apply the legislative enactment according to the plain terms and \u2018cannot read into the terms of a statute something which manifestly is not there in order to reach what the court thinks would be a just result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 315. \u201c \u2018It is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is the function of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perrucio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 163 n.4, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984), <em>quoting Duart </em>v. <em>Axton-Cross Co., </em>19 Conn. Sup. 188, 190, 110 A.2d 647 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We go no further than to point out that revision and clarification of General Statutes \u00a7 17-251 by the legislature is necessary. As it stands, the statute appears to authorize the director of Whiting and the trial court to grant \u201cparole\u201d to a patient sentenced and committed by the court. If that option was ever truly available to the director or the trial court under the statutes relating to parole,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is no longer a viable option with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>advent of definite sentencing in Connecticut in 1980.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As has already been pointed out, that portion of \u00a7 17-251 (b) that authorizes the trial court to release a sentenced patient upon discharge from Whiting produces questionable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Cognizant of our responsibility to afford the defendant his right to equal protection, we believe a remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to the original sentencing court is in order with the direction that it resentence the defendant with the knowledge that a suspended sentence is now available, though not mandatory, for first degree arson. As we stated earlier, <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, held that the trial court erred in refusing to exercise its discretion to consider any suspension of the defendant\u2019s sentence for first degree arson. Because our decision in <em>O\u2019Neill </em>followed the defendant\u2019s sentencing in the present case,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the trial court was unaware that it had discretion to give the defendant a suspended sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">There is error, the judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction that it be returned to the original sentencing court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-lll. arson in the first degree: class a FELONY, (a) A person is guilty of arson in the first degree when, with intent to destroy or damage a building, as defined in section 53a-100, he starts a fire or causes an explosion, and (1) the building is inhabited or occupied or the person has reason to believe the building may be inhabited or occupied; or (2) any other person is injured, either directly or indirectly; or (3) such fire or explosion was caused for the purpose of collecting insurance proceeds for the resultant loss; or (4) at the scene of such fire or explosion a peace officer or firefighter is subjected to a substantial risk of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">\u201c(b) Arson in the first degree is a class A felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 17-251. review of cases after periodic examinations, disposition of cases: further treatment, transfer, leave of absence, parole, (a) As soon as is practicable the director shall act upon the examination reports of his staff.

Any person confined for an indeterminate sentence, after having been in confinement under such sentence for not less than the minimum term, or, if sentenced for life, after having been in confinement under such sentence for not less than the minimum term imposed by the court, less such time as may have been earned under the provisions of section 18-7, may be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the board of parole for the institution in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>which the person is confined, if (1) it appears from all available information, including such reports from the commissioner of correction as such panel may require, that there is reasonable probability that such inmate will live and remain at liberty without violating the law and (2) such release is not incompatible with the welfare of society. Such parolee shall be allowed in the discretion of such panel to return to his home or to reside in a residential community center, or to go elsewhere, upon such terms and conditions, including personal reports from such paroled person, as such panel prescribes, and to remain, while on parole, in the legal custody and control of the board until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced. Any parolee released on condition that he reside in a residential community center may be required to contribute to the cost incidental to such residence. Each order of parole shall fix the limits of the parolee\u2019s residence, which may be changed in the discretion of such panel. Within one week after the commitment of each person sentenced for more than one year during any criminal term of the superior court, the state\u2019s attorney of each county and judicial district shall send to the board of parole the record, if any, of such person. In the case of an inmate serving a sentence at the John R. Manson Youth Institution, Cheshire, or at the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Niantic, the board of parole shall establish, by rule, the date upon which said board shall notify the inmate that his eligibility for parole will be considered. At any time prior thereto the commissioner of correction may recommend that parole be granted and, under special and unusual circumstances, the commissioner may recommend that an inmate be discharged from the institution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10 provide: \u201cSec. 9.
