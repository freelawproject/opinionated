We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The essential facts are not in dispute. The plaintiffs American Totalisator Company, Inc. (AmTote), DTP Royalty, Inc. (DTP), and GTECH Corporation (GTECH), at various times contracted with the state of Connecticut acting through the division of special revenue (state) to provide personal property, training, personnel and services to establish systems to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the state to conduct its lottery, teletrack and off-track betting enterprises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In order to accomplish that purpose the plaintiffs, during the years for which deficiencies were assessed, purchased or leased<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> computers, computer components, computer terminals, paper stock and other tangible items on which they paid no sales tax. Subsequent to conducting audits, the defendant commissioner assessed use tax deficiencies, penalties and interest against all the plaintiffs, reasoning the various items purchased were not acquired for resale but were retail purchases of equipment and material used by the plaintiffs to discharge their contractual obligations with the state. The plaintiffs disagreed with the commissioner\u2019s assessments and argued that their purchases were not retail sales as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They claimed instead that the personal property involved had been purchased for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>resale and consequently was not subject to the imposition of a use tax under General Statutes \u00a7 12-411.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">A conclusion as to whether the personal property in question was acquired by the plaintiffs for their own use in fulfilling their agreements with the state and therefore subject to a use tax or was purchased for resale to the state<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and consequently not subject to the imposition of a use tax requires a determination of the true object of the contracts between the parties. <em>Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>176 Conn. 604, 609-10, 410 A.2d 457 (1979); <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>145 Conn. 176, 184-85, 140 A.2d 486 (1958); <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>141 Conn. 530, 537-38, 107 A.2d 398 (1954); <em>White </em>v. <em>Storer Cable Communications, Inc., </em>507 So. 2d 964, 968 (Ala. Civ. App. 1987); <em>Culligan Water Conditioning, Etc. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization, </em>17 Cal. 3d 86, 96, 550 P.2d 593, 130 Cal. Rptr. 321 (1976). \u201cThe court must look to the intention of the parties to the contract to determine whether the items in a contract are held for resale or were purchased for a different purpose.\u201d <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>198 Conn. 413, 422, 503 A.2d 582 (1986). \u201cThat intention is to be ascertained from the language used, interpreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances surrounding them.\u201d <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>supra, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">A careful reading of the contracts in question leads to the inescapable conclusion that the intention of the parties in contracting and the true object of each of the contracts was the furnishing by the plaintiffs, and the retention by the state, of the plaintiffs\u2019 expertise and services to establish, implement and operate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>various systems of wagering desired by the state.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nowhere in any of the contracts are the words \u201clease\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>or \u201crental\u201d mentioned in relation to personal property and nowhere, other than in certain clauses giving the state the option to purchase various items at set periods, are the words \u201csale,\u201d \u201csell,\u201d or \u201cpurchase\u201d mentioned in regard to personal property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Further, other than in the option clauses, nowhere in any of the contracts is there a price or rental figure established for the purchase or lease of any particular piece of equipment or any commodity. Rather, the contracts stipulate that the plaintiffs are to be compensated by the payment of a fee based on a percentage of the revenues generated by the particular system of wagering with which they are affiliated. See <em>U-Need-A-Roll-Off Corporation </em>v. <em>New York State Tax Commission, </em>67 N.Y.2d 690, 691, 490 N.E.2d 840, 499 N.Y.S.2d 921 (1986); <em>Greene &amp; Kellogg, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chu, </em>134 App. Div. 2d 755, 756, 521 N.Y.S.2d 571 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"AYB\">As might be expected, the involvement of the state in gaming required that it maintain significant control over its operation. The extent of that control is reflected in the contractual provisions for such things as mandated licensing requirements, placement of terminals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and security procedures. The presence of state control, however, does not convert contracts for the establishment and operation of wagering systems into contracts for the sale or lease of the personal property used in operating those systems. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 423. Nor does the fact that agents or licensees of the state, after training by the plaintiffs, dispensed tickets and collected money alter our view that the true object of the contracts and the primary purpose of the personal property employed was to implement the systems the plaintiffs had contracted to provide, not to effect a resale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In short, we believe that the language of the agreements between the state and the plaintiffs compel a determination that the computers, computer terminals, computer components, paper stock and other personal property that the plaintiffs claim were purchased or leased for resale, although not inconsequential in utility or cost, were <em>incidental </em>to the primary purpose of the contracts which was to provide the state with wagering systems. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 422; see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.) p. 686. It is the primary purpose for which the personal property was purchased and put to use that controls the determination of the property\u2019s taxability. <em>Dresser Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lindley, </em>12 Ohio St. 3d 68, 69, 465 N.E.2d 430 (1984); <em>Fliteways, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>v. <em>Lindley, </em>65 Ohio St. 2d 21, 25, 417 N.E.2d 1371 (1981). Where, as here, the primary function and purpose of the taxpayers was to provide wagering systems and the ownership, use and maintenance of certain personal property and equipment were necessary to enable them to furnish those systems, those taxpayers, not the state, were the ultimate users or consumers of that property and equipment within the meaning of the sales and use tax statutes. <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>supra, 423; <em>Boise Bowling Center </em>v. <em>State, </em>93 Idaho 367, 369-70, 461 P.2d 262 (1969); <em>Appeal of AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc., </em>242 Kan. 554, 561-62, 749 P.2d 1033 (1988); <em>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>State Commission, </em>168 Kan. 227, 232, 212 P.2d 363 (1949); <em>Nashville Mobilephone Co. </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>655 S.W.2d 934, 937 (Tenn. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiffs did not purchase or lease to resell to the state the personal property for which a use tax was assessed. Rather, the property was purchased or leased for use in delivering to the state the gaming systems the plaintiffs had contracted to provide. The plaintiffs\u2019 lease or purchase of the property in question therefore was subject in each case to a use tax deficiency as determined by the commissioner and affirmed by the Superior Court. There is no error as to the use tax assessments against the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The trial court determined, however, that \u201ceach of the plaintiffs had a firm and reasonably held belief in the correctness of its legal position and that none of them brought suit for delay.\u201d The trial court, therefore, rendered judgment that the defendant commissioner collect the use tax assessments against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>plaintiffs without penalty or interest. The commissioner appeals that determination of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The defendant commissioner does not contend that the trial court lacked authority to forgo penalties against the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He does contend, however, that the trial court lacked authority to relieve the taxpayers of their obligations to pay the statutory interest due on their assessments. The commissioner\u2019s position is that the imposition of interest on delinquent taxes is not punitive but compensatory in nature, and that the trial court had no authority to waive it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 12-422 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny taxpayer aggrieved because of <em>any </em>order, decision, determination or disallowance of the commissioner of revenue services under section 12-418,12-421 or 12-425 may . . . take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain.... <em>Said court </em>may <em>grant such relief as may be equitable . \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That broad statutory grant of equitable powers has been interpreted by this court to authorize the Superior Court to set aside an assessment of interest. \u201cWe agree with the plaintiff that it was within the trial court\u2019s province to consider whether to set aside the interest imposed as part of its review of the deficiency assessment; see <em>Duval </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>[31 Conn. Sup. 373, 377, 333 A.2d 63 (1974)]; <em>Bowne </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>[30 Conn. Sup. 309, 316, 313 A.2d 426 (1973)]; but we also consider the resolution of that issue to be within the court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>187 Conn. 581, 587-88, 447 A.2d 12 <em>(1982); New England Yacht Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>198 Conn. 624, 637, 504 A.2d 506 (1986). \u201cThe determination of what equity requires in a particular case, the balancing of the equities, is a matter for the discretion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>trial court.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Nissley, </em>184 Conn. 539, 546, 440 A.2d 231 (1981). The defendant in this instance has not persuaded us that the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was clearly erroneous. <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>w. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>supra, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The defendant also argues that an interpretation of \u00a7 12-422 that would allow a court to waive the commissioner\u2019s assessment of interest would be unconstitutional because it would constitute a delegation of the commissioner\u2019s administrative function to the judiciary. We find the defendant\u2019s reasoning in this regard difficult to follow, and we also find inapposite the case of <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 251 A.2d 49 (1968), on which it primarily relies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Article XX of the amendments to the Connecticut constitution expressly provides that the jurisdiction of the courts shall be defined by law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In effectuating that constitutional mandate, the legislature has promulgated General Statutes \u00a7 52-1, which expressly gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Superior Court the power to \u201cadminister legal and equitable rights and apply legal and equitable remedies.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That general grant of equitable powers has been further enhanced and defined by \u00a7 12-422, the statute pursuant to which these appeals were taken, which provides that the court \u201cmay grant such relief as may be equitable.\u201d The statute does not exclude assessments of interest from its equitable ambit. Since under \u00a7 12-422, the trial court was exercising de novo jurisdiction over the taxpayers\u2019 appeals and was not bound by the commissioner\u2019s previous rulings; <em>Kimberly-Clark Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>204 Conn. 137, 143-45, 527 A.2d 679 (1987); its determination did no more than carry out its constitutional and statutory mandates by affording equitable relief where that court deemed it appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 12-422. appeal. Any taxpayer aggrieved because of any order, decision, determination or disallowance of the commissioner of revenue services under section 12-418, 12-421 or 12-425 may, within one month after service upon the taxpayer of notice of such order, decision, determination or disallowance, take an appeal therefrom to the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, which shall be accompanied by a citation to the commissioner of revenue services to appear before said court. Such citation shall be signed by the same authority, and such appeal shall be returnable at the same time and served and returned in the same manner, as is required in case of a summons in a civil action. The authority issuing the citation shall take from the appellant a bond or recognizance to the state of Connecticut, with surety to prosecute the appeal to effect and to comply with the orders and decrees of the court in the premises. Such appeals shall be preferred cases, to be heard, unless cause appears to the contrary, at the first session, by the court or by a committee appointed by it. Said court may grant such relief as may be equitable and, if such tax has been paid prior to the granting of such relief, may order the treasurer to pay the amount of such relief, with interest at the rate of six per cent per annum, to the aggrieved taxpayer. If the appeal has been taken without probable cause, the court may tax double or triple costs, as the case demands; and, upon all such appeals which are denied, costs may be taxed against the appellant at the discretion of the court, but no costs shall be taxed against the state.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 12-415.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> The plaintiffs, DTP Royalty, Inc., and GTECH Corporation, also claimed refunds of sales taxes imposed on rental payments they had made to lease equipment used in pursuance of their contracts with the state. The commissioner, in assessing additional taxes, denied both requests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b424-5\"> AmTote originally contracted with the state as to teletrack and off-track betting in 1973 and as to the daily lottery in 1977.

GTECH (formerly Gaming Systems Corporation) succeeded DTP by virtue of an assignment from DTP in 1981 and subsequently by an agreement with the state in 1983. Because we believe that all the contracts have the same legal effect and lead to the same result as far as the issue in dispute is concerned, it is not necessary to treat each plaintiff or contract separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> The leasing or rental of tangible personal property is a \u201csale\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (2) (j).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-407 (3) provides in pertinent part: \u201cdefinitions.

Further, insofar as that case may indicate that possession and control are the determinants of taxability, we reject it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> Nor are the plaintiffs DTP and GTECH entitled to a refund on sales taxes previously paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 12-415 (4) and (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 251 A.2d 49 (1968), this court considered the constitutionality of 1967 legislation applicable to probate court administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> Article XX of the amendments to the constitution of Connecticut provides: \u201c(COURTS.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u201cSection 1.
