We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">As a result of allegations that Luis had been physically abused, on April 2,1982, the department of children and youth services (DCYS) filed a petition in the trial court alleging that Luis was a neglected child. Luis was eighteen months old at the time the petition was filed. Pursuant to an order of temporary custody, Luis, whose biological parents were Hispanic, was taken into custody by DCYS, and was placed in the home of non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Hispanic foster parents in May, 1982. Luis has been in their care since that time. Following a hearing on the petition, the trial court on September 9,1982, adjudicated Luis a neglected child because of parental abuse, and committed him to the care and custody of the commissioner of DCYS for a period up to eighteen months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With the respondent\u2019s agreement, Luis\u2019s commitment to DCYS was extended for a period of eighteen months in February, 1984, and for an additional eighteen months in August, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On October 23,1986, the commissioner of DCYS filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of the respondent and Victor, Luis\u2019s father. The commissioner alleged that Victor had abandoned Luis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the respondent\u2019s parental rights to Luis should be terminated on the basis of \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) and (4). Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) provides that the trial court may grant a petition to terminate parental rights based upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the parents of a child, previously adjudicated by the Superior Court to be neglected, have failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the child\u2019s age and needs, they could assume a responsible position in the child\u2019s life'. Section 17-43a (b) (4) provides that parental rights may be terminated if by clear and convincing evidence it is proven that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In March and April, 1986, the trial court conducted a hearing on the commissioner\u2019s petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights to Luis. The trial court heard testimony from several counselors who had worked with Luis and the respondent. Louise Leavenworth, a social worker, testified that she observed twenty-three visits by the respondent with Luis during the period from December, 1984, to July, 1986. She testified that she found very little interaction initiated by the mother with Luis, and that Luis reacted negatively toward his mother. Leavenworth testified that Luis had become concerned about the court proceeding and where he was going to live. She further testified that adoption by the foster parents would have a positive influence on Luis and that a reunification with his mother would be negative. She concluded that no meaningful relationship between Luis and his mother would be likely to develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The respondent engaged in counseling at two separate facilities beginning in 1982. In October, 1982, she was referred by DCYS to Hartford Community Health Services for parenting skills counseling. The scheduled weekly sessions were discontinued in May, 1983, because of her absences. The substance of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>of her counselor from Hartford Community Health Services was that the respondent did not experience any substantial increase in parenting skills as a result of the sessions. In 1984, the respondent began counseling with the Institute for the Hispanic Family, initially for the purpose of dealing with the respondent\u2019s problems of getting independent housing, reunification with Luis and parenting of her newborn child, Carlos. The main efforts of this counseling activity were directed toward Carlos, who had been a difficult child to raise. The respondent\u2019s counselor, Gloria Gerena, testified that she observed a visit between the respondent and Luis in November, 1985. She described the visit as friendly and not negative, but that Luis treated the respondent as a friend and not as his mother. Gerena also testified that, based on her work with the respondent over a two and one-half year period, it was her opinion that the respondent had the \u201cpotential\u201d to develop adequate parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, in September, 1985, Dr. Julia Ramos-McKay, a psychologist, performed an evaluation of the respondent, the foster mother and Luis. She testified that the respondent\u2019s and Luis\u2019s relationship was \u201cfriendly\u201d but was not that of a mother and child. She further testified that Luis\u2019s foster mother was the child\u2019s \u201cpsychological\u201d parent, and that Luis referred to his foster mother as \u201cMom.\u201d Ramos-McKay suggested that, as of September, 1985, the respondent may not have had command of common parental techniques. Dr. Henry Kranzler, a specialist in cultural psychiatry, testified for the respondent. Kranzler was unable to render a definitive opinion on whether it would be possible to reunite the respondent and Luis in the future. He also testified that it would be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Luis to return to an Hispanic cultural environment in light of the fact that Luis had spent the previous four and one-half years in an Anglo-American environment with his foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The trial court also heard testimony that, at the time of DCYS\u2019 initial involvement with Luis in connection with the original abuse allegation, the respondent lived on Groton Street in Hartford. Thereafter, she moved to Vine Street. She was evasive about her other residences. Housing had been difficult to obtain because of a lack of housing units and a lack of money. Gerena, one of the respondent\u2019s counselors, contacted the Hartford Housing Authority on behalf of the respondent and furnished other housing leads to her. At the time of the termination hearing, the respondent had an apartment in the Charter Oak public housing project, but according to Gerena, the street on which the respondent lived was considered the worst street in the project because of a high crime rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Luis, who was almost seven years old at the time of the termination hearing, did not testify. The trial court found that the parties had stipulated that Luis loved his foster parents, considered them to be his mother and father, and wanted to live with them and not the respondent. The trial court determined that because Luis has grown up as a non-Hispanic child in the foster home, his relationship to his Hispanic mother had suffered, that the difference in cultures between mother and child adversely affected their relationship, and that Luis\u2019s return to an Hispanic culture after this stay in the Anglo-American foster home would be disastrous. The trial court further found that the respondent\u2019s visits with her son at his foster home had not been productive. The visits caused Luis to experience tension and anxiety. Following the respondent\u2019s visits, Luis experienced nightmares, maladjustment at school, mood changes and bed wetting. A pediatric nurse and a kindergarten teacher confirmed Luis\u2019s negative reaction to the respondent\u2019s visits. The trial court sanctioned the cessation of the respondent\u2019s visits in January, 1986, and thereafter Luis no longer suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>from the negative reactions identified as having been caused by the respondent\u2019s visits. The trial court further found that the respondent\u2019s parenting skills were deficient and that her relationship with Luis had suffered because of this deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, made specific findings regarding the six statutory factors necessary for consideration in a proceeding to terminate parental rights. While many of these findings are evident from our recitation of the facts, for emphasis, we will recapitulate those findings here. The court found that the counseling services provided to the respondent had little effect in improving her parenting skills. It also found that the respondent had displayed little dedication to meeting obligations that she had agreed to, such as maintaining contact with DCYS and attending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>parenting skills programs. It further found that Luis, who was six years of age at the time of the termination hearing, had bonded with his foster parents, and that the respondent had made only limited efforts to adjust her conduct and circumstances so that Luis\u2019s return to live with her would be in his best interests. It also found that the respondent\u2019s efforts to maintain a meaningful relationship with Luis had not been interfered with by any other person. Accordingly, the trial court found that the evidence was clear and convincing that the respondent had failed to achieve the necessary level of rehabilitation required under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) and that there was no ongoing parent-child relationship as provided by \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4). The trial court also concluded that the evidence was clear and convincing that it was in Luis\u2019s best interests to grant DCYS\u2019 petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The respondent's principal claim is that the trial court erred in finding by clear and convincing evidence that she had failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of her child, she could assume a responsible position in his life. General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u201cThe termination of parental rights is defined as \u2018the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . . \u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 17-32a (e) (Rev. to 1972) [now \u00a7 45-61b (g)]. Although that ultimate interference by the state in the parent-child relationship may be required under certain circumstances, the natural rights of parents in their children \u2018undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection.\u2019 <em>Stanley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 [1972]; see <em>In re Appeal of Kindis, </em>162 Conn. 239, 240, 294 A.2d 316 [1972]; <em>Cinque </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>[99 Conn. 70, 82, 121 A. 678 (1923)].\u201d <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 425, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975). Termination of parental rights is \u201ca most serious and sensitive judicial action.\u201d Id., 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cSection 17-43a carefully sets out . . . four situations that, in the judgment of the legislature, constitute \u2018countervailing interests\u2019 sufficiently powerful to justify the termination of parental rights in the absence of consent. The commissioner of children and youth services, in petitioning to terminate those rights, must allege and prove one or more of the statutory grounds. In contrast to custody proceedings, in which the best interests of the child are always the paramount consideration and in fact usually dictate the outcome, in termination proceedings the statutory criteria must be met before termination can be accomplished and adoption proceedings begun. No all-encompassing \u2018best interests\u2019 standard vitiates the requirement of compliance with the statutory criteria. See <em>Alsager </em>v. <em>District Court of Polk County, </em>[406 F. Sup. 10 (S.D. Iowa 1975), aff\u2019d, 545 F.2d 1137 (8th Cir. 1976)]; <em>In re Adoption of Children by D., </em>61 N.J. 89, 293 A.2d 171 (1972); <em>Malpass </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>213 Va. 393, 192 S.E.2d 794 (1972); Ketcham &amp; Babcock, \u2018Statutory Standards for the Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights,\u2019 29 Rutgers L. Rev. 530, 539 (1976); comment, \u2018Termination of Parental Rights in Adoption Cases: Focusing on the Child,\u2019 14 J. Fam. L. 547, 550 (1975).\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>177 Conn. 648, 671-72, 420 A.2d 875 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The respondent mounts a three pronged attack on the trial court\u2019s decision granting the petition to terminate her parental rights to Luis. She argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>evidence adduced at the hearing showed that she did in fact successfully rehabilitate herself to the extent that, with some supportive counseling services, she currently could be a responsible parent to Luis. She also maintains that the trial court narrowly and improperly construed the term \u201crehabilitation\u201d under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) and further, that the court based its decision in part on factors for which the respondent was not responsible. She maintains, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s determination that the evidence was clear and convincing that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate herself was clearly erroneous. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">A determination by the trial court under \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) that the evidence is clear and convincing that the parent has not rehabilitated himself or herself will be disturbed only if that finding is \u201cnot supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 <em>(1980).\u201d In re Juvenile Appeal (84-3), </em>1 Conn. App. 463, 478, 473 A.2d 795, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 802, 474 A.2d 1259 (1984). In the present case, the trial court\u2019s findings, which are amply supported by the record, indicate that the respondent\u2019s visits with Luis were not productive toward maintaining or reinforcing a parent-child relationship, that Luis reacted negatively toward her, that the progress the respondent had made in improving her parenting skills with respect to Luis was unpromising, that the prospects of the respondent achieving a useful and constructive role as a parent to Luis were crucially impaired by language and cultural barriers, that Luis had psychologically bonded with his foster parents with whom he had lived for the last five years of his almost seven year life, and that the respondent continued to have difficulty in obtaining adequate housing. Moreover, the trial court found that DCYS had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>with Luis. In light of these findings as supported by the record, we are not persuaded that the trial court was clearly erroneous in concluding that the evidence clearly and convincingly demonstrated that the respondent had failed to achieve a level of rehabilitation that would encourage the belief that, within a reasonable time, considering Luis\u2019s age and needs, the respondent could assume a responsible position in Luis\u2019s life. General Statutes \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The respondent argues, however, that the term \u201crehabilitation,\u201d as used in \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2), does not require the parent to be able to assume full responsibility for a child without the use of available support programs. She also claims that her failure to fulfill all court expectations does not equate with a conclusion that she could not assume a responsible position in the child\u2019s life. See <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 203, 504 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 809, 508 A.2d 770 (1986); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84</em>-<em>3), </em>supra. We have no quarrel with the propositions to which the respondent alludes. We note, however, that as it is presently written, \u00a7 17-43a (b) (2) requires parental rights to be terminated if by clear and convincing evidence it is established that the respondent\u2019s level of rehabilitation falls short of the level which would \u201cencourage the belief that <em>within a reasonable </em>time, <em>considering the age and needs of the child, </em>\u201d the parent could assume a responsible position. (Emphasis added.) Thus, the statute requires the trial court to analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d There may be instances in which the evidence does not establish that parental rights should be terminated under this section, despite the fact that continuing support programs for the parent may be suitable or even necessary. The trial court in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>present case, however, determined that, with regard to Luis\u2019s age and needs, the respondent had not been rehabilitated. Further, the record discloses that the trial court based its conclusion on a plenary consideration of the factors identified in \u00a7 17-43a (d), and did not grant the petition to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights solely on the basis of the respondent\u2019s failure to abide consistently by agreements entered into with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The respondent also suggests that the trial court\u2019s decision was erroneous because it was based in part on financial, language and cultural barriers \u201cnot of her own making\u201d which rendered difficult the task of reunification with Luis. The record, however, indicates that the trial court found that the respondent\u2019s failure to reunify with Luis was not primarily the result of her financial difficulties. Moreover, although it is true that the cultural and linguistic barriers between the respondent and Luis resulted from Luis\u2019s placement with a non-Hispanic foster family, the trial court found that \u201c[wjhile placement within the extended family or in an Hispanic foster home might have been better than use of this non-Hispanic home, those alternative options have not been available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We recognize that some of the facts relied on by the trial court in granting the petition to terminate parental rights cannot be attributed to a lack of moral responsibility or commitment on the part of the respondent. Under \u00a7 17-43a, however, the trial court\u2019s obligation is not to make an unguided investigation of the respondent\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d in determining whether to grant a petition to terminate parental rights, any more than its disposition is intended to reflect some kind of moral judgment respecting a parent whose rights are terminated. Nor may this court invalidate the statutory criteria of \u00a7 17-43a merely because that criteria may in some instances implement the legislature\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that parental rights should be terminated despite the fact that a particular parent, with the best intentions, personally may be incapable of overcoming deficiencies in parenting skills. \u201cThis court has \u2018[i]nsist[ed] upon strict compliance with the statutory criteria [of \u00a7 17-43a] before termination of parental rights and subsequent adoption proceedings can occur . . . . \u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84 -BC), </em>194 Conn. 252, 257 n.9, 479 A.2d 1204 (1984). \u201cInsistence upon strict compliance with the statutory criteria . . . enhances the child\u2019s best interests by promoting autonomous families and by reducing the dangers of arbitrary and biased decisions amounting to state intrusion disguised under the rubric of the child\u2019s \u2018best interests.\u2019 <em>\u201d In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>supra, 672. In the present case, the trial court strictly complied with the requirements of \u00a7 17-43a by giving plenary consideration to both subsections (b) (2) and (d) of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We have reviewed the record together with the transcript, exhibits and briefs in this case, and we are unable to find that the facts found by the trial court as set out in its memorandum of decision are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The respondent next claims that \u00a7 17-43a (b) (4) violates the due process clauses of the Connecticut and United States constitutions. She argues that the state\u2019s attempt to terminate her parental rights on the grounds that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship, and that it would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interests not to terminate her parental rights, without any showing of parental unfitness, unconstitutionally infringes upon her fundamental right to family integrity. See <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 155, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147, reh. denied, 410 U.S. 959, 93 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>1409, 35 L.
