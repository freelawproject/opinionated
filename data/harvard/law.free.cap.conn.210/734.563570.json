Chagnon and Marian G. Chagnon, actually represented a continuing guaranty rendering the defendants liable for debts arising from their business\u2019s open credit account with the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court from a judgment of $35,000 rendered in favor of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff cross appealed. We transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error with respect to the defendants\u2019 appeal, or with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for interest on the cross appeal. We remand the case for further articulation on the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The facts may be summarized as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff, Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc., supplied merchandise to the defendants\u2019 wholesale business, Hanover Gift House (Hanover), on a \u201crunning account.\u201d In 1975, after the defendants\u2019 business encountered financial difficulties, the plaintiff proposed that the defendants sign a promissory note making them personally liable for Hanover\u2019s debt. This note was never executed. At the plaintiff\u2019s behest, however, on September 1, 1977, an instrument entitled \u201cInstallment Note\u201d was executed by Pierre Chagnon as vice president of Hanover and by both defendants in their individual capacities. The note provided in relevant part: \u201cFor Value Received [Hanover Gift House] and/or Pierre Chagnon and/or Marion [sic] Chagnon promise to pay to the order of Associated Catalog Merchandisers, Inc. the sum of $35,000.00 (Thirty-five thousand) with interest thereon at the rate of Twelve per cent (12 %) per year, the principal and interest payable in installments as follows: October 1,1977 $1,000.00 plus accrued interest and $1,000.00 plus accrued interest every month thereafter. ... In the event of default hereunder the undersigned agree to pay all costs of collection including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d There was no evidence that either party had legal assistance in the preparation or execution of the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The plaintiff continued to supply merchandise to Hanover for the next several years. During this period, the plaintiff applied all money received from the defendants to the open account balance. In September, 1978, the defendants sent the plaintiff a corporate check for $20,000 bearing a notation that the money should be applied to the installment note. Upon receipt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>check, however, the plaintiffs president, Richard C. Fredette, Jr., telephoned Pierre Chagnon and told him \u201cyou know better than that\u201d and that the payment would not be applied to the note. Subsequently, Fredette directed his office manager to \u201cwhite out\u201d the notation, and credited the check to the open account balance. In December, 1980, the defendants\u2019 corporate check for $15,000 similarly was applied to reduce the open account balance without being altered. Further, in December, 1985, two other checks totaling $20,000 and bearing the notation \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d also were applied to the open account.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In late 1986, Fredette discussed Hanover\u2019s large outstanding balance with Pierre Chagnon. Chagnon told Fredette that \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything personally and my company may not be able to pay you.\u201d Thereafter, on November 19, 1986, the plaintiff\u2019s application for an ex parte attachment on the defendants\u2019 real property located in Meriden was granted. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint dated November 24,1986, named Pierre and Marian Chagnon as defendants. In an amended complaint dated November 25, 1987, the plaintiff alleged that the installment note operated as the defendants\u2019 personal guaranty on the debt arising from the open account. The plaintiff sought $54,943.86 in money damages representing the principal on the note plus interest accruing to September 30, 1987, and also sought reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">At trial, Fredette testified that the note was \u201csecurity for past or future deliveries. . . . The consideration was the future deliveries which would be assured. . . . What I gave him [by his signing the instrument] was the ability to continue to receive merchandise . . . the note was intended to be used solely as a guaranty of payments if the company was unable to make payments.\u201d Grita B. French, the plaintiff\u2019s former office manager, testified that the \u201cdefendants\u2019 company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>very slow paying bills, and this was an attempt to guaranty personally the company\u2019s bills. ... I whited out the check [of September, 1978,] after Mr. Fredette told Pierre Chagnon he wouldn\u2019t apply it to the note. . . . Mr. Fredette called Pierre Chagnon two minutes after he received the check and said to him \u2018you know better than that\u2019 . . . the note was a guaranty.\u201d Edward Symanksy, the plaintiff\u2019s former employee and director, testified that \u201c[o]n defendants\u2019 account we thought we should get a guaranty . . . while I had frequent personal contact with defendants, I never heard them say they wanted to pay off the note.\u201d In a deposition admitted at the trial, Pierre Chagnon testified that \u201c[w]hat we bought [with the agreement] was the ability to keep buying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The trial court issued a memorandum of decision on January 22, 1988. Relying on the foregoing evidence, it concluded that the installment note was intended to represent a guaranty rendering the defendants personally liable for $35,000. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that the checks they earmarked toward satisfaction of the installment note extinguished their liability on the underlying corporate debt. It found that when the note was executed, the plaintiff was unwilling to extend the defendants further credit without assurances of their personal liability, and that the defendants in executing the note intended to induce the plaintiff to continue to supply them with merchandise on credit. The trial court rendered a judgment against the defendants for $35,000, but denied the plaintiff interest. The memorandum made no reference to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court erred by (1) relying on parol evidence to interpret the installment note as a continuing guaranty, (2) rejecting the defendants\u2019 statute of limitations defense, and (3) finding the defendants personally liable without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>making any finding on the debt of the defendants\u2019 corporation. The plaintiff on cross appeal asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to award it interest on the $35,000 principal and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing suit to enforce the defendants\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The defendants claim that the trial court erred in adverting to parol evidence in its interpretation of the installment note, and, therefore, improperly reached the conclusion that the note was a continuing guaranty. They argue that the parol evidence was not admissible under any of the exceptions to the rule set forth in <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>189 Conn. 52, 56, 453 A.2d 771 (1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They also argue that any continuing guaranty between the parties was \u201crevoked\u201d by the actions of Pierre Chagnon and, further, that the trial court erred in \u201creforming\u201d the written agreement since the plaintiff did not seek reformation in its pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\u201c \u2018Whether the written contract was actually the final repository of the oral agreements and dealings between the parties depends on their intention, evidence as to which is sought in the conduct and language of the parties and the surrounding circumstances. If the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>leads to the conclusion that the parties intended the written contracts to contain the whole agreement, evidence of oral agreements is \u201cexcluded,\u201d that is, excluded from consideration in the determination of the rights and obligations of the litigants, even though it is admitted on the issue of their intention. <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>111 Conn. 342, 346, 149 A. 851 [1930].\u2019 <em>Shelton Yacht &amp; Cabana Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suto, </em>150 Conn. 251, 254-55, 188 A.2d 493 (1963) . . . . \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Damora </em>v. <em>Christ-Janer, </em>184 Conn. 109, 113-14, 441 A.2d 61 (1981). A written agreement is \u201cintegrated\u201d and operates to exclude evidence of the \u201c \u2018alleged extrinsic negotiation\u2019 \u201d if the subject matter of the latter \u201c \u2018is mentioned, covered or dealt with in the writing . . .; if it is not, then probably the writing was not intended to embody that element . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019\u2019Cohn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra, 347; <em>Shelton Yacht &amp; Cabana Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suto, </em>supra, 258; 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 215; 30 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 1045. If the evidence, however, does not indicate that the writing is intended as an integration, i.e., \u201ca final expression of one or more terms of an agreement\u201d; 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 209 (1); then \u201cthe agreement is said to be \u2018unintegrated,\u2019 and the parol evidence rule does not apply.\u201d E. Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 7.3., p. 452. Whether the parties intended to integrate their negotiations in a writing is a question of fact for the court. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>140 Conn. 297, 299, 99 A.2d 126 (1953); 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 210 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s consideration of evidence extrinsic to the installment note to determine whether that writing was an \u201cintegration\u201d was entirely proper. <em>Shelton Yacht &amp; Cabana Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suto, </em>supra; <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the parties had agreed to a contract of continuing guaranty necessarily was predicated on a determination that the installment note did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>constitute an \u201cintegration\u201d of the parties\u2019 agreement. We are not persuaded that such a finding was clearly erroneous. Cf. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The parties in this case conducted business pursuant to the open account arrangement for a number of years prior to the execution of the installment note. In the mid-1970s, the defendants\u2019 business encountered financial difficulties, prompting the plaintiff to seek assurances that it would be paid for the merchandise it supplied on credit. In addition, the following factors are significant: the terms of the installment note did not purport to deal with the debt of the defendants\u2019 business on the open account; <em>Shelton Yacht &amp; Cabana Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suto, </em>supra; <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>supra; the note was brief and skeletal in nature; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Boston Excelsior Co., </em>91 Me. 214, 220, 39 A. 554 (1898); and contained no recital that it was intended to constitute the parties\u2019 final agreement; 30 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7 1019; the parties did not seek legal advice in executing the instrument; Pierre Chagnon admitted that the purpose of the note was to enable Hanover to continue to buy merchandise from the plaintiff pursuant to their long established course of dealing; and the parties\u2019 conduct subsequent to execution of the note forcefully demonstrates that they intended the installment note to represent the defendants\u2019 continuing personal guaranty on the debt arising from the open account. See <em>LarRob Bus Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>170 Conn. 397, 407-408, 365 A.2d 1086 (1976); <em>Taft Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Yorkhaven Enterprises, Inc., </em>146 Conn. 338, 343, 150 A.2d 597 (1959); <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>141 Conn. 583, 591, 107 A.2d 629 (1954); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Rockefeller, </em>134 Conn. 585, 590, 59 A.2d 524 (1948). Under these circumstances, evidence of the oral negotiations was admissible \u201cin the determination of the rights and obligations of the litigants. . . . \u201d <em>Shelton Yacht &amp; Cabana Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Suto, </em>supra, 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>The defendants\u2019 argument that the parol evidence relied on by the trial court does not fit within any of the exceptions enumerated in <em>Jay Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ahearn Development Corporation, </em>supra, is unavailing. In <em>Jay Realty, Inc., </em>we observed that \u201c[p]arol evidence is admissible (1) to explain an ambiguity appearing in the instrument; (2) to prove a collateral oral agreement which does not vary the terms of the writing; (3) to add a missing term in a writing which indicates on its face that it does not set forth the complete agreement; or (4) to show mistake or fraud.\u201d Id., 56. It is clear from our discussion above, however, that those \u201cexceptions\u201d only come into play once it is established that the writing in issue was intended as the \u201cfinal repository\u201d or \u201cintegration,\u201d either partial or complete, of the parties\u2019 negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We disagree with the defendants\u2019 assertion that because a contract of continuing guaranty remains in force only until revoked by the guarantor, the defendants\u2019 attempted payments on the note and Pierre Chagnon\u2019s discussions with Fredette revoked the guaranty. A guaranty \u201ccontract is continuing if it contemplates a future course of dealing during an indefinite period or it is intended to cover a series of transactions or a succession of credits, or if its purpose is to give to the principal debtor a standing credit to be used by him from time to time. An offer for a continuing guaranty is ordinarily effective until revoked by the guarantor or extinguished by some rule of law.\u201d <em>Iola State Bank </em>v. <em>Biggs, </em>233 Kan. 450, 454, 662 P.2d 563 (1983); 38 Am. Jur. 2d, Guaranty \u00a7 63. To revoke a continuing guaranty, the guarantor usually must give notice of the revocation to the creditor. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>67 Conn. 147, 156, 34 A. 1025 (1895). However, \u201c[e]ven a continuing guaranty that is, in terms, unlimited as to duration, imposes liability upon a guarantor only for such period of time as is reasonable in light of all the cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>cumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Monroe Ready Mix Concrete, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westcor Development Corporation, </em>183 Conn. 348, 351, 439 A.2d 362 (1981). The interpretation of a continuing guaranty, as well as the question of its revocation, ordinarily is a question of fact. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">In the present case, Fredette told Pierre Chagnon upon receipt of the corporate check for $20,000 in September, 1978, that the money could not be applied to reduce the defendants\u2019 personal liability on the underlying debt. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendants expressed disagreement with Fredette\u2019s position. After the parties\u2019 discussion, the defendants\u2019 company continued to acquire merchandise from the plaintiff pursuant to the open credit arrangement. In December, 1980, the defendants sent another check for $15,000 bearing the notation that it applied to the installment note. On the basis of all the evidence, including that of the parties\u2019 discussion in 1978, however, the trial court could reasonably have found that the notation on the December, 1980 check did not effectuate a revocation. Id. The same holds true for the checks sent in 1985 bearing the notation \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d Further, aside from the notations on the checks, the record does not disclose that the defendants expressly communicated a desire to revoke their guaranty until Pierre Chagnon told Fredette in late 1986 that the defendants did not consider themselves personally liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Finally, the defendants\u2019 argument that the trial court improperly \u201creformed\u201d the installment note because the plaintiff sought only money damages is misleading. In analyzing the facts, the trial court did not purport to \u201creform\u201d the contract on the basis of mutual mistake or fraud. Cf. <em>Lopinto </em>v. <em>Haines, </em>185 Conn. 527, 531, 441 A.2d 151 (1981). Relying on the language of the written agreement, the circumstances surrounding its execution, and the parties\u2019 subsequent conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the trial court determined that the \u201c \u2018installment note\u2019 of September 1, 1977, was not a promissory note at all, but rather the <em>product </em>of an unprofessional yet honest effort on the part of the plaintiff to insure that it would be paid for materials furnished.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As we observed above, this conclusion in essence indicated that the installment note was not an integration of the parties\u2019 negotiations. Since the installment note was only the \u201cproduct\u201d of the underlying guaranty agreement, the trial court was not engaged in \u201creformation\u201d when it analyzed the surrounding facts to determine precisely the content of the agreement. In light of this evidence, we are unpersuaded that the trial court committed error in determining that the defendants were guarantors on the underlying corporate debt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Monroe Ready Mix Concrete, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westcor Development Corporation, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The defendants next claim that the trial court erred in rejecting their statute of limitations defense. They argue that under General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-122 (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action on the installment note accrued on August 2, 1980, the day after the note matured according to its terms. They claim, therefore, that the plaintiff\u2019s action was barred under General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 52-576<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because it was brought in November, 1986, more than six years after its cause of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">The installment note, executed on September 1,1977, provided that the interest and principal were payable in monthly installments of $1000 plus accrued interest beginning on October 1, 1977. According to the defendants, the full term of the note expired on August 1,1980, the date the thirty-fifth and final payment was due. The defendants\u2019 argument presupposes that the action was brought on the installment note and not on a continuing guaranty. The trial court\u2019s findings, however, indicate that the payment terms of the note were not controlling. The trial court found that the plaintiff\u2019s invoices did not adhere to the interest rate stated in the installment note, and further, that the parties\u2019 conduct evinced an intent to ignore the payment schedule set forth in the note. That the defendants themselves did not adhere to those terms is clear from the acknowledgment in their brief that \u201c[i]t is manifest from this payment scheme . . . that the agreement . . . contemplated termination of the guaranty and release of the Chagnons upon payment of the final $1,000.00 installment in <em>May, 1981.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u201cIn the case of a continuing guaranty, the statute [of limitations] does not commence to run in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>a guarantor until there is a default in payment by the principal, and a cause of action has accrued against the former.\u201d 38 Am. Jur. 2d, Guaranty \u00a7 121. In the present case, the defendants\u2019 guaranty existed, absent an effective revocation, for \u201cas long as the open account was in existence.\u201d <em>Boxed Beef Distributors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rexton, Inc., </em>7 Conn. App. 555, 560, 509 A.2d 1060 (1986). Hanover\u2019s account with the plaintiff was not in default until late. 1986, when Pierre Chagnon informed Fredette that \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything personally and my company may not be able to pay you.\u201d Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s action, brought in November, 1986, was not barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-576.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The defendants next claim that the trial court erred in finding them liable for $35,000 on the underlying debt of their corporation without any finding on the corporation\u2019s debt to the plaintiff. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that \u201c[t]he agreement and the evidence lead conclusively to this court\u2019s holding that defendants are liable to plaintiff for the sum of $35,000.\u201d While the trial court\u2019s memorandum does not make express findings with respect to Hanover\u2019s debt, Hanover\u2019s aggregate liability for at least $35,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>arguably is implied by the court\u2019s conclusion as to the defendants\u2019 liability. There was evidence before the trial court of Hanover\u2019s liability in excess of $35,000. In any event, the defendants bore the burden of providing this court with an adequate record for appellate review. Practice Book \u00a7 4061.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They have not sought an articulation of the trial court\u2019s findings with respect to Hanover\u2019s debt, or the basis for its failure to make any such finding. Practice Book \u00a7 4051.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the defendants have failed to present us with an adequate record to support the factual underpinnings of their claim, we decline to review it. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>206 Conn. 267, 277-78, 537 A.2d 1004 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The plaintiff on cross appeal argues that the trial court erred in (A) failing to establish a date on which the $35,000 guaranteed amount was due and then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>award the plaintiff interest at the statutory rate until the principal was paid, and (B) failing to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court should have determined that the defendants\u2019 $35,000 debt to the plaintiff became \u201cfixed\u201d on November 18,1986, when the plaintiff initiated its action by filing an attachment on the defendants\u2019 realty. The plaintiff concedes that the amount collectible on a guaranty is limited to the amount of the guaranty, but argues that once the amount falls due, failure to pay it results in the guarantor\u2019s liability for interest on that amount from the date the amount falls due. It asserts, therefore, that beginning on November 18,1986, it became entitled to interest at the rate of 10 percent under General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 37-3a,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> yielding a total amount of damages of $39,113.12 as of the date the trial court filed its memorandum of decision, January 22, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Under \u00a7 37-3a, an allowance of prejudgment interest turns on \u201c \u2018whether the detention of the money is or is not wrongful under the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Cecio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Feldmann, </em>161 Conn. 265, 275, 287 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>374 (1971).\u201d <em>Newington </em>v. <em>General Sanitation Service Co., </em>196 Conn. 81, 90, 491 A.2d 363 (1985).

The court noted that \u201c[i]t was the practice of plaintiff to charge the defendants interest on any outstanding balance not promptly paid,\u201d but that the \u201crate of interest charged varied from less than 1 per cent per month to as high as <em>V-k </em>per cent per month.\u201d It concluded that it was \u201cimpossible for this court to find that there was a meeting of the minds that defendants\u2019 guaranty extended beyond $35,000.00 to the extent of interest on that amount at 12 per cent per year because that was the rate expressed in the \u2018installment note.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the memorandum of decision demonstrates that at trial the plaintiff sought interest at the rate of 12 percent, as set forth in the installment note, and not ten percent, based on the statutory rate of \u00a7 37-3a. Moreover, a simple comparison of the $54,943.86 sought in the complaint with the $39,113.12 asserted on the cross appeal demonstrates that the issue of interest pressed on appeal is not the same as that litigated at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Nothing in the record indicates that the plaintiff distinctly raised at trial the issue now argued on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Neither the defendants on appeal nor the plaintiff on cross appeal ordered transcripts of the proceedings below. Cf. <em>Nair </em>v. <em>Thaw, </em>156 Conn. 445, 455, 242 A.2d 757 (1968). Further, the record does not indicate that the plaintiff sought an articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision concerning interest on the judgment of $35,000. \u201cWe have repeatedly held that this court will not consider claimed errors on the part of the trial court unless it appears on the record that the question was distinctly raised at trial and was ruled upon and decided by the court adversely to the appellant\u2019s claim. See Practice Book \u00a7 3063 [now \u00a7 4185] .... Moreover, it is an appellant\u2019s burden, utilizing the rules of practice, to ensure that this court is provided with an adequate appellate record.

Because an award of prejudgment interest under \u00a7 37-3a raises a question of fact which is not evident in the record before us, we decline to review the plaintiff\u2019s claim for interest. Practice Book \u00a7 4185.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The plaintiff next claims on cross appeal that the trial court erred in failing to allow it reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The plaintiff argues that its right to attorney\u2019s fees is expressly provided in the language of the installment note stating that \u201c[i]n the event of default hereunder the undersigned agree to pay all costs of collection including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d It further asserts that our review is not limited to the question whether the trial court\u2019s failure to award attorney\u2019s fees was clearly erroneous since the memorandum of decision does not at all purport to address the question of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">The record demonstrates that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees was included in its prayer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>for relief set forth in the complaint. Thus, the claim for attorney\u2019s fees was properly before the trial court. Because the trial court failed to address this claim, we remand the case to the trial court for an articulation of this issue. Practice Book \u00a7 4061.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The judgment is affirmed in all respects except on the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, on which the case is remanded to the trial court for an articulation in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\"> The parties in this case did not request transcripts of the proceedings below. Consequently, we must assume that the facts set out in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence. Cf. <em>Nair </em>v. <em>Thaw, </em>156 Conn. 445, 455, 242 A.2d 757 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\"> The defendants claim that the note is a negotiable instrument under article three of the Uniform Commerical Code; General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-104; and that in signing the note they became an \u201caccommodation party.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-415 (1). Nevertheless, neither the defendants nor the plaintiff relies on any provision of the code relative to the admissibility of parol evidence. We agree with the parties that article three principles are inapplicable in this case. See <em>EAC Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>King, </em>507 F.2d 1232, 1238 (5th Cir. 1975) (contract of continuing guaranty not governed by Uniform Commercial Code); <em>Liberty Bank </em>v. <em>Shimokawa, 2 </em>Haw.

The plaintiff also presses this point on appeal. The defendants, however, have not argued the applicability of the statute of frauds on appeal. Consequently, that issue is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42a-3-122 (1) provides: \u201cA cause of action against a maker or an acceptor accrues (a) in the case of a time instrument on the day after maturity; (b) in the case of a demand instrument upon its date or, if no date is stated, on the date of issue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-576.

The contract at issue in this case is the continuing guaranty between the parties, and not the underlying open credit account by which the plaintiff sold goods to the defendants\u2019 business.

App. 535, 536, 295 S.E.2d 226 (1982) (applying similar statute).
