On April 22, 1987, the trial court granted in part the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment with regard to the liens filed from 1972 to 1981. On January 11, 1988, the trial court found that the liens filed from 1968 to 1971 were also valid and, therefore, denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the action. On January 12, 1988, the trial court rendered a judgment of strict foreclosure and found that the total due for all the tax liens was $1,270,622.26. The defendants filed this appeal in the Appellate Court on January 29,1988. We transferred it here pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. Anthony E. Debek owned real property located at 1315-1357 Main Street in Bridgeport on which no municipal real estate taxes have been paid since June, 1967. Tax liens were filed with respect to these delinquencies each year. An involuntary bankruptcy action was filed against Debek on June 6,1975. Debek died shortly thereafter and his son, the defendant Allan C. Debek, was appointed administrator of his estate. On October 1, 1981, the United States Bankruptcy Court granted the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>relief from the automatic stay of other court proceedings that had been imposed upon the bankrupt estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The plaintiff thereupon instituted an action to foreclose the tax liens filed for the years 1966 to 1981 against the defendants Allan C. Debek, Marlene Debek, Todd J. Debek and Margaret Debek, and other parties not involved in the present appeal. On October 30, 1981, the plaintiff delivered the foreclosure complaint and summons to a deputy sheriff, who served each of the defendants involved in this appeal on November 11, 1981. The sheriff failed to make timely service on some defendants not involved in this appeal. None of the defendants filed a motion to dismiss because of insufficiency of service within thirty days of filing an appearance in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motions for summary judgment over the defendants\u2019 objection that the ten year statute of limitations contained in General Statutes \u00a7 12-175 barred this action. The court concluded, furthermore, that the sheriff\u2019s delay in serving some of the parties originally named in the complaint had not deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The defendants raise four claims of error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They claim that the trial court erred: (1) in ruling that only those parties not served within the requisite time period had standing to raise a claim of insufficient service of process; (2) in concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 12-175 is a statute of limitations whose operation may be extended; (3) in determining that bankruptcy law suspended the operation of the statute of limitations; and (4) consequently in determining that the total tax liens due and owing include the liens for 1966 to 1971. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We must first consider the defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff\u2019s foreclosure action because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to serve all the defendants within fifteen days as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-592. The trial court held that the defective service of process in this case implicated only the court\u2019s in personam jurisdiction, and thus that the defendants who had been properly served could not prevail on their belated attempt to raise defective service as a defense. Only the defendants who were properly served are parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The resolution of this issue presents no factual issues. The record fully substantiates the untimely service on some of the defendants, and the complaint about this defect by the remaining defendants, whose own service was entirely proper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The only issue therefore is whether the trial court correctly concluded that the sheriff\u2019s failure to effect proper service on some defendants did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction. We agree with the trial court. Our precedents make it abundantly clear that, except in the special circumstances of administrative appeals, defects in process do not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction. Only last year we reiterated that \u201c \u2018[\u00bfjurisdiction over the person, jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and jurisdiction to render the particular judgment are three separate elements of the jurisdiction of a court. . . .Facts showing the service of process in time, form, and manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>sufficient to satisfy the requirements of mandatory statutes in that regard are essential to jurisdiction <em>over the person.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 433-34, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988). The Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction only if it has no competence to entertain the action before it. <em>Meinket </em>v. <em>Levinson, </em>193 Conn. 110, 115, 474 A.2d 454 (1984); <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>191 Conn. 555, 559, 468 A.2d 1230 (1983); <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>177 Conn. 173, 185, 413 A.2d 819, appeal dismissed, 444 U.S. 801, 100 S. Ct. 20, 62 L. Ed. 2d 14 (1979); 1 Restatement (Second), Judgments (1982) \u00a7 11. \u201cUnlike subject matter jurisdiction . . . personal jurisdiction may be created through consent or waiver.\u201d <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 39, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985); see also <em>Insurance Corporation of Ireland </em>v. <em>Compagnie des Bauxites, </em>456 U.S. 694, 703-704, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 72 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1982). The trial court therefore had the jurisdiction to consider this case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The defendants\u2019 remaining three claims are actually three aspects of a single claim that the tax liens filed in the years 1968 to 1971 are invalid and unenforceable because no foreclosure action was brought within the ten year limit stipulated by General Statutes \u00a7 12-175.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff and the defendants disagree about whether, pursuant to \u00a7 Ilf of the Bankruptcy Act, Anthony Debek\u2019s intervening bankruptcy operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>to toll the running of this statute. We agree with the plaintiff that the statute was tolled by the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The defendants contend that \u00a7 Ilf did not toll the running of the time period allowed by \u00a7 12-175 because, in their view, the time limitation that our statute provides is not a statute of limitations. Under \u00a7 12-175, \u201cany tax lien . . . recorded . . . for more than ten years shall be invalid . . . unless an action of foreclosure has been commenced during such period of ten years . . . . \u201d The defendants urge us to construe this language as manifesting the intention of our legislature to establish time constraints that operate as a condition on the enforcement of a substantive right, as a limitation on the underlying liability, rather than as a statute of limitations that merely affects the applicable remedy. They claim that \u00a7 12-175 is analogous to other statutes whose time constraints we have construed as a limitation on the underlying liability, such as our mechanic\u2019s lien statute, General Statutes \u00a7 49-39;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Diamond National Corporation </em>v. <em>Dwelle, </em>164 Conn. 540, 543, 325 A.2d 259 (1973); see <em>Matter of Reardon, </em>10 Bankr. 697, 700 (D. Conn. 1981); and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>wrongful death statute, General Statutes \u00a7 52-555.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ecker v. West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 232, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987). The defendants also note that a federal court has construed a time limitation in the Washington mechanic\u2019s lien statute to fall outside of the suspension provisions of \u00a7 Ilf. <em>In re Warren, </em>192 F. Sup. 801, 803 (W.D. Wash. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The defendants may well be right that, for some purposes, \u00a7 12-175 is so intimately connected with the statutory creation of municipal tax liens in General Statutes \u00a7 12-172<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the time limitations it contains should be construed as substantive limitations on the rights conferred rather than as procedural limitations on available remedies. If that is the appropriate characterization of the statute, then as \u201ca limitation upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>right of action it must be strictly complied with.\u201d <em>DeMartino </em>v. <em>Siemon, </em>90 Conn. 527, 529, 97 A. 765 (1916). The question before us, however, is not what effect to give to \u00a7 12-175 under ordinary commercial circumstances. We must decide instead how this statute fits into the prescriptions of the federal law of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Our analysis of this issue must start with the recognition that, because of the plenary power over bankruptcy that the United States constitution grants to the federal government; U.S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 4;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Congress unquestionably had the power to provide that the filing of a bankruptcy petition tolls time limitations such as those provided by \u00a7 12-175. To the extent a state statute and the Bankruptcy Act conflict, the latter governs. <em>Marine Harbor Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Trust Co., </em>317 U.S. 78, 83, 63 S. Ct. 93, 87 L. Ed. 64, reh. denied, 317 U.S. 710, 63 S. Ct. 254, 87 L. Ed. 566 (1942); <em>Kalb </em>v. <em>Feuerstein, </em>308 U.S. 433, 439, 60 S. Ct. 343, 84 L. Ed. 370 (1940); <em>West Coast Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merced Irrigation District, </em>114 F.2d 654, 664 (9th Cir. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The question therefore becomes whether the Congress, in enacting \u00a7 Ilf, which provides that the filing of a petition in bankruptcy suspends the operation \u201cof any statute of limitations of . . . any State,\u201d intended to encompass time limitations such as those contained in \u00a7 12-175. In order to determine the intent of Congress, we look to the statutory language itself, to see whether it yields a plain and unambiguous answer; if the statute does not on its face lead to a definitive resolution, we turn for guidance to the purpose that the statute was intended to serve, and to the role of this statute within the overall statutory scheme of the Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>ruptcy Act. <em>Nicotra Wieler Investment Management, Inc. </em>v. <em>Grower, </em>207 Conn. 441, 451, 541 A.2d 1226 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>206 Conn. 421, 428, 538 A.2d 193 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Examination of the relevant language of the Bankruptcy Act discloses that, although \u00a7 1 of the act provides many definitions, the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d that appears in \u00a7 Ilf is not defined either there or elsewhere in the act. As a point of departure, we may therefore assume that the Congress intended to use the phrase as it is normally defined. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states that a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d is \u201c[a] statute prescribing limitations to the right of action on certain described causes of action . . . that is, declaring that no suit shall be maintained on such causes of action . . . unless brought within a specified period of time after the right accrued. Statutes of limitation are statutes of repose, and are such legislative enactments as prescribe the periods within which actions may be brought upon certain claims or within which certain rights may be enforced.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). On its face, \u00a7 12-175\u2019s limitations on the right to foreclose tax liens appear to satisfy this definition, which makes no distinction between substantive and procedural limitations on rights of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">A broad definition of \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d for bankruptcy purposes, is consistent, furthermore, with the purpose that \u00a7 Ilf was intended to serve. The suspension of the running of applicable statutes of limitations is an essential counterpart of the automatic stay, which is \u201c \u2018one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>Midlantic National Bank </em>v. <em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, </em>474 U.S. 494, 503, 106 S. Ct. 755, 88 L. Ed. 2d 859, reh. denied, 457 U.S. 1090, 106 S. Ct. 1482, 89 L. Ed. 2d 736 (1986); H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), reprinted in L. King, Collier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>on Bankruptcy (15th Ed.), app. 2, pp. 341-42. Under Bankruptcy Rule 601 (a), enacted to implement \u00a7 148 of the Bankruptcy Act, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy operates as <em>\u201ca </em>stay of any act or the commencement or continuation of any court proceeding\u201d to enforce a lien against the bankrupt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>N.L.R.B. </em>v. <em>Bildisco &amp; Bildisco, </em>465 U.S. 513, 530, 104 S. Ct. 1188, 79 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1983). The stay provides a \u201csanctuary from the jungle of creditors\u2019 pursuit of their individualistic collection efforts\u201d in order to safeguard \u201c[t]he primary function of the bankruptcy system . . . to continue the law-based orderliness of the open credit economy in the event of a debtor\u2019s inability or unwillingness generally to pay his debts.\u201d Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., Pts. I and II (1973), reprinted in L. King, supra, app. 2, c. 3, p. 71. The Bankruptcy Act is rooted in equitable principles. <em>Bank of Marin </em>v. <em>England, </em>385 U.S. 99, 103, 87 S. Ct. 274, 17 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1966); <em>Pepper </em>v. <em>Litton, </em>308 U.S. 295, 304-305, 60 S. Ct. 238, 84 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1939). It is likely that the Congress, having provided the debtor with a stay to protect his interests, would have intended the creditor to have coextensive rights to revive causes of action that were unenforceable while the bankruptcy stay was in effect. The defendants in this case have not suggested that, once bankruptcy intervened in 1975, the plaintiff would have been able to foreclose on its tax liens at any time before October 1,1981, when, at its request, the stay was lifted by action of the Bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ruptcy Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In these circumstances, it is only equitable to construe \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in \u00a7 Ilf to encompass the provisions of \u00a7 12-175.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">A broad construction of \u00a7 Ilf finds further support in the legislative history of the enactment of \u00a7 108 of the Bankruptcy Code, the 1978 successor to \u00a7 Ilf of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the new section is on its face more expansive than the old, the drafters apparently believed that the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d as used in the Bankruptcy Act had always referred to statutes that limit th\u00e9 right to bring an action generally, as opposed to a narrowly defined class of purely procedural limitations on actions. The Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States in comments to the proposed section (then numbered \u00a7 4-102 [b])<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> stated that the section \u201cis derived from \u00a7 Ilf of the present Act but reaches to unexpired periods of limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tation imposed by agreement or orders entered in other proceedings as well as to those imposed by law . . . .\u201d Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 93-137, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., Pt. II (1973), reprinted in L. King, supra, app. 2, c. 4, p. 69. Although the drafters commented expressly on the wisdom of extending \u00a7 Ilf of the act to include limitations other than those imposed by law, they apparently perceived no difference between the former language referring to a suspension of a \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d and the new language referring to a \u201ctime fixed for commencing an action.\u201d This perception is reenforced by statements made both in the House of Representatives Report on the proposed code, which describes \u00a7 108 (c) as extending \u201cthe <em>statute of limitations </em>for creditors\u201d (emphasis added); H.R. Rep. No. 95-595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), reprinted in L. King, supra, app. 2, p. 318; and in the explanations of the compromise bill by House and Senate floor managers which characterize \u00a7 108 (c) as \u201cexpressly including] any special suspensions of <em>statutes of limitations </em>periods . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The House Debate on Compromise Bill, 124 Cong. Rec. H11109 (daily ed. September 28,1978), reprinted in L. King, supra, app. 3, c. 9, p. 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">All the available indicia thus point to an interpretation of the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in \u00a7 Ilf, as a matter of federal law, as a broad reference to state-enacted time constraints, such as \u00a7 12-175, without regard to whether such time constraints might, in other circumstances, be viewed as substantive rather than as procedural. Indeed, we have ourselves, as a matter of nomenclature, recognized a linguistic overlap between substantive limitations and statutes of limitations. For example, in <em>Diamond National Corporation </em>v. <em>Dwelle, </em>supra, we stated: \u201cGenerally, \u2018limitations on actions . . . are considered procedural or personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>and thus subject to waiver .... This is so because it is considered that the limitation merely acts as a bar to a remedy otherwise available. . . . Such is not considered to be the case, however, where a specific limitation is contained in the statute which establishes the remedy. Here the remedy exists only during the prescribed period and not thereafter. . . . In such situations the <em>Statute of Limitations </em>is considered substantive . . . . \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 546-47 (holding statute of limitations in statute creating mechanics\u2019 liens substantive), quoting <em>Matter of Benjamin </em>v. <em>State Liquor Authority, </em>17 App. Div. 2d 71, 73, 230 N.Y.S.2d 888, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 13 N.Y.2d 227, 195 N.E.2d 889 (1947). As a general matter, as the trial court held, we have defined a statute of limitations as a bar to the maintenance of an action. <em>Simonelli </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>156 Conn. 49, 53, 238 A.2d 418 (1968); <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>131 Conn. 34, 38, 37 A.2d 695 (1944). The wording of \u00a7 12-175 fits within this broad definition because \u00a7 12-175 imposes a bar to the maintenance of an action involving tax liens recorded on private property in the land records of the town for more than ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Finally, our conclusion that the phrase \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d in \u00a7 Ilf encompasses the limitations upon suit contained in \u00a7 12-175 is buttressed by the analogous holdings of courts in other jurisdictions. Other courts have held that debts valid and enforceable at the time of the filing of a bankruptcy petition retain their validity during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings; <em>In re Berg, </em>33 F. Sup. 700, 702 (D. Minn. 1940); and \u201chave held generally that the filing of a petition in bankruptcy excused the taking of further action under state law to enforce liens.\u201d <em>In re Etherton, </em>88 F. Sup. 874, 879 n.15 (S.D. Cal. 1950); see also Martin v. <em>Goggin, </em>107 Cal. App. 2d 688, 238 P.2d 84 (1951). As the court stated in <em>In re Etherton, </em>supra, 879, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>a claimant\u2019s only remedy under state law was to foreclose or to sue, \u201c[h]e, having been prevented from doing so by the effect of a federal statute, the statute of limitation has not run even now.\u201d <em>In re Warren, </em>supra, on which the defendants rely, is distinguishable. That court, noting that \u00a7 Ilf suspends statutes \u201caffecting the debts of a bankrupt,\u201d construed the time limitation in the relevant state mechanic\u2019s lien statute as affecting only the security for the underlying debt, rather than the enforceability of the debt itself. Id., 804.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was not time-barred was therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> Title 11 of the United States Code, \u00a7 29f, the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, \u00a7 Ilf, provided: \u201cThe operation of any statute of limitations of the United States or of any State, affecting the debts of a bankrupt provable under this Act, shall be suspended during the period from the date of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy (1) until the expiration of thirty days after the date of the entry of an order denying his discharge; or (2) expiration of thirty days after the filing of such waiver or loss of such right . . . or (8) until thirty days after the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings, whichever may first occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Although the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 was replaced by the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, \u00a7 403 (a) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, preceding note; preserves the applicability of the Bankruptcy Act to these proceedings because the bankruptcy petition in this case was filed in 1975.
