Subsequently, the respondent was adjudicated a delinquent. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s allowance of the amendment on the ground that, in juvenile proceedings, a standard of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d governs midtrial amendments rather than the stricter provisions applicable to adult proceedings. <em>In re Steven G., </em>14 Conn. App. 205, 210, 540 A.2d 107 (1988). We granted the respondent\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issue: \u201cIn juvenile delinquency proceedings, what standard governs the authority of the state, after the commencement of trial, to amend the petition to include additional charges?\u201d We conclude that the Appellate Court correctly applied the appropriate standard, and we therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The facts of this case are fully set forth in <em>In re Steven G., </em>supra. We summarize only those facts pertinent to the certified issue. On February 3, 1986, the respondent was charged with criminal liability for robbery in the second degree. On July 9, 1986, the trial commenced. The complainant testified that she was working alone in a natural food store in New Haven on January 18, 1986, when two boys came into the store. One boy went to the rear of the store and engaged the complainant in conversation. The other boy went to the front of the store and put his hand on the cash register and pushed the buttons. When the complainant went to the front of the store, she was ordered by the boy there to \u201copen the drawer,\u201d which she did because she felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d While at the front of the store, the complainant paid no attention to the boy at the back of the store, and consequently was unable to testify about what he did. She also was unable to make any identification of the respondent \u201cwith certainty.\u201d She testified that after the money was taken from the cash register by one of the boys, both boys \u201cflew\u201d out of the store. She also testified that she did not observe the boy who had gone to the back of the store take money from the register.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The state then called the co-respondent, Ted F., as its next witness. Ted testified that on January 18,1986, he and the respondent were walking around the State Street area of New Haven \u201c[planning] to go rob a store.\u201d As they came upon the complainant\u2019s store, they decided to put their plan into action. Ted testified that he and the respondent entered the complainant\u2019s store and that the respondent went to the back of the store while Ted went to the cash register and \u201ctapped some buttons.\u201d Ted testified further that the complainant came to the front of the store and opened the cash register. He stated that the respondent \u201csnatched money first\u201d from the register, and that he himself then took the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Shortly after the beginning of the cross-examination of Ted, the respondent\u2019s counsel requested a recess, which the trial court granted. On the date that the trial resumed, July 16, 1986, the state filed a motion to amend the petition against the respondent to add four additional charges arising out of the same incident. The respondent and his mother were provided with notice of the amended petition on that date. The four additional charges in the amended petition were: (1) conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-135; (2) larceny in the sixth degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b; (3) conspiracy to commit larceny in the sixth degree; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-125b; and (4) criminal liability for larceny in the fifth degree; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-125a. The respondent\u2019s counsel objected to the added charges claiming that they violated the respondent\u2019s right to notice of the charges against him, his right to counsel and to present a defense, and that the added charges prejudiced the respondent. The state argued that an amendment was proper under Practice Book \u00a7 1029, claiming that the additional charges were brought because it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201csurprised\u201d by Ted\u2019s testimony. The trial court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1029, permitted the amended petition, and continued the case for one week until July 23, 1986, for completion of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On July 21, 1986, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the four additional charges. The trial court denied the motion on July 23, 1986. Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the respondent entered a plea of nolo contendere to a reduced charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respondent\u2019s plea was conditioned on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The respondent subsequently was adjudicated a delinquent child and was committed to the department of children and youth services for a period not to exceed two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The respondent argues that juveniles charged with delinquency offenses have a right to the same standard of fair and adequate notice of the charges against them in advance of trial as is constitutionally mandated for adult criminal defendants. He claims that the addition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of four new and different charges against him after the commencement of trial, made possible by Practice Book \u00a7 1029, violated rights secured to him by the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and also article first, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut constitution. In support of this claim the respondent relies principally on In <em>re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967), and Practice Book \u00a7 624.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt that the Due Process Clause is applicable in juvenile proceedings. \u2018The problem,\u2019 we have stressed, \u2018is to ascertain the precise impact of the due process requirement upon such proceedings.\u2019 <em>In re Gault, </em>[supra, 13-14]. We have held that certain basic constitutional protections enjoyed by adults accused of crimes also apply to juveniles. See [id., 31-57] (notice of charges, right to counsel, privilege against self-incrimination, right to confrontation and cross-examination); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970) (proof beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>421 U.S. 519, 95 S. Ct. 1779, 44 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1975) (double jeopardy). But the Constitution does not mandate elimination of all differences in the treatment of juveniles. See, e.g., <em>McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, </em>403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1971) (no right to jury trial). The State has \u2018a parens patriae interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child,\u2019 <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 766, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982), which makes a juvenile proceeding fundamentally different from an adult criminal trial. We have tried, therefore, to strike a balance\u2014to respect the \u2018informal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ity\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 that characterize juvenile proceedings, <em>In re Winship, </em>[supra, 366], and yet to ensure that such proceedings comport with the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 demanded by the Due Process Clause. <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>[supra, 531]; <em>McKeiver </em>[v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 543] (plurality opinion).\u201d <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>467 U.S. 253, 263, 104 S. Ct. 2403, 81 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>In re Gault, </em>the United States Supreme Court ruled that although a juvenile delinquency hearing need not \u201c \u2018conform with all the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing, [such a] hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 30, quoting <em>Kent </em>v. <em>United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 562, 86 S. Ct. 1045, 16 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1966). The right to adequate notice of the charges is among the essentials of due process and fair treatment that the <em>In re Gault </em>court held applicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings. <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 33. Notice must be given to \u201cthe child and his parents or guardian ... in writing ... at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation\u201d and must contain \u201cthe specific charge or factual allegations to be considered at the hearing.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Despite the state\u2019s assertions to the contrary, there can be no question that a midtrial amendment to an information adding different charges in an adult criminal proceeding is violative of due process. See Practice Book \u00a7 624; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>182 Conn. 585, 590-91, 438 A.2d 792 (1981). \u201cThe state\u2019s right to amend must be limited to substitutions that do not charge the defendant with an additional or different offense because the defendant has a constitutional right to fair notice, prior to the commencement of trial, of the charges against which he must defend himself. See U.S. Const., amend. VI; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jacobowitz, </em>supra, 590. <em>In re Gault, </em>however, did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>address the issue of midtrial amendments to charges in juvenile delinquency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In our view the Appellate Court did not err in applying a \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d analysis. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 263; see <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra, 543 (\u201cthe applicable due process standard in juvenile proceedings, as developed by <em>Gault </em>and <em>Winship, </em>is fundamental fairness\u201d); <em>Carrillo </em>v. <em>State, </em>480 S.W.2d 612, 615 (Tex. 1972) (applying fundamental fairness analysis to midtrial amendment in juvenile delinquency proceeding); see also <em>In re Appeal in Maricopa County, </em>111 Ariz. 103, 106, 523 P.2d 1304 (1974) (amendment at close of juvenile delinquency proceeding under rule providing for amendment at any time permissible if parties afforded sufficient opportunity to meet new allegations).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although we are mindful that <em>In re Gault </em>requires juvenile delinquency proceedings to meet the \u201cessentials\u201d of due process and fair treatment, we also recognize that the United Stated Supreme Court did not hold that a juvenile delinquency proceeding must conform in all particulars to the requirements of an adult criminal trial. <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 30. The court\u2019s desire to refrain from establishing such a requirement stems from its recognition of the need to balance the state\u2019s essentially nonpunitive objectives in juvenile delinquency proceedings with the fundamental demands of due process. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra. The procedural protections accorded alleged juvenile offenders appropriately may differ from those accorded alleged adult offenders because of the differing societal interests at stake. <em>Santana </em>v. <em>Collazo, </em>714 F.2d 1172, 1177 (1st Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 974, 104 S. Ct. 2352, 80 L. Ed. 2d 825 (1984). In its most recent decisions, in fact, the United States Supreme Court has emphasized the state\u2019s legitimate parens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>patriae interest in juvenile proceedings. <em>Schall </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra; <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>supra; <em>McKeiver </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Although some criminal trial standards have been implemented in juvenile delinquency proceedings, the public policy of Connecticut as expressed in the General Statutes contemplates a distinction between juvenile matters and criminal matters. See and compare General Statutes, c. 815t, Juvenile Matters, and c. 950, Penal Code: General Provisions. A further manifestation of this distinction is indicated specifically in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-145, which provides: \u201cNo child shall be prosecuted for an offense before the superior court, nor shall the adjudication of such court that a child is delinquent in any case be deemed a conviction of crime except as provided in sections 46b-126 and 46b-127.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Like our General Statutes, the Connecticut Rules of Practice contemplate a distinction between criminal matters and juvenile matters. Compare procedure in criminal cases, chapters 22 through 30, with procedure in juvenile matters, chapters 31 through 40. We note particularly that a juvenile delinquency hearing is circumscribed by Practice Book \u00a7 1034 (1), which provides: \u201cThe hearing shall not be conducted as a criminal trial; the proceedings shall be at all times as informal as the requirements of due process and fairness permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In synthesizing the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d analysis applicable to juvenile proceedings with the language of <em>In re Gault </em>pertinent to the sixth amendment right to notice, we conclude that the Appellate Court did not err in upholding the trial court\u2019s allowance of the amended petition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As we noted above, <em>In re Gault, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>supra, 33, requires that \u201cnotice be given at the earliest practicable time, and in any event sufficiently in advance of the hearing to permit preparation.\u201d In the present case, the respondent, his attorney and his mother had known of the incident underlying the charges in both the original and the amended petitions since February 3, 1986. The state claims that Ted\u2019s \u201csurprise\u201d testimony on the first day of the hearing prompted it to add the additional charges. The respondent has not challenged the state\u2019s motives for adding the new charges, nor has he suggested that the additional charges resulted from bad faith on the part of the state. Further, the trial court continued the case for one week after allowing the amendment. Since the state had presented its witnesses\u2019 testimony and the respondent had begun his cross-examination of the corespondent before the continuance, the continuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>allowed the respondent to consider the scope of his further cross-examination of the co-respondent, and to investigate the new charges. Moreover, the continuance also allowed him to consider calling witnesses on his own behalf, and otherwise to challenge the evidence presented against him. The respondent has not claimed that the continuance did not provide adequate time to prepare a defense against the additional charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Finally, the record discloses that the respondent entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree. This charge was obviously a compromise, resulting from a plea bargain in which the respondent chose to plead guilty to the less serious charge. There is no claim that the plea was coerced or in any way involuntary. The record does not indicate any effort by the state to rush <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the respondent to judgment or to deprive him of the opportunity to be heard or to assert any desired defense to the charges. Because Practice Book \u00a7 1029 requires a continuance if the new allegations justify additional time for preparation, and because the trial court ordered a continuance, we conclude that the respondent was given notice \u201cat the earliest practicable time . . . sufficiently in advance of\u201d the scheduled court proceedings. <em>In re Gault, </em>supra, 33. Nothing in <em>In re Gault </em>establishes a per se rule forbidding a midtrial amendment to a petition of delinquency adding substantively different charges arising out of the same incident. We conclude that the respondent\u2019s federal and state constitutional rights were not violated. It follows that the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 624, which are inapplicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings, do not apply to the present case by reason of constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[A] child may be found \u2018delinquent\u2019 (1) who has violated any . . . state law . . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-135. robbery in the second degree: class c felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the second degree when he commits robbery and (1) he is aided by another person actually present; or (2) in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom he or another participant in the crime displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u201c(b) Robbery in the second degree is a class C felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-8. criminal liability for acts of another.

The issue to be considered in such an appeal shall be limited to whether it was proper for the court to have denied the motion to suppress or the motion to dismiss. A plea of nolo contendere by a defendant under this section shall not constitute a waiver by the defendant of nonjurisdictional defects in the criminal prosecution.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-136. robbery in the third degree: CLASS D FELONY, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the third degree when he commits robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u201c(b) Robbery in the third degree is a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-48.

Ct. 1428, 18 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1967). None of these cases, however, involved midtrial amendments. See <em>D.L., Jr. </em>v. <em>State, </em>491 So. 2d 1243, 1244 (Fla. App. 1986) (no amendment issue); <em>D.P. </em>v. <em>State, </em>129 Ga. App. 680, 681, 200 S.E.2d 499 (1973) (receiving stolen goods not lesser included offense of burglary; no amendment issue); <em>In re Interest of Bryant, </em>18 Ill. App. 3d 887, 892, 310 N.E.2d 713 (1974) (defective original petition); <em>Interest of Korkosz, </em>393 So. 2d 332, 333 (La. App. 1980) (issue is whether state proved alleged offense beyond reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"AdvJ\">The respondent also cites the Arizona Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion <em>In re Appeal in Maricopa County, </em>21 Ariz. App. 542, 543, 521 P.2d 641, vacated, 111 Ariz. 103, 523 P.2d 1304 (1974), which only addressed the issue whether trespass is a lesser included offense of burglary. In that case, the juvenile was charged with burglary. Based on the evidence at trial, however, the trial court found that the juvenile had committed a trespass, and entered an adjudication of delinquency. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, on the basis that trespass was not a lesser included offense of burglary. Id. That decision, however, was subsequently vacated by the Arizona Supreme Court. <em>In re Appeal in Maricopa County, </em>111 Ariz. 103, 523 P.2d 1304 (1974). The court first determined that the Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that trespass was not a lesser included offense of burglary. Id., 106. The court, however, reversed the lower court upon the following ground: \u201cNevertheless the adjudication of delinquency may still be upheld. Rule 4 (b), Rules of Procedure for the Juvenile Court, 17A A.R.S. provides that \u2018A petition may be amended by order of the court at any time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>on its own motion or in response to the motion of any interested party before an adjudication; provided the parties are notified and granted sufficient time to meet the new allegations.\u2019. . . It is apparent from the foregoing that the court had in effect amended the petition alleging acts of delinquency on the part of the juvenile. . . . However it appears from the record that the court should have permitted the parties sufficient opportunity to meet the new allegations. Therefore it is necessary to remand the case to the juvenile court in order to permit the parties an opportunity to address themselves to the allegation that the juvenile had committed trespass.\u201d Id. A number of cases the respondent fails to cite, although arguably more on point, are ultimately distinguishable from the present case. In <em>In re Roy C., </em>169 Cal. App. 3d 912, 915, 215 Cal. Rptr. 513 (1985), the court held that the trial court erred in allowing the state, after it had rested its case, to amend the petition to include another offense that was not a lesser included offense of the original charge. In that case, however, \u201cno continuance was offered to prevent prejudice to [the juvenile].\u201d Id. The court noted that, \u201cgiven adequate time,\u201d the juvenile could have developed a defense to the new charge. Id., 918; see also <em>In Interest of Becker, </em>370 Pa. Super. 487, 496, 536 A.2d 1370 (1988) (holding that amendment at close of commonwealth\u2019s case alleging new charge violated due process; no discussion of effect of possible continuance); <em>In Interest of Bonner, </em>301 Pa.
