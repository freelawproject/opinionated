Collins. The sole issue on appeal is whether the commissioner had jurisdiction to award the plaintiff compensation benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433C.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the plaintiff\u2019s notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 31-294,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the commissioner had jurisdiction to award such benefits. There is, therefore, no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">This case revolves around the interrelationship of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; General Statutes, tit. 31, c. 568; and General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was enacted to \u201cprovide compensation for any injury 'arising out of and in the course of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on the employer.\u2019 <em>Jett </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>179 Conn. 215, 217, 425 A.2d 1263 (1979); <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 279, 240 A.2d 886 (1968).\u201d <em>Bakelaar v. West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 67, 475 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>A.2d 283 (1984). Heart disease and hypertension are just some of the many ailments compensable under the act. See, e.g., <em>McDonough </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>204 Conn. 104, 111-16, 527 A.2d 664 (1987). In order to recover under chapter 568, however, \u201c \u2018[t]he employee has the burden of proving that the injury claimed arose out of the employment and occurred in the course of the employment.\u2019 <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 550, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979).\u201d <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 67. Section 7-433c, on the other hand, was enacted to provide \u201cspecial compensation\u201d to qualifying policemen and firemen who die or become disabled as a result of hypertension or heart disease. Id. It requires the employer to pay compensation to those officers \u201cwho have successfully passed a physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>cal examination which failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease and who subsequently die or are disabled as a result of such conditions\u201d whether or not the \u201c \u2018disease resulted from the employee\u2019s occupation or . . . occurred in the line and scope of his employment.\u2019 \u201d Id., <em>68-69; Plainville v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>178 Conn. 664, 670, 425 A.2d 131 (1979). An employee may, if the facts so warrant, elect to proceed under either chapter 568 or \u00a7 7-433c. <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">It is undisputed in the present case that the plaintiff was a regular, paid, uniformed member of the West Haven police department. Upon entry into the service of the city, the plaintiff underwent a physical examination that failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease. On May 2, 1973, while off duty, the plaintiff suffered a heart attack and has since been totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On July 6,1973, the plaintiff filed a \u201cForm for Notice of Claim for Compensation\u201d with the commissioner. The notice, which is a standardized form provided by the workers\u2019 compensation commission, required the plaintiff to fill in basic identification information and to state the nature of his injury. This line of the form reads: \u201cNotice is hereby given that the undersigned, who while in the employ of.....(Name of Employer).....at ... (Town) ... on the .... day of.......19 . . . sustained injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment as follows: (State nature of injury in ordinary language).\u201d The plaintiff in this case typed the following response: \u201cAcute myocardial infarction \u2014 hypertension, heart disease.\u201d A copy of the plaintiff\u2019s notice form was sent to the city and to its insurance carrier, Commercial Union Insurance Company (Commercial Union), with whom the city had contracted to insure itself against workers\u2019 compensation claims. The city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>was self-insured for claims brought under \u00a7 7-433c. See <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">It was not until July 16,1975, that a hearing was held before the commissioner on the matter. At this hearing Commercial Union contested its liability to pay compensation under chapter 568 because it considered it doubtful that the plaintiffs illness resulted from his employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that hearing the city did not make an appearance to contest its liability under \u00a7 7-433c and, therefore, the commissioner decided to delay the rendering of an award. The commissioner rescheduled a hearing for January 21, 1976, to address the claim under \u00a7 7-433c and notified the city that it should attend. After the hearing the commissioner issued a finding in favor of the plaintiff awarding him benefits under \u00a7 7-433c. In limiting its award to such benefits, the commissioner refused to make a ruling as to the responsibility of Commercial Union under chapter 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The city appealed the commissioner\u2019s award to the Court of Common Pleas in April, 1976. Prior to a decision by the court, the plaintiff filed a motion to remand the matter to the commissioner for further proceedings. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was granted by the court on December 22,1977. The remand remained pending before the commissioner until November 30, 1981, when the city filed a motion to open and modify the commissioner\u2019s award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-315 \u201cto eliminate all references to \u00a7 7-433c, and to provide for liability, if any, based solely on Chapter 568.\u201d On April 23,1986, the commissioner denied the city\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">On April 30, 1986, the city filed a petition with the compensation review division for reconsideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>commissioner\u2019s denial of its motion. The review division refused to find that the commissioner had abused her discretion and upheld her decision denying the city\u2019s motion stating that \u201cthe use by Claimant of the words \u2018heart\u2019 and \u2018hypertension\u2019 in his own description of his injury certainly justified the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of that choice [of remedies] to be one under Sec. 7-433c.\u201d It thereafter dismissed the city\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On April 22,1988, the city filed an appeal from the review division\u2019s decision in the Appellate Court. We transferred the matter to ourselves, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On appeal, the city argues that the review division erred in refusing to find that the commissioner had abused her discretion when she denied its motion to open and modify the 1976 award in favor of the plaintiff. According to the city, the commissioner lacked subject matter jurisdiction to award the plaintiff benefits under \u00a7 7-433c because the plaintiff had failed specifically to notify the city of his intent to proceed under that section within one year from the date of the accident as required by \u00a7 31-294. Although the plaintiff filed a notice within weeks of his injury, the city contends that notice was notice only of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The city argues that because \u201c\u00a7 7-433c\u201d was not typed in the notice and not adverted to until the hearing before the commissioner in 1976, there was no timely notice of the \u00a7 7-433c claim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As we have stated on numerous occasions, while the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and \u00a7 7-433c are separate pieces of legislation, \u201c[t]he procedure for determining recovery under \u00a7 7-433c is the same as that outlined in chapter 568, presumably because \u2018the legislature saw fit to limit the \u201cprocedural avenue\u201d for bringing claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>under \u00a7 7-433c to that already existing under chapter 568 rather than require the duplication of the administrative machinery available [under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] and further burden the courts and the municipalities [with additional litigation from claims by firemen and policemen pursuant to this legislation].\u2019 \u201d <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 68, quoting <em>Plainville </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 671-72; see <em>Grover </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>165 Conn. 615, 617-18, 353 A.2d 719 (1973); <em>Cuccuro </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>6 Conn. App. 265, 267, 505 A.2d 1 (1986); <em>Janco </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 403, 405, 466 A.2d 1, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 805, 508 A.2d 31 (1983). Section 7-433c, therefore, directs claimants to the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; General Statutes, tit. 31, c. 568; to determine how to proceed with a claim for compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Section 31-294 states that \u201c[n]o proceedings for compensation . . . shall be maintained unless a written notice of claim for compensation is given within one year from the date of the accident . . . .\u201d That section also requires that a claimant\u2019s form of notice \u201cstate, <em>in simple language, </em>the date and place of the accident and the nature of the injury resulting therefrom . . . and the name and address of the employee and of the person in whose interest compensation is claimed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Compliance with \u00a7 31-294 is essential to maintaining a claim for compensation under chapter 568 and therefore under \u00a7 7-433c because timely notice is a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be waived. <em>Cuccuro </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra; <em>Janco </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 406; see also <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Waldron &amp; Sons, </em>112 Conn. 579, 584, 153 A. 298 (1931).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The plaintiff in the present case provided the city with written notification of his intent to seek compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>within weeks of his injury as required by \u00a7 31-294 and his form of notice contained all of the information required by that section. Indeed, the notice form he used was created by the workers\u2019 compensation commission to conform with provisions of \u00a7 31-294. Having complied with the procedures of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the plaintiff simultaneously raised a \u00a7 7-433c claim, and accordingly the commissioner had jurisdiction to award him benefits under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The city\u2019s argument that it was misled by the plaintiff\u2019s use of a workers\u2019 compensation notice form that contained language normally associated with such claims is without merit. No separate form of notice for \u00a7 7-433c liability exists, nor is such a form necessary, as the procedures for claims under that section and chapter 568 are the same. Further, as noted by the review division, the words \u201chypertension\u201d and \u201cheart disease\u201d used by the plaintiff in his own description of his injury were sufficient to alert the city of a \u00a7 7-433c claim.</p>\n<p id=\"As4\">The city argues that even if the plaintiff was authorized to use the workers\u2019 compensation form, he should have explicitly stated on that form that he was proceeding under \u00a7 7-433c. Section 31-294, however, does not contain such a requirement. Rather, the statute, by providing that a claimant should state the nature of his injury in \u201csimple language,\u201d suggests that the legislature intended the average lay person to be able to give notice of his claim without citing specific statutory provisions that would require substantial legal advice. The argument posed by the city would require otherwise. Moreover, the form of notice, created by the workers\u2019 compensation commission, tracking the language of \u00a7 31-294, did not require the plaintiff to provide such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Accordingly, since the plaintiff filed notice of his intent to seek compensation within one year of his heart attack, meeting all of the requirements of \u00a7 31-294, the commissioner had jurisdiction to award compensation under \u00a7 7-433c. Therefore, the review division did not err in upholding the commissioner\u2019s decision denying the city\u2019s motion to open and modify the award and in dismissing its appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1972)] Sec. 7-433c. benefits for policemen OR FIREMEN DISABLED OR DEAD AS A RESULT OF HYPERTENSION OR heart disease. In recognition of the peculiar problems of uniformed members of paid fire departments and regular members of paid police departments, and in recognition of the unusual risks attendant upon these occupations, including an unusual high degree of susceptibility to heart disease and hypertension, and in recognition that the enactment of a statute which protects such fire department and police department members against economic loss resulting from disability or death caused by hypertension or heart disease would act as an inducement in attracting and securing persons for such employment, and in recognition, that the public interest and welfare will be promoted by providing such protection for such fire department and police department members, municipal employers shall provide compensation as follows: Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 568 or any other general statute, charter, special act or ordinance to the contrary, in the event a uniformed member of a paid municipal fire department or a regular member of a paid municipal police department who successfully passed a physical examination on entry into such service, which examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>lion failed to reveal any evidence of hypertension or heart disease, suffers either off duty or on duty any condition or impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in his death or his temporary or permanent, total or partial disability, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive from his municipal employer compensation and medical care in the same amount and the same manner as that provided under chapter 568 if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment, and from the municipal or state retirement system under which he is covered, he or his dependents, as the case may be, shall receive the same retirement or survivor benefits which would be paid under said system if such death or disability was caused by a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment, and was suffered in the line of duty and within the scope of his employment. If successful passage of such a physical examination was, at the time of his employment, required as a condition for such employment, no proof or record of such examination shall be required as evidence in the maintenance of a claim under this section or under such municipal or state retirement systems.
