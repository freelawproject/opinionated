The issue presented is whether the mandatory minimum sentence prescribed under \u00a7 1324 violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-5\">Raad, indicted for sixty-seven counts relating to alien smuggling, pleaded guilty to three counts of smuggling aliens for financial gain, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324. Although the district court calculated Raad\u2019s sentencing range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines to be fifty-one to sixty-three months imprisonment, the court sentenced Raad to the mandatory minimum sentence of sixty months imprisonment required under the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Raad did not challenge this mandatory minimum at sentencing. Raad now appeals, claiming that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment because it is disproportionate, as it falls at the high end of the guidelines range.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-6\">When a defendant fails to object to an error before the district court, we review the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Hall, </em>314 F.3d 565, 566 (11th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>314 F.3d at 566; <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-12\">As this court has explained, \u201c[i]n non-capital cases, the Eighth Amendment encompasses, at most, only a narrow proportionality principle.\u201d <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995) (relying on <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991))). The Supreme Court has made it clear that, \u201c[o]utside the context of capital punishment, <em>successful </em>challenges to the proportionality of sentences [are] exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 289, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3009, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983) (emphasis in original). This is so because we accord substantial deference to Congress, as it possesses \u201cbroad authority to determine \u2018the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 103 S.Ct. 3001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>When addressing an Eighth Amendment challenge,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1314-4\">a reviewing court must make a threshold determination that the sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed and, if it is grossly disproportionate, the court must then consider the sentences imposed on others convicted in the same jurisdiction and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\"><em>Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d at 1214 (citing <em>Brant, </em>62 F.3d at 368).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-6\">We have upheld mandatory minimum sentences in other statutes. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210 (11th Cir.2000) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to the Aimed Career Criminal Act and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924); <em>United States v. Brant, </em>62 F.3d 367, 368 (11th Cir.1995) (rejecting challenge to career offender provisions); <em>United States v. Willis, </em>956 F.2d 248, 251 (11th Cir.1992) (rejecting challenge to mandatory life sentence required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)); <em>United States v. Benefield, </em>889 F.2d 1061, 1064 (11th Cir.1989) (rejecting challenge to mandatory minimum sentence for illegal purchase of food stamps at less than face value). Thus, Raad cannot show that his five-year mandatory minimum sentence was grossly disproportionate to his offenses of smuggling three people into the United States simply because the statutory minimum sentence fell at the high end of the guidelines range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201ca sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual [does not] become[] so simply because it is \u2018mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harmelin, </em>501 U.S. at 995, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (citing <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 467, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1928-1929, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-9\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1313-7\">. Raad also appeals the guidelines calculations. Because we conclude that the district court correctly imposed the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, any error in the guidelines calculations is harmless and we need not address these arguments. Additionally, there is no merit to Raad's claim that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621(2005). Raad was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentence based on the facts to which he pleaded guilty. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1313-10\">. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324, there is a three-year mandatory minimum sentence for the first or second violation, and a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for any further violations. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(B)(2)(B)(iii). Raad pleaded guilty to smuggling three aliens, and each alien is counted as a separate violation. <em>See United States v. Ortega-Torres, </em>174 F.3d 1199, 1201 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, Raad faced the minimum five-year term of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">. We reject the government\u2019s assertion that Raad has waived his right to appeal. The record does not contain a copy of the written plea agreement or a transcript from the change-of-plea hearing demonstrating any waiver of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1314-7\">. Because Raad cannot make a threshold showing of disproportionality, we need not consider the sentences imposed on others. <em>See Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d at 1214; <em>Brant, 62 </em>F.3d at 368.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
