He allegedly has been in custody since May 28, 2000. Sample filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habe-as petition asserting that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) is calculating his good time credit in a manner contrary to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). He argued that the statute requires that a prisoner be awarded \u201c54 days\u201d of credit for each year of his prison term, as imposed by the court, whereas the BOP is computing such credit based on each year <em>served, </em>which will allegedly result in his receiving 98 fewer days of good time credit over the course of his prison term. The district court denied Sample relief, concluding that the BOP\u2019s regulatory construction of any ambiguity in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) was permissible under the standard of <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-22\">Whether Sample\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>pretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b) or his own, Sample will not be. eligible for release before 2012. Moreover, the statute makes clear that good time credit must be earned by a prisoner on an annual basis; if is not awarded in advance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction to \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2. In order to give meaning to Article III\u2019s case-or-controversy requirement, the courts have developed justiciability doctrines, such as the standing and ripeness doctrines. <em>United Transp. Union v. Foster, </em>205 F.3d 851, 857 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Since standing and ripeness are essential components of federal subject-matter jurisdiction, the lack of either can be raised at any time by a party or by the court. <em>Sommers Drug Stores Co. Emp. Profit Sharing Trust v. Corrigan, </em>883 F.2d 345, 348 (5th Cir.1989); <em>see also Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cRipeness is a justiciability doctrine designed \u2018to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Park Hospitality Ass\u2019n v. Department of Interior, </em>538 U.S. 803, 807-08, 123 S.Ct. 2026, 155 L.Ed.2d 1017 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Given the temporally distant and speculative nature of Sample\u2019s claim, his allegations do not establish that \u201che \u2018will sustain immediate injury\u2019 and \u2018that such injury would be redressed by the relief requested.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Cinel, </em>15 F.3d at 1341 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that Sample\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition is not ripe for review, and we DISMISS the instant appeal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Even if we were to assume ar-guendo that we have subject-matter jurisdiction, we would conclude that the district court did not err in denying Sample\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition. Issues of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Santos-Riviera, </em>183 F.3d 367, 369 (5th Cir.1999). The appropriate starting point when interpreting any statute is its plain meaning. <em>See United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., </em>489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S.Ct. 1026, 103 L.Ed.2d 290 (1989). \u201cIn ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Section 3624(b)(1), 18 U.S.C., reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Subject to paragraph (2), a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner\u2019s life, <em>may </em>receive credit toward the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, <em>beyond the time served, </em>of up to 54 days <em>at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, </em>beginning at the end of the first year of the term, <em>subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons </em>that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations. Subject to paragraph (2), <em>if the Bureau determines that, during that year, the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with such institutional regulations, the prisoner shall receive no .such credit toward service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence or shall receive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>stick lesser credit as the Bureau determines to be appropriate. </em>In awarding credit under this section, the Bureau shall consider whether the prisoner, during the relevant period, has earned, or is making satisfactory progress toward earning, a high school diploma or an equivalent degree. <em>Credit that has not been earned may not later be granted. </em>Subject to paragraph (2), <em>credit for the last year or portion of a year of the term of imprisonment shall be prorated and credited within the last six weeks of the sentence.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">(emphasis added).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We disagree with Sample\u2019s contention that the \u201cplain language\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1) requires that his good time credit be computed in a manner that would award him \u201c54 days\u201d for each year of his \u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d based on the \u201csentence actually imposed by the sentencing judge.\u201d It is plain from the statute that an inmate must <em>earn </em>good time credit; the statute grants the BOP itself the power to determine whether or not, during a given year, the inmate has complied with institutional disciplinary rules. Good time credit thus is not awarded in advance, and any entitlement to such credit for future years is speculative at best. The statute also plainly states that a prisoner cannot earn any good time credit until he has <em>served </em>at least one year of his prison term. At that time, and thereafter \u201cat the end of each year\u201d of the inmate\u2019s prison term, he \u201cmay\u201d be awarded \u201cup to 54 days\u201d of good time credit. The plain effect of such annual awards is to <em>reduce an inmate\u2019s prison term incrementally while he is serving it. </em>For instance, if Sample were to receive annual awards of 54 days of credit until 2012, his sentence by that time would be several hundred days shorter than the 168-month term imposed by the court. The statute, however, contains no language that would permit him to receive <em>additional </em>good time credit based on the original prison term \u201cas imposed\u201d by the court, and it provides no method for computing such credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">If this statutory language does not \u201cplainly\u201d support the BOP\u2019s computation method, then it is at worst ambiguous. If the statute is ambiguous, deference to the BOP\u2019s interpretation thereof is required by <em>Chevron. </em>At least two sister circuits have so held, and they have concluded that the BOP\u2019s interpretation was permissible. <em>See White v. Scibana, </em>390 F.3d 997, 1002-03 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Pacheco-Camacho v. Hood, </em>272 F.3d 1266, 1270-71 (9th Cir.2003). We agree with the reasoning of <em>White </em>and <em>Pacheco-Camacho. </em>Accordingly, even if were to conclude that the case is ripe for review, we would affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Sample\u2019s pro se motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot because he is now represented by pro bono counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\"> Section 3624(b)(2), to which subsection (b)(1) refers three times, merely states that, \"[n]ot-withstanding any other law, credit allowed under this subsection after the date of enactment of the Prison Litigation Reform Act [in 1996] shall vest on the date the prisoner is released from custody.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
