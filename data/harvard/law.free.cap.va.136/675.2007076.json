As to this it is sufficient to say that the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth shows that the accused was guilty of the illegal, sale of liquor, while that introduced by him shows that he was guilty of the illegal gift of whiskey. In either event, the conviction is plainly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
