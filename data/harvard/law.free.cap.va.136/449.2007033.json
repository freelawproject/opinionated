One carload of 56,000 pounds being now on the way and a draft which came in through the First National Bank, $\u2014:-- having been protested for non-payment. Also a carload of scrap and one of pig iron remaining still on demurrage, the company not-having sufficient funds nor credit to release them. Also the current accounts payable for March and April remaining unpaid for the same reason. None of the directors nor stockholders having responded to the appeal for funds, the credit at the bank having been closed on account of the recent trouble among the stockholders and the directors, the company being thereby in a very precarious situation, and something must be done at once in order to relieve the situation and avoid an action for receivership on the part of the creditors. His personal credit being involved, the president urges the board of directors to take immediate action. Messrs.

That as soon as they learned of this Martin and Reid and the president of the corporation went to Richmond to the office of the Commission, in the latter part of July, 1920. As to what occurred at the office of the Commission on that occasion Martin testifies as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\"><em>\u201c </em>* * and we planned between us, and the Commission agreed, that if Mr. Reid and I would return our commissions that he would not report us to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney of Campbell county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-7\">\u201c Q.

Of course, that commissioner had the auditor\u2019s report before him and he figures out how much I had been paid. I then showed him receipts of expenses I had incurred in connection with this business and he deducted the expenses and told me he didn\u2019t want me to suffer any actual loss other than the difference, because he believed that Mr. Reid and I had ignorantly violated the law and he didn\u2019t want to penalize us and didn\u2019t expect to do it if we would refund the actual gain in the proposition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-11\">It further- appears from such testimony that, on August 2, 1920, both Martin and Reid made their afore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>said refund of commissions, which had been retained by them as aforesaid, by checks payable to the said corporation, and, at the direction of said Martin as chairman of the said creditors\u2019 committee (who, as authorized by the creditors\u2019 committee, along with the secretary of the corporation handled the current business of the corporation), these checks were indorsed by the secretary of the corporation with the name of the corporation by himself as secretary and treasurer (he holding both positions), and the cheeks, so indorsed, were, at the direction of said Martin, as chairman as aforesaid, used by the secretary in making payments on account of two notes in bank, which had been discounted for the benefit of the corporation, and hence were the obligations of the corporation as principal, on which Martin and Reid, respectively, were bound as sureties as between them and the corporation, although their names on the face of such respective notes appeared as makers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">It further appears in evidence that the two notes were not obligations of the corporation created during the operation of its business by the creditors\u2019 committee, but debts which arose prior to the appointment of such committee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">It also further appears in evidence that on July 24, 1920, nine days prior to the aforesaid application of said refunded amounts, pursuant to the call of a sufficient number of stockholders of said corporation, a notice was sent out by the secretary, calling a special meeting of the stockholders to be held on August 4th (just two days after said application of the aforesaid refunded amounts were made), \u201cfor the purpose of considering and acting upon the question of closing up the business of the company, disposing of the assets, or the raising of additional capital necessary for the continuance of the affairs of the company, and for the transaction of any and all business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>necessary or desirable in connection therewith.\u201d And the circumstances shown in evidence demonstrate very clearly that the said Martin and Reid, at the time they made said application of said refunded sums, did so in apprehension that the August 4th meeting of stockholders would probably find that the additional capital, necessary for the continuance of the corporation as a going concern, could not be raised, and would probably decide upon closing the business of the corporation and liquidating its assets, and in apprehension that the result of the liquidation might be the failure of the assets to pay all of the debts of the corporation in full; and that Martin and Reid made such application with the intent to give the two debts aforesaid, to which said refunds were applied, preference, in so far as the money refunded was concerned, over all other debts of the corporation, and to thus reduce to that extent their personal liability therefor in case the assets of \"the corporation should prove upon liquidation to be insufficient to pay all its debts in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-5\">At the meeting of the stockholders, held on August 4, 1920, pursuant to said call, the following resolution was adopted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-6\">\u201cWhereas, it appears from the report of the officers of this company, that judgments have recently been recovered against it and that several suits are now pending and that there are no funds available for the liquida-, tion of same, and in order to prevent any creditor from obtaining priority and that all creditors may share rat-ably in the assets of this company, be it resolved:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-7\">\u201cThat the vice-president and secretary of this company execute and deliver a general deed of assignment tojMason Perrow, conveying all of the assets of this company, both real and personal, under the usual provision, terms and conditions of such deeds, in trust for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>the benefit of all the creditors ratably, except such creditors as have now priority by law, and especially granting to such trustee the power to sell at public auction or privately the plant, machinery and fixtures of this company. That the said trustee shall have the authority to employ such agents, attorneys and labor, etc., and shall have power to institute and defend suits, compromise claims for and against this company and in general to do all other acts and things he may deem necessary to conserve and promote the interest thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">But the deed of assignment directed by the last named resolution was never executed. The creditors\u2019 committee took the position that the special stockholders\u2019 meeting was called merely to consider giving that committee authority to sell the property and close up the business of the corporation; that the tenure of office of such committee had not then expired, and did not expire until November 3, 1920 (six months after its appointment), by the terms of the resolution of May 3, 1920, which appointed the committee; that the committee had not been dealt with at all or discharged by the stockholders\u2019 meeting; that the attempt by said resolution to make the deed of assignment was illegal; that the committee therefore had the right to ignore the resolution and continue in custody of the property and affairs of the corporation. The committee conferred with the secretary and he was of the same opinion on the subject as the committee and refused to execute the deed of assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">However, the creditors\u2019 committee, upon adoption of the resolution last mentioned, discontinued the operation at the plant, discharged the employees and stopped all operating expenses, but held on to the custody of the property of the corporation, as aforesaid, until the receiver was appointed in this suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Don P.

Did the appellants, Martin and Reid, acting as members of, or as authorized by the creditors\u2019 committee, even if they acted in good faith with respect to the belief that they have the right so to do, have the authority from the corporation to make the application of the sums of money, refunded by them, respectively, under the ruling of the State Corporation Commission, to the two debts of the corporation on which they were bound as sureties, and thus give such debts preference, <em>pro tanto, </em>as to and to the extent of such money over the other outstanding debts of the corporation, and thus lessen their personal liability for the payment of such debts in the event that the assets of the corporation should prove insufficient to pay all of its debts in full?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">The question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">It is apparent from the resolution of the board of directors which appointed the creditors\u2019 committee that it did not undertake to impose upon the committee all of the duties or to confer upon the committee all of the powers of the board of directors; but only a limited duty and limited powers. The sole duty imposed, as set out in the resolution, was \u201cto take charge of the property and conduct the operation of the corporation;\u201d and it is manifest from the other terms of the resolution that the powers conferred were limited to those expressly named, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u25a0or conferred by necessary implication, which were all such only as were incident to the custody of the assets, the borrowing of money to increase the working capital, and the conduct of the current operations of the corporation thereafter by the committee, in the \u201cdue course of business,\u201d and necessary to enable the committee to discharge the aforesaid duty. They did not embrace the power to distribute the assets of the corporation in the payment of debts of the corporation existing when the committee was appointed, or any part or parts of such debts. The debts in question were incurred by the \u25a0corporation prior to the appointment of the committee. Hence, it is plain that neither the appellants, Martin and Reid, acting as members of the committee, or as authorized by the committee, had any authority from the corporation to make the application of the. refunded money in question, if that money belonged to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> In 39 Cyc. 296, this is said: \u201c * * good faith is no defense where the trustee has arbitrarily overstepped the bounds of his authority.\u201d Citing the following mentioned cases of <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>Allen </em>and <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Seal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In <em>Gibney </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>156 Mich. 301, 120 N. <em>W. </em>811, on .a bill filed by beneficiaries under a will to set aside a deed executed by a trustee named in the will without .authority, it is held that good faith on the part of the trustee is no defense. On'this subject the court said this: \u201c* * good faith is a defense only where a trustee, acting within the limits of his powers, with proper prudence and diligence, commits mere mistakes or errors of judgment, but is not a defense where a trustee \u25a0disregards the limits placed upon his powers by law or by the trust instrument. 28 Am. &amp; Eng. Eney. of Law .{2d ed.), p. 1063, and eases cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In <em>Pennington </em>v. <em>Seal, </em>49 Miss. 518, a guardian lent out money of the ward without the previous sanction of court required by the statute, and the money was lost by the insolvency of the person borrowing the money. Held: The guardian must pay back the money. The court said: \u201c* * we are satisfied that the guardian, in this matter, was actuated by good faith and pure motives * *. If a trustee, whether his duties are defined by law or by instructions given by an individual who may appoint him, is under a duty to follow the directions of the law or the instructions given by the person who appoints him; and if he exceeds his authority or disobeys the rules prescribed for him, he acts at his peril and undertakes responsibility for the consequences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In <em>Pannill\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Calloway\u2019s Committee, </em>78 Va. 387, it is held that one who assumes to act as a trustee in relation to trust property, without just authority, is held personally liable for the estate of the <em>cestui que trust </em>converted by him to his own use. Upon this subject the court says this: \u201cOne who assumes to act in relation to trust property without just authority, however bona fide may be his conduct, shall be held responsible both for the capital and the income, to the same extent as if he had been <em>de jure trustee.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> That the money mentioned did belong to the corporation is manifest. It is true that, as an original proposition, the corporation had no right to compel the appellants, Martin and Reid, to pay back such money. The blue sky law did not confer upon the corporation any such right. Section 18 of that law, however, expressly provides that it shall be construed to give the State Corporation Commission \u201cpower * * to require the promoters of such securities\u201d (that is, such stock as was sold by said appellants), \u201cshall honestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>apply the proceeds of the sale thereof to the purpose for which such securities are sold.\u201d This statute, therefore, empowered the State Corporation Commission to require the appellants to apply the commissions they had retained to the purpose for which the stock was sold. As appears in evidence, that purpose was to supply the general needs of the corporation for money as capital; not the need to pay any particular debt or debts, or any part or parts thereof. Hence, when the Commission ruled that the said appellees must return the portions of the commissions aforesaid, the legal effect of the requirement was that such money be returned to the treasurer of the corporation as assets of the corporation; and when such appellees did in fact make such return by their checks payable to such treasurer and the checks were received by the latter, the money became part and parcel of the general assets of the corporation, of which, under the provisions of the aforesaid resolution appointing the creditors\u2019 committee, that committee was \u201cto take charge,\u201d and thus it became a trust fund belonging to the corporation under the control of the committee and held in trust by it as provided in such resolution; and which neither the appellants, in any capacity whatsoever, nor the creditors\u2019 committee, had any authority to distribute among the creditors whose debts arose prior to the appointment of the committee. The aforesaid application of such money was, therefore, a wrongful conversion of it by appellants, Martin and Reid, for their own use and benefit, in breach of the aforesaid trust, which rendered them personally liable, and, since they acted in concert in the matter, rendered them jointly and severally liable therefor; which was, in substance, the holding of the \u2022 decree under review.</p>\n<p id=\"A69\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> It is urged in behalf of the appellants, Martin and. Reid, that the corporation was not insolvent at the-time the aforesaid application of the money in question was made to the aforesaid payments on account of the two debts of the corporation in preference to other debts of the corporation; and the well settled rule is invoked that it is not fraudulent per se, under the State law on the subject, even for an insolvent debtor to prefer certain creditors in the distribution of his assets, if the preference is made in good faith, with no actual fraudulent intent; and it is urged that, in the case of a corporation, the directors, acting in good faith and without any fraudulent intent, may' make preferences-between creditors of the corporation, even in their own favor, where the directors are themselves creditors of the corporation\u2014citing <em>Planters' Bank </em>v. <em>Whittle, </em>78-Va. 737, and other authority to the same effect. But these well settled principles have no application to the-case before us, for the reason that we have not before us. the case of any preference made or attempted by the debtor corporation in the distribution of its assets between its creditors, through the action of its board of directors, or otherwise. We have before us the attempt of members of a committee of the board of directors of the debtor corporation.to act for the corporation in making such a preference, without any authority whatsoever so to do\u2014a wholly different situation. And such being the situation it is immaterial for us to determine whether, in the case before us, the corporation was or was not insolvent at the time the wrongful conversion of assets aforesaid was made; or whether or not'the conversion was made with fraudulent intent on the part-of the appellants. In \"any case, the conversion being without authority and in breach of trust, as aforesaid, it was wrongful, and having been made by appellants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>acting in concert, they are jointly and severally liable. Hence, the decree under review so holding will be affirmed; but nothing said in this opinion is to be construed as intended to affect any right which the appellants, Reid and Martin, may have, by way of subrogation, to assert against the corporation so much of the debts of the banks as was paid by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
