He is here assigning as error that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">The evidence for the Commonwealth shows that a special policeman, having \u201cnews that this still was run-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ning,\u201d and acting upon this information, took a companion with him to the still and found it in operation. Three men were found there. One of them was lying between the still and the worm. Tompkins, the accused, was sitting on a candy bucket, one witness says about a foot, and another about a foot or eighteen inches, \u201cfrom where the whiskey was running out.\u201d The evidence is not perfectly clear as to whether the accused ran. The officer and his companion were within thirty steps of the still when the other men ran. \u25a0 One of the witnesses says that he (Tompkins) had started, the other in one answer that he ran and in another, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, he <em>may intended </em>to run.\u201d The accused thus testifies as to this: \u201cAbout that time one of them said, \u2018There comes the officers.\u2019 He ran up the hill and I turned around on the bucket and one of these officers shot. It flew all over me. I had a gun and I said, \u2018Don\u2019t shoot this way, I am not going to run.\u2019 There was a little tree there and my intention was to get behind, and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t get behind that tree. Get out of there.\u2019 And he came up and got me.\u201d The accused further testifies that he knew, or thought, the still was there, and went to get a drink of liquor; that he saw the smoke when he went up the hill. That he had no interest in the still. About two gallons of whiskey were found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">We think it only necessary to say that this evidence justified the submission of the issue to the jury, and that their verdict is conclusive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
