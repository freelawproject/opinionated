It has never been deemed unreasonable to search for and take stolen property, smuggled goods, etc.; and the same rule has been uniformly held to apply to contraband, such as the illegal still for which the defendants in the instant case were searching, and no privacy of the plaintiff was invaded. Therefore, the search, without a warrant, of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, remote from his home and curtilage, and not even in his personal presence, was not an unreasonable search forbidden by the common law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b32-7\">16.

This thicket or the woods and swamp extended back on some adjoining land also, under different ownership from that of the farm occupied by the plaintiff. On a certain day in March, in the day time, the defendant officers, without knowing just where the boundary lines of the lands were, and, indeed, not thinking about the ownership of the land at all or that there would be any objection to their going on the land for the purpose they had in view, entered and searched the thicket, woods and swamp aforesaid, in the effort to find the illegal still which they had been informed as aforesaid was there. They found four or five places where stills had been, one bearing evidence of having been as recently removed as within a week, the others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>seeming to have been removed a month or two, or more, it not appearing, however, that any of sneh stills had been on the farm in question, except the one which had been found there, as aforesaid, about a year before the trial. The defendant officers became separated in the swamp, and one of them came out of the woods and sat down on the railroad track, off of the land of said farm, and, after waiting there for about an hour for his companions, fired a pistol shot, which was the signal agreed upon for them to get together. This shot was answered by a pistol shot which was fired by another of the defendant officers down in the woods, about fifty or seventy-five yards from the edge of the woods nearest to the dwelling house of the plaintiff, and about two hundred and fifty or two hundred and seventy-five yards from such house. These were the only shots fired by the defendant officers and the only conduct on their part that could be relied on by the plaintiff as being disorderly. The defendant who fired the last mentioned shot thereupon came out to the edge of the woods, which was about two hundred yards from the said dwelling house, and walked along the edge of the field of the said farm, which adjoined the woods, until he got off the farm and thence joined his companions; he being the only one of the defendants who came within sight of the dwelling house, so far as appears in evidence, and he at no time went within the curtilage or nearer than two hundred yards of the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">On the subject of search warrants, there was in force in this State at the time the alleged cause of action in this case arose, in addition to the common lav/, the following constitutional and statutory provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">Section 10 of the Virginia Constitution, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">\u201cSection 10\u2014General warrants of search or seizure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>prohibited.

Moreover, if while on the premises the defendants were guilty of disorderly conduct injurious to the plaintiff, which was malicious or wanton, or conduct in violation of the search warrant statute cited and quoted preceding this opinion, they were liable for punitive damages. The liability, in the former ease, would be a common law liability; in the latter, a liability imposed by the terms of such statute for acting without a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">We will here say that the jury were plainly warranted in finding from the evidence that there was no common law liability upon the defendants for malicious or wanton conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The decision of the instant ease therefore turns upon this single question.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> 4.

L., sec. 114, p. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">So that it is plain that the common law and the sections of Code and of the prohibition law last above quoted (which are but declaratory of the common law as applicable in such cases) gave the defendant officers the legal authority to make the entry upon the land in question for the purpose in question, without a search warrant, unless there is some rule of the common law, or Constitution or statute which inhibited them from so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> The position is taken for the plaintiff, which is earnestly urged, that the officers in such a case as this had no legal authority, without a search warrant, to enter upon any privately owned land, however remote from the dwelling house or curtilage, and although not in the immediate actual possession of any one, because a search warrant is in such case required, both (a), by section 10 of the Virginia Constitution and (b), by the statute aforesaid contained in Acts 1920, pp. 516, 517, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>in order to render such entry lawful. We will first consider the position (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">(a). To sustain the position (a) just mentioned the following authorities are cited: <em>Entick </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>19 Howell\u2019s St. Trials 1029; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>116 U. S. 616, 6 Sup. Ct. 524, 29 L. Ed. 746; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>232 U. S. 383, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652, L. R. A. 1915 B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915 C, <em>1177; People </em>v. <em>Marxhausen, </em>204 Mich. 559, 171 N. W. 557, 3 A. L. R. 1505; 2 Watson on the Constitution, p. 1415 (see also <em>Idem. </em>pp. 1417, 1418, 1419, 1424); <em>Gouled </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>255 U. S. 298, 41 Sup. Ct. Rep. p. 261, 65 L. Ed. 647 (advance sheets); Black\u2019s Const. Law, sec. 7, p. 9 (see also <em>Idem. </em>pp. 606, 607, 608, 612); Anonymous, Minor (Ala.), 52, 12 Am. Dec. 31; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>19 Cal. App. 469, 126 Pac. <em>375; Delafoile </em>v. <em>State, </em>54 N. J. Law, 381, 24 Atl. 557, 16 L. R. A. 500; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eyre </em>(Pa.), 1 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> The only entry by officers which is held by these authorities to be unlawful is that which occurs when the officers are making an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search or seizure. Such a search or seizure is forbidden by the common, law, and by the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States (which, however, does not extend to the State governments nor apply to proceedings in the State courts), which is but declaratory of the common law on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\"><bracketnum>[10]</bracketnum> In Virginia we have no constitutional provision on this subject, except section 10, which merely forbids, searches and seizures under \u201cgeneral warrants;\u201d not searches and seizures without any warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\"><bracketnum>[11]</bracketnum> What is meant by \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d in such section of our State Constitution is well settled historically and judicially, as appears from the above mentioned authorities. And as we held in <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Town of Bedford, </em>134 Va. 787, 115 S. E. 362; such war-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>rants are search warrants issued \u201c(1) without any evidence of fact furnished previously to their issuance, or (2) (which do) not designate any specific thing or person to be seized, or (3) (do not) particularly describe the offense claimed to have been committed.\u201d See to same effect Black\u2019s Const. Law, page 612. Such search warrants, as appears from the same authorities above mentioned, would, if valid, authorize \u2022 \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures; and it is for that reason that they are condemned by section 10 of our State Constitution aforesaid. In so doing, this section merely adopts and makes unchangeable by the legislature the common law on the subject, to that extent, but no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">It is manifest, therefore, that since the entry in the instant case was not under any search warrant at all, section 10 of the Virginia Constitution has no direct application to the case. It has an indirect application, however, in its enunciation in part of the common rule on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><bracketnum>[12]</bracketnum> We have now, therefore, to consider whether the common law condemns such an entry as that involved in the instant case, without a search warrant. It does not do so unless the entry is made in the course of an \u201cunreasonable\u201d, search. And, as the authorities show, what is meant by an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search is a search which is unreasonably oppressive in its invasion of the liberty of the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\"><bracketnum>[13]</bracketnum> It is well understood that the authorities above cited, involving the subject, hold that searches and seizures under \u201cgeneral warrants\u201d are \u201cunreasonable\u201d solely because, under their general terms, ministerial officers might search private homes and seize private papers and persons indiscriminately, unrestrained by previous judicial sanction. And the holding is precisely the same with respect to searches and seizures by officers without a search warrant. It is the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and political liberty of the citizen, especially the privacy of Ms home and Ms papers, which is sought to be protected by the common law rule against \u201cunreasonable\u201d search and seizure and which would be considered unreasonably violated if certain searches and seizures were permitted without search warrant, or under general search warrants.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We find no indication in any of the authorities that protection of the title, or the constructive possession of property, is the controlling object of the common law rule against unreasonable searches and seizures. No right- of property is primarily intended to be protected' thereby, and certain property rights, not inclusive of those involved in the instant ease, are incidently protected only because they are immediately incidental to and inseparable from the enjoyment of the personal, rights aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">This is true of all of the decisions aforesaid cited and. relied on for the plaintiff. Anonymous, <em>supra, </em>involved the search of a dwelling house without a warrant; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ross, supra, </em>a dwelling house and curtilage, without a warrant; <em>Delafoile </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>a hotel (the home of the landlord and wife) and assault upon the landlord\u2019s wife, without a warrant; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eyre, supra, </em>the curtilage, without a warrant; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marxhausen, supra, </em>a dwelling house, without a warrant; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>U. S., supra, </em>letters and private documents ordered to be produced; <em>Entick v. Carrington, supra, </em>private papers seized in a dwelling house, under a. \u201cgeneral warrant;\u201d <em>Gouled </em>v. <em>U. S., supra, </em>private papers seized and taken from an office, without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In <em>Faulkner </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>Gilm. (21 Va.) 221, cited for-the plaintiff, the entry was by the landlord, not an officer, but the entry originally lawful became unlawful <em>ah initio, </em>under settled principles, because of the subse\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>quent unlawful conduct of the landlord in breaking into the dwelling house, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><bracketnum>[14, 15]</bracketnum> All of the authorities concur in the view that only \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures are forbidden by the comm on law rule aforesaid, or by the Federal and State constitutional provisions on the same subject;, that \u201cunreasonable\u201d searches and seizures without a search warrant are not thereby forbidden; and that what is a reasonable or an unreasonable search or seizure is \u201cpurely a judicial question and in determining it the court must look to all the circumstances.\u201d 2 Watson on the Constitution, pp. 1417, 1418. See to same effect Black\u2019s Const. Law, p. 612; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>2 Biss. 99, 102, Fed. Cas. No. 9,252; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>U. S., </em>supra; <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>U. S. </em>(C. C. A.), 268 Fed. 795, 803; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Bookbinder </em>(D. C.), 278 Fed. 216, 218; <em>O'Connor </em>v. <em>U. S. </em>(D. C.), 281 Fed. 396, 398-9; <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>U. S. </em>(C. C. A.), 268 Fed.795, 803-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In the case last cited, this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">\u201cNot all searches and seizures are forbidden. Consider first the character of the property that may be seized. It never has been deemed unreasonable to hunt for and take stolen property, smuggled goods, implements of crime, and the like. * * * Consider next the person whose privacy is invaded. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The same rule there announced has been uniformly held to apply to contraband (such as was the illegal still for which the defendants in the instant case were searching), <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Moss, supra, </em>([C. C. A.], 278 Fed. 123); and no privacy of the plaintiff was invaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">It is too manifest for further elaboration that the search, without a warrant, of the plaintiff\u2019s premises, remote from his home and curtilage, and not even in his personal presence, was not an \u201cunreasonable\u201d search, and hence was not forbidden by the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number><bracketnum>[16]</bracketnum> The sole question, therefore, which remains for our decision is that presented by the position (b) taken for the plaintiff, as above stated, namely:</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">(b). Did the statute concerning search warrants (Acts 1920, pages 516, 517) require the defendant officers to obtain a search warrant before making the entry on the land of the plaintiff, in the aforesaid locality, remote from his dwelling and curtilage, and not in his presence or immediate actual possession, for the purpose of searching for the illegal still which they \u201chad cause to suspect\u201d was there?</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\"><bracketnum>[17]</bracketnum> In the opinion of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for this circuit delivered by Judge Woods in <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Moss, </em>278 Fed. at page 129, this is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">\u201c* * every constitutional or statutory provision must be construed with the purpose of giving effect, if possible, to every other constitutional or statutory provision, and in view of new conditions and circumstances in the progress of the nation and the State\u201d (citing Supreme Court decisions). \u201cHence the provisions of Federal and State Constitutions forbidding unreasonable searches must be construed in the light of the constitutional provision against the sale, manufacture and transportation of intoxicating liquors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The same is equally true of the provisions of the search warrant statute under consideration, and they must be construed in the light of the aforesaid provisions of section 21 \u00a1J/-? of the prohibition law of the State authorizing the seizure of illegal stills without a warrant, and in the light of the common law and the statutory authority aforesaid conferred upon such officers as the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">So construing such search warrant statute we are of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>opinion that its provisions have no application to the search by the officers of such a place as that involved in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><bracketnum>[18]</bracketnum> It is plain, when the whole statute is read, that while it has a wider scope than the common law rule on the subject, in that it designates other places and things for the search of which search warrants are thereby required, for which the common law does not require search warrants; still, it is apparent that an attribute, not present in the instant case, is common to all of the places and things for the search of which the statute requires a search warrant, namely: the immediate actual personal custody by some one of the place or thing. The statute and the common law rule aforesaid are alike in this; it is the protection of the personal liberty and privacy of the citizen which is the prime object; the prevention of the unreasonable invasion of personal rights in the course of the administration of the law; and the protection which is given by the statute to property is purely incidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The word \u201chouse\u201d used in the statute, does not exhaust the class to which it refers, as is argued for the plaintiff. And plainly, in the light of the common law rule aforesaid, the words \u201cplace\u201d and \u201cthing\u201d mean other places and things of like character, with respect to being in the immediate personal custody of some one, so that the entry thereon or search thereof would violate the personal liberty and privacy aforesaid. Hence the cases of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>State, </em>104 Ark. 261, 149 S. W. 56, Ann Cas. 1914C, 302, and <em>American Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>128 Md. 382, 97 Atl. 999, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 33, relied on for plaintiff on this subject, have no controlling application.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The case must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
