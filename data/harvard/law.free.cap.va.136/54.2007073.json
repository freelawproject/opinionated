The verdict was for the county and plaintiff assigned as error the action of the trial court in refusing to set aside the verdict as against the evidence and enter judgment for the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Plaintiff when testifying used a memorandum which purported to show on what days the dogs were killed, and plaintiff testified^that this was the original memorandum made by him at the times he killed the dogs, but it developed before the jury, upon objection being made to the memorandum, that it was not in truth such original record, but only a memorandum made by the witness \u201cto refresh his recollection.\u201d The memorandum was not even introduced in evidence, and the plaintiff affirmatively stated that he had no recollection whatever that a .single dog was killed in the county. The only other evidence for plaintiff was the testimony of a witness that ten or \u25a0 twelve dogs were killed presumably in the county. Plaintiff\u2019s claim was for killing 187 dogs. There was testimony tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s claim that he killed eight dogs on a certain day was false, and there was testimony of the chairman of the county board of supervisors to the effect that he did not know that any dogs had been killed in the county.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-8\"><em>Held: </em>That the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict for defendant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b82-9\">2.

O. Petherbridge (hereinafter called plaintiff), against the defendant in error (hereinafter called the defendant county), seeking to recover of the defendant county the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which was disallowed by the board of supervisors, for the sum of $467.50, for killing, during the period from May 10 to October 11, 1920, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>inclusive, 187 untagged dogs in said county, on whom the license tax had not been paid, while acting as a State, game warden, at $2.50 each, that being the fee allowed by the statute to game wardens for such killing of dogs and by the statute made payable by the county in which such dogs are killed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\">There was a trial by jury which.resulted in a verdict, and judgment accordingly entered, for the defendant, and the plaintiff assigns error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">The claim as presented to the board of supervisors and disallowed was an unitemized account, dated, sighed and sworn to by the plaintiff on October 23, 1920, made out against the board of supervisors of the county for \u201ccapturing untagged dogs and destroying same, 187 at $2.50 each, $467.50.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">On the trial the plaintiff introduced only two witnesses, who testified in support of his claim, himself and a witness named Stephens. For the defendant county there were two witnesses, the chairman of the board of supervisors and the game warden for Princess Anne county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">The plaintiff testified that his dog killing operations were carried on during the period covered by his claim in suit both in Norfolk and Princess Anne counties. That he did not have any system about it; some days he would go out and some days he did not; sometimes he would be engaged in killing dogs all day and some days only during a'part of the day. That for the dogs he killed in Norfolk county, that' county paid him; that he presented the bill or bills to the board of supervisors of that county for the killing of those dogs and they paid for them\u2014for how many does not appear from the record before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-8\">In the opening of his testimony in chief the plaintiff used an itemized memorandum, which purported to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>show on what days the 187 dogs were killed; and how many each day; that they were killed on thirty-three different days from May 10th to October llth, inclusive; as many as twelve being stated as killed on two of the days in July, and nine, ten and eleven on other days in that month; thirteen on one day in August, seven, \u2022eight and nine on other days in that month; eight on two separate days in September, one of these days being September 23rd; and lesser numbers of dogs on the \u25a0other days; and the plaintiff first testified positively that the memorandum was the original record made by him at the times he killed the dogs. It developed before the jury, upon objection being made to the memorandum by counsel for the defendant county, that it was in truth not such original record, but only a memorandum made by the witness \u201cto refresh his recollection,\u201d and was used by the witness for that purpose only, as stated by his counsel. And on cross-examination the plaintiff admitted that, as a matter of fact, he had not kept any record of the time and place when the dogs were killed, making the following statement giving the reason for his not having kept such a record, viz.: \u25a0\u201cThe department does not require us to keep a record of when and where the dogs were killed. That is why I never kept it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\">Moreover, the plaintiff, by his testimony, admitted that he had no personal recollection at the time he testified of the killing of a single dog in Princess Anne \u25a0county. He depended wholly upon the said memorandum to prove the killing of the dogs in such county as \u2022claimed by him. He was asked if he could tell the location of a single dog that he killed in Princess Anne county? He answered: \u201cIt would be impossible.\u201d He was particularly interrogated about the item on said memorandum of eight dogs entered as killed on Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ber 23rd, and said that he remembered that day and remembered being at a magistrate\u2019s trial \u201cin the morning\u201d of that day, \u201cprosecuting a dove case;\u201d but couldn\u2019t remember killing a single dog that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-4\">Stephens, the only witness for the plaintiff other than the plaintiff himself, testified that he worked for the plaintiff in June, August and September, 1920, driving a truck used by the plaintiff in hauling away dogs killed in Norfolk and Princess Anne counties. He undertook to testify to only ten or twelve dogs killed (presumably meaning by the plaintiff, but he does not say so) in Princess Anne county, and merely made a general statement as to that, saying that ten or twelve were killed in that county \u201cto my knowing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The plaintiff was thereupon recalled to the witness stand and testified that Stephens was not with him on all of Ms dog-Mlling trips; that three other persons were with Mm \u201con different occasions\u201d (on how many \u201cdifferent occasions\u201d he does not say); but he gave a very lame excuse before the jury for not having them as witnesses on the trial. He did not have any of them summoned as witnesses. He said that he went to the home of one of these persons \u201clast week, two or tMee times to get him, but his people told me he was down near Suffolk, with a log gang, getting out timber;\u201d that another of these persons was a mail carrier at the time of the trial, and that he \u201ctried to get Mm Saturday, to get him, to come here. I went to the postoffice, but they said I could not get Mm.\u201d He made no excuse for not having the other person mentioned as a witness on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The chairman of the board of supervisors of the defendant county, a witness for such defendant, testified that he did not know that any dogs had been killed in that county.

This witness testified that he was at the magistrate\u2019s trial above mentioned that day. That he saw the plaintiff there about one o\u2019clock of such day and that plaintiff stayed there from that time \u201cuntil nearly night.\u201d That witness did not see plaintiff kill any dogs; \u201cwitness adding, however, the following: \u201cHe might have killed them after I saw him.

The sole question for our decision, therefore, is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">1. Is the assignment of error just stated well taken?</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As appears from the statement preceding this opinion, the memorandum, used by the plaintiff in the course of his testimony merely to refresh his memory, was not even introduced in evidence; and the plaintiff affirmatively stated that he had no personal recollection whatever that a single dog was killed in Princess Anne county. So that there was no evidence whatever before the jury to sustain any part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, except the single general statement of the witness, Stephens, introduced by the plaintiff as a witness in his behalf, who testified that \u201cten or twelve dogs\u201d were killed (presumably meaning by the plaintiff, although he does not say so) in Princess Anne county. Now, in view of the fact that the jury might have reasonably considered that this witness was under the influence olthe plaintiff ; that the breakdown of the abortive attempt of the plaintiff to maintain in his testimony before the jury that he was testifying from an original memorandum made at the time the alleged dogs were killed, which he admitted on cross-examination was not such a memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>randum, was sufficient in itself to justify the jury in believing that the plaintiff was wholly unreliable and that his claim was fraudulent; and in view of the further consideration that the jury were the sole judges of the credibility of the witness, Stephens, as affected by bias in favor of the plaintiff; by the indefinite character of his testimony, as it appears in the record; and by his demeanor on the witness stand, of which we can form no idea, and which, of course, does not and cannot appear from the record; the jury may have reasonably wholly disbelieved Stephens\u2019 testimony with respect to the \u201cten or twelve dogs.\u201d So that, as the jury may have reasonably found that there was no reliable testimony whatever, and, hence, no evidence before them, to sustain a verdict for the plaintiff, under the settled rule on the subject we must so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Moreover, there was the testimony for the defendant county of the game warden for Princess Anne county, and the admissions of the plaintiff himself as to his engagements on one of the days on which he claimed to have killed eight of the dogs included in his account, which tended to show that the account of the plaintiff was a false account.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Further: There was the testimony for the defendant county of the chairman of its board of supervisors, to the effect that he didn\u2019t know that any dogs had been killed in Princess Anne county. It seems reasonable to suppose that, if the number of dogs had been killed by the plaintiff, as claimed by him, within the period as claimed, the chairman of the board of supervisors of the county would have known something about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">There were, also, the other discrediting circumstances of the failure of the plaintiff to introduce any testimony to sustain his claim, beyond the aforesaid testimony of Stephens as to ten or twelve of the dogs, and his lame excuses for not producing other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As said by the court, in its opinion delivered by Judge Burks, in <em>Director General </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>133 Va. 487, 113 S. E. 835: \u201cA number of cases have come to this court on certificates of evidence since the Code went into effect, and we have been asked to set aside verdicts because contrary to the evidence, or without evidence to support them. We have uniformly refused to do so where there was involved the credibility of witnesses, whose testimony the jury might reasonably have believed, or the weight to be given to their testimony, or a question of the mere preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Citing <em>Lorillard Co. </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>127 Va. 734, 104 S.

We find nothing in any of these decisions in conflict with the rule in Virginia on the subject under consideration as it is stated in the above quotation from <em>Director General </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>or in conflict with the conclusion we have reached and stated above with respect to the verdict in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> In the petition and reply brief, and in the oral argument for the plaintiff, mention is made of certain colloquies between the trial judge and the plaintiff while on the witness stand, which are set forth in the statement preceding this opinion; and the' position taken for the plaintiff on this subject is that the jury was misled adversely to plaintiff by these remarks of the judge; and that this error was not cured by the instruction given upon the conclusion of the introduction of evidence, because such remarks were in direct conflict with the instruction, and that this, in effect, created a conflict in the directions to the jury. And in the reply brief for the plaintiff, on the subject of the remarks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the judge, this is said: \u201cIt was this attitude of the court\u2014this plain direction to the jury\u2014-that explains, as nothing else in the record can explain, the verdict of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> As above pointed out, the verdict of the jury may be reasonably explained, as we think, upon other grounds. We do not wish, however, to be understood as approving of the action of the learned trial judge in making the remarks mentioned; although they were doubtless made without any thought that they would influence the verdict, and when, for the moment, the judge was forgetful of the jealous care with which the rule on the subject in this State has, from the earliest times, forbidden the trial judge to express any opinion to the jury, except a hypothetical one, as to the rights of the parties. Hence we will say, that if timely objection had been made to such remarks, and they had not been corrected, by express reference to them, and there had been an assignment of error on that point supported by a bill of exceptions or certificate, bringing the matter before us for review, we might have felt constrained to reverse the case. But as the ease stands the subject cannot be regarded as before us and therefore cannot be dealt with by us. However, had objection been made to the remarks in question before the trial court they would no doubt have been promptly corrected and so explicitly as to have left no room for them to have misled the jury.
