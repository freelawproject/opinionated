For several years they had in their employ a man named Harry Stroup. There is no dispute as to the terms of his employment except for the season of 1918. While in the employ of plaintiffs in 1917, Mr. Stroup concluded he wanted an automobile but did not have the money to pay for it and approached plaintiffs for financial assistance in the matter. These negotiations resulted in the purchase by Mr. Stroup of a second hand Ford for $300. To pay for the car he gave his note for $50 indorsed by one of the plaintiffs, and they furnished the balance of $250 in cash, taking a paper which amounted to a chattel mortgage on the machine to secure the payment of this sum. Mr. Stroup made but few payments on the amount due on this chattel mortgage during the balance of that season. The parties disagree as to the arrangements for the season of 1918. The plaintiffs claim they were to pay Stroup $30 per month in cash and credit him with $20 per month on the amount due and if he remained the full season of 8 months, they were to. credit him with the further sum of $80 which was to be treated as a bonus. He insists he was to have $60 per month if he stayed the full season, and $50 per month if he quit before the season ended. It is undisputed that Stroup did not work the full season but it is a disputed question as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to whether he was discharged or quit of his own accord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-3\">Stroup and one of the plaintiffs took the car to the garage of one Bollinger at Lakeview, the idea being to have some repairs made upon it and to have it sold by Mr. Bollinger in order that both parties might get their money out of it. Bollinger was informed both orally and in writing of plaintiffs\u2019 claim on the car. He advertised the car for sale. Defendant saw the advertisement and went to the Bollinger garage to see the car. It suited him and the price was satisfactory but he did not want to pay all cash, was willing to pay $150 in cash and give a property note for the balance of $100. Bollinger told him plaintiffs owned the car or had a claim on it, the testimony varies as to the exact language used, and referred defendant to them to see about the terms of payment. Shortly after this defendant went to plaintiffs\u2019 place and there had a talk with one of them about buying the car and about giving a property note. They were willing to accept any note they could use at their bank but did not want to take a property note. About two weeks after this Mr. Stroup went to the Bollinger garage at Lakeview and, while Mr. Bollinger was in the back room, took the car out although he had been forbidden by Bollinger so to do. He drove to Morley where he left the car in a garage and went over to see the defendant. Defendant was not acquainted with Mr. Stroup&lt; until he came to his place. Mr. Stroup told defendant he had the car in his possession; that he would sell the car to him. Some of defendant\u2019s testimony is significant. He testifies on cross-examination:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>* * * Why did you tell him you didn\u2019t want to get in any mix-up?</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>On the garage at Morley.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b460-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Why did you do that?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>His saying it was the same car.

The trial judge submitted the case to the jury upon the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 lien, they claiming it to be $147, and Mr. Stroup claiming it to be but $90, which amount had been tendered by him before the trial. The trial judge was of the opinion that inasmuch as the undisputed testimony and the\u2019 admissions of the defendant established the fact that: defendant had actual notice of plaintiffs\u2019 claim before.' he purchased the car he could not claim the benefits of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser. He therefore withdrew the question of whether defendant was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from the jury. The jury found the lien to be $147, and to review a judgment entered in accordance with the verdict defendant brings the case here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b461-9\">Fellows, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8d\"><em>(after stating the facts). </em>There are numerous assignments of error but under the well recognized rule we shall only consider those relied upon by appellant in his brief. We need not consider the effect to be given the filing of the chattel mortgage without having attached to it the affidavit required by the statute (8 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 11988), or whether the proof sufficiently established that the original mortgage as filed did not have such affidavit attached, as the trial judge disposed of this feature of the case upon the ground that defendant had actual notice and therefore whether he had constructive notice or not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>was unimportant. Defendant, in answer to a question asked by a juror as to whether he made any attempt to find out whether the Rossman claim had been satisfied, replied that he did not, and added that he never thought of it until after he had paid the money. While this answer was not in strict accord with other testimony given by defendant, it is urged by defendant\u2019s counsel that, when taken in connection with other testimony, it makes the question of <em>bona fides </em>a question for the jury. The difficulty with defendant\u2019s contention lies in the fact that he is invoking the rules of the law merchant, of negotiable instruments, to a case not involving commercial paper. We are not here dealing with the purchase of a promissory note in due course or with what constitutes <em>mala fides </em>in such purchase. We are here dealing with the purchase of personal property upon which the plaintiffs had a lien, of which lien defendant had actual notice before he purchased the property. That the rule is different is settled by this court. In <em>Detroit Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>145 Mich. 656, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201cIt is a general rule applicable to transactions not involving commercial paper, that where one has notice of facts which would put an ordinarily prudent man upon inquiry, he cannot be considered a <em>bona, fide </em>purchaser, if he neglects to take such care of his own interests as an ordinarily prudent man would do, but that rule has not been applied to commercial paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the instant case the proofs are undisputed and it is admitted that when defendant first saw the car and negotiated for its purchase he was informed that plaintiffs owned it or had a claim upon it; he saw one of plaintiffs and was unable to make satisfactory terms of payment; about two weeks later a stranger offered .'him the same car he had tried to purchase of plaintiffs and told him it was the same car. He says he did not know whether this stranger owned the car or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>not. He claims to have then bought it without inquiry as to whether plaintiffs\u2019 claim had been. discharged or not. Under such circumstances he is not a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, and the fact, if it be a fact, that in his anxiety to acquire the car on favorable terms he forgot the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, his negotiations with them, or that he had notice of such claim, does not alter the situation. He was not a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser and the trial judge correctly disposed of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-6\">Moore, C.
