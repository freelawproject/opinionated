In an informal finding which is not questioned on appeal, the district court at least implicitly found jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1970).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are of the opinion, and so hold, that jurisdiction in this case is proper under \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">There has been no dispute that the amount in controversy here has at all times exceeded $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs (appellee sought $100,-000 in his complaint). Further, in accordance with our holding in <em>Lansdale,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there can be no doubt that this action \u201carises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a)(1970). Moreover, as we have recently held,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the mere fact that \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction is not specifically alleged is not determinative. Appellee Hander, then, possesses the same jurisdictional status as teacher and administrator Roane in our recent case of <em>Roane v. Callisburg Independent School District, </em>511 F.2d 633 (5th Cir. 1975), wherein we noted that <em>Monroe v. Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), and <em>Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973), left open the possibility, fully exploited by us in several cases, of \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction and that, \u201cRegardless of whether a school district is treated as a municipality or as a \u2018person\u2019, the record in this case indicates that the plaintiff Roane satisfied the jurisdictional requisites of \u00a7 1331,\u201d 511 F.2d at 635 n. 1 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">Thus, in accordance with the above discussion, we abide by our original determination that Texas junior college districts are \u201cindependent political subdivisions not immune from suit,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for Eleventh Amendment purposes. Accordingly, <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1972), does not constitute a bar to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Therefore, we hold that jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 1331 and that the \u201cnon-person\u201d rule of <em>Kenosha </em>is not controlling. With this clarification, our earlier opinion is in all respects affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The petition for rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the petition for rehearing en banc is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\">. As a preliminary matter, we note that, although appellants had argued in the district court that \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction was lacking, this matter was not presented in their briefs on appeal. In their post-argument memorandum and in their petition for rehearing, appellants still have not specifically focused on the jurisdictional question, preferring instead to contend that there has been no constitutional violation because, it is argued, appellee has no right to choose a method of grooming, but is bound by the rules of the college.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Nonetheless, we detail our jurisdictional holding herein because it is the determinative issue. Appellant would have us rehash our conclusion in <em>Lansdale </em>v. <em>Tyler Junior College, </em>470 F.2d 659 (5th Cir. 1972) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 986, 93 S.Ct. 2268, 36 L.Ed.2d 964 (1973), that freedom to choose a grooming style at the college level can rise to constitutional proportions. This we refuse to do. Thus, we have encountered no difficulty in determining that appellee possesses a valid claim for relief which arises under the United States Constitution, as we held in <em>Lansdale.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\"><em>. </em>Appendix at 4-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b263-11\">.

This holding thus obviates any potential problems which might arise, were jurisdiction based solely on section 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (1970), because of <em>Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109 (1973). In <em>Kenosha </em>the Supreme Court held that a municipality was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of sections 1983 and 1343. See <em>also Sterzing v. Fort Bend Ind. School Dist., </em>496 F.2d 92, 93 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1974). Since in this case jurisdiction exists under section 1331, we pretermit an extensive discussion of <em>Kenosha, see, e. g., Mitchell v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, </em>507 F.2d 662, 666-67 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b263-17\">. <em>See </em>note 1 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b263-18\">. <em>Kelly v.
