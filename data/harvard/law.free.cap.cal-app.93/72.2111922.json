The record herein discloses the fact that all the evidence introduced before the respondent board at the hearing of the charges against the accused was hearsay and consequently inadmissible\u2014with the legal result that the board was without jurisdiction to make the order of which complaint is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>Belying upon the authority of the said case of <em>Dyment </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>it is ordered that the judgment be and it is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Conrey, P.
