The action was to recover upon the covenant contained in the bond to the effect that defendant Tingey and appellant would pay for the materials used in the performance of the work. While the price specified in the contract would be the measure of recovery in an action thereon against Rubendahl, with whom the contract was made, nevertheless, as against defendants, in an action on the bond the measure of recovery as against them was the value of the materials, which appears to have been as specified in the contract under which the materials were furnished to Rubendahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Conrey, P.
