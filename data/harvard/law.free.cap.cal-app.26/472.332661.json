He had judgment in the lower court, from which this appeal has been prosecuted by the defendant. In addition to the usual papers constituting the judgment-roll, there is printed what purports to be a statement of the case presenting the evidence heard at the trial. It does not appear that this statement was ever settled by the trial judge; nor is there any stipulation attached thereto by reason of which this court would be authorized to take notice of the contents of that statement. It would seem from a note printed on the concluding page of the transcript that the motion for settlement of the statement was by the trial court denied. There is, therefore, nothing presented from which a review of the evidence can be made. Examining the judgment-roll, we find no error which willl warrant a reversal being ordered. The findings of the court seem to support the judgment and to have been within the issues made by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The judgment is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">Conrey, P. J., and Shaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
