There is no controversy as to the facts and it is stipulated that all the documents filed herein may be considered in determining this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The main question is whether a purported bond filed by appellant in said justice\u2019s court was sufficient to confer upon said superior court jurisdiction of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">It is not disputed that an undertaking on appeal from a justice\u2019s court is a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>68 Cal. 24; [8 Pac. 509] ; <em>McKeen </em>v. <em>Naughton, </em>88 Cal. 462, [26 Pac. 354].) The statute itself is plain enough. Section 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cAn appeal from a justice\u2019s or police court is not effectual for any purpose, unless an undertaking be filed with two or more sureties in the sum of one hundred dollars for the payment of the costs on the appeal.\u201d There is also a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>further provision in the same section as to an additional undertaking in order to accomplish a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">It is claimed, though\u2014and justly so\u2014that there is a vital difference between the ease where a bond, merely defective in some matter of form, has been filed and the instance where there is no undertaking at all or where it is so defective as to be entirely invalid. This distinction is clearly recognized in the decisions and it has been held that where an imperfect though not void undertaking has been given, another one may be filed-in the appellate court. This seems to be true on appeal to the superior court as well as to the court of appeal or the supreme court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">In <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Roadhouse, </em>5 Cal. 71, the bond was defective by reason of the omission of the words, \u201cto pay to,\u201d and the county court dismissed the appeal. The supreme court said: \u201cThe defect pointed out is so trifling, that the obligation of the bond would not be affected by it. Even if it were otherwise, the court should have given the party leave to file a good bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>8 Cal. 34, the bond on appeal to the county court was defective\u2014but in what respect does not appear\u2014and it was held that plaintiff should have been permitted by the county court to file a good one before the motion to dismiss the appeal was determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Amador County, 61 </em>Cal. 337, the supreme court approved of the action of the superior court in permitting the appellant to file another undertaking in lieu of an undertaking insufficient in form filed in the justice court from which the appeal was taken. It was said: \u201cWith respect to a question of practice, like that here presented, we do not feel authorized, at this late day, to disturb a ruling intended to assist parties to a hearing in the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In the recent case of <em>Werner </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>161 Cal. 209, [118 Pac. 709], it was said: \u201cAn undertaking on appeal from the justice\u2019s court, taken by the plaintiff, which erroneously provides that the sureties will pay all costs and damages awarded against \u2018the defendant\u2019 instead of \u2018plaintiff, \u2019 is defective merely and not a nullity. Such defect may be cured by the filing in the superior court of a sufficient undertaking, in pursuance of leave first obtained from that court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Other cases cited to the point by respondents are: <em>Rabe </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>15 Cal. 32; <em>Moyle </em>v. <em>Landers, </em>78 Cal. 107, [12 Am. St. Rep. 22, 20 Pac. 241] ; <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>34 Okl. 199, [124 Pac. 989]; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>37 Okl. 169, [131 Pac. 539] ; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>37 Okl. 457, [44 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1144, 132 Pac. 667]; <em>Churchman </em>v. <em>Payte, </em>37 Okl. 649, [133 Pac. 178]. To these we deem it unnecessary to devote specific attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In <em>Jarman </em>v. <em>Rea, </em>129 Cal. 158, [61 Pac. 790], some light is thrown upon the consideration of the character of the infirmity in the bond that may be corrected by a new undertaking filed in the appellate court. Therein it is said: \u2018 \u2018 The above provision of section 954 contemplates that, although an undertaking has been filed, it may be of such a character or in such a form as not to fully indemnify the respondent against the costs and damages which he may sustain by reason of the appeal. The use of the phrase, \u2018insufficiency of the undertaking\u2019 indicates a distinction between an undertaking which does not fully comply with all the terms of section 941 and the entire absence of the undertaking. An undertaking may be filed which is so defective as not to constitute any obligation upon the sureties therein, and which is in reality no undertaking at all. In such a case there is more than mere \u2018insufficiency.\u2019 There is an entire want of indemnity to the respondent, and section 954 has no application.\" It is true that said section 954 specifically refers to appeals to the supreme court and to a district court of appeal, but the supreme court, in considering appeals from the justice court, has approved the same practice as that expressly authorized by said statute. And in the decisions of the question whether a new undertaking may be filed in the superior court the same distinction has been made between a void undertaking, or one that \u201cis in reality no undertaking at all,\" and one that is merely \u201cdefective\" in not fully complying with the requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The vital consideration, then, is, whether the bond in question filed in the justice court was and is an undertaking in reality at all, and that would seem to depend upon the question whether it is sufficient to indemnify respondent and to impose upon the sureties the obligation to pay the costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The said bond was prepared on a regularly printed form designed for use as an undertaking for costs and also to stay execution and, after title of the court and cause, was in the following form: \u201cWhereas, <em>M. Blum, </em>the defendant in the above entitled action has appealed to the Superior Court of the County of <em>Humboldt </em>from a <em>judgment </em>made and entered against him in the said action, in the said Justice\u2019s Court, on the <em>17th </em>day of <em>August, </em>A. D. 1910, in favor of <em>M. </em>Cohen, said plaintiff, for...... or for the sum of <em>forty-three ($43.00) dollars and costs of suit,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">\u201cNow, Therefore, in consideration of the premises, we, the undersigned, do hereby jointly and severally undertake, in the sum of <em>One Hundred </em>dollars,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201cAnd Whereas, the appellant is desirous of staying the execution of said judgment, in so far as relates to the delivery of......we do further, jointly and severally undertake and promise, in the further sum of................dollars being the amount for that purpose fixed by the justice of said court, that during the............so as aforesaid fixed by the said justice of said court by which the said judgment was rendered and that appellant will pay any judgment and costs that may be recovered against <em>him </em>in the said action in the said Superior Court, not exceeding <em>One Hundred </em>dollars, as fixed by the justice of said court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">We have italicised the only written words in said instrument,' the printed form having been taken as the basis of the obligation, as already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">In considering the sufficiency of the foregoing it is well to recall that while there may be a stay-bond and an undertaking to pay the costs on appeal embodied in one instrument, only an undertaking for the payment of costs is essential to confer jurisdiction upon the appellate court. (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 978; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>159 Cal. 710, [115 Pac. 649].)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">We observe, also, that manifestly there was no attempt to complete the blank form of the undertaking to stay execution and that portion of the instrument may therefore be disregarded. Rejecting the printed matter relating to a stay of proceedings, we think it sufficiently appears that the document was intended as a bond for the <em>costs </em>on appeal. Indeed, it is perfectly clear that such was the intention, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>we believe that the expression of that intention is definite enough to be legally enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The bond was properly entitled and designated: \u201cUndertaking on appeal from a judgment directing the payment of money.\u201d It was signed by the principal and two sureties each of whom properly justified. It recites that the defendant has appealed to the superior court from a judgment entered against him in said action, on the seventeenth day of August, 1910, in favor of plaintiff for the sum of forty-three dollars and costs. With the omission of the redundant portion as aforesaid, we have the obligation of the parties expressed as follows: \u201cNow, Therefore, in consideration of the premises, we, the undersigned, do hereby jointly and severally undertake, in the sum of one hundred dollars . . . that appellant will pay any judgment and costs that may be recovered against him in the said action in the said superior court, not exceeding one hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It is difficult to conceive how the sureties could more effectually express their purpose to be responsible for the payment of the costs than to declare that they \u201cundertake\u201d that the appellant will pay said costs. Nor is there less doubt as to what \u201ccosts\u201d are referred to. As said, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>151 Cal. 591, [91 Pac. 506] : \u201cIt is somewhat difficult to imagine what \u2018costs\u2019 are alluded to in the undertaking, unless costs on appeal be intended, for the costs incurred at the trial in the justice\u2019s court had become inserted in and were a part of the judgment and were therefore included in the promise to pay the judgment. However, it is quite clear that.\u2018all costs\u2019 included costs on appeal.\u201d We think it.equally clear that \u201cany costs,\u201d referred to herein, would embrace all costs that might be incurred by reason of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Petitioner contends, though, that this position cannot be maintained in view of the following decisions: <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Times Mirror Co., </em>109 Cal. 607, [42 Pac. 147] ; <em>Estate of Fay, </em>126 Cal. 457, [58 Pac. 936] ; <em>Zane </em>v. <em>De Onativia, </em>135 Cal. 440, [67 Pac. 685], and <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>5 Cal. App. 762, [91 Pac. 405], In the first of these it was held that \u201can undertaking on an appeal from a judgment, which fails to contain a stipulation for the payment of damages and costs in the event of dismissal of the appeal, as required by section 941 of the Code of Civil Procedure, is ineffectual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In the <em>Estate of Fay, </em>126 Cal. 457, [58 Pac. 936], the same rule was declared and the Duncan case was cited as authority therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In <em>Zane </em>v. <em>De Onativia, </em>135 Cal. 440, [67 Pac. 685], the appeal was taken by only one party to the action and the undertaking purported on its face to be given on an appeal taken by several appellants and it was held that the undertaking was insufficient to support the appeal since, \u201cstanding upon the strict letter of their contract, the sureties could never be liable for anything upon this undertaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>the sureties failed to justify when required to do so and it was therefore held that the appeal must be regarded as if no undertaking had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Of the foregoing, it is manifest that only the first two can be regarded as at all in point and of these it is to be observed that they involved an appeal from the superior court. In such appeal the statute (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 941) specifically provides that the undertaking must be \u201cto the effect that the appellant will pay all damages and costs which may be awarded against him on the appeal, or on a dismissal thereof,\u201d while, as stated in the Jones case, \u201cThe law governing the matter of undertakings on appeal from a justice\u2019s court to a superior court is found in section 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d And as to this section it is to be observed that it seems to exact the specification, \u201cif the appeal be withdrawn or dismissed\u201d only when the undertaking is for a stay of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">But conceding that this provision is applicable to a bond for costs, it would still follow, under the authority of <em>Jarman </em>v. <em>Rea, </em>129 Cal. 159, [61 Pac. 790], a later case than <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Times Mirror Co. </em>or <em>Estate of Fay, </em>that the undertaking is not entirely void. Therein it is declared: \u201cIt cannot be said in the present case that there is an entire want of the undertaking provided for by section 941. The sureties undertake that the appellant \u2018will pay all damages and costs which may be awarded against him on the appeal. \u2019 The omission of a similar provision in case of a dismissal of the appeal does not defeat or impair the undertaking in case there should be an affirmance of the judgment. The undertaking is merely defective in failing to provide for indemnifying the respondent in case the appeal should be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>missed. This must be held to be only an \u2018insufficiency\u2019 which may be remedied by the filing of another undertaking. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The latest expression of the supreme court to which our attention has been called is found in <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>159 Cal. 710, [115 Pac. 649], Therein it is said: \u201cThe undertaking is in more than the sum of one hundred dollars, and is conditioned for the payment of the costs on the appeal. It thus contains all that is required by section 978 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to make the appeal effectual. Its validity as an appeal bond is not destroyed by the fact that it also purports to be given to' stay execution. Whether or not it is effectual to operate as a stay-bond is not here involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">It is true that the appeal bond therein contained the provision as to the dismissal of the appeal but, if it had been otherwise, we think the decision would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We think, as said in <em>Pacific Window Glass Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>8 Cal. App. 768, [97 Pac. 901], that \u201cthe conclusion we have reached responds to the spirit and corresponds with the trend of modern decisions on points of practice in general which is that causes should be permitted to be heard on their merits, where, in so ruling, positive viol\u00e9nce is not done some rule or rules of procedure and practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">We conclude that the bond was sufficient to bind the sureties and to give the superior court jurisdiction of the appeal. If this conclusion be sound, it would probably follow that no additional bond in the superior court was necessary. But respondent was thereby afforded greater security and of this' he cannot complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Petitioner\u2019s objection to the action of the court in refusing to dismiss the appeal because of the long delay of appellant in bringing it to a hearing cannot be considered on this application. Clearly, the court had jurisdiction to deny the motion as well as to grant it. It was addressed to the discretion of the court and, while the excuse for the protracted delay does not seem very satisfactory, the court\u2019s action is not subject to review here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on April 5, 1915.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
