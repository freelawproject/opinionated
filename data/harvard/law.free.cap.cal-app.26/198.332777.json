Fealy, a defendant herein, caused a vineyard to be planted upon said land and that during the setting out of the same and at their request the plaintiff furnished and performed the labor actually used in planting said vineyard and that they and the plaintiff mutually agreed on or about the 22d of March, 1912, that the said plaintiff should plant said vineyard on said land; that he should commence said planting immediately and do said work in a satisfactory manner, and that upon completion thereof he should be paid by said defendants therefor at the rate of two cents a vine, which was and is the reasonable value of said work at said time and place. \u2019 \u2019 This is followed by allegations of the faithful performance of the work by plaintiff and of the amount still due and unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">A demurrer to the complaint was sustained, it being the opinion of the lower court that it was not a proper case for a lien:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The statutory provision upon which appellant relies is the portion we have italized of section 1191 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as follows: \u201cAny person who, at the request of the reputed owner of any lot in any incorporated city or town, grades, fills in, or <em>otherwise improves the same, </em>or the street or sidewalk in front of or adjoining the same, or constructs any areas or vaults or cellars, or rooms under said sidewalks, or makes any improvements in connection therewith, has a lien upon said lot for his work done and materials furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">While no ease entirely like this has been found, appellant believes that the situation is covered by the principles announced in 22 Cyc. 5; <em>California Portland Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Wentworth Hotel Co., </em>16 Cal. App. 692, [108 Pac. 103, 113] ; <em>Donehoo </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>113 Ala. 126, [21 South. 70] ; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Buckner </em>(Ky.), 40 S. W. 915; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Fields, </em>79 Kan. 38, [131 Am. St. Rep. 278, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 378, 17 Ann. Cas. 405, 98 Pac. 1112].</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In 22 Cyc. 5, it is declared that an \u201cimprovement is more extensive than ordinary repairs and enhances, in a substantial degree, the value of the property,\u201d and \u201cwhen the term \u2018improvements\u2019 is used, reference is generally had to those only which are permanent or beneficial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>In <em>California Portland, Cement Co. </em>v. <em>Wentworth Hotel Co., </em>16 Cal. App. 692, [108 Pac. 113], it was held by the district court of appeal for the second district that a lien was properly allowed for the furnishing of trees, shrubs, plants, flowers, seeds, bulbs, etc., for a hotel lot in the city of Pasadena, the court saying that \u201cthe furnishing and planting of seeds, trees and shrubs and the caring for the same for such a period of time as would insure that the seeds had become well started and that the plants and trees were thoroughly settled in the ground, would seem to be an improvement to the real estate which was among those intended to be included in the provisions of section 1191 of the Code of Civil Procedure. It is probably not true, that under the terms of this section a gardener or tiller of the soil could claim a lien by reason of labor expended in the general care of trees or crops, but under the contract made by Chisholm it appears that he was only to plant the seeds, trees, flowers, shrubs, etc., and to see that they were well started after being placed in the ground.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In the Alabama case, the question was as to whether an apple orchard constituted \u201ca permanent improvement\u201d and the court said: \u201cThe evidence discloses that the value of the land itself was enhanced by the orchard, and that such improvements are permanent we do not think can admit of controversy. 10 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 243, and notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Buckner </em>(Ky.), 40 S. W. 915, the court of appeals of Kentucky held that a good stand of clover and orchard grass must be regarded as an improvement since it materially enhanced the salable value of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">In the Kansas case, it was declared that \u201cwhile it is recognized as the general rule that the plowing and cultivation of land theretofore under cultivation does not constitute a \u2018permanent improvement,\u2019 the breaking and reducing of wild lands to cultivation does constitute such improvement.\u201d In the note to said case, as reported in 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 378, are collated many decisions as to what comes within the purview of \u201cimprovements,\u201d to which reference may be had for further instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">We can see no ground for holding that the planting of a vineyard is any less an improvement to the land than \u201cthe planting of lawns and shrubbery\u201d or \u201cof an apple orchard\u201d or \u201cof clover and meadow grass\u201d or \u201cthe breaking and reducing of wild lands to cultivation.\u201d The planting of a vine<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>yard is generally supposed to be not only an important and valuable improvement to the land but one of a. lasting and somewhat permanent nature. It is assuredly supposed to enhance the value of the land and the vines become a vital part of the realty. It is true that appellant did not furnish the vines, but the statute makes no distinction between the one who furnishes the material and him who performs the labor in effectuating the improvement. The lien is granted' for the \u201cwork done and materials furnished.\u201d If the plaintiff had furnished the vines as well as planted them it seems that no question could be raised that he had improved the land and would clearly be entitled to the lien. Since, however, the work of improving the land as well as the contribution of material <em>for such purpose </em>is made by the statute a basis for the claim of lien, the present case could be no different in principle from the contingency suggested. In other words, the plain meaning of the statute is \"that whoever contributes to the subtsantial improvement of the lot, either by furnishing work or material, is entitled to the privilege of so enforcing his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Respondents claim \u201cthat the meaning and the purpose for which the said statute was enacted was to create a lien for all work performed by a contractor or a person in. grading a street, or placing a sidewalk in front of one\u2019s property or for filling a lot within the incorporated limits of a city, and not for work performed by one in the cultivation or tilling of another\u2019s land.\u201d But this view ignores the significance of the expression \u201cor otherwise improves the same\u201d and loses sight of the said decision of the appellate court and cases from the supreme court there cited. It may be said, also, that the planting of a vineyard stands on an entirely different footing from the ordinary cultivation of the soil. It may be doubted whether for the latter said section affords a lien, since that is probably not such improvement as the statute exacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">It may be suggested that what we understand to be the plain and natural construction of said statute does not seem to involve any injustice and it is in harmony with the manifest policy of the law to protect those who furnish labor or material to the advantage of the owners of property. In the nature of things, there seems no stronger reason for allowing a lien to one who grades or fills in the lot than to him who effects or contributes to the improvement herein considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The only case cited by respondents in support of their position is <em>Nanz </em>v. <em>Cumberland Gap Park </em>Co., 103 Tenn. 306, [76 Am. St. Rep. 650, 47 L. R. A. 273, 52 S. W. 999]. In that ease the court reaffirmed the well-established rule that a liberal construction should be given to what is known as the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, but it is declared that this applies only in favor of parties who are clearly entitled to such lien under the statute. Attention is called to the fact that the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law is purely a creation of and regulated by the statute and, therefore, but little aid can be derived by the courts of one state from decisions in other states unless the statutes are identical, \u201cwhich is probably not the case in any two states in the Union.\u201d Many of the decisions are reviewed and the court proceeds: \u201cThese holdings are largely based, if not altogether, upon the special wording and phraseology of the statutes under which they are made, and while they are instructive, they are not controlling under our statute. In the present case, the contention is that the lien rests upon a proper construction of tjie terms used in the statute, \u2018improvements made\u2019; but we think it evident from a reading of the statute that the improvements therein referred to are such as buildings and structures. The latter part of the section uses the expression \u2018building contemplated in this section \u2019; and this construction of these terms is strengthened by the use and the connection in which they are used\u201d . . . in other sections. . . . \u201cIn the ease at bar, the complainants \u2018improved\u2019 the property by putting on it flowers, shrubs, trees and by grading and probably graveling the grounds and walks, but they made no erections, structures, buildings, fixtures or machinery,\u201d and therefore it was held that no lien would attach for such \u201cimprovements.\u201d The particular statute therein construed provides: \u201cThere shall be a lien upon any lot of ground or tract of land upon which a house has been constructed, built or repaired or fixtures or machinery furnished or erected or improvements made, by special contract with the owner or his agent, in favor of the mechanic or undertaker, founder or machinist, who does the work, or any part of the work, or furnishes the materials or any part of the materials or puts thereon any fixtures, machinery or material, either of wood or metal, and in favor of all persons who do any portion of the work or furnish any portion of the material <em>for the building </em>contemplated in this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The difference between that section and the one herein involved is quite manifest. In fact, said section 1191 of the Code of Civil Procedure, does not contemplate a building at all, but provides for improvements to the lot or to the street or sidewalk in front of or adjoining the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As we conceive it, the only ground upon which could be excluded the improvement herein made would be to hold that the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is applicable to the provision \u201cgrades fills in, or otherwise improves the same,\u201d but this would be an arbitrary construction of the terms employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
