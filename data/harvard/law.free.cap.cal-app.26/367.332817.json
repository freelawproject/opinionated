The contract of sale contained the following provision: \u201cThe party of the first part agrees to do street work on Day Street on or before November 1st, 1909.\u201d It is this clause in the contract which the plaintiff avers that the defendant has failed to perform, and out of its alleged failure this cause of action arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\">We think the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s third amended complaint was properly sustained. The clause in the contract counted upon is too hopelessly uncertain to base an actionable breach upon. It could only have been made definite by averments showing that the parties to the contract at the time of its execution had by some sort of an agreement arrived at an understanding as to just what amount and kind and detail of street work was to be done by the seller upon the street in question. There is no averment of any such agreement or understanding in this complaint. The statement therein that the term street work \u201ccontemplates curbing, paving grading and guttering\u201d presents no issuable fact; nor is it made to appear either in the plaintiff\u2019s pleading or argument that the expression \u201cstreet work\u201d has any defined meaning either in common usage or in the charter, ordinances or other regulations of the city of Sail Francisco relating to the improvement of streets. This being so, we think that the third amended complaint of the plaintiff was fatally defective, and that the demurrer was properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
