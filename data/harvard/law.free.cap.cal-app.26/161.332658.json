If there be no ambiguity in the contract it must speak for itself; but where the language employed is fairly susceptible of either one of the two interpretations contended for, without doing violence to its usual and ordinary import, or some established rule of construction, then an ambiguity arises, which extrinsic evidence may be resorted to for the purpose of explaining. This is not allowing parol evidence for the purpose of varying or altering the contract, or of putting a different sense and construction upon its language from that which it would naturally bear, but for the purpose of showing the circumstances under which the language was used, and applying it according to the intention of the parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-11\">Id.\u2014Unlawful Detainer\u2014Meaning of Lease.\u2014It is held in this action of unlawful detainer that the evidence sufficiently showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the actual agreement 'between the parties was that the lessees were, at the time specifically designated in the lease, to render and deliver to the lessors, in writing, a just and true accounting of all the affairs pertaining to the conduct of the farm leased, and to deliver to the lessors an equal half share of the <em>net </em>proceeds and crops produced on the leased premises.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-5\">APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Napa County and from an order refusing a new trial.

That said defendants, on said first day of January, 1913, failed and refused to render such accounting or deliver to the plaintiffs said one equal half part of all the said proceeds,\u201d and \u201cdo now fail, refuse and neglect to furnish said plaintiffs with a just and true accounting of all the affairs pertaining to the conduct of said farm and to deliver to said plaintiffs, or their order, one equal half part of all the proceeds and crops produced on said farm and premises\u201d; that, on the seventh day of March, 1913, the plaintiffs demanded in writing from the said defendants such an accounting and the delivery to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>(the plaintiffs) of an equal one-half part of the proceeds of and crops produced upon said farm from the first day of June, 1912, to the first day of January, 1913, within three days after the service of said notice upon them (the defendants), or that they surrender the said premises to the said plaintiffs; that \u201csaid defendants have neglected and refused for the space of or more than three days after said demand had been served on them, and do still continue to refuse to render to the said plaintiffs\u201d such accounting or to deliver to them their just proportion of the proceeds and crops produced on said farm during the period mentioned. The complaint contains the further allegation, usual in such cases, of the wrongful withholding by the defendants of the possession of the demised premises after default in the performance of the covenants of the lease and without the permission of the lessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The defendants answered the complaint and filed a cross-complaint, in which a reformation of the lease, so that it will conform to the intention of the parties, is prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The defendants were given judgment upon the issues made by the complaint and the answer thereto, and this appeal, supported by a bill of exceptions, is prosecuted by the plaintiffs from said judgment and the order denying their motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The trial court permitted the defendants to explain, by parol testimony, certain language of the written lease, and the ruling so made presents the only question submitted for decision by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Those parts of the lease in question which are pertinent to the investigation here read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u201cIn consideration whereof the said parties of the second part hereby covenant and agree that they will properly till and cultivate the premises above mentioned during the term aforesaid in a farmer-like manner and that they will not commit any waste or damage or suffer any to be done; that they will at their own cost and expense keep the fences and buildings on said premises in good repair, reasonable wear thereof and damages by the elements excepted; that they will semiannually, on the first day of January and June of each year during the term of this lease and at the expiration thereof, render to said first parties, a just and true accounting of all of the affairs pertaining to the conduct of the said farm, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u25a0that they will deliver to said parties of the first part, or to their order, one equal half part of all the proceeds and crops produced on said farm and premises aforesaid. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">At the trial the plaintiffs contended, as they contend here, that, under the terms of the lease, and, according to the true intent of the parties as expressed therein, they were entitled to receive from the defendants, on the first day of January and of June of each year during the term of the lease, one equal half part of all the <em>gross </em>proceeds and crops \u201cproduced on said farm and premises.\u201d That this plainly appears from the lease itself, is the contention, and, hence, it is argued, the admission of parol or extrinsic evidence disclosing a different agreement would have the effect of varying the terms of the writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">On the other hand, the defendants insisted in the court below, as they urge here, that the understanding had by both parties of the meaning of the lease, at the time of its execution, and which understanding does not clearly appear from the language of the instrument, was that the defendants were to return to the plaintiffs, at the times specified in the lease, one equal half part of all the <em>net </em>proceeds and crops produced on the leased premises. In other words, the defendants claim that the understanding between all the parties was that the lessees should deliver to the lessors one-half of such proceeds as were realized from the farm as remained after the expenses of feeding the stock and the amount of certain products used by the lessees for family or domestic purposes were deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Thus it was made to appear to the trial court that the instrument was in that respect characterized by a latent ambiguity, and upon that theory it allowed oral evidence explanatory of the intention of the parties with regard to that covenant of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">There are \u201cgross proceeds\u201d and \u201cnet proceeds,\u201d and who can say to which of these the parties to the lease in this case intended to refer when they used the language: \u201cone equal half part of all the proceeds and crops produced on said farm\u201d? The mere word \u201cproceeds,\u201d unaccompanied by some qualifying word or language imparting to it definite scope or signification, cannot itself be said to refer either to gross or to net proceeds, and there is nothing in the language of the other provisions of the lease in the present case which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>discloses the sense in which the parties intended to use the word or which sheds any light upon the subject. A \u201cone equal half part of all the proceeds and crops\u201d is, indeed, a vague and indefinite phrase, and we think that the ruling of the trial court, in permitting evidence extrinsic to the instrument itself for the purpose of ascertaining what the parties intended to express by the use of that language, was not only perfectly proper but absolutely necessary. It is true, and, indeed, elementary, that \u201cit is no part of the office of construction to add to the contract or take from it, but it is to ascertain what the parties intended by what they have said. If there be no ambiguity in the contract, it must speak for itself.\u201d <em>(Peterson </em>v. Chaix, 5 Cal. App. 525, 533, [90 Pac. 948]; see, also, Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1858.) But, where, as is certainly true here, \u201cthe language employed be fairly susceptible of either one of the two interpretations contended for, without doing violence to its usual and ordinary import, or some established rule of construction, then an ambiguity arises, which extrinsic evidence may be resorted to for the purpose of explaining. This is not allowing parol evidence for the purpose of varying or altering the contract, or of putting a different sense and construction upon its language from that which it would naturally bear, but for the purpose of showing the circumstances under which the language was used, and applying it according to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>(Balfour </em>v. <em>Fresno C. &amp; I. Co., </em>109 Cal. 225, [41 Pac. 876]; <em>German Fruit Co. </em>v. <em>Armsby Co., </em>153 Cal. 585, [96 Pac. 319]; see, also, Code Civ. Proc., sec. 1861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">As before suggested, in the ease at bar it was not possible for the court to determine precisely what the parties meant by the use of the language under consideration, either from \u2022the language itself or from other provisions of the lease, and, as before declared, it was obviously necessary to a correct determination of that issue to resort to parol or extrinsic evidence, not, as the cases above cited declare, to vary the terms of the writing or insert therein or add thereto anything not embraced within the intentions of the parties, but to explain what they really intended to express by the use of language susceptible of either one of two interpretations, each of which would in no manner or degree do \u201cviolence to the usual and ordinary import\u201d of said language. (See <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>California Petroleum Co., </em>120 Cal. 629, [52 Pac. 1080].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The evidence received under the ruling complained of sufficiently shows that by the use of the language referred to it was intended to express in the lease the actual agreement between the parties, viz.: That the lessees were, at the times specifically designated in the writing, to render and deliver to the lessors, in writing, \u201ca just and true accounting of all the affairs pertaining to the conduct of the said farm,\u201d and to deliver to the lessors an equal one-half share of the net proceeds and crops produced on the leased premises. The evidence so admitted further shows that, under the agreement, the lessors were authorized and entitled to feed the stock on the farm from the crops of hay, etc., raised thereon, and that the lessees themselves were likewise authorized to use, for their own purposes, such of the produce of the farm, eggs, buttter, milk, etc., as they might reasonably require for themselves or for their family use. It also appeared from the evidence that the lessees rendered a written statement of the business affairs of the farm for the term referred to in the complaint and delivered to the lessors an equal one-half part of all the net proceeds and crops produced on said premises for the term mentioned in the complaint. The evidence thus referred to sufficiently supports the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The judgment and the order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Chipman, P. J., and Burnett, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
