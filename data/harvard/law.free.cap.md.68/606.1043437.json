The Court below by the decree appealed from decided they took a fee simple, and after a careful consideration of the question we are of the same opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Lord Coke says, if a man giveth lands to a man to have and to hold to him and his heirs <em>on the part of his mother, </em>yet the heirs of the part of the father shall inherit, for no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>man can institute a <em>nexo hind of inheritance not allowed by \u25a0the laxo, </em>and the words \u201cof the part of his mother\u201d are void ; and if a man giveth lands to a man to him and to his <em>heirs male </em>the law rejecteth this word \u201cmales,\u201d because there is no such kind of inheritance. <em>Co. Litt., </em>13a. He is here undoubtedly speaking of a <em>common law </em>grant or conveyance, for in another place he says, if a man by his last will devise lands and tenements to a man and to his heirs males, this by construction of law is an estate-tail, the law supplying the words \u201cof his body.\u201d <em>Co. Litt., </em>27a. Another passage. in this connection, much relied on by counsel, is this, \u201cand therefore if lands be given to the son and to <em>his heirs of the body of his father, </em>the son cannot take as heir of the body of his father, because the grant is to him and to <em>his </em>heirs and consequently he hath a <em>fee simple. Co. Litt., </em>27a. Counsel have argued as if the words \u201cheirs of the <em>body </em>of the father\u201d mean the sam\u00e9 thing as \u201cheirs of the <em>blood </em>of the father\u201d but to this we cannot agree. The former include only heirs in the descending line, while the latter include heirs both in the ascending and descending line, and in our opinion mean the same thing as <em>heirs on the part of the father. </em>Mr. Preston calls such an estate a <em>qualified </em>fee. <em>Px'eston on Estates, </em>448. But we think it may well be classified as a \u201cfee simple conditional\u201d within the purview of our descent laws. <em>Act </em>o/17-86, <em>ch. </em>45, <em>Act of </em>1820, <em>ch. </em>191, and <em>Code, Art. </em>47, <em>sec. </em>1. In Plowden it is said that at common law before the Statute <em>de donis </em>there were but two estates of inheritance; the one a fee simple absolute, as where a man hath lands to him and to his heirs generally, and the other a <em>fee simple conditional, </em>as where a man hath lands given to him and' to his heirs of his body, thus putting under the latter head what afterwards became a fee tail general. 1 <em>Plowden, </em>241. Kent speaks of qualified, base or determinable fees, and uses the terms as interchangeable, gives the same definition of a <em>conditional fee </em>as that given in Plowden, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>speaking of the restriction upon alienation in the case of a qualified or determinable fee, says the determinable quality of the estate follows a transfer of it. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com., </em>9 to 11. Preston also says a qualified fee confers only a limited power of alienation, entitling the owner to give an interest of the same extent and continuance only in another person that it would be iu itself, so that the estate will, notwithstanding the transfer, bo determinable, and into whose-soever hands it shall come will cease on a failure of those heirs to whom on the creation of the qualified fee the limitation is made. <em>Preston on Estates, </em>460. In the note by Mr. Alexander to the <em>8to,tute de donis, </em>in which the Maryland decisions on this subject are collected and ably reviewed, he defines a \u201cfee simple conditional,\u201d one which restrains the fee to some particular heirs, exclusive of others, as to the heirs of a man\u2019s body or to the heirs male of his body. <em>Alex. British Statutes, </em>91.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">An estate like the one created by this will \u201cto the heirs of the blood of the father,\u201d or to heirs <em>ex parte paterna, </em>is an estate limited to a class of heirs, but to a class more numerous than those in an estate-tail general, and therefore would probably be of longer duration. It may continue for many generations, hampered all the while with this restricted,power of alienation, and then cease. Such an estate, whether called a \u201cqualified fee,\u201d or a \u201cfee simple conditional,\u201d is clearly within the mischiefs which it was the object of the descent laws to remove. The purpose o\u00ed those statutes as declared in the preamble to the Act o\u00ed 1786, was to abolish the law of descents which originated with the feudal system and military tenures, because it was contrarj' to justice and ought to be abolished, and we are clearly of opinion that by the operation of these descent laws this estate has been converted into an unqualified fee simple. Nor can we discover in sec. 28, Art. 47, of the Code (which is a codification and re-enactment of the 6th section of the Act of 1820), anything which saves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>such an estate as this, or authorizes its creation now. Clearly it cannot save\u2019 an estate-tail general or a \u201cfee simple conditional,\u201d or an estate of any other description which by the <em>first </em>section of this Article is made a fee simple. We have said this estate comes within the operation of the first section, and we adopt what is said on this point by counsel for appellee in his brief, to the effect that it would be most unreasonable' to suppose that a law which sets free lands limited in tail and gives them the qualities of fee simple, should make it possible for a testator by a devise like this to make the land, the subject of it,, more inalienable than any lands held in fee-tail ever were.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b634-6\">(Decided 15th March, 1888.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
