Field, Jr., </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">The appellees could have a right of possession to the \u25a0goods in question, sufficient to sustain replevin on but <em>one possible </em>ground, viz., that the sale made to Levy was <em>rescinded. </em>For if that sale were <em>not </em>rescinded, it was still valid and in force ; and if it were still valid and binding, the goods were not the appellees\u2019 but Levy\u2019s; and the appellees could not claim them. If the sale, however, was <em>voidable, </em>and had been rescinded or annulled by the vendor, then the goods were revested in the appellees as against Levy, or any-one claiming under him with notice of the facts that made the sale voidable. The question is therefore narrowed down, to this : For what causes could Lodge rescind the sale to Levy? For fraud existing in the contract of sale itself, forming a part of it ? Or for a subsequently formed fraudulent intent to make away with his property generally, to the detriment of his creditors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>no matter how fair the original purchase may have been ? To this question there can be but one answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">Fraud affecting the contract of <em>purchase itself, </em>by means of which the purchase is effected, avoids the contract as to the fraudulent vendee, and all claiming under him with notice of the facts. <em>Wells on Replevin, secs. </em>320-5 ; <em>Benj. on Sales, sec. </em>648, <em>&amp;c.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">A fraudulent transfer confers no new rights upon creditors. They may appropriate their debtor\u2019s property to their claims, <em>in the way the law provides, </em>but not otherwise. If they seize it themselves, they act illegally. <em>Bump on Fraud. Conveyances, </em>460-1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">Fraud must he material to the contract which is to be avoided; for if it relate to another matter, or to this only in an indirect or trivial'way, it offers no ground for the action of the Court. It must therefore relate distinctly and directly to this contract, and affect its very essence and substance. If the fraud be such that, had it not been practised, the contract would not have been made, then it is material; but if it be shown that the same thing would have happened in the same way, if the fraud had not been practised, it cannot he deemed material. <em>McAleer </em>vs. <em>Horsey, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>439.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">The appellees\u2019 third prayer is further, entirely inconsistent'with the appellant\u2019s <em>first. </em>The one makes fraud in the original sale from the appellees to Levy, a condition precedent to the appellees\u2019 recovery; the other makes fraud in the subsequent re-sale only, sufficient, leaving the fairness of the first sale out of the question. Prayers must be consistent with each other. <em>Evans\u2019 Practice, </em>371; <em>Harrison vs. Mayor, &amp;c., of Baltimore, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>264; <em>Cumberland Coal and Iron Co. vs. Tilghman, </em>13 <em>Md., </em>74; <em>Poe\u2019s Practice, sec. </em>300 ; <em>Adams vs. Capron, </em>21 <em>Md., </em>187; <em>Groff vs. Hansel, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>161.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>William, Reynolds, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-5\">The single question before this Court is whether or not, upon the hypothesis of the Court\u2019s instruction, the instruction given at the instance of the plaintiffs, lays down the correct rule for deciding if the defendant\u2019s advances to the fraudulent vendee were made in such good faith as to entitle him to the protection of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, against the claim of the defrauded vendor ?

The evidence tended to show that one Hirsch Levy had made a fraudulent purchase of these goods from the plaintiffs ; and that he had sent them for public sale to the defendant, who was an auctioneer. The defendant had made advances of money on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">On the supposition that the purchase of the goods from the plaintiffs had been accomplished by the fraud of Levy, it is not questioned that it was void at the election of the sellers, and that they could have reclaimed their property from him. But if he sold them to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice of the fraud, a good title would be passed which could not be impeached by the original vendor. Ordinarily a purchaser cannot acquire a title from a ven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>dor who has none. But the authorities show without dissent that there is an exception under the circumstances which we have just supposed, in <em>Powel vs. </em>Bradlee, 9 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>278, it is said : \u201c In such a case, good faith, and a valuable consideration would be^ssential constituents of a good title.\u201d If these features do not appear in the transaction, we take it that the title fails. An interest in the goods acquired by making advances on them when placed in the hands of an auctioneer for sale, would be protected under the same circumstances which would make a purchase valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The Court instructed the jury that if Levy\u2019s purchase was fraudulent, the defendant\u2019s title would be defeated, unless they found he had in good faith advanced money to Levy upon the security of the goods; or incurred expenses in relation to them. On the prayer of the defendant the Court ruled that the plaintiff could not recover, if the jury found that the advances were made by the defendant, without notice' or knowledge of the circumstances under which Levy purchased the goods. On the prayer of the plaintiffs it was ruled that they were not precluded from recovering by these advances, if the jury found that at the time the goods were delivered to the defendant, he had knowledge of circumstances calculated to-put a man of ordinary prudence on inquiry as to whether Levy was perpetrating a fraud in selling the goods by auction, and that he failed to make inquiry into the character of the transaction. Taking these instructions together it seems \u2019to us that they laid the case properly before the jury. Higgins could not deduce title to the goods through a fraudulent vendee,\u2019 unless he showed that his advances were made in good faith. If he knew that Levy was selling these goods for the purpose of carrying into effect a fraud, his advances could not be considered as made in good faith; and if the circumstances were such as reasonably to call for inquiry, and if inquiry would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>given him this knowledge, he is responsible in the same way as if he had obtained it. It has been held that if in any purchase \u201cthere be circumstances which in the exercise of common reason and prudence, ought to put a man upon particular inquiry he will be presumed to have made that inquiry, and will be charged with notice of every fact which that inquiry would give him.\u201d <em>Baynard vs. Norris, </em>5 <em>Gill, </em>483. To the same effect are <em>Green vs. Early, </em>39 <em>Md., </em>229; <em>Abrams vs. Sheehan, </em>40 <em>Md., </em>446. The evidence showed that Levy rented a basement room about the fifteenth of June, 1885, and commenced business as a jobber; that between that time and September the seventh he purchased a large quantity of goods; six thousand dollars worth being purchased from these plaintiffs; that in the latter part of June, 1885, he commenced sending goods to the defendant to be sold by auction, the defendant making advances on them; that he continued to send goods for this purpose, and to receive advances from the defendant until September the fifth ; that the amount of these auction sales was more than sixty-four hundred dollars; that on September the fifth, Levy had in his store only four or five hundred dollars worth of goods; that the week before he had fifteen thousand dollars worth; that he had opened a bank account on the eleventh of July, and on the seventh of September he drew out the balance to his credit with the exception of a small sum; that after that day he was regarded as utterly insolvent, that he purchased the goods in question from the plaintiffs on the twenty-first of August on credit, the time fixed for payment being October the tenth; that the small balance to his credit in the bank was attached by creditors, and that after September his business was conducted in his wife\u2019s name. The evidence certainly warranted the jury in finding that when Levj^purchased these good he did not intend to pay for them, and that he was engaged in a deliberate scheme of fraud, which he was effect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ing by purchasing large quantities of goods on credit, selling them by auction, and putting the proceeds beyond the reach of his creditors. Notwithstanding fraud on the part of Levy in making the purchase in question in this case, the title of Higgins would be good if the matters within his knowledge did not reasonably suggest to him the propriety of inquiring into the transactions in which Levy was engaged, and if this inquiry would not have discovered his fraudulent courses. It was the province of the jury to determine this question on the evidence in the cause.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b260-6\">(Decided 5th January, 1888.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
