Williams. An attachment bond was given by McLuchie with Adam E. Hitchins as surety, and was made payable to David J. Williams, the defendant in the attachment, instead of to the State of Maryland as required by the statute. The attachment was after-wards dismissed, and suit was thereupon brought on the attachment bond by the obligee against the obligors. The defendants filed a demurrer to the declaration which was overruled. The case was tried and the jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff. Judgment was entered on the verdict. The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b286-9\">The cause was argued before Alvey, C.

In the form given in the statute for the condition of the bond, the language is slightly varied; in case of breach, the plaintiff is required to pay the defendant \u201c all such costs in said suit,\u201d and such damages as shall be awarded against the plaintiff \u201cin any suit which may hereafter be brought for wrongfully suing out\u201d the attachment. Every attachment issued without such a bond is declared to be illegal and void, and directed to be dismissed. If a bond be given in accordance with the terms of the statute, and the attachment be afterwards quashed, the obligors become liable according to the terms cf the \u2022condition. If the bond does not meet the requirements -of the statute, and the attachment is nevertheless issued and afterwards quashed or dismissed, the injury to the defendant is the same as in the former case; and there is no meritorious reason why the obligors should not be liable according to the tenor of their bond. Nor is it easy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>to see why according to any legal principle they should be discharged. The bond, though not effective to maintain an attachment, is not illegal; it is not forbidden by any statute, nor does it contravene any principle of morality or public policy. It is simply a voluntary obligation; the act and deed of the obligors by which they declared themselves to he -held and firmly bound. The seal to a bond imports a consideration, and hence it is that in an action at law the failure of consideration cannot he inquired into- or proved. A bond not required by any statute, and not being in such form, and containing such terms as to accomplish the expectations and purposes of its makers, will, if not impeachable in other-respects, nevertheless stand as their act and deed. Obligors have always been held liable on their voluntary bonds, and ought to be so held. A party <em>sui juris </em>is certainly able to contract, and if the contract is embodied in an instrument under seal,-it has all the validity which can be imparted by a valuable consideration. We do not speak now of cases where the obligee has-no capacity to receive a bond; nor where a bond is void by statute unless it is made in a prescribed form; nor where it is exacted from the obligor without authority of law. Our opinion is that the first question ought to be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The express terms of the statute make the bond liable-for the costs of the attachment suit. We suppose, therefore, that there can be no difficulty in recovering them in an action on the bond as soon as there is a failure to prosecute-the suit with effect, that is, with success. But the bond is also liable for such damages as might be recovered against the plaintiff in any suit which might thereafter he brought for wrongfully suing out the attachment. If the defendant should bring a suit against the plaintiff and recover damages for the wrongful attachment, the bond would be liable for these damages. In such an event- the nonpayment of them by the plaintiff is a breach of the bond. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>It would be a strange anomaly if the suit could be brought before the breach had occurred. The plain and obvious meaning of the statute is that the suit is to be brought against the plaintiff alone. It would be a great misuse of language to speak of\u201c <em>such damages as shall be aivarded against him\u201d </em>if it was intended to moan such damages as should be awarded against <em>the bondsmen. </em>It must be remembered that it is not necessary that the plaintiff should be one of the bondsmen. The statute provides that the bond shall be taken \u201cfrom the plaintiff, or some person on his behalf.\u201d Language might have been used which would have imposed responsibility directly on the bondsmen; as if the condition of the bond had been that they should pay all damage caused by the attachment. Provisions of this kind have sometimes been made in our legislation, as in the twenty-third section of Article 10 of the Code relating to appeals from orders quashing attachments, and the twenty-third section of Article 5, relating to appeals from orders in equity. Our conclusion is that a suit may be brought on the bond to recover the costs in the attachment suit. But that nothing else can be recovered on the bond, unless a suit against the plaintiff for wrongfully suing out the attachment has been prosecuted to judgment.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b289-7\">(Decided 5th January, 1888.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The appeal comes before us on a demurrer to the declaration. All errors in pleading were waived, and by agreement of counsel the case was rested on the two questions which we have considered. The Circuit Court overruled the demurrer, and as a cause of action is stated in the declaration, we must affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
