Possession of land in this State is presumed to be under and in subordination to the legal title unless\u00fat appear that the land has been held and possessed adversely to such title for seven years before the commencement of an action to recover the same founded on the title.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b830-7\">4. Where a person enters upon land under a party not holding the true title, and afterwards takes a deed of conveyance from him, such entry will from the date of the deed be regarded as an entry under claim of title to the land described in the deed and in hostility to the true title and exclusive of any other rights.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b830-9\">5. A \u201cforty\u201d of land is not \u201ca tract divided into lots,\u201d within the moaning of the fifth section of the statute of limitations of 1872, p. 732, McClellan\u2019s Digest, but may be regarded as \u201c a known lot \u201d under the fourth clause of sixth section of that act, and the improvement and adverse possession of a part thereof under claim of title to the entire \u201cforty\u201d founded upon a written instrument as being a conveyance of the \u201cforty\u201d is in law, both under and independent of any special provision of our statute, adverse possession for the same length of time as well of the part not cleared nor inclosed, i-.s of the part actually improved and occupied.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b830-11\">O. Where there is privity between successive occupants holding- adversely to the true title and continuously their successive peril 'ds of possession may be united to make up the time of adverse holding- prescribed by the statute as a defence against such title, but there can be no tacking of possessions unless there is such privity.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b830-12\">7. Privity may be established between successive occupants by execution sale and a conveyance by the officer making it.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b830-14\">8. A Sheriff\u2019s deed conveying a prior adverse occupant\u2019s interest in the land to the succeeding occupant is not sufficient evidence to establish privity between them or connect their possessions, because it is not of itself evidence of the Sheriff\u2019s authority to. sell.

No written instrument is necessary to establish privity between successive occupants pending the running of the statutory period in so far as a transfer of the land of which there is a <em>pedis possessio, </em>or actual as distinguished from constructive possession ; but as to the part of which there is simply constructive possession a written instrument is essential to privity, but it need not be a formal deed; an instrument otherwise purporting to be a deed of conveyance but winch has no seal is sufficient.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b831-7\">11.

Defendant pleaded not guilty as to the following part of the land containing ten acres, viz: a lot beginning at the northeast corner of Annie Ravesies\u2019 ten acre tract at a stake and running west four hundred and forty yards, thence north one hundred and ten yards to a stake, thence east four hundred and forty yards, and thence south one hundred and ten yards to a point of beginning; and as to the residue of the land, pleaded that they were not in possession of it. Appellant took issue on the pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b832-5\">There was trial before a referee, who gave judgment in favor of the defendants. Plaintiff having appealed, has assigned as error, 1st, the admission as evidence for any purpose whatever of a certified copy of a deed from A. C. Sumner and wife to one C. S. Blackshear; 2d, the admission of a deed from J. B. Miclder,Sheriff of Hernando county, to T. S. Ooogler; 3d, the admission of a deed from Annie M. Tomlinson to James E. Latham ; and 4th, in giving judgment in favor of the defendants upon the evidence shown by the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b832-6\">The plaintiff, Kendrick, claims title to the land under a lost conveyance of the east half of the southwest quarter of the above section of land, alleged to have been made to him by the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Eund of the State, on the 23d day of November, 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b832-7\">The defendants offered in evidence an original record reestablishing a judgment rendered October 8th, 1870, and execution issued thereon on the 19th day of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>month, in favor of Anderson Mayo, as administrator of T. H. Edrington vs. C. 8. Blackshear and others in Hernando county Circuit Court for $&gt;120.62. The original judgment and execution had been destroyed in the burning of Hernando county records in September, 1877. The order reestablishing the same was made March 27th, 1879, by the Judge of the Fifth Circuit, the Judge of the Circuit of which Hernando county is a part, being disqualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b833-5\">Objections having been made by the plaintiff to the admission of these proceedings as evidence, they were rejected by the referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b833-6\">Defendants then offered in evidence a certified copy of a deed purporting to have been made by A. C. Sumner, January 15th, 1876, conveying the said east half of said quarter section of land to C. S. Blackshear in fee, and its admission in evidence was objected to on the ground that the record of the original deed was not legal; that it was not duly authenticated for record and not competent evidence without proof of execution of the original, which objection being sustained, defendant \u201cdisclaimed any intention to show title by it, but only an incident to be supported by further testimony,\u201d and the plaintiff objecting on the ground that the copy did not show that the original was properly authenticated for record, the referee \u201c held or ad-mi tted \u201d it \u201c only to the extent that it may be hereafter supported by evidence,\u201d and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b833-7\">Defendants then offered in evidence a deed from J. B. Mickler, Sheriff of Hernando county, dated October 6th, 1879, conveying to Ooogler the east half of the quarter section, mentioned above, pursuant to a sale of the same made by him under the execution referred to above and issued on said judgment, said sale having been made at public auction on the day of the date of said deed, it being the first Monday in October, \u201c after duly advertising the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>according to law,\u201d and said land being sold as the property of said C. S. Blackshear, Coogler being the highest bidder and the deed stating his bid and his payment of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-5\">To the admission of this deed in evidence plaintiff objected, first, that the judgment and execution upon which it was based was not sufficiently proven as a predicate, and secondly, that the deed did not recite how long notice was published, or when, or in what county or State the sale took place, or that the sale was made at the court house door, or within legal hours of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-6\">The action of the referee is as follows: Filed and offered in evidence January 25, 1888. Objected to by plaintiff. First objection sustained. Second overruled. Council on both sides except.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-7\">The record also shows a deed from Coogler and wife, dated December 22, 1881, conveying the half quarter section of land to Annie M. Tomlinson, and that the same was admitted in evidence \u201c in so far as admissible under the circumstances of the case ; \u201d and a deed from Annie M. Tomlinson to appellee, James F. Latham, dated May 1st, 1883, conveying to Latham \u201c thirty acres of land, being the north part of the northeast (1-4) fourth of the southwest quarter of said section, describing it \u201cthe division line to run east and west.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b834-8\">The plaintiff objected to the introduction of the latter deed on the ground that certain erasures and interlinea, tion on its face had not been satisfactorily explained. The \u25a0 consideration seems to have been expressed prior to the interlineations and erasures as follows : \u201cFor and in consideration of the sum of two hundred and forty dollars to be paid by the said Latham, the sum of one <em>at and before the ensealing and delivery hereof the receipt whereof </em>\u2014 do <em>hereby acknowledge and thereof and forever discharge the said--her </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number><em>executors and administrators.\u201d </em>This has been changed to read after the word \u201c <em>one,\u201d </em>as follows, viz : \u201c hundred and sixty dollars in lumber at $1.00 per 100 feet, and the sum of eight dollars in money due twelve months from this date.\u201d The words which we have italicised above have a line drawn through them, but they are still legible. The substituted words are interlineations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b835-5\">The other facts of the case are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b835-6\"><em>Shackleford $ Preston </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b835-7\">The facts as established by the record in this case are as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b835-8\">On the 10th day of April, 1851, the NEJ of the SVi of see. 15, T. 24, S., R. 21, E., which embraces the land in controversy, together with other lands, was approved to the State of Florida, and on the 8th day of. May, 1854, was sold by said State to Wm. J. Turner and certificate No. 852 was issued to him therefor. Said certificate was assigned for value September 10th, 1855, by the said Wm. J. Turner to William H. Kendrick, the appellant, and a deed was made to him by said State on the 23d day of November, 1859. The State Land Office at that time kept no record or copies of deeds issued and the original deed of Kendrick was lost without ever having been recorded, but the fact that such a deed once existed, its contents and loss was duly established by secondary evidence. Said Kendrick never conveyed said land to any one. On the 15th day of January, 1876, one A. O. Sumner and wife made what purports to be a deed, conveying said land, together with an adjoining forty, to one C. S. Blackshear, who by virtue of said deed entered into possession of the lands attempted thereby to be conveyed, but said deed was never properly acknowledged or proved for record, though it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>erroneously admitted to record. A certified copy of same offered in evidence by appellees and rejected by the court at first but afterwards admitted as \u201c an incident to be supported by further testimony.\u201d There is no evidence that Sumner ever had any title to the land in controversy. On the 6th day of October, 1879, J. B. Mickler, Sheriff of Hernando county, executed a deed to said land, together with the other forty purchased by Blaekshear from Sumner to T. S. Ooogler, reciting a judgment rendered October 8th, 1870, in favor of Mayo, Admr., vs. C. S. Blaekshear <em>et al., </em>and the issuance of an execution thereon. Said Sheriff\u2019s deed and the judgment and execution were offered in evidence by appellees and rejected by the court for reasons that will appear from an inspection of the record. Coogler, the purchaser at Sheriff\u2019s sale, never was in actual pos session of the land, but after his said purchase placed it in charge of an agent, who repaired the fence, set out some orange trees and had them cultivated and placed tenants on the place from year to year, though there were frequent intervals when there was no one on or in possession of the the land. On the 22d day of December, 1881, Ooogler and wife conveyed said land by warranty deed to Mrs. Annie M. Tomlinson, who, however, did not take actual possession of the same until December, 1883, or January, 1884, when she moved on it, though at times she had tenants on it. On May the 1st, 1883, Mrs. Annie M. Tomlinson conveyed by warranty deed to James E. Latham the actual land in controversy, which, however, did not include any of the improved part. On the-day of March, 1884, James E. Latham and wife conveyed said land by warranty deed to Mrs. E. Ravesies, formerly Mrs. Annie M. Tomlinson, which deed was offered in evidence by appellees and rejected by the court for reasons that will appear from the record. On the 1st day of November, 1884, Mrs. Ravesies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>and husband conveyed said land by warranty deed to James E. Latham and Ida Latham, the'appellees, a certified copy o\u00ed which deed was offered in evidence by appellees and rejected by the court for reasons that appear in the record. On the 5th day of February, 1887, John O. Law, Clerk of the Circuit Court in and for the county of Hernando, and State of Florida, conveyed said land by tax deed <em>to </em>Annie Tomlinson, reciting a sale of said land for taxes on the 6th of March, 1882, for the taxes of 1881, which said tax deed was recorded on the 5th day of February, L887. Appellant introduced record evidence contesting the validity of said tax deed. Appellees claim title to said land by virtue of seven years adverse possession by them and their grantors under the deed of J. B. Mickler, Sheriff, to T. S. Coogler as color of title, and the referee so found and decided. Appellant claims that the evidence does not warrant such a finding and decision and has assigned certain errors committed by the referee, which we will now discuss. In support error which we have assigned, to-wit: that the court erred in admitting as evidence a certified copy of a deed from A. C. Sumner and wife to C. S. Blackshear for any purpose whatever, we call the attention of the court to the fact that as appears from said certified copy, said deed was not proved for record as required by our statutes, in that A. C. Sumner, one of the grantors, never acknowledged the execution of the same and neither was it proved for record by either one of the subscribing witnesses, therefore it was not entitled to record and though informally recorded is not entitled to be treated as a registered instrument. Saunders vs. Pepoon &amp; Olcott, 4th Fla., 465. This being true, sec. 21, Article XVI, of the Constitution of 18S5, which provides for the admission of a certified copy of the record of a deed as evidence only when the original has been duly proved for record and recording ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>cording to law, would exclude the certified copy offered in. this case. It is true that thecourt below admitted it only as \u201c an incident to be supported by further testimony,\u201d but in view of the constitutional provision cited above we do not see how it could be admitted for any purpose whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b838-5\">In support of the 2d error assigned, to-wit: that the court erred in admitting the deed of J. B. Mickler, Sheriff, to T. S. Coogler as evidence after having rejected the judgment and execution upon which said deed was based, we beg -to cite the following authorities: aTo establish a title under an execution sale there must be shown, as against a stranger to the proceedings, a valid judgment and execution binding the estate of the defendant, in the judgment, and that the defendant had some title or interest in the property sold.\u201d Davis vs. Shuler, 14th Fla., 447 and 448; also see Hartley vs. Farrell, 9th Fla., 374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b838-6\"><em>\u201c </em>There must be proof of the judgment in order to derive title from a sale thereunder.\u201d Donald <em>et al. </em>vs. McKinnon, 17th Fla., 748.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b838-7\">\u201cA Sheriff\u2019s deed is not admissible in evidence where no judgment or action on which it was predicated is shown.\u201d Anderson vs. Robinson, 75th Ga., 375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b838-8\">In this cases the court below properly rejected the judgmentandexecutionupon which said Sheriff\u2019s deed was based for errors and irregularities appearing upon their face and stated in appellant\u2019s objection to their admission, and also sustained the appellant\u2019s objection to the introduction or admission of the Sheriff\u2019s deed, but afterwards considered said deed and in his findings and judgment treated said deed as though it had been admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b838-9\">In support of our third error assigned, to-wit: that the court erred in admitting as evidence a deed from Annie M. Tomlinson to James F. Latham without first requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the erasure and interlineations therein to be satisfactorily-accounted for and explained, we call the attention of the court to the fact that the erasures and interlineations in said deed are of an important character, said erasures and attentions occurring both in the consideration named in said deed and in the description of*theland conveyed, as will appear from an inspection of the record, we cite the following authorities : 1 G-reenleaf on Evidence, sections 564 to 568 and notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b839-5\">In support of our last assignment of errors that the court erred in giving judgment for the defendants (appellees) on the evidence as shown by the record, we contend that the evidence shows that the appellant had a good and sufficient title to the land in controversy from the State of Florida, and that he never conveyed the same to anyone. This being true, the only way his title could be divested was by a forced sale of the same under due process of law or by someone entering into possession thereof and holding the same adversely for a period of seven years. The appellee\u2019s claim was based upon the latter, to-wit: seven years adverse possession. We contend that the evidence is not sufficient to maintain this claim. Eveu admitting that the Sheriff\u2019s deed to T. S. Coogler is sufficient upon which to have color of title, the evidence is not sufficient to ripen the claim of appellee\u2019s into a good title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b839-6\">\u201c To constitute a possession such as will bar the title of the legal owner, five elements must co-exist. It must be (1) hostile or adverse; (2) actual; (3) visible, notorious and exclusive; (4) continuous, and (5) under a claim or a color of title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b839-7\">I English and American Encyclopaedia of Law, page 228, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b839-8\">We claim that these five elements did not co-exist and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>that the evidence fails'to show that the possession was actual, visible, notorious and exclusive and Continuous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b840-5\">\u201c The doctrine of adverse possession ' is to be taken strictly and not to be made out by reference, but by clear and positive proof.\u201d Hart vs. Bostwick, 14 Fla., 178.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b840-6\">Also see Seymour <em>&amp; </em>Simpson vs. Creswell, 18 Fla., 29; Ill.

Rep., 707; England vs. Hatch, 80 Ala., 247; Hines vs. Chancey, 47 Ala., 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The provisions of section 21, Article NVI, of the Constitution, embody this principle, as well as require that it shall appear that the original is not. within the custody or control of the party offering the copy. Bell <em>et al. </em>vs. Kendrick, decided at this term.</p>\n<p id=\"AUJ\">The purpose of the referee in holding or admitting the certified copy only to the extent that it might be subsequently supported by evidence, as he did, was, it would seem, merely to permit such copy which had been \u201c filed and offered in evidence,\u201d to remain on file before him to be used in case it should be rendered available to the defendant by further testimony ; and even though holding or admitting it to the extent indicated was, technically speaking, not proper practice, yet in this case we do uot see that any harm has resulted from it to the plaintiff. Without further objection upon the part of the plaintiff, testimony was at a subsequent stage of the cause introduced to show that Sumner executed a deed conveying to Blackshear the land described in the copy, and the certified copy was testified to as being a true copy of such original, and thus made available to the defendant. It is only in connection with, and as a part of this oral testimony as to the original deed, that the certified copy can be regarded to have been considered by the referee, and in this connection we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>think it was properly considered by him. Thompson vs. Nash, 15 Texas, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">II. Kendrick\u2019s conveyance from the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the east half of the southwest quarter of section 15, was made on the 23d day of November, 1859, or about twenty-seven years and four months beforejhe commencement of this suitin March,1887. It does not appear, however, that he has ever parted with his title to the north half of this eighty. His conveyance of February 16th, 1860, to James Weeks, included the south half of the southwest quarter of the section, and consequently carried the south half of the above \u201c eighty,\u201d but this did not affect, his ownership of the north half, or \u201c forty,\u201d in which the ten acres of the land now in controversy, are. There is no proof that Weeks ever occupied this forty; nor was it sold as a part of his estate by the commissioner under the order of the County Judge of Hernando county, or mentioned in such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">As there has been no conveyance of the land in dispute, or the \u201cforty\u201d which it is a part of, by Kendrick, the defendant must rely upon adverse possession for the period of seven years under the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Our statute of limitations declares that in every action for the recovery of real property or the possession thereof, the person establishing a legal title to the premises shall be presumed to have been possessed thereof within the time prescribed by law and the occupation of such premises by any other person, shall be deeemd to have been under and in subordination to the legal title, unless it appear that the premises have been held and possessed adversely to such legal title for seven years before the commencement of the action. Section 4, page 781 McClellan\u2019s Digest. See also Caro vs. Pensacola C. Co., 19 Fla.. 766; Tyler on Ejectment and Adverse Enjoyment, 102 and 852 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number><em>et seq. </em>Kendrick having shown title, the burden was upon the defendant to show adverse possesion for the statutory period. Wade vs. Doyle, 17 Fla., 522, 527; Sharp vs. Dauhgney, 33 Cal., 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The same statute provides, by its fifth section, upon the question of adverse possession as against the true title, that whenever it shall appear that the occupant or those under whom he claims, entered into the possession of premises under claim of title exclusive of any other rights, founding such claim upon a written instrument as being a conveyance of the premises in question, or upon the decree or judgment of a competent court, and that there has been a continued occupation and possession of the premises including in such instrument, decree or judgment for seven years, the <em>premises </em>so included shall be deemed to have been <em>held </em>adversely, except that where the premises so included consist of a tract divided into lots, the possession of one lot shall not be deemed a possession of any other lot of the same tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The chief purpose of this section is to provide that were the premises or tract covered by the written instrument, judgment or decree upon which claim of title is founded is not divided into lots, a continued actual occupation and possession of a part of the described premises for the specified period in the manner required b y law, shall be deemed to extend to the entire premises, or in other words, that such continuous actual occupation and possession of a part for seven years shall be <em>constructive and legal occupation </em>of the whole as it is described in the written instrument, decree or judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The sixth section declares that \u201c for the purpose of constituting an adverse possession by any person claiming a title founded upon a written instrument, or a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>or decree, land shall be deemed to be possessed and occupied in the following cases :</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">First, where it has been usually cultivated or improved ; or</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Second, where it has been protected by substantial enclosure ; or</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Third, where (although not enclosed) it has been used for the supply of fuel, or for fencing timber for the purpose of husbandry, or for the ordinary use of the occupant;</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Fourth, where a known lot or single farm has been partly improved, the portion of such farm or lot that may have been left not cleared, or not enclosed according to the usual course or custom of the adjoining country, shall be deemed to have been occupied for the same length of time as the part improved or cultivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">It is clear from the testimony that Blackshear occupied the land in the latter part of the year 1875. Even ignoring the presumption arising from the evidence that such entry was under Sumner, his possession from the date of his deed of conveyance from Sumner, January 15th, 1876, must be regarded as an entry under claim of title in hostility to the true owner, Kendrick, and exclusive of any other rights, and founded upon a written instrument as being a conveyance of the premises described therein. Tyler, 107, 108, 876; Jackson vs. Parker, 3 Johnson\u2019s Cases, 124; Jackson vs. Thomas, 16 Johnson, 293; Jackson vs. Newton, 18 Ibid, 355. From this date his entry became \u00e1dverse'to the true title. Of course there is nothing in the record indicating that his original occupation of the land was as the tenant of Kendrick, or in subordination to his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Blackshear having moved on the place in 1875, remained in possession until the fall of 1879. The testimony shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>that as early as 1869 one Martin put a small house either on this \u201c forty \u201d in question, or the one immediately south of it, constituting the south half of the eighty, for the purpose of putting a stock of goods in, which purpose, however, he did not carry out; and that in the same year one Jeffcoat did'put a stock of goods in it and lived on the south side of the forty in controversy and cleared a small field and built and planted some orange trees and lived there three or four years and then left the place and went away. There is nothing to show any privity between the possession of these parties or of either of them and Black-shear, even if it be that the former were anything than mere trespassers without claim of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Blackshear opened about two acres of land and fenced it with a pine rail fence and set out some orange trees, and cultivated some of the land in corn, and some in potatoes, and also made a workshop out of an old house. His improvements were on both of the \u201c forties,\u201d and the fence erected by him remained until it was repaired and \u201cmoved out,\u201d and was kept in a condition to keep stock out as a general thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The \u201c forty \u201d within which the ten acres in controversy lie is not \u201c a tract divided into lots \u201d within the meaning of the exception of the fifth section of the statute. If the fourth clause of section six is to be taken as a limitation upon section four as an entirety, the forty may properly be regarded as \u201c a known lot,\u201d within the meaning of such clause. Reasoning upon the premises either that thisfourth clause is, or that it is not to be so taken, our opinion is that the character of Blaekshear\u2019s actual possession and improvements were for the time the possession lasted, such as to constitute an adverse possession of the entire forty, within the meaning of the act. Even it the fourth clause mentioned controls, then his improvement and possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>part of the \u201c forty \u201d were such as constituted adverse possession as well and for the same length of time of the part \u201c not cleared or not enclosed \u201d as of the part improved and occupied. Of course the possession was constructive as to the part not cleared or improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The above provisions of the statute of limitations have been in force in California and Wisconsin and New York, having been enacted by New York in the year 1830, and from that State were probably taken by Wisconsin and California. In the States mentioned the words \u201c or of some part of said premises,\u201d occur after the word judgment where it appeal\u2019s last in the fifth section, and in New York and Wisconsin the expression \u201c known farm or single lot,\u201d is used in the last clause of the sixth section in the place of \u201c known lot or single farm,\u201d in the same clause in California and Florida. Wood\u2019s California Digest, 46; Revised Statutes of Wisconsin of 1878, p. 1014, and <em>vide </em>23 New York, p. 25; Tyler, pp. 102-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Without entering upon the question of constructive possession in the case of very large bodies of land of which but a small part is cultivated, improved or enclosed, as in Munro vs. Merchant, 28 N. Y., 1, and Thompson vs. Durhans, 61 N. Y., 52, we are satisfied that there is nothing in the size of a quarter of a quarter section of land to avoid the application of the doctrine of constructive possession either independent of the statute, or under it and considered as modified by the sections last set out above. Baldwin vs. Simpson, 12 Cal., 560; Langford vs. Poppe, 36 Cal., 73; Pepper vs. O\u2019Dowd, 39 Wis., 338; Coleman vs. Eldred, 44 Wis., 210; Tremaine vs. Weatherly, 58 Iowa, 615; Ellicott vs. Pearl, 10 Peters, 412; Barr vs. Gratz\u2019s Heirs, 4 Wheaton, 213; Welborn vs. Anderson, 37 Miss., 155; Kile vs. Tubbs, 23 Cal., 432; Rose vs. Davis, 11 Cal., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>133; Crispen vs. Hannavan, 50 Mo., 544; Watson vs. Mansell, 76 Ala., 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The possession of Blackshear did not continue seven years, and consequently we must consider other questions presented by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Where there is privity between successive occupants holding adversely to the true title and continuously, the successive periods of possession may be united or tacked to each other to make up the time of adverse holding prescribed by the statute as a defence against such title, but this cannot be done if there is not such privity. If this were not the case, as says Thompson, J., in Schrack vs. Zubler, 34 Penn. St., 41, the first intruder might abandon his intention of holding adversely and leave the possession-, and a succeeding one might enter and claim without authority a quality in the predecessor\u2019s possession which he had abandoned. Tyler, 912-917; Overfield vs. Christie, 7 S. &amp; R., 173; Smith vs. Chapin, 31 Conn., 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Where one is in adverse possession of land and pending the running of the statutory period, the land is levied upon and sold by a Sheriff under an execution issued upon a valid judgment against him, and the purchaser at such sale enters into possession, such sale and the conveyance by the Sheriff is sufficient to establish privity between the defendant in the judgment and the purchaser. Tyler, 917; Scheetz vs. Fitzwater, 5 Penn. St., 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">In the case at bar the referee rejected the evidence' offered by the defendant to prove the execution and judgment upon which the Sheriff\u2019s deed professes to be founded. Though the record of the proceedings re-establishing the execution and judgment in favor of Mayo, as administrator of Edrington vs. Blackshear and others, is in the appeal transcript, they cannot be considered by us in support of the Sheriff\u2019s deed. This results from the simple fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>they were never admitted in evidence in the case. That it may have been erroneously excluded, makes no difference. Teegarden vs. Carpenter, 36 Miss., 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The only evidence before us that can be relied on as establishing privity between Blackshear and Coogler, or Coogler\u2019s privity with Blaekshear\u2019s claim of title under the deed from Sumner, is the Sheriff\u2019s deed to Coogler. A Sheriff\u2019s deed is not of itself evidence of that officer\u2019s authority to levy and sell. In England it has been held that proof of the writ of execution is sufficient. Doe vs. Marless, 6 M. &amp; S., 113; Doe vs. Thom. 1 M. &amp; S., 425; and so in Georgia, in Whatley vs. Newsom, 10 Ga., 74; and I am not satisfied that this was not the view of this court in Hartly vs. Ferrell, 9 Fla., 374; yet subsequent authorities hold that a valid judgment must also be shown; Davis vs. Shuler, 14 Fla., 447; Donald vs. McKinnon, 17 Fla., 748; and this is said to be the rule in several States. Tyler, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">In Hester vs. Coats, 22 Ga., 59, 60, it is observed, and 'properly'too, that although a mere Sheriff\u2019s deed maybe enough to lay foundation for the statute to begin to run on, it is not, when unaccompanied with the judgment or execution, sufficient to connect a possession under it with a previous possession under the person named in it as defendant in execution. In the absence of proper proof of the authority of the Sheriff to levy and sell, his position as to the occupying defendant in execution is that of a trespasser. Privity between successive occupants will not be supported by a trespass. Moffit vs. McDonald, 11 Humph., 457. .</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Had the record of the proceedings re-establishing the lost judgment and execution been admitted in evidence, we sould, even under the rule announced in Davis vs. Shuler, and Donald vs. McKinnon, supra, hold, in view of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>deuce which that record contains, as shown by the plea to the petition, of the jurisdiction of the court of the person of the defendants in the action in which the judgment was rendered, that the Sheriff\u2019s deed was properly admitted in evidence, but as such record was not admitted, our conclusion is that the Sheriff\u2019s deed is not of itself sufficient to show privity between Coogler and the title under which Blackshear claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The second objection made to this Sheriff\u2019s deed was, that it did not recite how long notice was published, or when, or in what county the sale took place, or that the sale was made at the court house door, or within the legal hours of sale, were properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The deed states that sale was made at public auction on the day of its date, the sixth day of October <em>1*79, </em>\u201cafter duly advertising the same according to law.\u201d Without intimating an opinion as <em>to </em>the effect of an entire want of notice, or of a notice deficient in time, or otherwise, we are satisfied that the recital as to the publication of notice is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, sufficient evidence that the sale was legally advertised for the period of thirty days preceding the sale. Freeman on executions, sections 285, 286; and our conclusion is that where there is no showing to the contrary, it is to be presumed that the Sheriff sold at the \u201c\u00a1court house door,\u201d as required'by section 11, p. 523 McClellan\u2019s Digest; and that he sold at an appropriate hour, and in the county. It is not pretended that the sixth day of October, 1879, was not the first Monday in that month, and consequently a sale day.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The deed from the Sheriff to Coogler, notwithstanding what we have said above, is considered of itself, or unaccompanied by the execution or judgment, a sufficient written instrument, within the meaning of the statute, to sustain a claim of title and start the running of the period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>limitation in favor of one entering under it and claiming adversely or exclusive of any other rights. Beverly vs. Burke, 9 Ga., 440; Hester vs. Coats, <em>supra. </em>This being So, if there was an adverse holding within the meaning of the statute, by Coogler and those claiming under and in privity with him, for seven years before the commencement of this ejectment action, the judg\u2019ment of the referee should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Coogler took possession in 1879, after the Sheriff's sale of October 8th. It is unnecessary under the view we have to take of the case, to fix the precise time. \"Whether it was in October or December, the period of seven years could not expire till the corresponding time in the year 1888. On December 22d, 18S1, Coogler conveyed the entire half of the quarter section to Mrs. Thomlinson, and on May 1st, 1883, she conveyed to J. F. Latham \u201c thirty acres of the land, being the north part of the northeast (1-4) fourth of the southwest quarter of\u201d said section, describing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">It is apparent from the testimony that this thirty acres did not include any of the enclosed or cultivated land, although a part of the same \u201c forty.\u201d Latham says he took possession after buying and held it and improved it until he sold it back to her and her husband, E. Ravesies, in the summer of 1884, she having prior to this time married Ravesies. In August of the same year Latham bought ten acres of the same thirty from Mr. and Mrs. Ravesies and improved it and moved on it in November, and has been on it ever since. On this ten acres, which is the land covered by the plea of not guilty, he says there were no improvements until he placed them there. We understand him to mean that he put them on it after his last purchase just mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">It is clear that this ten acre piece of land is one of which there has been no enclosure, cultivation or <em>pedis possession </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>but the possession claimed of it, as by Blackshear and others down to Latham\u2019s possession after his purchase in 1884, is riot actual, but constructive, as resulting from the actual enclosure, improvement and possession of the part of the quarter section enclosed. This being so, it was essential that there should be a sufficient written instrument establishing privity between Latham as grantor and Mrs. Ravesies as his grantee as to this ten acres. If he had sold without such \u2022an instrument, then the privity between him and her extended only to that part of the thirty acres actually protected by a substantial enclosure, or in fact usually cultivated or improved. Sections 7 and 8, p. 732, McClellan\u2019s Digest.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">There is in the transcript a copy of an instrument bearing date March 30, 1884, by which, according to its terms, Lath-am and wife bargained, sold and conveyed to Ravesies and wife the thirty acres mentioned above. The instrument has no seal to it. There is also another instrument without seal, dated November 1st, 1884, by which Ravesies and wife, according to its terms, sold, conveyed and transferred to Latham and wife the same thirty acres. These instruments were offered in evidence by the .defendants, and rejected by the referee, the former having been objected to by the plaintiffs on the ground that it was not sealed, and not evidence of title ; and the latter that it was not sealed and not admissible to record, and not evidence of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Though the decision of Simpson vs. Downing, 26 Wendell, 316, may seem to support the theory that a formal deed is necessary to keep up privity between successive occupants, except as to that part of the land actually enclosed, cultivated or improved, we prefer the position taken in Crispen vs. Hannavan, 50 Mo., 536, where a deed without a seal was held sufficient. See also Watts vs. Parker, 27 Ill., 224. Considering the office performed by the written instrument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>in cases of adverse possession under the statute of limitations, we think that a formal deed is not necessary to a transfer pending the running of the statutory period. McNeely vs. Lasgan, 22 O. St., 32; Fugate vs. Pierce, 49 Mo., 441; Watson vs. Mansell, 76 Ala., 600; Clements vs. Hays, 76 Ala., 280; Cunningham vs. Fredotzen, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">These instruments, we may remark, are not deeds, as they are not sealed ; Blackstone\u2019s Con., Book II, p. 295 ; nor are they mortgages, and consequently they are not controlled by the provisions of section 21 of Article XYI of the Constitution, as to the admission of such instruments to record, or in evidence. The mere fact, however, that they may not be admissible to record is no objection to their being used in evidence. We do not say that they are not admissible to record under the statute, (McClellan\u2019s Digest, pp. 214-215,) but even if they are, we are inclined to think their execution must be proved as at common law to entitle them to be used in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Whether these instruments wmre admissibse or not, they were in fact not admitted, and cannot be considered by us as being in evidence. Teegarden vs. Carpenter, <em>supra. </em>The former of these papers not having been admitted, the fact that Eavesies and wife may have taken actual possession of that part of the thirty acres of which Latham, when he sold to them, had actual, as distinguished from constructive, possession, still their doing so did not in the absence of an instrument of the character indicated, carry to them constructive possession of any part of which Latham had only constructive possession; and of course when Latham surrendered to Eavesies and wife that of which he had actual possession, his constructive possession as to the balance of the thirty acres terminated, for the simple reason that actual possession of the part under the sixth section of the statute, or independent of it, is essential to constructive possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>of the balance of the land described in the original instrument under which the claim of title is made. Cunningham vs. Fraudson, 26 Texas, <em>34; </em>Chandler vs. Rushing, 38 Texas, 591; Cooper vs. Ord, 60 Mo., 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The deed from Mrs. Tomlinson to Latham, dated May 1st, 1883, was objected to on, account of erasures and interlineations, as explained in the statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, an alteration will be presumed to have been made contemporaneously with the execution of the instrument, and properly made, if nothing appears to the contrary. There was no error in overruling the objection, as there is nothing in the evidence, nor upon the face of the instrument as it appears in the transcript, to overthrow this presumption. Stewart vs. Preston, 1 Fla., 10; Meikel vs. State Savings Institution of Chicago, 36 Ind., 355; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, section 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
