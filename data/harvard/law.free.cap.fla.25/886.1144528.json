D. 1886, Eduardo H. Gato exhibited his bill of complaint in equity in the Circuit Court for Duval county, against the appellants, alleging that he commenced the business of manufactui\u2019ing and selling cigars at Key \"West, Florida, in the year 1875; that he has always exclusively used Cuban or Havana tobacco in the making of his cigars, which, being made at Key West by skilled Cuban workmen, and by faithfully excluding American grown tobacco from being \u00fcsed in the manufacture of his said cigars, he has acquired a reputation for the product of his factory, of a very high order. That to'designate his cigars, he used the words \u201c Key West,\u201d and also certain labels and pictures and printed matter consisting of the words \u201c E. H. Gato,\u201d \u201cEduardo H. Gato,\u201d \u201c Bouquet,\u201d \u201cGato\u2019s Bouquet Cigars of Key West,\u201d \u201c Gato\u2019s Key West Cigars,\u201d \u201cCigars Bouquet de E. H. Gato,\u201d \u201c Gato\u2019s Key West.\u201d and a like combination with the words \u201cLa Estrella.\u201d Said bill further states that the El Modello Cigar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>Manufacturing .Company, of Jacksonville, Florida, started business there in the year 1882, use American grown or seed tobacco, and make their cigars now and have always made their cigars at Jacksonville aforesaid, of seed tobacco ; and that said defendants desiring to injure the plaintiff and to reap the benefit of his reputation and obtain his trade, used similar labels, pictures, names and words, identical with those used by the plaintiff; notably using the words G. H. Gato\u201d and \u201cKey West,\u201d and the words \u201cBouquet \u201d and \u201c La Estrella,\u201d separately and in combination with the words \u201c G. H. Gato\u201d and \u201cKey West,\u201d so as to appear like and resemble the devices and words employed by the plaintiff, and that the cigars so packed by defendants have been palmed off and sold to the trade and dealers and consumers thereof as and for plaintiff\u2019s Bouquet, Estrella and Gato\u2019s Key West Cigars, all of which is alleged to be contrary to equity, and tends to the manifest wrong and injury of the said plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b904-5\">The defendants on the Rule Day, in October, 1886, interposed a demurrer to said bill of complaint, on two grounds\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b904-6\">1st. For want of equity, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b904-7\">2d. Because complainant asked for damages in addition to profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b904-8\">The demurrer was argued on the 11th day of October, and on the 2d day of November, the court overruled it as to the first ground, and sustained it as to the second.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b904-9\">A motion was made out on the 16th day of October, 1886, for a temporary injunction. This came on to be heard on the 15th day of November, and was argued and submitted, and the court aving held it under advisement, on tenth day of January, 1887, granted said motion. From this decree defendants have appealed, and assign as error\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>1st. The overruling of the demurrer, and</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-5\">2d. The granting of said temporary injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-6\">LACHES.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-7\">We desire first to call the attention of the court to the laches of complainant, which appears on the face of his bill of complaint. Tie alleges that defendants commenced infringing his trade mark in 1882. His bill was filed August 3d, 1886., about four years after said alleged infringement began:</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-8\">\u201c Where a plaintiff laid by for two years before filing his bill for an injunction, having seen labels of the defendant exhibited publicly, which he now complained of as being colorable imitations of his labels, such laches was a good defence!\u201d Wait\u2019s Actions &amp; Def., Vol. 6, pp. 42, 48, citing Beard vs. Turner, 13 L.

J. (N.

C. C., 640:</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-13\">\u201cA court of equity, which,, is never active in relief against conscience or public convenience, has always refused its aid to stale demands, where the party has slept upon his rights, and acquiesced for a great length of time. Nothing can call forth this court into activity but conscience, good faith and reasonable diligence.\u201d Also see Wait\u2019s Act. &amp; Def., Vol. 6, p. 37, citing Amoskeag Mfg. Co. vs. Garner, 4 Am. L. T. (N. S.), 176, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b905-14\">Passing from this, we draw attention to the charge made by defendants in their answer, that complainant has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>from some time between the year 1880 and the year 1888 manufacturing cigars of seed or American grow n tobacco, under the name of E. G-. Badia, the surname of his deceased mother. If this be true, then the court must, upon principle, refuse him any relief. The explanation offered by the complainant in. the affidavits filed falls short of its object; for if there be a person of the name of E. G. Badia in Key West, or indeed in existence within reach of complainant, then we take it this fact conld be easily proved by the affidavit of said Badia, or by that of some other veritable person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b906-5\">In discussing the demurrer, the first question to be disposed of is, whether the defendants, among whom is Mr. G. H. Gato, have right to the use of Mr. G. H. Gato\u2019s name. Mr. G. H. Gato has the unqualified right to make cigars, and has the unqualified right to use his own name in announcing the origin of said cigars, provided no fraud is practiced by him in so doing. There are many cases sustaining this position ; but before citing several of such adjudications, from which we purpose quoting, we desire particularly to refer to the extensive and exhaustive note to the case of Partridge vs. Menck, reported in 47th of American Decisions, at page 281. Note pp. 284-289, an instructive brief itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b906-6\">In the case of Clark vs. Clark, New York Supreme Court, 25 Barb., page 76, it was held : \u201c Where the plaintiff and the defendant have nearly the same names, and are engaged in the same business, each has a right to use his own name, and a party will not be restrained by injunction from using his own name, unless he so use it to mislead.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b906-7\">In the case of Burgess vs. Burgess, 17 English Law <em>&amp; </em>Equity, page 257, it was declared: that \u201c where a person is selling an article in his own name, fraud must be shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>to constitute a case for restraining him from so doing on the ground that the name is one in which another has long been selling a similar article; therefore where a father had for many years exclusively sold an article under a title of Burgess\u2019 Essence of Anchovies, the court would not restrain his son from selling a similar article under that name, no fraud being proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b907-5\">In the case of Coats vs. Platt, reported in the 17th Legal Intelligencer, 213, it was decided: \u201cThat where a firm name, as J. &amp; P. Coats, in connection with certain symbols, has acquired the properties of a trade-mark, it is no infringement for two other individuals bearing the same name to adopt the style J. &amp; T. Coats to designate goods of a like description, provided they do not use it in connection with the, residue of the trade-mark of the former firm.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b907-6\">In the case of Faber vs. Faber, reported in the 49th Barbour, 357, N. Y. Supreme Court, it was decided: \u201c That the court will not enjoin a defendant from using his own name in the prosecution of a manufacturing business because it is similar to that of a rival manufacturer in the same business. ' Any injury which one manufacturer may sustain by the competition of other persons of the name from the use of such name merely, is without remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b907-7\">In the case of Wolfe vs. Burke, N.

No man can obtain the monopoly for the exclusive right of property in the public and well known name of a geographical district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b909-8\">We need only cite a few cases to sustain this elementary proposition. The Moline Plow case was decided in Candee vs. Deere, reported in the 54 Illinois, 439; the United States Supreme Court, in the case of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Co. vs. Clark, reported in the 13th Wallace, 311; the Glendon Iron Co. vs. Uhler, 75 Pa., 467; Blackwell vs. Armistead, 5 Am. Law Times, 85; Dunbar vs. Glenn, 42 Wis., 118; Caswell vs. Davis, 58 N. Y., 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b909-9\">In the case in 13th Wallace, 311, it was held that \u201c the same reasons which forbid the exclusive appropriation of generic names or those merely descriptive of the article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>manufactured, and which can be employed with truth, apply with equal force to the appropriation of geographical names designating districts of the country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b910-5\">\u201cTheir nature is such that they cannot point to the origin or ownership of the article of trade to which they may be applied. They point only to the place of production, and could they be appropriated exclusively, the appropriation would result in mischievous monopolies. Could such phrases as Pennsylvania Wheat, Kentucky I\u00edemp, Virginia Tobacco, or Sea Island Cotton be protected as trade marks; could any one prevent all others from using them or from selling articles produced in the districts they describe under those appellations, it would greatly embarrass trade, and secure exclusive rights to individuals in that which is the common property of many. It can be permitted only when reasons that lie at the foundation of the protection given to trade marks are entirely overlooked.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b910-6\">In the case of the Glendon Iron Co. vs. Uhler, reported in the 75 Pennsylvania, 467, it was decided: \u201cThat as a general rule, the name of a town or city cannot be exclusively appropriated as the trade mark of any one.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b910-7\">In the case of Blackwell vs. Armistead, Judge Rives, in his opinion reported in the 5th Am.

Gato would not have the right to have a Mr. Gato manufacturing cigars at Key West, restrained, and he certainly would not under the foregoing authorities, then he certainly has no right amounting to a legal right to ask that a favor be extended to him which is not sanctioned by legal authority. It has become too well settled by custom in the trade, that KejWest cigars, so called, apply to all cigars made in the Collection District of Florida. The same as Cuban grown to \u2022 bacco has come to be known and described by custom as Havana tobacco. The custom of branding all cigars manufactured in the Key West District as Key West cigars is so well known and understood in the cigar trade of this country, that none is misled thereby, and no injury results from a use of that which custom has sanctioned and made permanent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b911-6\">We now come in the order of this discussion to consider the words \u201cBouquet\u201d and \u201cEstrella.\u201d It is well settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>as an elementary principle governing the law of trademarks, that no word descriptive ot kind or quality can be used and protected as a trade-mark. The word Bouquet, as defined by Webster, signifies an agreeable perfume ; an agreeable, aromatic odor. That certainly designates the quality of a cigar, and it is well known in the trade, and is used as a trade designation, either in wine or in tobacco. The following cigar factories in Havana, Cuba, use Bouquets : Bock &amp; Co. make the Alexander II Bouquets Pinos; The Elor de Alma Petit Bouquet; The Alta Club Bouquets and Concha Bouquets; Ambrosia and Nectar Bouquet ; The Anita Petit Bouquet.; Antig\u00fcedad Petit Bouquet; Elor de Benito Suarez and Petit Bouquets; Carolina Bouquets and Concha Bouquets and Petit Bouquets ; El Brilliant Bouquets, La Camelia Bouquets; Caridad Bouquets; Cortina Mora Company Petit Bouquets; and Elor Cubana Boqueta; Diaz&amp; Garcia Dulcinea Bouquets; La Escepcion Bouquets; Figaro Bouquets; Flor de las Flores Bouquets ; Selectas Petit Bouquets; Manuel Garcia Alonzo Bouquets ; Henry Clay Bouquets ; La Hijo Yuelta Abajo Bouquets; *La Intimidad Bouquets ; Por laraugo Bouquets Finas; La Lectura Bouquets ; LaPuehade Flores Bouquets ; and Petit Bouquets ; Puck Bouquets ; Punch Bouquets ; La Rosa Bouquets ; Alvarez Hijo Bouquets ; and Bouquets Fina; Soberanos Bouquets and Bouquets Especia ; Troya Bouquet; and nearly all noted factories in the U. S. make Bouquets and sell under -the same both separately and in combination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b912-5\">From the foregoing list of names and brands coupled with the word Bouquet, it is very evident that plaintiff can under no circumstance claim titlq thereto to the exclusion of a similar use by the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b912-6\">The same argument applies to the word. \u201c Estrella.\u201d This word indicates quality, being the Spanish for a star. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Among tbe numbers of manufacturers, it is easy to find it in common use. Let the court compar\u00e9 the cigar boxes filed as exhibits to the bill, and the striking dissimilarity between the pictures and labels become at once apparent. Besides, the cigars sold by defendants, under the word Bouquet are each wrapped with a band having \u201c Bouquet \u201d printed thereon but those of the complainant are bare. No one of intelligence looking for complainant\u2019s cigars could possibly be mistaken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b913-5\">We now come to a consideration of the allegations in the bill contained, charging that the cigars made by the defendants are sold as plaintiff\u2019s, and palmed off on the purchasing public as such. This point was passed upon in the celebrated Sapolio case, decided by the New York Court of Appeals, sub nom. Enoch Morgans Son\u2019s Company vs. Troxwell, and reported in 89 N. Y. Court of Appeals, p. 292. In that case the charge was also made, as in this that defendant was palming off his goods as the goods of plaintiff, and the court very rightly held that the real question to be considered in such an issue and in such form of action, was the one whether an imitation of a trade mark belonging to plaintiff, and which would be sustained as such, was being perpetrated by the defendant, and if no such imitation existed, the judgment could not be sustained on any other grounds.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b913-6\">To use the language of the court, in the unanimous opinion given by it, as follows: u If, as we think, there was no imitation of any trade mark of the plaintiff, the judgment cannot be sustained on the ground of fraudulent representations or devices on the part of the defendants to palm off their goods upon individuals as the goods of the plaintiff. \"What remedy there is for such a wrong if proved, it is not necessary now to inquire; but the remedy clearly is not to restrain the defendants from selling their own goods in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>packages and labels which do not infringe upon any trade mark of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b914-5\">This decision covers the case under consideration, and may be profitably considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b914-6\">To recapitulate: As to the use of the words G. IT. Gato, Key West, Bouquet or Estrella, by the defendants, there can be no question in view o\u00ed the foregoing decisions, that the plaintiff has no legal right or equitable title giving him a monopoly of the use of such terms or either of them, in view of the fact that the courts have so uniformily held otherwise, and also in view of the fact that the devices and symbols used by the defendants to designate their various brands are so totally different from the devices and symbols used fry the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b914-7\">We would call especial attention to the very lucid and comprehensive exposition of the law of trade marks regulating their use, when such trade marks consists of arbitrary words, as made by the New York Court of Appeals in the case of Hier <em>et al. </em>vs. Abrams <em>et al., </em>and reported in 82 N. Y. Court of Appeals Report, p. 520. That decision points out and distinguishes the difference of the application of law between trade marks consisting of symbols or devices alone, as contra-distinguished from trade marks consisting of arbitrary words. And the application of this case to the case at bar is patent in sustaining the contention that the plaintiff has no right to exercise a monopoly in or become entitled to the exclusiveness of the words Key West, Bouquet or Estrella, inasmuch as he was not the original user of the same, and further, inasmuch as the symbols used by defendants are totally different from the symbols used on plaintiff's labels by him. The celebrated Hoh case cited in the authority last quoted controls the issue in the case at bar in that particular direction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b914-8\">In regard to the second assignment of error, we submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>that the court erred in granting the order for a temporary injunction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b915-5\">We contend that the court had doubt, upon the case being submitted on motion for the injunction. This is manifest from the time during which it was held under advisement. If the court doubted, the motion for the temporary injunction should have been refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b915-6\">\u201c In many cases it may be difficult to determine whether the complainant\u2019s sign or trade-mark has been actually pirated in such a manner as to be likely to deceive and impose upon his customers or the patron of his manufacture, trade, or business. And in cases of doubt the court should not grant or sustain an injunction until the cause is heard upon pleadings and proofs, or until the complainant has established his right by an action at law. But if the court sees that the complainant\u2019s trade-mark are simulated, in such a manner as probably to deceive his customers, or the patrons of his trade or business, the piracy should be checked at once, by an injunction. In this case, however, I am not satisfied that the label used by the defendants will probably have the effect to deceive And impose upon those who are in the habit of buying and using the matches of these defendants are of his manufacture.\u201d Partridge vs. Menck, Am. Decisions, vol. 47, p. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b915-7\">The case was submitted on the motiou for a temporary injunction upon the bill, the answers of defendants Sigo Myers and G. II. Gato, and upwards of fifty affidavits in behalf of defendants, as against less than half a dozen affidavits on behalf of complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b915-8\">We respectfully submit to the court that these affidavits of witnesses, taken from nearly every quarter of the Union, made by persons residing in some of the most important cities \u2014 -centers of wholesale and retail trade in cigars, both in number and in character (we speak with reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>positive averments of the affiants) ought to have overborne the affidavits and the bill of the complainant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b916-5\">The counsel for the complainant very candidly informed the solicitors for the defendants, and repeated it upon his argument before the court below, that he did not regard the answers of the two defendants referred to as anything more than affidavits. This, however, is a matter for the court to determine. We speak in regard to the absence of answers, or affidavits if the court please, of the other two defendants, that which is not improper for us to state in view of the fact that counsel for the complainants are well aware of the situations and exigency that prevented counsel for defendants from filing answers of the other defendants, when we say that the court had concluded to hear the motion for a temporary injunction on so short a notice, that we were unable to obtain anything from the defendants Herman Myers and Frederick Myers, one of them residing in Virginia and the other in New York; and we beg also to remark in that connection that neither of the absent defendants has any personal acquaintance with the matters involved in this suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b916-6\">Inasmuch as the complainant has taken a cross appeal from the decision of the court sustaining the. demurrer, as to the damages claimed in the bill of complaint, we respectfully submit, that we believe it is unnecessary, so far as authority is concerned to do more than refer the court to the fundamental principles controlling this subject \u2014 we mean the subject of injunctions against infringements of trade-marks. The unbroken line of authorities upon this subject is, that there is no jurisdiction in a court of equity to go beyond restraining the defendants from the use of complainant\u2019s trade-mark, and compel him to account for the profits he has wrongfully derived from the invasion of complainant\u2019s rights. He may have his action for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>ages at law, and recover them, but the true doctrine is that if he recovers damages at law, that then he can do no more upon the equity side of the court than enjoin defendant from further use of his trade mark.</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b917-5\">The following are authorties in point upon this proposition : Hostetter vs. Vowinkle, 1 Dill., 329; Waite\u2019s Ac. &amp; Def. v. 6, p. 36, citing Stonebreaker vs. Stonebreaker, 33 Md., 252; Blackwell vs. Wright, 73 N.

Y., 519; Williams vs. Brooks et al., 50 Conn., 278; Liggett <em>&amp; </em>Meyer Tobacco Co., vs. Hynes, 20 Federal Reporter, 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">We have not been furnished with any of defendant\u2019s boxes of the \u201cEstella\u201d brand, but the bill alleges that this brand of defendants so closely resembles the \u201cEstrella\u201d (star) brand of complainant that it is calculated to mislead the public into believing the brand of the defendant to be that of the complainant. The demurrer to the bill admits these allegations of the bill, and the defendants virtually admit the truth of the allegations in their answer. They, it is true, deny in a general way, the allegations of the bill in regard to the said brand so closely similating complainant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>brand, but failed utterly to show wherein their brand does not resemble the complainant\u2019s. They admit the manufacture of the brand \u201cEstella\u201d brand of cigars at Jacksonville, but say that the word \u201cEstella \u201d is not \u201cEstrella, \u201d as alleged in the bill. Is this a denial of the positive allegations of the bill as to the resemblance between the said two brands? Certainly not. Then why did not the defendant's deny the allegations of the bill if they were not true? They admit the allegations of the bill to be true, that is to say, that they intended to deceive the public, profit by the deception, and to injure the complainant. The omitting of the letter \u201c r, \u201d as aforesaid, was bn* an artifice resorted to by the defendants under the belief that it would not be detected, but if detected, it might protect them in a suit for damages by the complainant against the defendants for so pirating his trade-mark. No other conclusion would be consistent with the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The affidavits of Bishop &amp; Co. and others filed in the case, tend to show that the defendants have palmed oft and sold their said cigars as, and for those of the complainant, and that the agents of the complainant have had to publish notices in newspapers cautioning the public against the deception thus practiced by the defendants. This the defendants have attempted to contradict by filing counter affidavits, stating that the affiants knew of no such efforts either on the part of the defendants or their agents, to palm off or use their cigars as, of and for those of the complainant. This is mere negative evidence and proves nothing. There was no error iu granting the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">This disposes of the error assigned by appellants, but counsel in their argument further contend that the complainant has been guilty of such laches that he is not entitled to the relief he prays for, and cites Wait\u2019s Actions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Defenses, volume 6, pp. 42, 43; Beard vs. Turner, 13 Law T. (N. S.), 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The rule in England in trade mark cases is more stringent than in this country, and a lack of diligence there in suing deprives complainant in equity o\u00ed the right to an injunction or on account. Bnt our courts are more liberal in this respect. A long lapse of time will not deprive the owner of a trade mark of an injunction against an infringer, bnt a reasonable diligence is required of a complainant in asserting his rights, if he would hold a wrong-doer to account for profits and damages. This rule, however, applies only to those cases where there lias been an acquiescence after a knowledge of the infringement is brought home to the complain ant. Sawyer vs. Kellogg, Am. Trade Mark Cases, 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Nor will the acquiescence of any person in the wrongful use of his name, estop him from asserting his rights in equity unless he hasmotice during such acquiescence o\u00ed the facts rendering the use of his name wrongful. Horton Manufacturing Company, Jamestown, N. Y., vs. Horton Manufacturing Company, Ft. Wayne, Indiana, Am. Trade Mark Cases, 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">And the laches of the complainant will not avail as a defence in a proceeding to restrain the use of a trade name when the defendant adopted the name with a fraudulent intent. Sanders vs. Jacob, Am. Trade Mark Cases, 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The complainant was in no such laches as would deprive him of his rights in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">The only remaining question to be considered is, did the chancellor err in sustaining the second ground of defendant\u2019s demurrer to the bill?</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">This court held in Doggett vs. Hart et al., 5 Fla. 230, that \u201c in cases of accounts, of agency, of apportionment, of general average, of contribution, of waste and of partnership, when chancery once entertains a suit upon grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>legitimately cognizable in that court, it will proceed to adjudicate other matters of which it has only incidental cognizance, in order to avoid a multiplicity of suits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">\u201cAnother rule,\u201d says Mr. Story, (1 Story\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, section 64, k,) \u201c respects the exercise of jurisdiction, when the title is at law, and the party comes into equity for a discovery, and for a rebel, as consequent on that discovery. In many cases it has been held, that, where a party has a just title to come into equity for a discovery, and obtains it, the court will go on, and give him the proper relief; and not turn him round to the expenses and inconvenience of a double suit at law. The jurisdiction having once rightfully attached, it shall be made effectual for the purposes of complete relief. And it has accordingly been laid down by elementary writers of high reputation that \u2018the court, having acquired cognizance of the suit for the purpose of discovery, will entertain it, for the purpose of relief, in most cases of fraud, account, accident and mistake.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In the case at bar the bill prays for discovery, an accounting of profits, injunction, damages and general relief, and the only ground of objection to the bill, raised by the second ground of defendants\u2019 demurrer, is, that the bill prays damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">That a man whose trade-marks have been infringed upon as in this case, is entitled to compensation for the infringement, is unquestionable, and it strikes us that it makes no difference whether the compensation to which the complainant is entitled is called profits or damages. What is an accounting, but the method by which to ascertain the complainant\u2019s damages or compensation for the wrong and injury done him by the defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">That the complainant is entitled to damages see Hostetter et al. vs. Vonwinkle et al., 1 Dillon, 329; Pitt vs. Hall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>2 Blatch. U. S. C. C., 229; Atlantic Milling Co. vs. Robinson et al., 20 Federal Reporter, 217; Graham vs. Platt, 40 Cal., 593; 6 Am. Rep., 639; Marsh vs. Billings, 7 Cush., 322; Stonebreaker vs. Stonebreaker, 33 Md., 252; Blackwell vs, Wright, 73 N C., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">A party whose trade-mark has been violated is entitled to recover all profits realized by the wrong-doer from sales of the spurious article, and also, damages resulting from such violation. Graham vs. Platt, 40 Cal., 593; Peltz vs. Eichel, 62 Mo., 171; 7 Cush., 322; Atlautic Milling Co. vs. Robinson et al., Am. Trade Mark Cases, 904; Hostetter et al. vs. Vouwinkle et al., 1 Dill., 329; Pitts vs. Hall, 2 Blatch., 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The owner of a trade-mark is entitled to nominal damages for the violation'of his trade-mark, although it is not shown that he has sustained actual damages, and although the defendant\u2019s articles are not inferior in quality to his own. Blofield vs. Payne, 4 Barn. &amp; Ad., 410; S. C. 1 New. &amp; Man., 335; Thompson v. Winchester, 19 Pick., 214; Rodgers vs. Nowill, 5 C. B., 109; Conran v. Joseph Uhrig Browing Co., Am. Trade Mark Cases, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The decree of the court below granting injunction is affirmed, but the order sustaining defendant\u2019s demurrer to that part of the bill that claims damages, in excess of profits realized, is reversed, and .the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The appellant, El Modelo Cigar Manufacturing Company, to pay all costa of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Appellants filed a bill for a rehearing, which was denied.</p>\n<author id=\"b925-9\">Maxwell, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"ALh\">Appellants are not satisfied with the decis* ion in this case, and they now come with application for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>rehearing, based on mistakes of the court in the opinion rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The first mistake complained of is in relation to a statement of the court respecting allegations of appellants in regard <em>to </em>climatic and atmospheric conditions in Key West, as adapted to the manufacture and preservation of cigars. The court asked in argument why did appellants \u201caver in the answer that the atmosphere in Key West was not more favorable for the manufacture and preservation of cigars than at points north of place,\u201d &amp;e. So far as we can see this is but hypercritical, in that the word \u201c aver \u201d was used instead of the word \u201cdeny.\u201d Whether it was an averment or denial made no difference as to the question then under discussion, of intention to injure complainant by the use of simulative words and brands.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">The next ground for rehearing is, that \u201c there is no allegation in the bill or answer, nor is there any proof that G. H. Gato was the junior member of the firm of the El Modelo (ligar Manufacturing Company, yet the court, in its opinion, asked why did they use the name of the junior member of the firm in combination with the words \u2018 Key West,\u2019 \u2018La Estella \u2019 and \u2018 Bouquet.\u2019 \u201d With all due respect to counsel, this seems simply frivolous. G. H. Gato was spoken of as the junior member of the firm because in the list of four partners his name appeared last. But whether he was a junior or other member did not affect the question involved in the use of his name, the impressive fact being that his name <em>was </em>used, instead of any other of the four, or of the firm name, to direct attention to the brand of cigars.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The third ground for rehearing is, that there was a mistake of the court in reference to the La Estella brand of cigars, in saying that the defendants \u201c admit the allegations of the bill to be true, that is to say, that they intended to deceive the public, profit by the deception, and to injure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>complainant.\u201d The paragraph of the opinion in which this sentence occurs, taken altogether, is such as to render the sentence susceptible of reference to the admission of defendants under their demurrer to the bill. ' In this view the statement is correct. But without regard to that, and even if the mistake is a substantive one, it cannot affect the conclusion of the court, for there is still the \u201c Bouquet\u201d brand not 'touched by this mistake, which furnishes sufficient ground for that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">A rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
