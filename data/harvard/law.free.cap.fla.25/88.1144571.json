We insist that such mandate is void as a trespass on <em>judicial </em>functions. The granting or refusal of new trial's belongs exclusively to the judiciary; only the trial or appellate court can impair a judgment for cogent reasons,; as soon as it is rendered, the legislative powers cease, except so far as they afford the vanquished party an opportunity to point out wherein the judgment is erroneous, in law or fact.

Section 18, page 26, Hawes, ibid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-9\">The legislature would be powerless to directa trial court to reopen a cause, and for the same reason it is an unwarrantable assumption to direct the appellate tribunal to determine it on the theory of the non-existence of a judgment, <em>which does actually </em>exist, and is absolutely conclusive as to law and fact until the contrary is made apparent by the supposed aggrieved party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b100-10\">If we once concede the constitutional power of the legislature to direct causes once solemnly determined, to be re-tried <em>de novo </em>we then decl\u00e1re that the judiciary is not a fix\u00e9d element \u00f3f th\u00e9 Federal \u00e1r\u00edd State Constitutions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>2. Section 19 of the act February 16, 1881, chapter 3248, specifies the County Judge with exclusive <em>original </em>jurisdiction in a special subject matter; <em>expressio unius exclusio </em>alterius. When we say original, we mean <em>in the first instance. </em>Wells on Jurisdiction, section 154, page 149, Hawes, Ibid, section 14, page 44, hence, if a party proceeded thereunder <em>in the first instance </em>in the Circuit Court, its doings would be absolutely void; how then, can the Circuit Court do indirectly on an appeal what it would be powerless to do directly by an original cause?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-5\">A judgment is always supposed to vest the victorious party with higher rights, but the theory of respondent reverses that principle, for it relegates the relator to a worse position in Circuit Court and places the company in a better after the judgment than each previously occupied before its recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-6\">The Circuit Court, it is claimed, has original jurisdiction in actions of forcible entry and unlawful detainer; true, for instance, under the act of 1868, which specifies the Circuit and County Courts with concurrent jurisdiction ; but, <em>in this case, </em>it has not, unless we first wipe out the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and then are prepared to declare that, although the County Court is specified under the act of 1881, the Circuit may, nevertheless, without authority over the subject matter and person, entertain an original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">Assuming for argument that the Circuit Court may entertain such original jurisdiction concurrently with the County Judge under the act of 1881, (a proposition absolutely untenable) yet, in this case, it has not, because when the Company brought its action before the County Judge it was a solemn admission of the County Judge\u2019s original jurisdiction; hence, under the Constitutional amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of 1875, such original jurisdiction immediately attached, and it is a principle that whichever of two courts of concurrent powers first attaches, the first retains the same and' <em>ipso facto </em>ousts the original jurisdiction of the other. Wells, Ibid, section 156, page 149. Hawes, Ibid, section40..</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">A judgment in the County Court would be' a complete bar to an action in the Circuit, and a judgment in the Circuit a bar to the County Court; or, in other words, the judgment of one is conclusive and supreme to the \u2019concurrent jurisdiction of all other courts. Hall vs. Dana, 2 Aiken, 384; Smith vs. McIver, 9 Wheaton, 535; Cited by Hawes, Ibid, \u00a7 40, page 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-6\">3. In the Circuit Court the respondent <em>admitted and argued </em>that a <em>de novo </em>trial is the exercise of original jurisdiction ; but now we hear for the first time that a <em>de novo trial is appellate </em>\u2014 a proposition that embodies in its terms a clear contradiction; for, if that be true, the legislature used meaningless words, and thus performed an idle ceremony in providing for a <em>de novo </em>trial. <em>Ex parte </em>Henderson, 6 Fla.; State vs. Baker; State vs. Vann, 19 Fla.; and State vs. King, 20 Fla., directly demonstrate that it is the exercise of original jurisdiction. Whatever may have been the reasoning of State vs. Baker, the conclusion is unmistakably correct in so far as it holds that a <em>de novo </em>trial is \u201c original \u201d and not \u201c appellate.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-7\">In many of the States \u2014 as in Texas \u2014 the Circuit or Superior Courts have on appeal an original and appellate jurisdiction in certain cases;. but we have no such duplex jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-8\">\u201cAppellate\u201d jurisdiction necessarily implies that the subject matter has been instituted in and acted upon by some other court whose judgment is to be revised.

VII of Amendment), and its letter and spirit are engrafted on our State Constitution that trial by jury shall \u201c remain inviolate forever.\u201d ' .</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-5\">The Pensacola City Co. recognized this principal, for they filed a transcript of the record of the pleadings, etc., of the case, as tried in the County Court in the Circuit, thus making the record the vehicle and channel for \u201c getting into \u201d the appellate tribunal; but, after they \u201cget into\u201d the Circuit, they deny the very means and the only means by which they entered and could have entered into the court and ob. tain a new trial (before the County or Circuit Court has granted it,) as if none other had been previously had \u2014 thus reminding us of Macbeth, \u201c Whereto the upward climber looks into the clouds and scorns the base degrees by which he did ascend!\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-6\">There was in fact no difference between the cases as tried in the Circuit and County Courts on the pleadings; hence, the Circuit contradicted the principle of State and Trustees vs. J. P. &amp; M. R. R. Co., XVI Fla., 903, that 'there cannot be two inconsistent final judgments covering the same subject matter, based , up the same pleadings, by the same plaintiff, against the same defendant, and that the first must stand until reversed or opened and vacated <em>(not by the legislature, but by the judiciary), and. </em>the annihilation of another fixeed principle your Honors have announced, that every fair intendment must be made in the appellate court that an inferior .court has acted rightly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b104-7\">Under our Constitution the County Judge and Circuit Courts in their respective spheres are supremeand sovereign when the admitted powers of one have' been exercised; it is no answer to say that another court of equal dignity has held to the contrary \u2014 except as an <em>appellate' </em>co\u00fc rt \u2014 so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>an affirmance, reversal or correction of the trial cqurt may result very different from totally disregarding a final judgment. (concretely merging facts and law),- and without which final judgment thereeditldilW no <em>appeal.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-4\">But whatever may b\u00e9 the reasoning .of the Baker and other cases, the Legislature in fhe act qf . 1885, providing *\u2022 that appeals by \"bills of exceptions are hereby authorized from Justices\u2019 and County Courts to the Circuit in the same manner as appe\u00e1ls from Circuit to Supreme Courts,\u201d shows the intent of the lawmakers, so that no doubt should longer exist, and with a view to uniform practice and procedure in cases tried in all the courts of Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">The same idea that a \u201c de novo trial is the exercise of original and not appellate was prevalent in the mind of the framers of our New Constitution, for they provided in Art. Y, Sec. 18, in future legislative organization of County Courts for a trial \u201c de novo \u201d at the option of appellant\u2014 thus demonstrating their belief, engendered by all the previous decisions of our Supreme Court, that a constitutional provision was essential to direct a \u201c de novo \u201d trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-6\">On the whole, we conclude that as the legislature did not provide in the act of 1881 for the County Judge\u2019s grant or \u2022 refusal of a new trial, that the appellant should remove, <em>not the original </em>papers, but the transcript of the record of all the proceedings, pleadings, evidence, charge of court, etc., to the Circuit Judge, whose duty it then becomes to do in the premises as to law may appertain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-7\">The writ of prohibition, it is clear, should be granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-8\">The State <em>ex. rel. </em>Alex. Iggans, is virtually the same as this except that the motion to dismiss included one ground not included herein. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-9\">The case made out by respondent involves this most remarkable proposition: That a judgment is a valid judgment as to the vanquished party, but-is. not a judgment, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>all as\"'to'1 the victorious party. It is a judgment <em>so far </em>as it enables'the Company, to appeal \u2014 for without a judgment there could be no appeal \u2014 but it is not a judgment merging certain concrete facts and law, from which certain other legal consequences necessarily .result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\">\u2019 How c\u00e1n a judgment \u2014 a legal result \u2014 be effectual, unless we also concede the constituent causes producing that result ? How can the vanquished party of a.trial court claim the benefit of an appeal from a judgment unless he be willing to concede to his victorious opponent if not greater, at least corresponding benefits ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">A judgmeut is the judicial'determination of certain particular facts and law; strike out those facts and law and there is no judgment; where then is the appeal ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-6\">This is undeniable unless we are prepared to recognize the -impossible doctrine, that an effect can be produced without a cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-7\">The truth is, that an appeal does not destroy, but merely suspends a judgment. 3 D.all.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-8\"><em>W.

Chap. 3248, \u00a77, Laws of Florida.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-10\">This legislation is not affected1 by the provisions of chapter 3584, which merely authorizes the use of another method, and which, besides, does not extend to actions before the County <em>Judge.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-11\">The question, then, for consideration is whether this provision for a trial <em>de novo </em>is in conflict with the Constitution of 1868, as amended'in 1875-(Art. VI, \u00a711,), which gives-to the-Circuit Court only <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction over those cases when arising before the County Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>This court has decided that it is in such conflict. State <em>ex rel. </em>vs. King, 20 Fla.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-5\">We submit with great deference, but with equal confidence, that this decision is erroneous, and our whole attempt here will be to Justify that confidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-6\">The logic in the King case is irreproachable, but, while it repudiates the reasoning, it is based upon an assumption or the correctness of the decision, in the case of State <em>ex rel. </em>vs. Baker, 19 Florida, and by reason of this assumption is fatally wrong.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-7\">That decision is that a trial <em>de novo </em>cannot be had in the exercise of that appellate jurisdiction to which the Circuit Court, in cases arising before the lower court, is limited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-8\">Let us examine this proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-9\">First upon principle:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-10\">The word \u201c appellate \u201d as used, in the Constitution is evidently generic, embracing any proceeding by which a cause once tried in a lower court may be removed or transferred into a higher court, and there passed upon, whether that removal and passing upon be effected through the instrumentality of a writ of error, a writ of <em>certiorari </em>or an appeal. All of these are known as appellate proceedings. State <em>ex rel. </em>vs. Baker, 19 Fla., 27.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-11\">It is evident, then, that the word \u201cappellate\u201d in itself furnishes no clew by which we can determine either the method of tranfer to the higher from the lower court, or the method to be used by the higher court in arriving at its determination, after the transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b107-12\">Th,e court in the Baker case erred primarily here, in adopting a narrow definition from an obscure writer of a generic term embracing diverse processes, instead of inquiring whether either of these processes would authorize the power under discussion. We propose to make that inquiry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Taking each of these processes in turn, it is clear, and we admit, that the authorization of a writ of error or of a writ of <em>certiorari </em>would not empower an appellate court to try a cause arising in a lower court <em>de </em>novo, but we say that an appeal is an appellate proceeding authorized under a grant, of appellate jurisdiction, and that the Legislature may, under a constitutional grant of such jurisdiction to the Circuit Court over actions decided before a County Judge, provide for a trial <em>de novo </em>of such action in the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b108-5\">Tliis results from the very definition of the word \u201cappeal,\u201d no matter from what legitimate source we mat' derive that definition. We cannot go to the common law for it has no such proceeding, and even the word, in the sense of a supervisory proceeding by one court over anol her, was unknown.

Authorities ante.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-8\">4. Prevailing American Practice. Of course we refer to the practice prevailing in courts of appellate-organization similar to those of our own circuit courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-9\">In numerous States of the Union, if not in a large majority of them, the trial in a circuit or superior court of an appeal from a lower court, meant a trial <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">Such was the meaning in Alabama, 5 Porter, 121; 21 Ala., 479; 36 Ala., 682; in Texas, 20 Tex., 629; in Illinois, 24 Ill., 180; 27 Ill., 35; in Nevada, 2 Nev. 166; in Massachusetts, 5 Mass. 376; in Connecticut, 15 Conn., 518; in Rhode Island, 1 Gall., 12.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">And like proceedings, all called appeals, prevailed in other of the States. Of course, all these appeals were uuder provisions of statutes, but the bearing of them just here is to show what was meant in general American jurisprudence by an appeal from an inferior court to a circuit, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>trict or superior court, as they were variously termed in the several States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">5. Florida Legislation and Decisions. The statutes of 1822, 1823, 1824 and 1832 (6 Fla., 287), provide fora trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court upon appeal from a Justice of-the Peace.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">The Statute of 1859, chap. 1013, provides for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court upon: appeal from the Probate \u2022 Court. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">These provisions were construed to allow amendments in the Appellate Court. Davis vs. Elliott, Adm., V. Fla., 261. And to eonstitutionally permit the trial <em>de novo </em>there; <em>Ex parte </em>Henderson, 6th Fla. :</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-8\">So that the only system in Florida in existence up to 1868, by which appeals could be had from inferior courts to Circuit Courts, was a system by which the determination of the appeal should be <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-9\">We are now able to determine what was the meaning of the word appeal, as one of the appellate proceedings provided for under the grant of appellate jurisdiction in the Constitution of 1868.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">As we have before remarked, the civil and admiralty law would preclude anything but a trial <em>de novo </em>upon an appeal, but we do not insist upon a construction so narrow, but merely that at the time of the making of the Constitution there existed in American law two methods of determining cases upon appeal. The one upon the record by review, and the other by a new trial <em>d\u00e9 novo. </em>Each of these was adapted to the courts to which they were applied. In courts of last resort, Courts of Errors, Supreme Courts and Courts of Appeal, it would have been impossible that cases brought from the various widely separated 'localities over which these courts had jurisdiction, should.be tried <em>denovo\\ </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and so in these courts the re-determination was by a review of errors in the court below, upon the record. \u2019 Besides,; the courts were to a great extent like the French Court of Cassation \u2014 for the purpose of determining the law and making it uniform \u2014 which could be well effected only by reviewing decisions upon law questions made by the lower court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">But upon appeals from one local court to another in matters usually of small importance, no such reasons existed. All original sources of testimony were, equally accessible to both courts, it was infinitely more important to settle the particular individual litigation than to determine the law, and the size of the litigation was such as to render the-costs of a-record and bill of exceptions such as to prohibit appeals to be tried upon the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">These reasons had operated upon almost all the States in the American Union, to cause them to institute differences between the methods of appeals by a central appellate court, and by local appellate courts. And among other States, they had operated upon the Legislature of Florida, which had established one system for its Supreme Courts, and another for its Circuit Courts, when sitting as courts of appeal. This last system had been pronounced constitutional, and had been approved by the Supreme Court and by the practice of the profession for a score of years. <em>Hx parte </em>Henderson, 6 Fla.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">The makers of the Constitution found this condition of jurisprudence in existence when they undertook to form the Constitution of 1868, and this system was continued under the new Constitution, unless repugnant to it. Fairchild <em>et al. </em>vs. Knight <em>et al., </em>1 Fla., 8771.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-8\">And the terms in the new Constitution are to be construed with reference to the system prevailing under the old. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Blanchard and Burrus vs. Raines, 20 Fla. 476; 18 Fla., 771.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">Upon the application of these principles we rely for our procedure upon appeal to the Supreme Court, and why should not our application of the same principles be sufficient to determine what is allowable upon appeals to the Circuit Court ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">In fine, our argument is this: The Constitution grants appellate jurisdiction to Circuit Courts \u2014 this includes all appellate proceedings \u2014 an appeal is an appellate proceeding \u2014 by every system of law authorizing appeals, on such appeal to inferior courts a trial <em>de novo </em>was permissible; therefore the Constitution authorized trials <em>de novo </em>upon appeals from a lower court to a Circuit Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">Secondly upon authority:</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-8\">The Supreme Court of Nevada has, under a Constitution (of 1864) almost identical in this respect with ours, decided that a grant of appellate jurisdiction to the Circuit Court authorized the Legislature to provide for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the appellate court. Cavanagh vs. Wright, 2 Nev., 166.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-9\">Wefind no other authority where this point was directly involved, but we find that in the following States, where the Circuit Courts have constitutional jurisdiction of appeals (which, of course, is equivalent to, and if not equivalent to, is still narrower than appellate jurisdiction) from lower courts, a trial <em>de novo </em>in the appellate court is authorized by the Legislature and enforced by the courts: In Alabama, under Constitution of 1819, Art. V., sec. 10; 5 Porter, 121; 21 Ala., 479. So under the Constitution of 1865, Art. 6, sec. 9; 36 Ala., 682. In Texas, under Constitution of 1866, Art. 10, sec. 6; 20 Texas, 729. In Illinois, under Constitution of 1848, Art. V., sec. 8; 24 Ill., 180; 27 Ill., 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-10\">And note that the removal of a cause from a State to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Federal Circuit Court (even after judgment in the discretion of Congress) is an appellate proceeding, although the Federal Court cannot consider any errors committed by the State Court before removal. 1 Kent\u2019s Com., 321; Story\u2019s Com. on Const., sec. 1745.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">The arguments <em>contra </em>our position are :</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">1. That a trial <em>de novo </em>is the exercise of original jurisdiction. If our foregoing argument is correct, that it is the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, of course it cannot be of original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">But we may go further. Original jurisdiction is the exercise of jurisdiction in the first instance. Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\">And it is impossible to say that a trial in a court is the exercise of original jurisdiction unless the cause originated in that court, and if it originated elsewhere, it would seem equally impossible to say, with reason, that any manner of determination in that court could make the cause originate there.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">The whole doctrine of original jurisdiction, which is elaborated in the Baker case, is founded upon the decisions there cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-10\">But in the Henderson case, which is one of the citations, the court admits that it is not original, but say that it is of <em>mixed </em>jurisdiction, a fancy that is dispelled with but slight reflection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-11\">We have not before us the other cases cited, but our recollection is that they do not sustain the position assumed, but that the Missouri cases (or at least one of them, upon which the others are founded) place the want of a power in the appellate court to try <em>de novo, </em>upon the want of a <em>statutory </em>provision which the Constitution would have allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-12\">And in the case of Lyles vs. Barnes, 40 Miss., 608, (also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>cited) it is expressly decided that an appeal generally could be tried <em>de </em>novo, but that the statutes of Mississippi require them to be tried on the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">And, in truth, the King case repudiates the whole theory of the decision in the Henderson case, aud the reasoning in the Baker case, for it emphatically decides that though the Circuit Court has original jurisdiction, it could not try <em>de </em>now, because on appeal its appellate jurisdiction only was invoked.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">2. That the idea of an appeal pre-supposes error in the court below, and that a trial <em>de novo </em>in the superior court is hadatthe volition of the party losing in the inferior court without any showing of error there. But this is assuming the very point in controversy, and we think that we have shown that it is an assumption contrary to principle and authority. To add another citation, Powell (Appellate Proceedings, p. 359, \u00a72,) says that \u201c here [in America] by means of the appeal a trial <em>de novo </em>is obtained at the volition of the party, without assigning any cause for it.\u201d The assumption is natural to a lawyer whose appellate practice has been exclusively- in the Supreme Courts, but cannot withstand the light of the history of inferior appellate courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\">3. That the judgment of the inferior court is <em>res adjudicada, </em>and must stand until reversed by due course of appellate proceedings. This also is begging the question for it brings us back to the point of this discussion as to whether a trial <em>de novo </em>is or not an appellate proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-8\">Besides, the doctrine of <em>res adjudieata </em>is merely the doctrine of estoppel, dependent up &gt;n the finality of the judgment until reversed, and it is for the Legislature to say (within constitutional limits) whether it shall be subject to reversal in one way or another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>We submit that we have accomplished our task, aud demonstrated that the Legislature was authorized by the Constitution of 1868 to provide for a trial <em>de novo </em>in a Circuit Court upon appeal from the County Judge in an action by a landlord against a delinquent tenant, and that the case of State <em>ex rel. </em>vs.'King, 20 Fla., should be overruled.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b116-5\">Raney, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Acm\">This is an application for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The question before us is whether under the Constitution of 1868, as amended in 1875, the seventh section of the delinquent tenant act of 1881. (chapter 3248) is unconstitutional in so- far as it authorizes a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Circuit Court, of a case appealed to after trial by a County Judge. It was held by this court in 1884, in the case of State <em>ex rel. </em>vs. King, Circuit Judge, 20 Fla., 399, that the provision in question was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"AK1\">Section 10 of Article X, the Judiciary Article, of the Constitution of 1868, as amended in 1875, provides, after giving County Judges the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Justices of the Peace, that they \u201c may also have jurisdiction of such proceedings relating to the forcibly entry or unlawful detention of lands and tenements, subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, as may be provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Section 8 of the same article provides that the Circuit Courts shall have \u201c original jurisdiction * * * of the action of forcible entry and unlawful detainer, and of actions involving the titles or the right of possession of real estate;\u201d aud that \u201c they shall have appellate jurisdiction of matters pertaining to the probate jurisdiction and of the estates and interests of minors in the County Courts and of such other matters as may be provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">The fifth article of the Constitution of 1838 provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>inter </em>alia, as follows: The Supreme Court, except in cases otherwise directed by that instrument, shall have appellate jurisdiction only, which shall be co-extensive with the State, under such restrictions and regulations not repugnant to the Constitution as may from time to time be prescribed by law (section 2.) The Circuit Court shall have original jurisdiction in all matters, civil and criminal, within this State not otherwise excepted in this Constitution (section 6.) It also provided (section 10) for Justices of the Peace, and that they should \u201cpossess such jurisdiction as may be prescribed by law ; and that in cases tried before a Justice of the Peace the right of appeal shall be secured under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The Legislature haviug provided for appeals from trials by Justices of the Peace to the Circuit Court, and that on any such appeal being taken the case should be tried in the latter court \u201c anew upon its merits,\u201d and without requiring written pleadings, it was contended in <em>ex parte </em>Henderson, 6 Fla., 279, that the Circuit Court had no power in view of the above grant of powers made by section 6 of Article Y of the Constitution to entertain or try a case so appealed, but that the duty belonged to the Supreme Court. The decisiou of the court was that \u201c the right of appeal \u201d in cases tried before Justices of the Peace, under the above tenth section of the fifth article of that Constitution, meant (p. 291) appeals involving trials <em>de novo </em>or anew upon the merits, which had been in use in the Territory under Legislative enactments, as far back as 1822. Of such a trial on appeal it is said, pp. 288, 289 : \u201c We do not concur in the opinion that the case of an appeal from a Justice of the Peace is a ease of appellate jurisdiction in the sense in which this term is used in the Constitution conferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>it on this (the Supreme) Court. The fact is, it is of a mixed character, having but one ingredient of appellate power in that it has its origin in the inferior court, whilst in all other respects it is and from its commencement, as well by the Legislature as the courts, has been treated and regarded as if originally instituted in the Circuit Court, with the single exception that written pleadings are not required. The case is directed to be tried anew in the Circuit Court, and it is to be continued after judgment, until final execution. This undoubtedly is the exercise of original jurisdiction. There is no revision and correction of error of law merely, no remitting of the case below for further trial.\u201d Again, on p. 291: \u201c Considered in this light we feel no difficulty in regarding the Constitution as having allusion to these statutes and designing their continuance, and in holding the case to be one of original jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Assimilating the powers of the Circuit Court to those of the King\u2019s Bench.in its general supervising control of inferior tribunals it was, however, also said that even if the power was appellate in its nature, it could, nevertheless, be exercised. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Considering the fact that the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was concurrent with that of Justices of the Peace in any case involving not more than fifty dollars, McMillan &amp; Campbell vs. Savage, 6 Fla., 748, it is clear that an appeal under the above system was nothing more than a transfer of the cause after trial to another tribunal where it was retried without regard to either the result of or to any proceeding in, the former trial, and the second trial was the exercise of original, and not of any supervisory jurisdiction. The case was carried to the Circuit Court1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>for it to try as an original cause the same as if it had originated there.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Looking at the Constitution of 1865 we find nothing indicating any different intent, or different effect from that indicated by the former instrument. Article Y, sections 5, 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Constitution of 1868, by section 8 of Article VII, gave to the Circuit Court original jurisdiction of the action of forcible entry and unlawful detainer. Its appellate jurisdiction as prescribed by this section does not include such actions. By section 11 of the same article the County Courts \u201c may have no-extensive jurisdiction with the Circuit Courts in cases of forcible entry and unlawful detention of real estate, subject to appeal to the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The doctrine of State <em>ex rel. </em>vs. King, Circuit Judge, <em>supra, </em>is that although the Circuit Court has original jurisdiction of the proceedings in question, its power in cases appealed from the County Judge is appellate only, and that it could not exercise original jurisdiction; citing State vs. Baker, 19 Fla., 19, and State vs. Vann, <em>Ibid, </em>29, where it was held that on an appeal to a Circuit Court from a judgment of a Justice of the Peace a trial <em>de novo </em>is the exercise of original jurisdiction, and that the statute providing for such trials on such appeals was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">We have considered the question presented carefully and are unable to conclude that there is error in the conclusion reached by our predecessors in the case against Judge King It is clear that the Constitution of 1868, as amended in 1875, gave to the Circuit Court both an original and an appellate jurisdiction in cases of the character of the one before us, and we are unable to reach the conclusion that the language used in it, as shown at the outset of this opinion, does not exclude the idea that the appeal should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>be to the original jurisdiction of that court. Its natural meaning is that it should be to the appellate jurisdiction, and not to the same jurisdiction as that by which it could try the ease as a cause originally instituted in it. Under the Constitution of 1838 it was necessarily an appeal to the original jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. Though called an appeal or anything else, in trying the case the Circuit Court did so by the use of its original jurisdiction, put to such a use by the Legislature. It had no real appellate jurisdiction, as distinguished irom original, to be used; a\"d wo may remark here that the Circuit Court, under the Constitution of 1868, as amended in 1875, did not. have the extensive powers supervisory of and controlling inferior tribunals, conceded to have been in the Circuit Court under the organic law of 1838, by the opinion in Ex-parte Henderson. They were chiefly if not exclusively in the Supreme Court. Section 5, Article VI; Singer Manufacturing Company, vs. Spratt, 20 Fla., 122; Sherlock vs. City of Jacksonville, 17 Fla., 93; State vs. Gleason, 12 Fla., 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Having in a preceding section a'iven the original jurisdiction indicated, to the Circuit Court, if it had not been the intention to exclude a retrial in the exercise of such jurisdiction the language quoted from section ten of the amendments of 1875 would not have been used, or, in other words, if it had intented to permit a retrial by such original jurisdiction the language referred to would not have been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The jurisdiction to try a proceeding relating to the forcible entry or unlawful detainer of lands, is a law jurisdiction ; and at law, barring the legislation as to trials <em>de </em>novo, such a thing as the introduction \u2018of new evidence has not been permitted on either a writ of error, or on our law appeal. The same is true of appeals in equity. State courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>have no admiralty jurisdiction, and the peculiar practice in that branch of jurisprudence cannot be invoked as in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The point before us was not made in any of the cases cited by counsel for respondents, except in that of Cavanaugh vs. Wright, 2 Nev., 166, and it does not change our convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The demurrer to the suggestion will be overruled, with leave to ihe respondents to plead within tw\u00e9nty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">It will be so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
