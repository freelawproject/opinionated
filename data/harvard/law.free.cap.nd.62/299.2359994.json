The only payment on the note was one for $181.46, made December 10, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The defendant Benschler defaulted. The defendant Merkel answered setting up want of consideration, and that his signature was obtained by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">When the case was called for trial defendant Merkel appeared by other counsel and at that time was permitted to file an amended answer in which he alleged \u201cthat if he signed the note described in the complaint, there has been a total failure of consideration therefor, and that he has not received any value whatsoever.\u201d As a further defense he set forth certain facts, the gist of which will be stated later.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">A jury was waived and the case tried to the court.

The plaintiff was the owner of a half section of land in Emmons county, encumbered by a mortgage of .$3,500.00 due December, 1930. In September, 1926, by written contract, plaintiff sold this. land to the defendant Eenschler; and the Vendee assumed \u25a0 the mortgage and agreed to pay the same as a part of the purchase price, lie further agreed in the contract to give plaintiff a note for the remainder of the purchase price \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s equity in the land \u2014 to be signed by himself, his father, and the defendant Merkel. Such note was given. One half of the crop each year was to be delivered to the plaintiff to be applied upon the note and the note was to be \u201crenewed each year.\u201d There were covenants and agreements in regard to the payment of taxes, the place and manner of.delivery of grain, the crops to be sown, the care to be .given to the premises, the acts which would constitute default and the rights .of the plaintiff thereunder. .</p>\n<p id=\"ALS\">The note for the purchase price was renewed annually until the note in controversy was given- \u2014 the vendee\u2019s father dying in the meantime. The vendee failed to pay the-mortgage'and it was foreclosed in May, 1930. . ..- '\u2022 \u2022 . : ;s</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u2022 This action was commenced in January, 1931, and appellant\u2019s original answer was \u00a1 served in May \u00a1of that year. The 'vendee failed to redeem from the-foreclosure sale and a sheriff\u2019s deed was issued'on or about May 2-6, 1931.- The-case came on for.trial on June 25, 1931, and at-that time appellant 'filed., his amended answer, based .on the theory that the action, \u2022 in -effect, was one for specific performance and alleging the renewal of the notes, the sale of the land :under the written contract, and that'the plaintiff had failed to'fender a deed to the land at the time this note became .duel \" :.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The facts are' not in dispute. Appellant is an accommodation maker for the vendee. It is his claim .that the cpnsideration' for the .sale failed; that the action is in the nature of specific performance, of lia contract for deed and that the .'defendant Merkel, though an accommodation maker for the defendant Eenschler, can insist upon specific performance; that before the plaintiff can recover on this note it must -show it tendered a deedand inbi tender was made. \u2022 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Ay1\">There is no merit in the claim.there was no consideration; and it is immaterial that the <em>appellant </em>\u201chas not received any value whatsoever.\u201d 'The consideration, for the not\u00e9 was the equity which the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tiff had in the land. This is what defendant Renschler boughtand for this -he and the appellant gave the note. \u2022 &gt; \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">There is no merit in the contention that there-is a failure of consideration. The vendee permitted the mortgage to be'foreclosed before this note was due and before tbe action was commenced, and permitted a sheriff\u2019s deed to issue before he claimed\" any failure of consideration. The mortgage was superior to the equity he'bought. The loss of the equity is the only \u201cfailure\u201d of \u25a0 consideration.. The vendee failed to redeem and thus lost the 'land. This loss \u2014 solely the result of his .own failure \u2014 is his, not plaintiff\u2019s. x</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The plaintiff did not bring an action for specific performance of tbe contract. It sold its equity in tbe land, has not been paid, and is suing on tbe note: It woidd be an idle ceremohy to tender a deed for an extinguished equity. Tbe carefully prepared and elaborately 'presented defense that this, in effect, is an action.for specific performance, and that consequently the rules governing such action apply, disappears. The note is due, the time of paym\u00e9nt has arrived, and the note is not paid. \u2019 ' -lln ' ' :</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The judgment of the lower court is 'affirmed;</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-7\">Christianson, Oh.
