That conviction was reversed by this Court for reasons involving the warrantless search of appellant\u2019s home. United States v. Scheffer, 5 Cir. 1972, 463 F.2d 567. Scheffer was re-tried, convicted again and the same sentence was imposed. Appellant unsuccessfully appealed this second conviction, United States v. Collins, 5 Cir. 1973, 478 F.2d 837, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1010, 94 S.Ct. 373, 38 L.Ed.2d 248, and then moved the district court for a reduction of his sentence. The motion was denied; Scheffer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-22\">We cannot say either that the sentence was illegal or that the district judge abused his discretion in refusing to reduce appellant\u2019s sentence. United States v. Johnson, 5 Cir. 1973, 476 F.2d 1251, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 852, 94 S.Ct. 146, 38 L.Ed.2d 101. The record shows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>however, that Scheffer was nineteen years old at the time of his offense and thus was eligible for sentencing pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010. The district court order denying appellant\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence offers no indication that the court considered the propriety of sentencing Scheffer under the Act, even though Scheffer submitted several affidavits which raised the issue. We therefore vacate appellant\u2019s sentence and remand the case to district court for an express determination of whether Scheffer would benefit from treatment under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act.
