Central to both appeals is the issue whether the District Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a collateral attack upon an order of the Board approving an airline merger, subject to labor protective provisions, and upon the Board\u2019s refusal to exercise its reserved jurisdiction to set aside an integrated seniority list negotiated by the parties\u2019 freely chosen representatives. For reasons more fully explained below, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-21\">1. BACKGROUND \u2014 THE DISTRICT COURT\u2019S ACTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b178-22\">A. Carey v. O\u2019Donnell</p>\n<p id=\"b178-23\">W. Peter Carey and four other former Northeast Airlines pilots filed the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>action below against the Air Line Pilots Association and its president, J. J. O\u2019Donnell, alleging (1) invidious discrimination, (2) breach of duty of fair representation in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement, and (3) violations of the Railway Labor Act (\u201cthe RLA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement by the defendants of the agreement of 26 October 1972, wherein ALPA and Delta incorporated the integrated seniority list complained of.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (6), defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\u201c(a) The Court lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201c(b) The Complaint is barred by a prior judgment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201c(c) The Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Alternatively, defendants moved for summary judgment \u201con the basis of the Complaint, and the affidavit and exhibits attached to [the] motion.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The District Court dismissed the complaint on the authority of Northeast Pilots Master Executive Council v. O\u2019Donnell and ALPA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Hyland v. United Air Lines, Inc.,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> holding that \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over this controversy lies with the Civil Aeronautics Board . \u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">B. Chaudoin v. ALPA</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">George S. Chaudoin and three other former Northeast Airlines pilots filed the class action below against the Air Line Pilots Association and Delta Air Lines, Inc., alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cthe ADEA\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sought a declaration that the agreement of 26 October 1972 incorporating the integrated seniority list was in violation of the ADEA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Asserting the same grounds as in <em>Carey, </em>and that \u201cthe complaint is a collateral attack on an order of an Administrative Agency, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and it [sic] not permitted under the law,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> defendants moved for dismissal of the complaint or in the alternative for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">The District Court found that while the membership in the class below was somewhat smaller than that alleged in <em>Carey, </em>all members of the <em>Chaudoin </em>class were also members of the <em>Carey </em>class. The court also found that while the action in <em>Carey </em>was based on unfairness under the RLA and the action in <em>Chaudoin </em>on illegal age discrimination under the ADEA, each complaint questioned the validity of the integrated seniority list and therefore raised the same substantive issues. Accordingly, the court held that between plaintiffs and the defendant ALPA, the decision in <em>Carey </em>was <em>res judicata. </em>Between plaintiffs and the defendant Delta, the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The instant appeal is from those holdings.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>II. EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD AND THE COURTS OF APPEALS</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Today in Northeast Master Executive Council v. CAB,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we affirm the Board\u2019s refusal to set aside the integrated seniority list and its holding that the list had been compiled in a \u201cfair and equitable manner.\u201d Our jurisdiction to review such orders derives from the Federal Aviation Act of 1958,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which provides that orders of the Board \u201cshall be subject to review by the courts of appeals of the United States or the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that \u201cthe court shall have <em>exclusive jurisdiction </em>to affirm, modify, or set aside the order complained of . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Congress having thus provided a statutory scheme whereby matters of airline merger, including the fair and equitable integration of seniority lists, are vested in the Civil Aeronautics Board subject <em>only </em>to review in the courts of appeals, collateral attacks thereon are impermissible.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Appellants in the cases at bar have all had their day in court as contemplated by the statute.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Viewed objectively, the actions below, although couched in terms of violations of the RLA and the ADEA, are essentially collateral attacks on the integrated seniority list as incorporated in the ALPA-Delta agreement of 26 October 1972, approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board, and reviewed by this court in Northeast Master Executive Council. We perceive no necessity for additional review, not contemplated by the Federal Aviation Act, in the District Court or any other forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">The Seventh Circuit in Oling v. Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> rejected the claim, brought by pilots aggrieved by the merger of Capital and United Air Lines, that the District Court had jurisdiction over a suit charging discrimination and other violations under the RLA. Like the case at bar, <em>Oling </em>involved \u201ca situation where the Board acting within its jurisdiction and authority gave its approval to the merger upon condition that certain labor protective provisions be complied with including that pertaining to seniority integration . . . . \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court held that the allegations made in the District Court were essentially the same as those made before the Board, and as such constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Appellants over rely on the Board\u2019s statement in Universal Airlines Company<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that it lacks jurisdiction over controversies of the type presented in these appeals, implying that the aggrieved pilots in that case had remedies available elsewhere. But when the Universal pilots\u2019 action in District Court \u2014 based on a claim of breach of duty of fair representation \u2014 was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Sixth Circuit in Kesinger v. Universal Airlines, Inc.,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> affirmed, citing <em>Oling, </em>and noting that \u201cthe CAB is not the final word concerning its own jurisdiction . . . and certainly not the final word concerning the jurisdiction of United States district courts.\u201d <footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We follow the result reached in <em>Oling </em>and <em>Kesinger. </em>Our decision in Southern Pilots Association v. CAB<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> is not to the contrary. We said there that the Civil Aeronautics Board \u201chas no jurisdiction to pass upon designations of bargaining agents or charges of discrimination in the representation function.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Yet that case, which involved an ordinary unfair representation claim based solely upon principles of labor law, did not arise in the context of an airline merger and subsequent compilation of an integrated seniority list. Conseauently, we had no occasion in <em>Southern Pilots </em>to consider whether the Board does have jurisdiction over certain labor matters arising out of its approval of an airline merger on conditions involving the fair and equitable negotiated settlement of those labor matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">III. OTHER ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Since we adopt the rationale of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits and hold as we do that the District Court has no jurisdiction over the actions below, we need not reach the questions of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel presented in <em>Chaudoin. </em>While it may have found other valid grounds on which to dismiss, the District Court had no more jurisdiction to hear that action than it had to hear <em>Carey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Accordingly, the judgments appealed from are</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">EDWARDS, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result in Nos. 73-1608 and 73-1783.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b178-12\">.
