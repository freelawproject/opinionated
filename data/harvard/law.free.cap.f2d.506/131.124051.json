The petition named as respondents the Director of the Bureau of Prisons and the Attorney General of the United States, the appellees here, and challenged as cruel and unusual punishment an administrative policy banning such visitation in federal penal institutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response to the District Court\u2019s order to show cause why the petition should not be granted, appellees opposed the action on the premise that it could be brought only in the judicial district of appellant\u2019s confinement. The District Court thereupon dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, but granted appellant leave to appeal <em>in for-ma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">When notified of the docketing of the appeal and asked whether he wished an appointment of counsel, appellant filed a motion for permission \u201cto withdraw [his] complaint and litigation, with leave to refile same at [a] later date.\u201d As reasons for the motion, appellant alleges that his health is impaired and that, in retaliation for the litigation, he has been severely harassed by penitentiary personnel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case is now before us on the motion for leave to relinquish the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-17\">We have no call to consider the constitutional argument which appellant\u2019s habeas corpus petition ushered in. The District Court dismissed the petition, not for failure to state a claim upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>which relief could be granted,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the court never addressed appellant\u2019s constitutional contention, nor would that contention be reached on this appeal. Rather, the only issue which the appeal presents for resolution is whether the District Court erred in dismissing the petition for jurisdictional reasons. And, we repeat, the question immediately before us is whether appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw the appeal should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The latter question would ordinarily present a simple task, particularly in view of the poor condition of appellant\u2019s health, but it has been given a new cast by his allegations of retaliatory mistreatment by prison personnel. \u201cEvery prisoner,\u201d the Fifth Circuit aptly declares, \u201chas a constitutional right of access to the courts to present any complaints he might have concerning his confinement. He cannot be disciplined in any manner for making a reasonable attempt to exercise that right.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If indeed the motion to withdraw was a product of persecution germinated by appellant\u2019s assertion of his claim judicially, the motion is not made voluntarily. And it goes without saying that the courts will not tolerate such a perversion of the judicial process, or aid the unlawful thwarting of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In this state of affairs, we find ourselves confronted with something of a dilemma. Certainly we could not, in the face of the grave charge which appellant makes, act on his motion without further investigation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But just as surely, this court, as an appellate tribunal, is not equipped to undertake the kind of factual exploration which the situation demands. We could, of course, remand the inquiry to the District Court, but only if, contrary to its already-expressed view, that court was empowered to adjudicate the case when it first came there. And even if it was, the factual predicate, if any, for appellant\u2019s complaint of abuse resides in the penitentiary in Atlanta, and only dubiously would a court in the District of Columbia attempt to thrash out the factual issues which ex-pectably would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">The interplay of these considerations leads us unavoidably, in the search for the answer, to reexamine the District Court\u2019s jurisdictional position. Doing so, we have little difficulty in concluding that the District Court possessed jurisdiction to entertain appellant\u2019s action. We need not ponder whether there was jurisdiction in habeas corpus per se <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for, at the least, appellant\u2019s pro <em>se </em>petition was treatable alternatively as an application for relief via some other suitable remedy \u2014 mandamus, injunction or declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With both defendants in the District of Columbia, and charged with unconstitutionally barring conjugal visitation between federal inmates and their spouses, there was both jurisdiction and venue for mandamus<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, upon satisfaction of the jurisdictional-amount requirement,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for injunction and declaratory-judgment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of course, an entirely different question is whether the District Court should have transferred appellant\u2019s suit to the judicial district in which appellant was incarcerated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court did not pursue that course, however, and dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was not in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">But even though the District Court has power to act in this case, the further question is whether its action in connection with the allegations of harassment would otherwise be appropriate. The answer, we believe, is plainly in the negative. Ostensibly the witnesses are in the penitentiary in Atlanta, and certainly their convenience would be served by the transfer of the litigation to the Northern District of Georgia, wherein the penitentiary is located.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Other factors bearing on \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> point in the same direction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> And we are unable to perceive \u201cany compelling reason [which] requires the matter [of harassment] to be litigated here.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">We are mindful that the District Court is authorized to transfer this case only to a district \u201cwhere it might have been brought,\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a requirement necessitating proper venue<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, as well, amenability of the defendants to process emanating from the transferee court.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> But. venue in the Northern District of Georgia would have been proper whether the assumed objective of appellant\u2019s lawsuit is a writ of habeas corpus<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> or mandamus,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or an injunction or a declaratory judgment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And it is equally clear that the District Court for that district possessed the means of acquiring personal jurisdiction over the federal officers at whose hands appellant seeks relief.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-17\">Accordingly, we reverse the District Court\u2019s jurisdictional determination and remand the case with the instruction that it be transferred to the Northern District of Georgia. Since neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>District Court\u2019s action nor ours rests upon any determination on the merits, neither will foreclose litigation of appellant\u2019s claims there.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\">.

Certainly this ease belongs in the Northern District of Georgia, the District of appellant\u2019s incarceration <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> if, indeed this case belongs in any court at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Logically and historically, imprisonment has usually resulted in a deprivation of conjugal rights. No other result could be expected from incarceration and forced separation from the rest of society. No prison is designed to be just like home. Deprivation of conjugal rights, like many deprivations flowing from imprisonment, is thus neither <em>cruel </em>nor <em>unusual </em>punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">In the few instances where conjugal visitations have been granted, this has always been done by act of the legislative or executive, as an act of grace or experiment in rehabilitation, not because of any constitutional mandate to grant such a privilege. No decision of any court has been cited requiring conjugal visitations as a matter of constitutional right, and I am aware of none. There are decisions to the contrary.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">I would remand this \u201ccase\u201d to the District Court to dismiss as frivolous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">. As a matter of habeas corpus jurisdiction, it is doubtful that the District Court for the District of Columbia has even the power to entertain this action. Under the mechanical test employed in some older cases, the fact that the action was not brought in the location of the \u201cimmediate custodian\u201d of the petitioner would alone have barred the exercise of jurisdiction. See, <em>e.g., </em>Sanders v. Bennett, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 148 F.2d 19 (1945); Jones v. Biddle, 131 F.2d 853 (8th Cir. 1942). Recent cases suggest a more functional approach to habeas jurisdiction. Their concern is less with identifying the actual physical custodian of the petitioner (if, indeed, he has one) and more with evaluating the meaningfulness and sufficiency of the petitioner\u2019s contacts with the forum. <em>Cf. </em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court, 410 U.S. 484, 493-494, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973); Eisel v. Secretary of Army, 155 U.S.App.D.C. 366, 369-381, 477 F.2d 1251, 1254-1276 (1973). The contacts of the appellant in this case with the District of Columbia are minimal. If habeas jurisdiction were allowed, all prisoners dissatisfied with prison conditions anywhere in the country could bring such actions in this district. (In 1973 there were over 23,000 inmates in the Federal Prison system. Weekly Report, U. S. Department of Justice \u2014 Bureau of Prisons, Federal Prisoners Confined Week of 6/14/73.) Of course, jurisdiction may properly be obtained under an application for mandamus, an injunction, or declaratory relief; but, as our opinion makes clear, the same factors of convenience which militate against the assumption of habeas jurisdiction dictate a transfer of this case to the Northern District of Georgia under section 1404(a) if jurisdiction is laid on an alternative ground. <em>See </em>Young v.
