J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUa\">Lamar Johnson was involuntarily committed to a state mental hospital after a jury found him to be a sexually violent predator (SVP). He appealed, and he later filed two petitions for a writ of habeas corpus. We consolidated the actions after issuing orders to show cause. In his appeal, Johnson argues (1) insufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that he is an SVP; (2) the jury was improperly instructed on the burden of proof; and (3) the Sexually Violent Predator Act (the SVPA or Act)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutional. In both habeas corpus petitions, he argues that his commitment must be vacated because the newest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (DSM), a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association to identify criteria for the classification of mental disorders, does not allude to the psychiatric diagnosis upon which his commitment was based: \u201cparaphilia[,j not otherwise specified, . . . with non-consenting persons.\u201d We reject these arguments, affirm the judgment, and in the published poition of our decision deny the habeas corpus petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">A. <em>The Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Under the SVPA, a person who is found to be an SVP beyond a reasonable doubt by a unanimous jury may be involuntarily committed to a state mental hospital for an indefinite term. (\u00a7\u00a7 6603, subd. (d), 6604.) The statute defines an SVP as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against one or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>SVPs are entitled to have their mental conditions examined once per year (\u00a7 6604.9, subd. (a)), and they can obtain release in two ways. First, if the State Department of State Hospitals (DSH) determines that the SVP\u2019s diagnosed mental disorder \u201chas so changed that the person is not likely to commit acts of predatory sexual violence while under supervision and treatment in the community,\u201d the DSH must forward a report and recommendation for conditional release, and the trial court must set a hearing to consider conditional release. (\u00a7 6607, subd. (a).) Second, the SVP may petition the court for a conditional release with or without the concurrence of the DSH. (\u00a7 6608, subd. (a).) Upon receiving a petition filed without the DSH\u2019s concurrence, the court \u201cshall endeavor whenever possible to review the petition and determine if it is based upon frivolous grounds and, if so, shall deny the petition without a hearing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If the court determines the petition is not frivolous, it must set a hearing. (\u00a7 6608, subds. (b)(1) &amp; (4), (c)(1).) If the SVP\u2019s petition is denied, the SVP may not file a new application until one year has elapsed from the date of the denial. (\u00a7 6608, subd. (j).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">At a hearing to consider an SVP\u2019s conditional release, the trial court must determine whether \u201cit is likely that [the committed person] will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior due to his or her diagnosed mental disorder if under supervision and treatment in the community.\u201d (\u00a7 6608, subd. (g).) Ordinarily, the burden is on the SVP to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that conditional release is appropriate. (\u00a7 6608, subd. (k).) But when the DSH issues a report stating that \u201cconditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the person and that conditions can be imposed that would adequately protect the community,\u201d the burden is on the state to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that conditional release is not appropriate. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Not surprisingly, the constitutionality of the SVPA and other states\u2019 civil commitment schemes has been challenged. Our state Supreme Court has upheld the SVPA against due process and equal protection challenges, and it did so by adopting the same analysis that applies under the United States Constitution. <em>(Hubbart </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1138, 1152, fn. 19 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 492, 969 P.2d 584].) Under both the federal and state Constitutions, a finding of dangerousness alone is insufficient to justify an involuntary commitment. <em>(Kansas v. Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346, 356-357 [138 L.Ed.2d 501, 117 S.Ct. 2072] <em>(Hendricks)', </em>see <em>Hubbart, </em>at p. 1152, fn. 19.) Rather, a state can only involuntarily commit someone who has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u201cserious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d that separates the person \u201cfrom the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Crane </em>(2002) 534 U.S. 407, 413 [151 L.Ed.2d 856, 122 S.Ct. 867] <em>(Crane).) </em>\u201cIf . . . civil confinement were to become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence, or if it were shown that mental abnormality is too imprecise a category to offer a solid basis for concluding that civil detention is justified, our precedents would not suffice to validate it.\u201d <em>(Hendricks, </em>at p. 373 (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.); see <em>Crane, </em>at p. 412.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">B. <em>The Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Between 1983 and 1992, Johnson committed sexually violent offenses against three victims. In 1984, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 220, 261) of a 24-year-old woman. While he was awaiting sentencing for that crime, he raped a 15-year-old girl who lived in his apartment complex, and he later pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261.5). He served time in prison for those two convictions but was released on parole in May 1985. In March 1992, Johnson sexually assaulted yet another woman, and he was subsequently convicted of two counts of rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)) and one count each of assault with intent to commit sodomy (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 220, 286), forcible oral copulation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288a), and assault with intent to commit rape (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 220, 261). He was sentenced to state prison for 36 years and remained incarcerated for over 17 years, but he was scheduled to be released on parole on June 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The day before Johnson\u2019s scheduled release date, the San Mateo County District Attorney petitioned to have Johnson committed to a state hospital as an SVP. A jury trial ensued, and four psychologists testified as experts: Deirdre D\u2019Orazio, Ph.D., and Jesus Padilla, Ph.D., testified for the state, and Brian Abbott, Ph.D., and Christopher Heard, Ph.D., testified for Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The state\u2019s experts, Drs. D\u2019Orazio and Padilla, diagnosed Johnson with \u201cparaphilia[,] not otherwise specified, . . . with non-consenting persons.\u201d We shall follow the lead of at least one of the experts who testified below and will refer to this diagnosis as \u201cparaphilic coercive disorder.\u201d The state\u2019s experts relied on several factors in forming the diagnosis, and they generally described it as marked by sexual arousal or gratification involving nonconsenting persons persisting over a six-month period. Johnson did not object to the introduction of this testimony, and his counsel cross-examined both doctors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Johnson\u2019s experts disagreed with the state\u2019s experts about Johnson\u2019s diagnosis. Dr. Abbott testified that, although it can be a valid diagnosis, paraphilic coercive disorder is very rare, was not listed in the then current edition of the DSM, and is controversial within the scientific community. He opined that Johnson does not have the disorder, and he questioned the factors relied upon by the state\u2019s experts in diagnosing Johnson with it. Dr. Heard testified that paraphilic coercive disorder does not exist and that an overwhelming majority of psychologists and psychiatrists has rejected it as a valid diagnosis. He further testified that, even if the disorder does exist, there is no consensus on its definition or diagnosis, and none of the factors on which the state\u2019s experts relied to diagnose Johnson with the disorder had been validated by research. Dr. Heard opined that Johnson was motivated not by paraphilia but by anger toward women, which he expressed in a violent, antisocial manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The edition of the DSM current at the time of Johnson\u2019s trial was the text revision of the fourth edition, published in 2000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It states that \u201c[t]he essential features of a Paraphilia are recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving 1) nonhuman objects, 2) the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one\u2019s partner, or 3) children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of at least 6 months.\u201d This edition of the DSM identifies eight classifications of paraphilia and also references a residual category, \u201cParaphilia Not Otherwise Specified,\u201d which includes paraphilias that are less frequently encountered. The state\u2019s experts asserted that paraphilic coercive disorder falls within this residual category. After the trial, the American Psychiatric Association published a fifth edition of the DSM, DSM-5. The description of paraphilia in DSM-5 does not reference \u201cnonconsenting persons\u201d as did the fourth edition\u2019s, and DSM-5 does not otherwise allude to paraphilic coercive disorder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The experts also disagreed about Johnson\u2019s risk of engaging in sexual violence if released. To assess Johnson\u2019s risk of reoffense, Dr. D\u2019Orazio used the Static-99R, an actuarial instrument based on studies of known sex offenders that identifies factors related to reoffense. Dr. D\u2019Orazio also used another instrument, the Structured Risk Assessment, Forensic Version, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>select a reference group for Johnson and place his Static-99R score in context. Based on these two instruments, Dr. D\u2019Orazio concluded that he falls into a high-risk group and has characteristics in common with men who have reoffended at a rate of 21 to 28 percent over a 10-year period. Dr. Padilla also used the Static-99R, as well as factors listed in another guided clinical assessment instrument, the Stable-2007, to estimate that Johnson had a 15.8 percent risk of recidivism over the next five years and a 24.3 percent chance of recidivism over the next 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Johnson\u2019s experts testified that his risk of reoffense was lower. Although, as did the state\u2019s experts, Dr. Abbott used the Static-99R, he concluded that Johnson fell into the \u201croutine corrections offender group,\u201d which has a 6 percent chance of reoffense over a five-year period, with the chance declining about 2 to 4 percent per year. Unlike Dr. D\u2019Orazio, Dr. Abbott did not use the Structured Risk Assessment, Forensic Version, to select a reference group, stating the instrument was experimental, and its reliability has never been tested. Dr. Heard testified that the current rate of sexual reoffense in the United States is 7 percent and that Johnson\u2019s risk was lower than that due to his age and declining sex drive. Dr. Heard did not use any sort of instrument or actuarial tool because he does not believe they provide accurate results.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The jury unanimously found Johnson to be an SVP, and the trial court imposed an indeterminate commitment. Johnson then filed a motion to strike the indeterminate commitment and to be given a two-year commitment instead, asserting that being held indefinitely would violate his constitutional rights. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">A. <em>Johnson\u2019s Appeal.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">B. <em>Johnson\u2019s Habeas Corpus Petitions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Having rejected the arguments Johnson raises in his appeal, we turn to his petitions for habeas corpus. In the first, he contends that the state\u2019s case is completely undermined by two pieces of newly discovered evidence\u2014 specifically, the DSM-5, which was published in May 2013, and the declaration of Allen Frances, M.D., which was submitted with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>petition. In the second, he claims that the revisions to the DSM undermine the state\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony and render it \u201c \u2018false evidence\u2019 \u201d under Penal Code section 1473, subdivsion (e)(1). Essentially, both petitions ask us to conclude, in the context of a case in which competing expert testimony on the subject was presented without objection, that paraphilic coercive disorder can no longer be considered a valid mental disorder. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We begin by observing that, in general, a person involuntarily committed under the SVPA may challenge the confinement through a petition for writ of habeas corpus. (\u00a7 7250; <em>People v. Allen </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 843, 859 [80 Cal.Rptr.3d 183, 187 P.3d 1018]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Talhelm </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 400, 405 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 150].) The restrictions on bringing the writ are typically discussed in the context of challenges to criminal imprisonment, but they apply equally to challenges to civil commitments. Important among these restrictions is that the writ does not lie \u201cto retry issues of fact or the merits of a defense, . . . and the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant the [jury\u2019s determination] is not a proper issue for consideration.\u201d <em>(In re Lindley </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 709, 723 [177 P.2d 918].) And when a habeas corpus petition is based on a claim of newly discovered evidence, \u201c[i]t is not sufficient that the evidence might have weakened the prosecution case or presented a more difficult question for the judge or jury.\u201d <em>(In re Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 750, 766 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729].) Rather, newly discovered evidence justifies habeas corpus relief only when it completely undermines the entire structure of the state\u2019s case. <em>(In re Hall </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 408, 421-423 [179 Cal.Rptr. 223, 637 P.2d 690].)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">A habeas corpus petition may also be based on a claim that \u201c[fjalse evidence that is substantially material or probative on the issue of guilt or punishment was introduced against a person . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (b)(1).) The Legislature recently amended section 1473 to expand the definition of false evidence to \u201cinclude opinions of experts that have either been repudiated by the expert who originally provided the opinion at a hearing or trial or that have been undermined by later scientific research or technological advances.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (e)(1), as amended by Stats. 2014, ch. 623, \u00a7 1.) Thus, both of Johnson\u2019s petitions ultimately turn on whether the new version of the DSM undermines the validity of a diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Being an extraordinary remedy, the writ is not available when an alternative remedy is available. <em>(In re Clark, </em>supra, 5 Cal.4th at p. 764, fn. 3.) Seizing on this principle, the Attorney General argues that Johnson\u2019s petitions must be denied because Johnson could argue in a section 6608 proceeding that the DSM-5 requires his release. We are not persuaded. A section 6608 proceeding does not provide Johnson with an adequate remedy because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of the nature of both his claims, which involve whether the DSM-5 renders invalid the diagnosis upon which his commitment under the SVPA is premised. If this were found to be true, the alternative remedy of a conditional release under section 6608 would be inadequate because it would require him to continue supervision under a \u201cforensic conditional release program\u201d for at least a year, and it would require him to petition for an unconditional release. (\u00a7 6608, subd. (g); see <em>id., </em>subd. (m).) If Johnson truly never had a mental disorder qualifying him as an SVP, he would not properly be subject to these restraints (even though he still would properly be required to fulfill any remaining parole obligations).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, section 6608 does not provide Johnson with an adequate alternative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We now turn to the merits of Johnson\u2019s petitions. According to Johnson, the drafters of the fifth edition of the DSM rejected a proposal from certain groups to clarify the fourth edition\u2019s language by including a specific diagnosis for paraphilic coercive disorder. He points out that the drafters also removed the passage in the fourth edition concerning nonconsenting persons and did not mention paraphilic coercive disorder when discussing conditions needing further research before being identified as official diagnoses.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Johnson contends that the upshot of these changes is that paraphilic coercive disorder can no longer be considered a valid mental disorder under the SVPA. Although we accept that the fifth edition may cast additional doubt on the validity of paraphilic coercive disorder, we cannot agree that it completely undermines the state\u2019s case or renders the state\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony false evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The federal Constitution does not require an SVP\u2019s commitment to be based on a disorder that is uniformly recognized by the mental health community. In <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. 346, the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that Kansas\u2019s SVP act violated due process because it allowed commitment based on a \u201c \u2018mental abnormality[,]\u2019 ... a term coined by the Kansas Legislature, rather than by the psychiatric community.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 357, 359.) The court observed, \u201c[W]e have never required State legislatures to adopt any particular nomenclature in drafting civil commitment statutes. ... As a consequence, the States have, over the years, developed numerous specialized terms to define mental health concepts. Often, those definitions do not fit precisely with the definitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>employed by the medical community,\u201d which the court concluded was permissible. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 359.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The Supreme Court later reaffirmed this principle in <em>Crane, supra, </em>534 U.S. 407, another case involving Kansas\u2019s SVP act. The court rejected the argument that the statute required the state to prove an offender had a total or complete lack of control over his or her dangerous behavior. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 412-413.) It also concluded that an offender could not be committed without any lack-of-control determination. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 413.) Although an alternative standard might be more precise, \u201cthe Constitution\u2019s safeguards of human liberty in the area of mental illness and the law are not always best enforced through precise bright-line rules.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court reasoned that \u201cthe States retain considerable leeway in defining the mental abnormalities and personality disorders that make an individual eligible for commitment\u201d and that \u201cthe science of psychiatry, which informs but does not control ultimate legal determinations, is an ever-advancing science, whose distinctions do not seek precisely to mirror those of the law.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Following <em>Hendricks </em>and <em>Crane, </em>the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals discussed the definitiveness of the DSM in particular in <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Bartow </em>(7th Cir. 2010) 593 F.3d 556. The petitioner in <em>McGee </em>challenged his involuntary civil commitment under an SVP statute, arguing that paraphilic coercive disorder was an invalid disorder because it was not specifically listed in the fourth edition of the DSM. <em>(McGee, </em>at p. 574.) The court ruled, \u201c[W]e cannot adopt any rule that asks the DSM to do what the text itself professes that it was not intended to do; answer ultimate legal questions or create a perfect fit between law and medicine in the realm of involuntary civil commitment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 576.) The court observed that regardless whether a diagnosis is accepted by the DSM, \u201cthe factfinder has the ultimate responsibility to assess how probative a particular diagnosis is on the <em>legal </em>question of the existence of a \u2018mental disorder\u2019; the status of the diagnosis among mental health professionals is only a step on the way to that ultimate legal determination.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 577, original italics.) The existence of a professional debate over paraphilic coercive disorder does not mean that the diagnosis is \u201c \u2018too imprecise a category\u2019 \u201d such that it runs afoul of due process. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 570, quoting <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 373 (cone. opn. of Kennedy, J.).) <em>McGee </em>concluded that \u201ca finding of a \u2018mental disorder\u2019 does not violate due process even though the predicate diagnosis is not found within the four corners of the DSM.\u201d <em>(McGee, </em>at p. 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We agree with these observations and conclusions and consider them to be equally applicable to the DSM-5. Even if the fifth edition reflects a growing skepticism in the psychiatric community about paraphilic coercive disorder, we cannot conclude that a commitment based on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>disorder violates due process, thereby completely undermining the state\u2019s case against Johnson. Similarly, we also cannot conclude that the fifth edition reflects scientific research that undermines expert testimony diagnosing that disorder and renders that testimony false evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Our holding might be different if the SVPA required an SVP\u2019s mental disorder to be specifically mentioned in the DSM. But it does not. The SVPA does not refer to the DSM, much less require an SVP\u2019s mental disorder be listed in it. (See \u00a7 6600, subd. (a)(1) [an SVP is someone with a \u201cdiagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others\u201d].) Even the Court of Appeals of New York, one of the courts most wary of basing an involuntary civil commitment on a diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder, accepts that under its state\u2019s civil commitment statute \u201ca mental abnormality \u2018need not necessarily be one so identified in the DSM\u2019 \u201d since the statute \u201cdoes not reference or require that a diagnosis be limited to mental disorders enumerated within the DSM . . . .\u201d <em>(State v. Shannon S. </em>(2012) 20 N.Y.3d 99 [956 N.Y.S.2d 462, 980 N.E.2d 510, 514].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As for Dr. Frances\u2019s declaration, it cannot even be considered newly discovered evidence or \u201clater scientific research.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1473, subd. (e)(1).) Dr. Frances is a professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University and was the chair of the task force that formulated the original fourth edition of the DSM. In his declaration, he states that the American Psychiatric Association has, over the past 24 years, consistently rejected the notions that the compulsion to rape could be conceived of as a mental illness and that the diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder should be used in forensic proceedings. He also opines, \u201cIt is obvious that Mr. Johnson is no more than a common criminal whose sexual violence was not due to a mental disorder and that he does not qualify for any diagnosis of Paraphilia.\u201d But other than its passing references to the DSM-5, the declaration simply elaborates upon the testimony of Johnson\u2019s experts below, who also questioned the legitimacy of a diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder. The declaration does not support Johnson\u2019s claims based on newly discovered evidence and false evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We think it worth reiterating that the validity of paraphilic coercive disorder was fully litigated at Johnson\u2019s trial. Johnson did not object to the introduction of the state\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony on the subject, and he was able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to cross-examine those experts and present the testimony of his own experts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Watters </em>(7th Cir. 2010) 599 F.3d 602, 612 [conclusion that diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder is acceptable is \u201cstrengthened where, as here, able assistance of counsel <em>actually did expose </em>the professional debate to the jury and substantial contrary professional opinions were offered\u201d (original italics)].) Although the fifth edition of the DSM and Dr. Frances\u2019s testimony might have bolstered Johnson\u2019s arguments if introduced at trial, they do not completely undermine the state\u2019s case or render the state\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony false evidence. Regardless of the publication of the DSM-5, the record before us includes substantial evidence that paraphilic coercive disorder is a legitimate diagnosis and that Johnson suffers from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The judgment is affirmed, and the petitions for a writ of habeas corpus are denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-8\">Margulies, J., and Dondero, J., concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 7, 2015, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.

The trial court granted the motion over an objection by Johnson that the exclusion would prevent him from adequately cross-examining the state\u2019s experts regarding the validity of the diagnosis of paraphilic coercive disorder. The court reasoned that the draft DSM had not yet been adopted and was subject to change.

(See, e.g., <em>In re Detention of Melcher </em>(Ill.App.Ct. 2013) 2 N.E.3d 1181, 1193-1195; <em>In re Cozart </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 2014) 433 S.W.3d 483, 490.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\"> Because the testimony about paraphilic coercive disorder was introduced without objection, we need not decide how questions about the admissibility of expert testimony on that disorder should be handled by a trial court. Suffice it to say that the admissibility of expert testimony in California is typically evaluated under Evidence Code section 801, which requires the testimony to be related \u201cto a subject that is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact\u201d and to be \u201cof a type that reasonably may be relied upon by an expert in forming an opinion upon the subject.\u201d In California, the admissibility of expert testimony about the diagnosis of mental conditions, including those not referenced in the DSM, is not governed by the <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test, which arose from <em>Frye v. U.S. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923) 293 F. 1013 and was adopted for use in California courts in <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 24 [130 Cal.Rptr. 144, 549 P.2d 1240]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McDonald </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 351, 373 [208 Cal.Rptr. 236, 690 P.2d 709]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 368, 373 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 828].) The <em>Kelly/Frye </em>test requires a party seeking to introduce expert testimony relying on \u201ca new scientific technique\u201d to show \u201cgeneral acceptance of the new technique in the relevant scientific community\u201d and the witness\u2019s qualification as an expert and use of \u201c[the] correct scientific procedures\u201d in employing the technique. <em>(Kelly, </em>at p. 30.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
