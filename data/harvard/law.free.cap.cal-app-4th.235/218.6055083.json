Baker sued Theresa Castaldi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appellant Alfonse Castaldi for allegedly stealing antiques he owned. Plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sought punitive damages. Trial proceeded to a first phase<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>on March 25, 2013, and a punitive damages calculation phase on August 6, 2013. The first phase dealt with liability, compensatory damages and whether plaintiff was entitled to punitive damages. The second phase dealt with the calculation of the punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">After the first phase completed, the court found both Theresa and Alfonse jointly and severally liable for conversion. On May 20, 2013, months before the punitive damages phase began, a document entitled \u201cjudgment\u201d was filed. The \u201cjudgment\u201d indicated that judgment was against both defendants, jointly and severally, and set forth $610,500 in compensatory damages plus interest and costs. The \u201cjudgment\u201d went on to state that the court \u201cfinds by a preponderance of the evidence^ that both defendants Alfonse Castaldi and Theresa Castaldi have acted with malice and with oppression toward plaintiff Ken Baker warranting an award of punitive damages to be assessed at a separate trial. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Several notices of appeal were filed in superior court, each identifying only the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d as the subject of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">We conclude that the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d was not a final, appeal-able judgment.

Neither party raised this issue in their initial briefs. However, \u201c[t]he appealability of the judgment or order is jurisdictional and an attempt to appeal from a nonappealable judgment or order will ordinarily be dismissed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Marsh </em>v. <em>Mountain Zephyr, Inc. </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 289, 297 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 493].) \u201cIt is the duty of an Appellate Court on its own motion to dismiss an appeal from an order which is not appealable.

Proc., \u00a7 577.) Generally, a judgment is final \u201c \u2018where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with\u2019 \u201d the order. <em>(Griset </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 688, 698 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 149, 23 P.3d 43] <em>(Griset).) </em>\u201c \u2018[B]ut where anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties, the decree is interlocutory.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 698-699.)</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The present appeal is from a single purported \u201cjudgment\u201d: the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment.\u201d That document states that judgment is made against defendants, jointly and severally, and sets forth $610,500 in compensatory damages plus interest and costs. However, the document also states that the court finds plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages in an amount \u201cto be assessed at a separate trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Under the general test in <em>Griset, </em>it seems quite clear that the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d was interlocutory. While a final judgment leaves no issue left for future consideration except compliance <em>(Griset, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 698), the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d did leave open an issue for future consideration: the amount of punitive damages. Determining the amount of punitive damages at a court trial seems quite clearly to be a type of \u201c \u2018judicial action on the part of the court\u2019 \u201d that is \u201c \u2018essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d was interlocutory.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">c. <em>Appellants \u2019 Contentions Are Unavailing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Appellants argue that if the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d was not final, \u201cthen respondent should not have been able to enforce that judgment until a final order issued.\u201d That may well be. But even if we accept appellants\u2019 contention that the subsequent enforcement orders were erroneous, that would not confer appealability on the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment.\u201d The merits of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>appeal cannot confer jurisdiction where it is lacking.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>(In re Frederick E. H. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 344, 348 [215 Cal.Rptr. 171].)</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Appellants argue the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d \u201cimplicitly\u201d refers to itself as the final judgment. But \u201c[a] paper filed in an action does not become a judgment merely because it is so entitled; it is a judgment only if it satisfies the criteria of a judgment....\u201d <em>(City of Shasta Lake </em>v. <em>County of Shasta </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1, 10 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 863]; cf. <em>Kurwa </em>v. <em>Kislinger </em>(2013) 57 Cal.4th 1097, 1107 [162 Cal.Rptr.3d 516, 309 P.3d 838] [\u201callowing the parties and trial court to designate a substantively interlocutory judgment as final and appealable \u2014 would be inconsistent with the one final judgment rule\u201d].)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Appellants also cite the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine but fail to explain why it would apply here. \u201cThe death knell doctrine permits the appellate court to review an order denying a motion to certify a class when it is unlikely the case will proceed as an individual action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Szetela v. Discover Bank </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1098 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 862].) The doctrine is \u201c \u2018a tightly defined and narrow concept\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Baycol Cases I &amp; II </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 751, 760 [122 Cal.Rptr.3d 153, 248 P.3d 681]), and we strongly doubt it has any application outside the class action context. Regardless, it is undisputed that the doctrine does not apply unless there is an order that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201camounts to a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 759.) The May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d is not such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Finally, appellants ask that we find any objections to the appealability of the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d were \u201cwaived.\u201d Jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon an appellate court by waiver. <em>(In re Marriage of Corona </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1205, 1216 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 17].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">d. <em>Liberal Construction of Appellants\u2019 Notices of Appeal Does Not Save the Invalid Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In arguing that we may review the judgment debtor and probate orders, appellants cite the rule that a \u201c \u2018notice of appeal shall be liberally construed in favor of its sufficiency [citation] ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Vibert v. Berger </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 65, 67 [48 Cal.Rptr. 886, 410 P.2d 390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">Appellants argue the rule of liberal construction applies in this case, because their notices of appeal were, at worst, \u201cpremature.\u201d They submit any flaw in the notices of appeal may be disregarded under <em>Groves v. Peterson </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 659, 666, footnote 2 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 164] <em>(Groves) </em>and <em>Bardin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1263, footnote 3 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 634] <em>(Bardin). </em>In <em>Groves </em>and <em>Bardin, </em>the appellants were attempting to challenge the trial court\u2019s sustaining of a demurrer. However, the notices of appeal incorrectly identified the order sustaining demurrer rather than correctly identifying the judgment dismissing the complaint pursuant to the sustained demurrer. In each case, the Court of Appeal excused the flaw. <em>(Bardin, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.4th at p. 1263, fn. 3; <em>Groves, supra, </em>100 Cal.App.4th at p. 666, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We need not decide whether we agree with <em>Bardin </em>and <em>Groves, </em>because they are distinguishable. The notices filed in the present case do not present \u201c \u2018a mere misdescription\u2019 of the judgment\u201d <em>(Glassco </em>v. <em>El Sereno Country Club, Inc. </em>(1932) 217 Cal. 90, 92 [17 P.2d 703]), but instead clearly and correctly identify a single order or judgment: the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment.\u201d Appellants would have us construe the notices of appeal, which identify one order, as a premature appeal from an entirely different order entered months later, which awarded $600,000 in punitive damages for the first time. But it is well \u201cbeyond liberal construction\u201d to view an appeal from one order as an appeal from a \u201cfurther and different order.\u201d <em>(Russell v. Foglio </em>(2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 653, 661 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 87].) \u201cDespite the rule favoring liberal interpretation of notices of appeal, a notice of appeal will not be considered adequate if it completely omits any reference to the judgment being appealed.\u201d <em>(Shiver, McGrane &amp; Martin </em>v. <em>Littell </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1041, 1045 [266 Cal.Rptr. 298].) \u201cThe rule favoring appealability in cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ambiguity cannot apply where there is a clear intention to appeal from only . . . one of two separate appealable judgments or orders. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Norman I. Krug Real Estate Investments, Inc. v. Praszker </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 35, 47 [269 Cal.Rptr. 228].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">e. <em>Our Conclusion Is Consistent with Analogous Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Our conclusion that the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d is not appealable is consistent with our decision in <em>Plaza Tulare </em>v. <em>Tradewell Stores, Inc. </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 522 [254 Cal.Rptr. 792] <em>{Plaza Tulare). </em>That case involved a dispute over the interpretation of a written lease. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 523.) The trial was bifurcated (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 598) with the issue of lease interpretation to be tried separately from damages. <em>{Plaza Tulare, supra, </em>at p. 523.) The respondents prevailed at the first trial regarding lease interpretation. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The appellants purported to appeal from the order adjudicating the issues presented at the first trial. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We noted that \u201c[a] positive verdict of liability in [a bifurcated] trial merely has the same status as a partial verdict or finding. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Plaza Tulare, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 524.) Consequently, we held that the adjudication of the issues in the first trial was an \u201cinterlocutory judgment\u201d and could not be appealed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, we dismissed the appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 525.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Appellants seek to distinguish <em>Plaza Tulare, </em>arguing that the present case did not involve a \u201cstipulated bifurcation.\u201d We see no legal significance to this distinction. Appealability of an adjudication turns on its \u201csubstance and effect.\u201d <em>(Otay River Constructors v. San Diego Expressway, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.4th at p. 801.) The procedural history leading up to the adjudication is relevant insofar as it informs this inquiry. But whether the \u201cbifurcation\u201d in this case was stipulated to or not is irrelevant because it does not change the fact that the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d left unresolved an issue essential to the final determination of the rights of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The appeal must be dismissed. (Cf. <em>Plaza Tulare, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at pp. 524-525.)</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">We understand the result in this case may seem harsh, as appellants are prevented from obtaining review of several unusual orders now and possibly ever.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> However, \u201c[t]his court is without power to bestow jurisdiction on itself . . . .\u201d <em>(Mid-Wilshire Associates v.

Even if it were determined that appellants were reasonably lured into thinking the May 20, 2013, \u201cjudgment\u201d was appealable due to an error on the part of the trial court, it would not alter our conclusion.

There the trial court allowed a second motion for new trial after denying the first. The Supreme Court held the trial court lost jurisdiction to do anything in the case after ruling on the first motion, making proceedings on the second a nullity. The time for appeal ran from the denial of the first motion, and the appellant was not entitled to relief from a tardy filing even if the trial court erroneously led the parties to believe it could rule on the second motion.
