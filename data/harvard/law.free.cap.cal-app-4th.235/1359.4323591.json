Appellant contends his prior conviction for receiving Jones\u2019s stolen car mandated the dismissal of the underlying action under Penal Code section 654, and that evidence of a 1974 incident of sexual misconduct was improperly admitted under Evidence Code section 1108; in addition, he maintains that his conviction for murder must be reversed due to insufficiency of the evidence and the ineffective assistance of his defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">In the published portion of this decision, we examine appellant\u2019s contentions under Penal Code section 654 and Evidence Code section 1108. Regarding the former, the focus of our discussion is on the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception to the rule regarding multiple prosecutions in Penal Code section 654, as annunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 510 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 115 P.3d 417] <em>(Davis). </em>We conclude that under the exception, in cases where the prosecution has probable cause to charge the defendant with murder and a related crime and proceeds only on the related crime, it is not thereafter barred from bringing the murder charge upon obtaining additional evidence if, at the time it declined to proceed, the prosecution lacked evidence supporting the objectively reasonable\" belief that it could secure a murder conviction on the evidence then available, despite the exercise of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>diligence in the investigation of the crimes. Regarding Evidence Code section 1108, we conclude that the admissibility of prior sexual misconduct under the statute does not hinge on whether there is sufficient independent evidence to prove that a sexual act occurred in the current case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">In the unpublished portion of this decision, we reject appellant\u2019s remaining contentions, with the exception of his challenge to the jury\u2019s special circumstance finding that he committed the murder during the commission, or attempted commission, of a kidnapping. Because that error was not prejudicial, we modify the judgment to strike the finding, and affirm the judgment, so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">RELEVANT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">In June 1985, an information was filed charging appellant with receiving stolen property (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> namely, Jones\u2019s car. In February 1986, after pleading guilty to the charge, appellant was sentenced to a prison term of three years eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">On December 16, 2011, an information was filed charging appellant with Jones\u2019s murder. Accompanying the charge were allegations (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)) that the murder was committed while appellant was engaged in the commission, or attempted commission, of robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5), kidnapping (\u00a7\u00a7 207, 209, 209.5), and rape (\u00a7 261). In addition, the information alleged that appellant had suffered a prior conviction for a serious felony (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)), and had been convicted of two prior felonies (\u00a7 1203, subd. (e)(4)). Appellant pleaded not guilty and denied the special allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Prior to trial, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action on the ground that it constituted a \u201cmultiple prosecution\u201d under section 654. Later, during the trial, the court dismissed the prior conviction allegations at the prosecution\u2019s request. After a jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder, and found all the murder-related special-circumstance allegations to be true, the trial court sentenced appellant to a term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">A. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">1. <em>Events Predating Jones\u2019s Murder</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1046-13\">In 1974, appellant lived near Linda Tulach\u2019s apartment in Long Beach. Tulach testified that on August 4, 1974, at approximately 4:00 a.m., she and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>her two-year-old son were in her apartment, sleeping in the same bed. At the sound of breaking glass, she awoke to see appellant holding a knife. He moved quickly to her bed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t scream, bitch.\u201d When she asked, \u201cDo you want money?\u201d he replied, \u201cNo, I want you.\u201d While holding the knife, appellant touched Tulach\u2019s breasts and thigh, and ran his hands under the bed\u2019s mattress, saying that he was looking for weapons. After permitting Tulach to remove her son from the bedroom, appellant disabled her telephone and began running his hands along the legs of a pair of Tulach\u2019s pants he found on her bed. Tulach saw that her front door was unlocked, grabbed her son, and fled to a neighboring apartment. Several days later, while shopping, Tulach saw appellant in a parking lot, flagged down a police officer, and pointed out appellant as the man who had broken into her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Debra Perry was appellant\u2019s \u201ccommon law . . . wife\u201d from 1977 to 1985. According to Perry, appellant was known as \u201cPlumber Joe,\u201d and he sold drugs obtained from Bill Brummet, who was a \u201cmajor drug supplier\u201d in Long Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">2. <em>Jones\u2019s Disappearance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">In April 1985, Martine Carcamo was dating Joanna Jones and living in an apartment building on Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach, near the Pacific Holiday Towers apartment complex. Jones sometimes spent weekends with Carcamo in his apartment. On the afternoon of April 28, 1985, Jones parked her blue Camaro close to his apartment and the Pacific Holiday Towers. After spending the night in Carcamo\u2019s apartment, Jones left for work the following morning, April 29, between 5:00 and 5:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Eugene Blackburn testified that in 1985, he worked as a security guard in the Pacific Holiday Towers. On April 29, 1985, his shift began at midnight and ended at 7:00 a.m. At 2:47 a.m., three people entered the building, one of whom signed the visitor sheet as \u201cJoe Spicer.\u201d According to Blackburn, between 5:00 and 5:30 a.m., the same person left the building \u201cgoing like a bat out of hell,\u201d and ran toward Ocean Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">After Jones left Carcamo\u2019s apartment, she failed to return his phone calls. He informed the police that she was missing. A few days later, while standing outside his apartment building, Carcamo saw Jones\u2019s Camaro pass by. The car was driven by appellant, and contained three other occupants. When Carcamo followed in his own car, appellant performed a U-turn and stopped. Carcamo also halted his car and yelled that he knew who owned the Camaro. The three passengers fled the Camaro on foot, and appellant drove away. Carcamo then reported to the police that he had seen Jones\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>On May 2, 1985, Long Beach Police Officer Paul Chastain and his partner responded to a call regarding Jones\u2019s potential kidnapping and stolen car. The officers located Jones\u2019s unoccupied Caxnaro parked at a market. The three passengers who fled from Carcamo were identified as Karen Zirpel, Lorraine McCrimmon, and Gerald Kuhnke, who then used the name \u201cJohn Rustin.\u201d The officers went to a nearby residence, where they saw appellant and Kuhnke. Although Kuhnke was detained, appellant fled from the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">Perry testified that after 11:00 p.m. on April 28, 1985, appellant left her apartment with two friends, and that she did not see him again until approximately 9:00 a.m. the following morning. On April 29, between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m., she walked to a convenience store with appellant, who pointed out a blue Camaro. He did not explain how he had obtained it. At some point, she saw appellant wipe down the car\u2019s interior. On May 2, Perry was arrested. Following her release, she had a phone conversation with appellant, who said that he was running from the police and that Brummet had \u201cset him up.\u201d They discussed the stolen Camaro and the related investigation into a potential murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">On May 8, when arrested at Perry\u2019s apartment, appellant said he had not killed the car\u2019s owner. Following his arrest, appellant made additional voluntary statements to Officer Chastain, who accompanied him to the police station. Appellant said that on April 29, at approximately 9:30 a.m., a man named \u201cSean\u201d offered the Camaro to him for the purpose of arranging its sale. Sean wanted $1,500 for the car, of which appellant would get $300. Appellant took possession of the car, although he was aware that it had probably been stolen. Later, when a man followed appellant while he was driving the Camaro, he decided to abandon it. Appellant told Officer Chastain that he had been \u201cset up\u201d for the homicide by Brummet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">On May 8, Long Beach Police Department Detective William Maclyman interviewed appellant. Appellant told Maclyman that Sean had asked him to try to sell the Camaro for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">3. <em>Discovery of Jones\u2019s Body</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">On June 8, 1985, several weeks after Jones\u2019s disappearance, hikers in Azusa Canyon smelled a foul odor from a drainage tunnel under the roadway. Looking into the tunnel, they observed a decomposing body, later identified as Jones\u2019s, and reported it. Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Sergeant Robert Perry, who responded to the discovery, found Jones\u2019s unclothed body inside a culvert under a rural road, approximately 48 miles from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>Carcamo\u2019s apartment. Jones lay on her back with her legs spread apart, each touching a side of the culvert. Other than a pair of shoes near her feet, no items of her clothing were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Two days later, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran performed an autopsy on Jones. Her body was decomposed, and showed maggot and animal activity. Dr. Sathyavagiswaran found an injury to her rib, as well as nine sharp force trauma injuries consistent with stab wounds to her neck, chest, and torso. Evidence of bleeding from the neck wounds supported the conclusion that she was alive when they occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">4. <em>Investigation (1985 through 1987)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">After appellant\u2019s arrest, fingerprints were lifted from the Camaro\u2019s exterior and its passenger area. Investigators also identified bloodstains on a mat and a cup holder found in the car\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">On October 3, 1985, Sergeant Perry interviewed appellant at his attorney\u2019s office. Appellant stated that on the evening of April 28, 1985, he bought some methamphetamine and visited two friends, Gineen Bertram and Dave Metcalf, in Bertram\u2019s apartment in the Pacific Holiday Towers. During the night, appellant briefly left the apartment to buy drugs, and returned. At 8:00 a.m. the following day, when appellant was walking on a street near the apartment to buy a soda, he encountered Sean, who was driving the Camaro, and asked appellant to arrange for its sale. Sean initially requested $2,500 for the car, but agreed to accept $500 or a quantity of methamphetamine. Appellant identified \u201cSean\u201d as Rick Castle, whom appellant characterized as a close associate of Brummet\u2019s. Appellant described Castle as a White male who walked with a limp due to a motorcycle accident. In addition, appellant maintained that Brummet wanted appellant off the streets, and had a bounty out on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">Following the interview, Sergeant Perry unsuccessfully tried to locate Castle. The fingerprints lifted from the Camaro were determined not to match those of Castle or Brummet. At some point, investigators conducted a search of Brummet\u2019s residence, but found no evidence regarding Jones\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">On January 17, 1987, Sergeant Perry again interviewed appellant, who was then in prison. Appellant stated he had sold drugs for Brummet, but fell out with Brummet. after he stole Brummet\u2019s gun. In 1984, Brummet threatened to kill him. Appellant further stated that he thought Brummet had \u201cset him up.\u201d According to appellant, Sean asked him to sell the Camaro for $2,500, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>required appellant to give him $500. Appellant also said that he abandoned the car because he was using it to transport drugs, and thought that Carcamo was a pursuing \u201cnarc officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">5. <em>Subsequent Investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">In December 2008, Jones\u2019s murder was assigned to Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department Detective Stephen Davis, whose focus was on \u201ccold cases.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">At some point in 2009, Detective Davis contacted Richard Castle. At trial, Castle denied knowing either appellant or Brummet; he also denied any involvement in Jones\u2019s murder and the theft of her car. According to Castle, in late 1984 or early 1985, he lived in Long Beach for two months, and suffered injuries in a motorcycle accident. After the accident, he and his roommate sometimes used methamphetamine. When Castle\u2019s roommate stole the settlement funds he had received following the accident, Castle moved to Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">On May 19, 2009, Detective Davis interviewed appellant at his home in Nevada.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant stated that in 1985, he was \u201creally involved in drugs.\u201d The night before he obtained the Camaro, he visited Metcalf and his girlfriend in her apartment in the Pacific Holiday Towers. The apartment overlooked the street area around the building. The next day, appellant left the apartment and went home. Appellant initially stated that a \u201cbig black dude\u201d brought the Camaro to him, but later said that the \u201cblack dude\u201d introduced him to Sean, who had the car. Appellant also said that he obtained the car during the evening. Although appellant suspected the car was stolen, he saw it as a \u201cway ... to make some quick money.\u201d Appellant said that he intended to sell the car to Brummet, who wanted it. Appellant recalled no threats against him by Brummet, but stated that they once had an argument regarding whether appellant should carry a gun while he sold drugs. Appellant further stated that he was familiar with the Azusa Canyon area, which he had visited <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">In October 2009, Detective Davis conducted a second interview of appellant, and obtained a DNA sample from him.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the interview, appellant stated that prior to obtaining the Camaro, he was acquainted with Sean, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>did not know his true name. Appellant further stated that he obtained the car when a \u201cblack dude\u201d and Sean brought it to him at a garage where he \u201cdealt.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">In August 2010, Detective Davis arranged for Gerald Kuhnke to testify during a grand jury proceeding related to appellant. When called as a witness in the trial below, Kuhnke testified that in 1985, he and Karen Zirpel were homeless in Long Beach, and often used methamphetamine. When arrested, Kuhnke usually provided the false names \u201cJohn Rustin\u2019\u2019 and \u201cJonathan Rustin\u2019\u2019 to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Kuhnke further testified that on one occasion, he and Zirpel were passengers in a Camaro driven by someone he knew as \u201cJoe the Plumber,\u201d who offered to sell it to them for $1,500. According to Kuhnke, Joe the Plumber said, \u201cI killed a girl and buried her\u201d in the hills or the woods.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sometime later, after fleeing from the car, Kuhnke was arrested. Kuhnke did not relate Joe the Plumber\u2019s statement to anyone else, including investigating detectives, because \u201c[he] was so freaked out\u201d by it, and he \u201cwanted away from [Joe the Plumber] as quickly as possible.\u201d Soon afterward, he and Zirpel moved to Wisconsin, where he \u201creclaimed [his] life\u201d and eventually became a Christian pastor. Kuhnke stated that the remark \u201cchanged [his] life.\u201d At trial, Kuhnke was unable to identify appellant as \u201cJoe the Plumber.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">In connection with the grand jury proceeding, Detective Davis obtained a court order permitting the monitoring of appellant\u2019s phone. Before and after appellant\u2019s niece testified in the grand jury proceeding, appellant and an unidentified male engaged in recorded phone conversations. During the conversations, the pair discussed questions addressed to the niece during the proceeding regarding her visits to Azusa Canyon with appellant. Appellant said, \u201cEverybody . . . knows where Azusa Canyon is . . . .\u201d \u201c[H]ell, I got more pussy in Azusa Canyon than . . . .\u201d He also said, \u201c[T]hey were asking her about... we ever went up to . . . the lake ... in Azusa Canyon but hell, I\u2019ve been up there a hundred thousand times, ... it was a hang out place, it was a party place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">In 2012, DNA testing disclosed that the bloodstains on the mat and cup holder from the Camaro\u2019s trunk were mixtures, consistent with at least two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>contributors. Jones\u2019s DNA matched the profile of the major contributor to the mixture found on the mat, and appellant was included as a possible minor contributor to that mixture. Jones and appellant were also possible contributors to the mixture on the cup holder. The methods used to conduct the analyses were unavailable in the 80\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">At trial, DNA expert Tiffany Shew testified regarding the \u201crandom match probability\u201d of the potential contributors to the bloodstains. Under that measure, which relies on ratios, the probability of a match increases with the denominator of the ratio. For Jones, the random match probabilities regarding the mixtures on the mat and the cup holder were one in 18,000,000,000 and one in 742,000, respectively. According to Shew, it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that Jones contributed to the bloodstains on the mat and the cup holder. For appellant, the analogous random match probabilities were one in 2,237 and one in 4,312. Shew stated that appellant could not be excluded as a contributor to the bloodstains.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">B. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">Gineen Bertram testified that in 1985, she lived in her mother\u2019s apartment in Long Beach, and was a heavy user of methamphetamine. She and her boyfriend David Metcalf knew appellant. According to Bertram, in April 1985, appellant once stayed overnight in her apartment. That evening, she and Metcalf went out drinking and picked up appellant, who was their drug supplier; the three then went to her apartment, where they spent the night doing drugs. Appellant left the apartment \u201ca couple of times\u201d to obtain more drugs. She stated: \u201c[H]e just left and came back. There was no big hurry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">Mary Volpe testified that in 1985, she was a drug user and knew appellant, whom she then called \u201cPlumber Joe.\u201d In April 1985, appellant once talked to Volpe\u2019s boyfriend regarding buying or selling a blue Camaro that appellant was driving. Volpe testified that appellant associated with a Black male who was \u201ca big dude.\u201d She did not know appellant to carry a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">Appellant contends (1) that the trial court erred in declining to dismiss the underlying action, (2) that the evidence of his prior sexual assault on Tulach was improperly admitted, (3) that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and (4) that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance. As explained below, we reject his contentions, with the exception of his challenge to the special circumstance finding that the murder was committed during the commission, or attempted commission, of a kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>A. <em>Propriety of Underlying Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">Appellant maintains that under the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution and section 654, the trial court was obliged to dismiss the underlying action, in view of his 1986 conviction for receiving Jones\u2019s stolen Camaro. Because the double jeopardy clause and section 654 support distinct claims regarding multiple prosecutions, we address them separately. <em>(In re Dennis B. </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 687, 691 [135 Cal.Rptr. 82, 557 P.2d 514] <em>(Dennis B.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">1. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">We begin with appellant\u2019s contention predicated on double jeopardy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Generally, the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution operates as a restraint on prosecutors and the courts. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fields </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 289, 298-299 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 282, 914 P.2d 832].) \u201cThe double jeopardy proscription . . . protects persons from being consecutively charged with violation of the same law or violation of laws so related that conduct prohibited by one statute is necessarily included within conduct prohibited by the other.\u201d <em>(Dennis B., supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 691.) The \u201cappropriate yardstick\u201d for that determination is the so-called \u201celements test,\u201d which is based on a statutory comparison of the crimes. <em>9Scott, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 795-796; see <em>People v. Kelley </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 568, 576 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 653] [for purposes of assessing existence of double jeopardy, the test \u201cis whether each offense contains an element the other does not\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Under the elements test, appellant\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property was separate and independent from the murder charged against him in the underlying prosecution. That charge was tried on theories of premeditated murder and felony murder predicated on the commission, or attempted commission, of kidnapping, robbery, and rape. Each theory constitutes a distinct offense, for purposes of double jeopardy. (See <em>People v. Wilson </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 839, 848-849 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 883] [under double jeopardy clause, premeditated murder and felony murder are different crimes]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 550, 572-573 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 967 P.2d 29] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>[under double jeopardy clause, predicate felony is element of felony murder].) None of the theories is a lesser included offense of receiving stolen property, as each requires a killing. Conversely, receiving stolen property is included within none of those theories. An item of stolen property is not required for them, with the exception of felony murder based on robbery, and it is otherwise well established that receiving stolen property is not a lesser included offense of robbery <em>(People v. Mora </em>(1956) 139 Cal.App.2d 266, 274 [293 P.2d 522]). In sum, the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution did not bar the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">2. <em>Section 654</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">We turn to appellant\u2019s contention predicated on section 654. As elaborated below (see pt. A.2.C., <em>post), </em>that contention relies primarily on the evidence available to the prosecution in 1985, as well as the prosecution\u2019s concession before the trial court that in 1985, there was probable cause to have charged appellant with Jones\u2019s murder.

Generally, the double jeopardy proscription is inapplicable when the prosecution \u201c \u2018is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1188, 1202 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 240, 939 P.2d 354], quoting <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>(1990) 495 U.S. 508, 516, fn. 7 [109 L.Ed.2d 548, 110 S.Ct. 2084], overruled on other grounds in <em>United States v.

There, the defendant commandeered a car using a gun, kidnapped the driver, and took his belongings and car. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>at p. 518.) The defendant was later arrested while driving the car. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the incident, the victim was unable to identify the defendant as the perpetrator, and the defendant pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of taking a motor vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 558.) Later, after serving a sentence for that crime, the defendant told a third party how he had obtained the car. <em>(Ibid.) </em>As a result, he was prosecuted for robbery and kidnapping. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 556.) Applying the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception, the Supreme Court held that section 654 did not bar that action, concluding that at the time of the defendant\u2019s initial conviction, neither the victim nor any other witness could have established that he had kidnapped and robbed the victim. (Davis, <em>supra, </em>at p. 558.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Here, we confront an issue regarding the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception not addressed in <em>Davis, </em>namely, the quantum of evidence constituting the prosecution\u2019s possession of \u201cfacts necessary to sustain [the charge].\u201d As noted above, the exception is triggered only when the prosecution, despite due diligence, first acquires facts of that kind <em>after </em>the initial conviction. Appellant argues that the exception was not triggered because in 1985, when the prosecution charged appellant with receiving stolen property, it had \u201call the facts necessary to sustain a murder conviction.\u201d In support, he cites the prosecution\u2019s acknowledgment that once Jones\u2019s body was discovered, there was probable cause to have charged him with murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">The issue before us thus implicates the prosecution\u2019s discretion regarding the charging of crimes. The prosecution may not charge a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>without \u201cprobable cause,\u201d that is, evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the crime. <em>(Rideout </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 471, 473 [62 Cal.Rptr. 581, 432 P.2d 197].) That showing \u201cneed not be sufficient to support a conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 474.) However, when the prosecution has probable cause to charge a crime, the decision to do so is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <em>(Valli, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th at p. 801.) As our Supreme Court has explained, notwithstanding the constitutional guarantees of due process and a speedy trial, \u201c[a] court should not second-guess the prosecution\u2019s decision regarding whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant bringing charges.\u201d <em>(People v.

Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion to dismiss the action under section 654, contending that at the time of his conviction for receiving stolen property, \u201cthe prosecution was or should have been aware [of] the instant case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">The prosecution\u2019s opposition relied on the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception set forth in <em>Davis, </em>stating: \u201c[T]he various agencies involved in the disappearance and murder of . . . Jones acted with due diligence. By the time Jones\u2019[s] body was found . . . , there was no doubt probable cause to arrest [appellant] for Jones\u2019[s] murder. Additionally, there was sufficient evidence to charge [him] .... However, despite the best efforts of investigators from three different agencies, sufficient evidence had not been developed to meet the prosecution\u2019s burden at trial \u2014 proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The prosecution maintained that following appellant\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property, three critical items of evidence had been acquired: appellant\u2019s 2009 interviews, which conflicted with his earlier accounts of the relevant events; appellant\u2019s 2010 phone conversations regarding his familiarity with Azusa Canyon as a place for getting \u201cpussy\u201d; and the results of the DNA testing regarding the contributors to the bloodstains on the items in the Camaro\u2019s trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>At the pretrial hearing on appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court considered the testimony from the preliminary hearing and the then available results of the DNA testing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In denying the motion, the court concluded that after 2008, the prosecution acquired \u201cnew evidence . . . [n]ot triggered by a failure to investigate the first time\u201d that supported \u201can objectively reasonable belief of the probability of a conviction\u201d by a jury applying the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof. The court stated that appellant\u2019s 2009 interviews raised the reasonable inference that he lied to investigators in 1985, as they \u201ccompletely contradict[ed]\u201d some of his prior statements; in addition, the court stated that the 2010 phone conversations disclosed appellant\u2019s familiarity with Azusa Canyon as a place to \u201chave sex.\u201d The court acknowledged that the DNA testing did not conclusively establish that appellant contributed to the bloodstains on the items in the Camaro\u2019s trunk, but noted that the testing represented \u201cnew technology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">c. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">As explained below, we discern no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. To the extent appellant challenges the court\u2019s determinations of law regarding the application of the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception, we examine those determinations de novo. (See <em>In re R.L. </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1339, 1343, fn. 4 [88 Cal.Rptr.3d 854].) To the extent appellant challenges the court\u2019s factual determinations relating to the exception, we review those determinations for the existence of substantial evidence. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 558; <em>Barriga </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 739, 748 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 110].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">Our research has disclosed no decision addressing the court\u2019s key legal determination, namely, that the exception applies when the prosecution exercised due diligence in its investigation and had probable cause to charge a defendant with murder in conjunction with a closely related crime, but deferred filing the murder charge until it acquired evidence supporting the objectively reasonable belief that it could sustain a murder conviction. Nonetheless, we find guidance from <em>U.S. v. Stearns </em>(9th Cir. 1983) 707 F.2d 391 <em>(Stearns).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Although <em>Stearns </em>addressed a claim of double jeopardy, our Supreme Court cited <em>Stearns </em>with approval in holding that the rule regarding multiple prosecutions under section 654 is subject to the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>exception to the double jeopardy proscription. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 558.) In <em>Stearns, </em>a married couple disappeared in 1974 after anchoring their yacht in the lagoon of an uninhabited atoll. <em>(Stearns, supra, </em>707 F.2d at p. 392.) Several months later, the yacht was discovered in the possession of the defendants, who had repainted it and registered it under a new name. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Following their arrest, they claimed that the married couple had drowned, and offered conflicting explanations regarding how they acquired the yacht. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Suspecting foul play, investigators searched the atoll and lagoon, but found no evidence regarding the married couple\u2019s fate. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.) In 1981, after the defendants had been convicted of theft, the missing woman\u2019s skull and a box containing one of her bones were discovered underwater near the atoll, and tests revealed that her bones had been subjected to \u201chigh temperatures.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 392.) The defendants were thereafter charged with felony murder. <em>(Ibid.) </em>After the trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the action on the basis of double jeopardy, the Ninth Circuit determined that the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception was applicable because the prosecution had exercised due diligence in its early investigation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 394.) In so concluding, the Ninth Circuit stated that due diligence did not require the use of \u201cextraordinary\u201d methods: \u201cA more thorough search may have been possible. ... A complete search of the lagoon, however, would have required ... an extraordinary amount of time, effort, and money.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\"><em>Steams </em>is instructive regarding the relationship between the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception and prosecutorial discretion regarding the charging of crimes. Its analysis reflects a determination that the prosecution\u2019s having possessed facts raising a suspicion of \u201cfoul play\u201d prior to the defendants\u2019 initial convictions did not bar the application of the exception. In addition, it reflects a determination that the prosecution\u2019s delay in obtaining evidence reasonably likely to sustain a murder conviction did not preclude the exception\u2019s application, as the prosecution displayed ordinary diligence in its initial investigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>We agree with the trial court that for purposes of applying the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception to the rule in section 654, the prosecution first possesses \u201cfacts necessary to sustain [the] charge\u201d when it secures evidence supporting the objectively reasonable belief that it \u201c \u2018will be able to promptly establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nelson, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at p. 1256). Thus, the exception applies when the prosecution, though having probable cause to charge a defendant with murder and a related crime, declines to file the murder charge prior to the defendant\u2019s conviction for the related crime because it lacks facts to support the objectively reasonable belief that it can prove the murder charge at trial, despite due diligence in the investigation of the crimes. To hold otherwise would be to encourage prosecutors to overcharge \u2014 by filing charges they lacked an objectively reasonable basis to believe would result in conviction \u2014 thus improperly cabining the prosecutorial discretion that is a basic element of the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">That discretion is not unlimited. In the relatively few cases where the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception is invoked, the court must decide whether the exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to have pursued the later-filed charges was reasonable. For the reasons we next discuss, we discern no error in the trial court\u2019s .determination that the evidence supporting an objectively reasonable belief that appellant would be convicted of Jones\u2019s murder was not within the prosecution\u2019s possession in 1985 and could not have been obtained despite due diligence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Appellant contends the prosecution acquires \u201cfacts necessary to sustain [the charge]\u201d when it obtains evidence sufficient to support a determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>guilt on appeal, that is, when it has substantial evidence of guilt, for purposes of appellate review. We disagree. As noted above, the focus of the prosecution\u2019s assessment is whether it \u201c \u2018will be able to promptly establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d at <em>trial. (Nelson, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at p. 1256.) In a criminal proceeding, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he functions of the jury include the determination of the credibility of witnesses, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of justifiable inferences of fact from proven facts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ross </em>(1953) 120 Cal.App.2d 882, 886 [262 P.2d 343], quoting <em>Curley </em>v. <em>U.S. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1947) 81 U.S. App.D.C. 389 [160 F.2d 229, 232].) In contrast, on review for the existence of substantial evidence, appellate courts \u201cdetermine, without reweighing the evidence, whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to convict.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Salgado </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 5, 15 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 373].) Accordingly, the prosecution, in determining whether its evidence will sustain a charge at trial, must assess the weight of that evidence, a consideration not implicated in appellate review. We decline to construe the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception to impose upon the prosecution a yardstick for assessing evidence fundamentally unrelated to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion regarding the charging of crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">Applying the \u201cobjectively reasonable belief\u2019 standard above, we conclude that the trial court did not err in finding that the exception, so understood, was applicable in the underlying action. In 1985, prior to appellant\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property, the prosecution had evidence establishing \u201cprobable cause\u201d regarding Jones\u2019s murder, that is, evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion that appellant committed the crime. That evidence was provided by appellant\u2019s abrupt departure from the Pacific Holiday Towers at approximately the time Jones left Carcamo\u2019s apartment, appellant\u2019s possession of the Camaro shortly after her disappearance, and his subsequent conduct, including his flight from investigating officers prior to his arrest. In addition, appellant\u2019s prior sexual assault potentially linked him to Jones\u2019s murder, as there was evidence that she had been sexually assaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Nonetheless, despite diligent investigation, the prosecution lacked evidence regarding certain key issues, namely, when Jones was murdered, why she was taken to Azusa Canyon, and how and when she was taken there. That evidence was required to rebut appellant\u2019s theory that someone else \u2014 for example, Brummet \u2014 kidnapped Jones, gave her car to Sean, and murdered her. Those gaps in the prosecution\u2019s evidence were filled after 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">The trial court reasonably concluded that the newly developed evidence was not the result of a prior failure of due diligence. In December 2008, Jones\u2019s murder was assigned to Detective Davis, who reinvestigated \u201ccold cases.\u201d The initial items of new evidence that Davis developed could not have been obtained prior to appellant\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen goods, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>namely, appellant\u2019s 2009 accounts of his acquisition of Jones\u2019s car, which differed materially from the accounts he provided in 1985 and 1986. After obtaining that evidence, Davis also sought DNA testing, which appellant does not dispute represented \u201cnew technology,\u201d and which strongly suggested that Jones and appellant contributed to the bloodstains on the items found in the Camaro\u2019s trunk. Moreover, Davis secured appellant\u2019s 2010 recorded phone conversations, in which he revealed his familiarity with Azusa Canyon as a place for having sex. As those conversations were directly prompted by the 2010 grand jury proceeding, nothing before us suggests that a similar wiretap in 1985 or 1986 would have produced that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">The newly acquired evidence provided concrete support for the theory that appellant murdered Jones in Azusa Canyon on the morning of April 29, 1985, just hours before he displayed the Camaro to Perry, his common law wife. To begin, the evidence showed that in all likelihood, Jones was transported while alive to Azusa Canyon in the Camaro\u2019s trunk on that morning. Although the DNA evidence itself did not conclusively identify appellant as the murderer, it strongly suggested that Jones had contributed to the bloodstains on the items from the Camaro\u2019s trunk, and thus rendered it likely that she had been transported to Azusa Canyon in the trunk. Furthermore, she probably was alive before arriving there, as she died of neck wounds inflicted by a knife or similar weapon, yet the trunk disclosed little blood. In view of other evidence that appellant openly drove the Camaro from the time he displayed it to Perry until his arrest, the DNA evidence showed that Jones probably died before Perry first saw the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The newly acquired evidence also placed the spotlight on appellant as Jones\u2019s murderer. The 2009 interviews supported the reasonable inference that appellant had lied in 1985 regarding how he obtained the Camaro. From 1985 to 1987, appellant maintained he obtained the car from Sean, an acquaintance he encountered on the street on the morning of April 29. He attributed Jones\u2019s death and the theft of her car to Brummet, with whom he claimed to have an antagonistic relationship, and posited that Brummet had \u201cset him up\u201d for the murder. In contrast, in 2009, appellant said he did not receive the car until the evening of April 29, that a \u201cbig black dude\u201d brought the car to his attention, and that the transfer took place in a garage. Further contradicting his earlier statements, he claimed that he intended to sell the car to Brummet, with whom he enjoyed an essentially good relationship. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s unsolicited statements recorded in the 2010 phone conversation supported the reasonable inference that appellant took Jones to Azusa Canyon because it was a place he went to have sex. The new evidence thus provided material support for the theory that appellant committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>Appellant contends that in 1985, the prosecution possessed evidence sufficient to sustain a murder conviction against him. Aside from the facts discussed above, he relies on certain remarks he made when arrested, namely, that he did not kill \u201cthat girl\u201d or \u201canyone.\u201d He argues that his flight from police officers prior to his arrest showed a \u201cconsciousness of guilt,\u201d and that his remarks upon arrest demonstrated knowledge of Jones\u2019s death before the discovery of her body. However, viewed in context, those items of evidence supported no compelling inference that he murdered Jones. Prior to appellant\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property, the prosecution knew that appellant claimed to have been aware that the Camaro was stolen when he obtained it from Sean. For that reason, a jury was likely to regard appellant\u2019s flight as manifesting only his awareness that he had received stolen goods. In addition, the prosecution was aware that prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, he had talked to Perry, who then knew from her own arrest that there was an investigation into the potential murder of the girl who owned the Camaro. A jury was thus likely to have concluded that appellant\u2019s prearrest contact with Perry nullified the inference that he knew of a potential murder only because he was the murderer. Accordingly, in 1985, the prosecution reasonably concluded that appellant\u2019s flight and remarks would not result in a murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Appellant also contends that in 1985, the prosecution did not exercise due diligence in investigating Jones\u2019s murder because it could have, but failed, to secure Kuhnke\u2019s evidence regarding Joe the Plumber\u2019s remark that he had killed a girl. Pointing to a police report regarding Kuhnke\u2019s arrest, appellant maintains that officers never adequately questioned Kuhnke regarding the stolen Camaro. The report states that upon arrest, Kuhnke and Zirpel \u201cdenied knowledge of the car being stolen until confronted by [Carcamo]. They then became suspicious and fled.\u201d To show that Kuhnke never was interrogated or queried, appellant relies on the report, which states that on May 2, 1985, when booked, Kuhnke and Zirpel \u201cwere not questioned about the stolen car, but . . . made several voluntary statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">The record does not establish that the prosecution failed to obtain Kuhnke\u2019s evidence in 1985 due to a lack of diligence. In fact, the record shows that Kuhnke was interviewed by two different officers \u2014 Officer Chastain and Detective Maclyman \u2014 after his arrest, and that Maclyman\u2019s interview with Kuhnke took place on May 3, 1985, after Kuhnke was booked. Furthermore, Kuhnke\u2019s testimony established that in 1985, it was unlikely he would have disclosed the remark, regardless of how he was questioned. In addition to Kuhnke\u2019s admission that he then often lied to police to protect himself, he explained that he had not revealed the remark to the investigating detectives or anyone else because it \u201cfreaked [him] out\u201d and he just \u201cwanted away from him as quickly as possible.\u201d Indeed, shortly thereafter he moved to Wisconsin. According to Kuhnke, the remark triggered a change in his life, and \u201cscared [him] straight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>Appellant further suggests that the prosecution failed to secure three other items of evidence in 1985 for want of diligence. He argues (1) that it was not until 2009 that investigating officers learned from Perry that appellant often carried a knife, even though they interviewed her in 1985, and (2) that in 1985, appellant\u2019s knowledge of the Azusa Canyon area could have been discovered through a search of public records or a wiretap. Although appellant does not dispute that the DNA evidence submitted at trial was unavailable in 1985, he also argues (3) that certain tests then possible might have established that the bloodstains on the items found in the Camaro\u2019s trunk were \u201cconsistent\u201d with his blood. We reject these contentions. Because knives are common and easily acquired, appellant\u2019s possession of a knife would not have materially enhanced the evidence available in 1985, had the prosecution then known that fact. Furthermore, it is speculation that in 1985, the prosecution had sufficient legal basis to obtain a wiretap, and that such a wiretap \u2014 or public records \u2014 would have disclosed the salient information obtained in 2010, namely, that appellant knew Azusa Canyon as a place to have sex. Finally, nothing in the record shows that the blood tests specified by appellant would have identified him \u2014 or Jones \u2014 in any meaningful way as a contributor to the bloodstains. In sum, the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion under section 654 to dismiss the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">B. <em>Admission ofTulach\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting Tulach\u2019s testimony under Evidence Code section 1108.

The ensuing trial often presents conflicting versions of the event and requires the trier of fact to make difficult credibility determinations. [Evidence Code s]ection 1108 provides the trier of fact in a sex offense case the opportunity to learn of the defendant\u2019s possible disposition to commit sex crimes. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Falsetta, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 915.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Evidence Code Section 1108 marks a departure from Evidence Code section 1101, which limits the admission of prior criminal conduct. As our Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[b]efore [Evidence Code] section 1108 was enacted, Evidence Code section 1101 governed the admission of prior criminal conduct, and a body of law developed concerning how similar the prior conduct had to be to the charged crime; the required degree of similarity varied depending on the use for which the evidence was offered. [Citation.] \u2018All of that radically changed with respect to sex crime prosecutions with the advent of section 1108. . . .

It is enough the charged and uncharged offenses are sex offenses as defined in section 1108.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Loy </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 46, 63 [127 Cal.Rptr.3d 679, 254 P.3d 980] <em>(Loy).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">2. <em>Underlying Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Prior to trial, the prosecution sought leave to present testimony from Tulach regarding the 1974 incident, during which appellant entered her apartment at night, touched her breast and thigh, and said that he wanted her, rather than money. In opposing the request, appellant maintained that the 1974 incident was insufficiently similar to Jones\u2019s murder, relying in part on decisions predating the enactment of Evidence Code section 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The court concluded that Tulach\u2019s testimony was admissible under Evidence Code section 1108, subject to certain restrictions intended to limit potential prejudice to appellant. The court determined that Tulach\u2019s testimony was \u201chighly probative\u201d regarding a central issue, namely, whether appellant raped or attempted to rape Jones. Furthermore, to the extent the prosecution sought to admit the evidence to resolve that issue, the court concluded the 1974 incident was not overly remote, and there was no substantial danger of undue prejudice. Nonetheless, the court determined that the 1974 incident was inadmissible regarding another \u201cbottom line\u201d issue, namely, the identity of Jones\u2019s assailant. To preclude prejudice to appellant, the court stated that it would give a jury instruction specifying the issues for which Tulach\u2019s testimony could be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">Following the presentation of evidence at trial, the court instructed the jury with a modified version of CALCRIM No. 1191, which stated that if the jury found appellant had committed the uncharged crimes in 1974, it was permitted, but not required, to conclude that appellant acted with the intent to commit felony murder predicated on rape, had a scheme or plan to do so, or was disposed or inclined to commit sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Appellant\u2019s principal contention is that the trial court erred in admitting Tulach\u2019s testimony because the 1974 incident was too dissimilar, and too remote in time, from Jones\u2019s murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-11\">In <em>People v. Robertson </em>(2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 965, 970 [146 Cal.Rptr.3d 66], the defendant was charged with kidnap for rape and related offenses. The evidence at trial showed that in 2009, the defendant lured his victim into a garage, locked it, and sexually assaulted her. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 972-973.) The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>also admitted evidence under Evidence Code section 1108 that approximately 34 years earlier, in 1974, the defendant committed a rape and kidnapping. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.4th at pp. 987-988, 992.) During that incident, the defendant picked up a hitchhiker, drove her to an isolated field, and raped her. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In affirming the admission of the 1974 incident, the appellate court rejected a contention that the prior incident was too remote, stating that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[substantial similarities between the prior and the charged offenses balance out the remoteness of the prior offenses.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 992.) Applying that standard, the appellate court determined that the similarities between the 1974 and 2009 crimes were sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 992-994.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">We reach the same conclusion here. During each incident, appellant attacked a woman and took action to isolate his victim. Furthermore, each incident commenced in the early morning, and took place in, or otherwise involved, the same area of Long Beach. In view of those similarities, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of the 1974 incident, even though it occurred 11 years prior to the crimes charged against appellant in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Appellant also contends that the court erred in admitting the 1974 incident under Evidence Code section 1108 because there was little other evidence that Jones was, in fact, subject to a sexual assault, or attempted sexual assault, aside from her lack of clothing when discovered. He argues that \u201cevidence that the defendant committed other sex crimes is not admissible under [Evidence Code] section 1108 unless, independent of that evidence, there is sufficient evidence to prove that a sexual act occurred in the current case.\u201d For the reasons discussed in the unpublished portion of this opinion, the 1974 incident was properly admitted to resolve the key issue regarding a sexual offense presented at trial, namely, whether appellant, in attacking Jones, acted with intent to commit a rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">Nothing in Evidence Code section 1108 suggests that prior sexual misconduct is admissible only if there is sufficient independent evidence that the currently charged sex crime actually involved a \u201csex act.\u201d On the contrary, the statute authorizes the admission of such misconduct in criminal actions in which the defendant is \u201caccused\u201d of enumerated sexual offenses, including attempted rape and other attempted sex crimes. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1108, subds. (a), (d)(1)(A), (F).) Evidence Code section 1108 thus permits the admission of prior sexual misconduct to establish charged offenses that require no accomplished \u201csex act,\u201d such as attempted rape <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 948 [131 Cal.Rptr.3d 225, 261 P.3d 243] [attempted rape requires only conduct exceeding mere preparation showing that defendant put plan into action]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>Furthermore, under the circumstances presented here, the trial court did not err in admitting appellant\u2019s prior sexual misconduct. Evidence Code section 1108 authorizes the trial court to admit such misconduct \u201c \u2018 <em>\u201cfor any relevant </em>purpose,\u201d \u2019 \u201d without engaging in the purpose-specific analysis required under Evidence Code section 1101. <em>(Loy, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at p. 63, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>James </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1353, fn. 7 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 823], disapproved on another ground in <em>Loy, supra, </em>52 Cal.4th at pp. 73-74.) Under the latter statute, the target purpose dictates the degree of similarity between prior and current offenses required for admissibility. \u201cThe least degree of similarity ... is required in order to prove intent.\u201d <em>(People v. Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 402 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].) In contrast, \u201c[t]he greatest degree of similarity is required ... to prove identity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 403.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Although the trial court admitted the 1974 incident under Evidence Code section 1108, its carefully considered ruling was informed by Evidence Code section 1101, as the court referred to the stringent standard for proof of identity under the latter statute in limiting the use of the 1974 incident. Under Evidence Code section 1101, evidence of a prior sexual offense is admissible to show that the defendant\u2019s conduct underlying the currently charged sexual offense was, in fact, performed with the requisite sexual intent. In <em>People v. Daniels </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 304 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 659] <em>(Daniels), </em>the defendant was charged with kidnapping for rape. At trial, the evidence showed that in 2005, the defendant encountered his intoxicated and essentially unconscious victim outside a bar and transported her to his motel room, where he placed her on the bed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 308-309.) Soon after, she awoke and fled. (Id. at p. 309.) Under Evidence Code section 1101, the prosecution was permitted to establish that in 1990, the defendant committed a rape after breaking into his victim\u2019s house. In affirming the defendant\u2019s conviction, the appellate court held that the 1990 rape had been properly admitted under Evidence Code section 1101, concluding that \u201c[t]he 1990 events and the 2005 events were sufficiently similar to support an inference that defendant acted with the same intent on both occasions.\u201d <em>(Daniels, supra, 176 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Although <em>Daniels </em>examined the application of Evidence Code section 1101, its holding establishes the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling under Evidence Code section 1108.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Daniels </em>demonstrates that Evidence Code section 1101 permits the admission of prior sexual misconduct to show the defendant\u2019s sexual intent with respect to the charged offense. In our view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>because Evidence Code section 1108 was intended to enhance the admissibility of prior misconduct when sexual offenses are charged, the same is true for that section. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting the 1974 incident to establish appellant\u2019s intent, and thereby show that his acts were, in fact, a sexual assault, or attempted sexual assault. (See <em>People v. Wilson </em>(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1034, 1043-1054 [83 Cal.Rptr.3d 326] [under Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a71101, 1108, trial court properly instructed jury that it could consider defendant\u2019s demonstrated sexual misconduct to establish his intent regarding other charged sex crimes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Appellant contends the trial court improperly assessed the potential for prejudice under Evidence Code section 352, arguing that evidence of the uncharged crimes was prejudicial in light of the jury instructions. The trial court instructed the jury with a modified version of CALCRIM No. 1191, which stated that if the jury found appellant had committed the uncharged crimes in 1974, it was permitted, but not required, to conclude that appellant acted with the intent to commit felony murder predicated on rape, had a scheme or plan to do so, or was disposed or inclined to commit sexual offenses. Appellant argues that the instruction permitted the jury to consider the evidence for an improper purpose, namely, to determine the identity of Jones\u2019s assailant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">CALCRIM No. 1191, as provided to the jury, stated: \u201cIf you conclude that the defendant committed the uncharged offenses, that conclusion is only one factor to consider along with all the other evidence. It is <em>not </em>sufficient by itself to prove that <em>the defendant </em>is guilty of murder or that the rape special circumstance is true. The People must still prove each charge and allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. [\u00b6] Do <em>not </em>consider this evidence for any other purpose except for the limited purpose as stated above.\u201d (Italics added.) Accordingly, the instruction, viewed as a whole, directed the jury to look at the other trial evidence to determine whether appellant was Jones\u2019s assailant <em>before </em>determining his culpability under a felony murder theory predicated on rape. We presume the jury followed the instruction. <em>(People v. Delgado </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 312, 331 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 529, 851 P.2d 811].)

Scott </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 784, 792 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 70] <em>(Scott).) </em>Nonetheless, we address the contention on the merits because appellant maintains that his defense counsel\u2019s failure to assert the defense constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitcham </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1027, 1044, fn. 5 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 230, 824 R2d 1277]; <em>Scott, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 792.) As we conclude that double jeopardy principles did not bar the underlying action, no ineffective assistance is shown. <em>(Scott, supra, </em>83 Cal.App.4th at p. 797.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1054-9\"> Subdivision (a) of section 654 states: \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. An acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1054-10\"> For purposes of the rule, the determination regarding the existence of a course of conduct differs from the analogous determination relevant to the prohibition in section 654 against multiple punishment. <em>(Kellett, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 827.) To apply the rule, courts have adopted two different tests to determine a course of conduct. <em>(People v. Valli </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 786, 797 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 335] <em>(Valli).) </em>The first examines the extent to which crimes are separate in time and location, and the second examines the extent to which they require \u201cseparate proofs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 797-802.) Here, the parties do not dispute that appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number>1986 conviction for receiving Jones\u2019s stolen Camaro was predicated on a single course of conduct that included her murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1057-9\"> It appears that the DNA testing results before the court were preliminary findings, rather than the final findings presented at trial. Those preliminary findings nonetheless supported the reasonable inference that Jones and appellant were \u201cpossible\u201d contributors. In asserting the motion under section 654, appellant acknowledged that his DNA was on the cup holder and mat found in the Camaro\u2019s trunk.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1058-6\"> We also find guidance from <em>Valli, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.4th 786. Although <em>Valli </em>does not address the \u201cunavailable evidence\u201d exception to the rule against multiple prosecution in section 654, it establishes that the rule is properly construed in light of the prosecutor\u2019s discretion regarding the charging of crimes. There, following a murder, a witness identified the defendant as the perpetrator to officers who responded to the crime. (187 Cal.App.4th at p. 791.) The day after the murder, other officers on patrol saw the defendant in a van, and, after a lengthy high-speed chase, arrested him. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 791-792.) After the defendant was acquitted of murder, he was charged in a separate action with felony evading. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 792-793.) The trial court denied his motion under section 654 to dismiss that action, concluding that the murder and the evading did not constitute a single course of action. <em>(Valli, supra, </em>at p. 793.) In affirming on that ground, the appellate court rejected the contention that section 654 mandated the joinder of the murder and evading charges in a single action because the prosecution had full knowledge of the facts of both crimes. <em>(Valli, supra, </em>at pp. 794\u2014802.) The appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>stated: \u201cThe decision as to appropriate charges is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. \u2018[P]rosecutorial discretion is basic to the framework of the California criminal justice system.
