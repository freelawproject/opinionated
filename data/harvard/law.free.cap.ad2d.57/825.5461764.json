The examination shall proceed at the place designated in the order under review, at a time to be fixed by plaintiff in a written notice of not less than 10 days, to be given within 20 days after entry of the order to be made hereon, or at such other time and place as the parties may agree. In our view the discovery ordered by Special Term was too broad, under the circumstances of this case, to the extent indicated herein. Cohalan, Acting P. J., Hawkins, Suozzi and Mollen, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
