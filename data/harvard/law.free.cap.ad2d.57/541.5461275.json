Appeals from the decisions dismissed. No appeal lies from a decision. Appeal from the order dated April 29, 1976 dismissed. That order was superseded by the order made on reargument. Order dated September 15, 1976 reversed insofar as appealed from, and motion to dismiss the complaint denied. Plaintiffs are awarded one bill of $50 costs and disbursements to cover all appeals. Anson J. Fowler died in 1923. C. Fred Fowler was appointed as one of the coexecutors and trustees of the estate. The statement of account was submitted in 1943 and, in 1945, the plaintiffs, beneficiaries of the estate, released the executors from any further liability with respect thereto and assigned any remaining right, title and interest in the assets of Anson J. Fowler to C. Fred Fowler. Due to a land title recording error which took place in 1904, and was discovered in 1969, the plaintiffs uncovered the alleged fraud, a misrepresentation of the assets of a corporation wholly owned by Anson Fowler. The alleged concealment involves some 25 transactions dealing with the delivery of deeds or satisfactions of mortgage by the corporation. The 1943 accounting statement refers to the corporation and states: \"This Executor is not familiar with the books of the Newburgh-Walden Realty Co. except as disclosed by the aforesaid audit and what information has been secured from time to time from various memorandas <em>[sic] &amp; </em>information furnished by the secretary or secretary\u2019s assistant in charge of the books, and gathered in the usual course of the Estate\u2019s business. He has, however, always acted in an advisory capacity in the conduct of its affairs and has done a good deal of work to further its interests, and has made financial advances to it, both from the Estate\u2019s account and from his own account. Only a complete audit of the books of the Newburgh-Walden Realty Co., in the opinion of the Executor, can a complete picture of the A.J. Fowler Estate be secured. This Executor, however, is of the firm opinion that there is no equity in the Newburgh-Walden Realty Co. which would result in any value to the Estate through its holding of practically all the stock in the Corporation.\u201d Special Term held that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to make an investigation into the subject matter of the account, which investigation would have disclosed the transactions now complained of, bars the maintenance of this action by reason of the Statute of Limitations (CPLR 203, subd [f|; 213, subd 8). The question of the time when the plaintiffs are chargeable with discovery of the fraud, the time when it is established that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>possessed of knowledge of facts sufficient to suggest to a person of ordinary intelligence the probability that he had been defrauded creating a duty to inquire, is generally a mixed question of law and fact (see <em>Erbe v Lincoln Rochester Trust Co., </em>3 NY2d 321). Only where it conclusively appears that the plaintiff had knowledge of facts of that nature should a complaint be dismissed on motion <em>(Dombadze v Lignante, </em>244 NY 1). The circumstances of the instant case do not demonstrate that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs failed to exercise reasonable diligence in discovering the fraud. Nor, considering those circumstances, is their failure to ascertain the truth by inspecting the public records fatal to their action (see <em>Mead v Bunn, </em>32 NY 275; <em>Todd v Pearl Woods, </em>20 AD2d 911, affd 15 NY2d 817). Accordingly, the motion should have been denied and the question left to the trier of the facts. Margett, Acting P. J., Shapiro, Titone and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
