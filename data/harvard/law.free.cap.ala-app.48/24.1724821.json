Mainly it comports with Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed.2d 274, except that no mention was made of the minimum and maximum possible sentences. See Question No. 19, \u201cQuestions to be Asked of Defendants at Arraignment on Guilty Pleas in Felony Cases\u201d by Hon. F. Murland Smith at 1970 Circuit Judges Summer Seminar. C.L.E. program, Alabama State Bar, July 16, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-23\">Such an enquiry is important to a record which speaks for itself as to the understanding of a defendant who pleads guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-24\">We consider it necessary to remand to the lower court to ascertain if either counsel or court had beforehand told Spidell of the range of punishment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-25\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-26\">PRICE, P. J., and ALMON, J., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b42-27\">AFTER REMANDMENT HEARING IN THE CIRCUIT COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b42-28\">CATES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b42-29\">Defense counsel testified in positive terms that he had advised Spidell spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>cifically both before and after being appointed as his counsel that the range of punishment for robbery was \u201cfrom ten years to the chair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The appellant was not so decided in his recollection. Understandably a solipsistic hope might help him in the present review.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">However, we consider that the preponderance of proof is with the State. Thus, we find part of the appellant\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u201cCross-Examination by Mr. Rayburn:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u201cQ Mr. Spidell, you are not telling the court this morning that you were not advised of the maximum and minimum punishment for robbery, are you?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">\u201cA You say I\u2019m not?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u201cQ Is that right or wrong? As I understood your testimony \u2014 What I am saying, Walter, you do say now that Mr. Wright did advise you or your counsel did advise you, is that correct or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">\u201cA Well, to my remembrance maybe he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">\u201cQ All right, and as a matter of fact he did on several occasions, didn\u2019t he, Walter, advise you of the maximum and minimum range of punishment you could get for robbery?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir, I think he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">\u201cQ Now, according to the record and the docket sheet this came up before Judge Waid. This is Judge Waid sitting here today. Do you recall Judge Waid?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">\u201cA Yes, sir, I think I remember him.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\"><em>\u201cQ </em>And do you remember that the State was to take off two robbery cases, nol-pros them, in an agreement with you to take life in one of the cases?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">Do you remember Mr. Wright discussing that with you? Did you understand that ?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-19\">\u201cA Well, I heard \u2014 I mean I remember him talking to me about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-20\">\u201cQ And I take it that met with your approval ?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, I went along with him because, like I said, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-22\">\u201cQ And you know that after the appointment Mr. Hubert H. Wright counseled with you on several occasions, didn\u2019t he, concerning your case ? Talked to you about the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-23\">\u201cA Yes, what little time was left. There wasn\u2019t no time just before court. That is the only time. I seen him upstairs there about seven or eight minutes. He never did come back upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-24\">\u201cQ And did Mr. Hubert H. Wright ever force you to take a plea as you have said forced?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-25\"><em>\u201cA </em>He didn\u2019t ever force me.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-26\">\u201cQ Did Judge Waid here ever force you to take a plea of guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-27\">\u201cA No.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-28\">\u201cQ As a matter of fact, Walter, you were happy to get these two robbery cases off in exchange for pleading in one of them, weren\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-29\"><em>\u201cA </em>Well, I wouldn\u2019t say so much as happy-</p>\n<p id=\"b43-31\">\u201cQ Well, it met with your approval? That met with your approval, didn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201cA At the time, see, I didn\u2019t know, you know, what kind of time I had, how long I would have to be down there. I didn\u2019t understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">\u201cQ Now, didn\u2019t Mr. Hubert H. Wright, your court appointed attorney, tell you how soon you would be eligible for parole?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">\u201cA Yes, he told me once they were so crowded I could get out in five years. That was his words. He said ten once, but he said five again. I didn\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t been to the penitentiary before.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u201cQ When he told you the maximum penalty was the chair you understood what the chair is, don\u2019t you?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201cQ You have mentioned Mr. L. P. Payne. Did he force you to take a plea of guilty in this robbery case?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u201cA Well, he didn\u2019t exactly force me. It is- just something I got into. I wasn\u2019t even going to open my mouth. I mean I just didn\u2019t understand what was going on at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u201cQ Don\u2019t you recall at the time that you changed your plea from not guilty to guilty before Judge Waid here going over these things with Judge Waid? Do you recall that?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\"><em>\u201cA </em>I guess I do.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\"><em>\u201cQ . </em>Don\u2019t you remember that Judge -Waid told you you didn\u2019t have to plead guilty; that you had a right to a jury trial if you so desired one?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\"><em>\u201cA </em>I think I remember that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">The judgment below is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"A_d\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-15\">PRICE, P.
