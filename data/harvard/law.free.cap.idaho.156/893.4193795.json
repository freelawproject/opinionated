CEF and the Edwardses filed an action to declare the parties\u2019 rights to property INWC owns on Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene that has been used as a Boy Scout camp since 1929. The district court held CEF and the Edwardses lacked standing because CEF lacked a legally recognizable interest and the Edwardses were not certified as class representatives. The district court also held no trust existed because all prior agreements merged into an unambiguous deed. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to INWC on the grounds that the deed was an unambiguous fee simple transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-21\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b927-22\">This appeal involves 132 acres of property on Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene in Kootenai County that is part of a Boy Scout camp called Camp Easton.' This property is currently owned by Inland Northwest Council Endowment Properties, LLC, which is a holding company for Inland Northwest Council of the Boy Scouts of America (\u201cInland Northwest Council\u201d). The Inland Northwest Council is a Washington non-profit organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">In 1929, F.W. Fitze owned the property. On May 18, 1929, Fitze attended a meeting of the Coeur d\u2019Alene district committee to the Idaho Panhandle Council, Boy Scouts of America (\u201cIPC\u201d). The IPC was the Inland Northwest Council\u2019s predecessor. The meeting\u2019s minutes state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-24\">It was announced that the purpose of the meeting was to consult with Mr. Fitze regarding the purchase of the camp site owned by him. After a short discussion as to the desirability of this site, and after it was chosen as the best available site on Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene, Mr. Fitze announced that it was his desire to present the site to the Idaho Panhandle Council as its summer camp site and that we accept it from him as his gift to the Council and the boys of our area. His only wish was that it should be accepted with the understanding that it was his desire to have it used perpetually as a camp for boys.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-25\">The minutes also stated that the chairman would appoint a committee to draft a resolution of thanks and formally accept the site.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-26\">On August 5, 1929, Fitze and his wife deeded the 132 acres to IPC. The Fitzes deeded the land for \u201cthe sum of one dollar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>and other valuable consideration.\u201d The deed states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-4\">And the above bargained premises in the quiet and peaceable possession of said party of the second part, his successors and assigns, against all and every person or persons lawfully claiming the whole or any part thereof, the said parties of the first part shall and will warrant and defend. This property is donated and given to the [IPC] by F.W. Fitze and Lumira Fitze, his wife, <em>for use of the Boy Scouts of America.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-dp\">The camp was constructed and various improvements to the camp were made through the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Camp Easton now totals 421.65 acres through additional land acquisitions. Both IPC and the Inland Northwest Council have used Camp Easton as a camp for Boy Scouts of America (\u201cBoy Scouts\u201d) members and also have accepted donations for Camp Easton. These donations include money and additional land, which have expanded and improved Camp Easton. In 1992, IPC merged with the Inland Northwest Council, who accepted ownership of the property as Camp Easton. An October 6, 1992 Memorandum of Understanding stated that \u201cCamp Easton will continue to operate as a long term Boy Scout resident summer camp so long as it remains financially feasible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">In May of 2011, Discovery Land Company contacted Inland Northwest Council about purchasing Camp Easton. Discovery proposed acquiring another large lakefront parcel on Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene, constructing a Boy Scout camp on it, and then trading that new camp for Camp Easton. Discovery also proposed funding an endowment for the new camp. Inland Northwest Council approved a non-binding letter of intent for this transaction in August 2011. In February 2012, the Board for the Inland Northwest Council and the Board of Inland Northwest Council Endowment Properties, LLC, each voted in favor of pursuing whether they could reach a successful transaction with Discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Believing INWC would sell Camp Easton imminently, in September 2011 a group of plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court. In November 2011, those plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and class action, which alleged INWC held Camp Easton in a constructive trust and asked the court to impose that trust to prevent irreparable wrongdoing. The amended complaint also alleged equitable estoppel, declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and a creation of a charitable trust as a matter of law. The INWC answered and raised defenses, including merger and statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">The plaintiffs included CEF and the Edwardses. CEF is an Idaho non-profit corporation created to oppose the proposed sale of Camp Easton. The group\u2019s members include people who have participated in the Boy Scouts and attended Camp Easton. The Edwardses are Boy Scout members who attended Camp Easton.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">The plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on March 12, 2012, asking that the district court determine the charitable and constructive trust claims only. The INWC moved for summary judgment on all claims eight days later. The INWC argued the transaction was a fee simple conveyance of real property. In addition, INWC contended CEF and the Edwardses lacked standing. Both parties supported their motions with affidavits, and the court heard oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">The district court granted INWC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied the motion for summary judgment by CEF and the Edwardses. The court held CEF and the Edwardses lacked standing because CEF lacked a legally recognizable interest and the plaintiffs did not seek to certify the Edwardses as representatives of a putative class as per I.R.C.P. 23(c). The district court also held no charitable or constructive trust existed because the doctrine of merger and the statute of frauds barred extrinsic evidence. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissed the claims by CEF and the Edwardses with prejudice, and determined there was no cognizable class or injury. CEF and the Edwardses filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied on the same grounds as the motion for summary judgment. CEF and the Edwardses timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-5\">1. Whether CEF and the Edwardses have standing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">2. Whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the grounds that the deed was unambiguous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment using the same standard the district court used when it originally ruled on the motion. <em>Carl H. Christensen Family Trust v. Christensen, </em>133 Idaho 866, 870, 993 P.2d 1197, 1201 (1999). Therefore, we affirm summary judgment when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). On summary judgment, this Court liberally construes all facts in favor of the nonmoving party and draws all reasonable inferences from the facts in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Hill v. Hill, </em>140 Idaho 812, 813, 102 P.3d 1131, 1132 (2004). We deny summary judgment if reasonable persons could reach differing conclusions or draw conflicting inferences from the evidence. <em>Id. </em>If no disputed issues of material fact exist, then only a question of law remains. Inf<em>anger v. City of Salmon, </em>137 Idaho 45, 47, 44 P.3d 1100, 1102 (2002). This Court exercises free review over questions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">CEF and the Edwardses argue trust law applies and forms a charitable trust over the property. They contend that standing can only be addressed after this Court decides which law applies because their approach differs depending on whether they are trust beneficiaries. The district court denied CEF and Edwardses\u2019 summary judgment on two grounds. The court held (1) CEF and the Edwardses lacked standing and (2) the unambiguous deed made a fee simple conveyance of the Fitze property.</p>\n<p id=\"AW_\">A. Daniel and Matthew Edwards have standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Courts determine standing as a preliminary question before reaching the merits of a case. <em>Young v. City of Ketchum, </em>137 Idaho 102, 104, 44 P.3d 1157, 1159 (2002). The district court held that CEF and the Edwardses lacked standing. The district court began with CEF, holding the nonprofit had no \u201cdistinct palpable injury\u201d shared by all or a large class of citizens. The court reasoned that selling Camp Easton was a generalized grievance and not a loss of a legally recognizable asset. The district court did not analyze individual standing for the Edwardses. Instead, the court disposed of standing by holding that the Edwardses did not timely seek class certification as per I.R.C.P. 23(c)(1), so they could not be representative of a class and lacked standing to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">\n<em>1. Standing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">The INWC argues that CEF and the Edwardses failed to show standing. Parties \u201cmust allege or demonstrate an injury in fact and a substantial likelihood that the judicial relief requested will prevent or redress the claimed injury.\u201d <em>Miles v. Idaho Power Co., </em>116 Idaho 635, 641, 778 P.2d 757, 763 (1989). That injury \u201cmust be distinct and palpable and not be one suffered alike by all citizens in the jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Selkirk-Priest Basin Ass\u2019n v. State ex rel. Batt, </em>128 Idaho 831, 833-34, 919 P.2d 1032, 1034-35 (1996). Even when a party shows an injury in fact, \u201cstanding may be denied when the asserted harm is a generalized grievance shared by all or a large class of citizens.\u201d <em>Young, </em>137 Idaho at 104, 44 P.3d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">The Edwardses have a distinct injury: they are members of the Boy Scouts who cannot use the camp once the camp property is sold or traded. These scouts have an injury in fact by losing use of a specific piece of property that they were previously able to use. While the district court noted that this was not a loss of money or property, the scouts will be deprived of using the camp once the camp is no longer there. Scouts used the camp, not everyone in the area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Thus, the Edwardses and other scouts have a distinct and specific injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">However, INWC contends that there are no facts supported by affidavit that CEF members or the Edwardses are scouts, paid dues, or used Camp Easton. We have looked to the United States Supreme Court for guidance when we consider standing. <em>Koch v. Canyon Cnty., </em>145 Idaho 158, 161, 177 P.3d 372, 375 (2008). Because standing is \u201cnot mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part of the plaintiffs case, each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, <em>ie., </em>with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364 (1992). At summary judgment \u201cthe plaintiff can no longer rest on such \u2018mere allegations,\u2019 but must \u2018set forth\u2019 by affidavit or other evidence \u2018specific facts,\u2019 Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e), which for purposes of the summary judgment motion will be taken to be true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Standing is also an indispensable part of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, so Idaho\u2019s summary judgment standard applies: \u201can adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of that party\u2019s pleadings, but the party\u2019s response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">CEF\u2019s complaint alleges that its members are longtime scouts, scout leaders, participants in the camp\u2019s operation, Board members of scout organizations, donors, and Camp Easton\u2019s neighbors. These allegations are not supported by affidavits. However, INWC\u2019s affidavits show that Camp Easton was a camp used by scouts. INWC admits in its answer that the Edwardses are members of the Boy Scouts of America. It is therefore undisputed that the Edwardses are Boy Scout members, so it follows that they were entitled to use the camp. Thus, the Edwardses established standing with more than mere allegations. The complaint does not specify whether the Edwardses are members of CEF.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">INWC also argues that the Edwardses paying dues to the Boy Scouts of America does not establish standing because there is no evidence the scouts paid dues with any restrictions on use. INWC cites no case to support this statement. While paying dues without restriction may not mean a person can tell an organization what to do with its dues, that person can still have a distinct injury when the organization deprives him of property he could use because he paid dues. Thus, scouts are injured by losing a camp they used, even if the scouts did not restrict or funnel their dues directly to the camp. Because the Edwardses have standing, we do not need to reach the issue of whether CEF has standing or whether alleged charitable trust beneficiaries have standing in order to reach the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">\n<em>%. Class Certification for Edwardses.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">The district court held \u201cbecause the Plaintiffs never sought certification, there is no putative class that has standing.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[a]s a result, Daniel Edwards and Matthew Edwards have no standing to proceed.\u201d Thus, the court denied individual standing to the Edwardses because the court denied standing to the class. Because the Edwardses had standing, the issue is whether the district court could deny individual standing based upon a denial of the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Courts certify a class action if the class meets all four factors in I.R.C.P. 23(a) and at least one factor in I.R.C.P. 23(b). <em>Bettwieser v. New York Irr. Dist., </em>154 Idaho 317, 324, 297 P.3d 1134, 1141 (2013). Nothing in Idaho law states that a party is denied individual standing when he is not able to certify his action as a class action. Indeed, \u201c[plaintiffs are never <em>required </em>to seek the vindication of a class.\u201d <em>Middlekauff v. Lake Cascade, Inc., </em>110 Idaho 909, 915, 719 P.2d 1169, 1175 (1986). Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) instead merely establishes conditions where \u201c[o]ne or more members of a class <em>may </em>sue or be sued as representative party on behalf of all....\u201d (emphasis added). The United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cA plaintiff who brings a class action presents two separate issues for judicial resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>tion. One is the claim on the merits; the other is the claim that he is entitled to represent a class\u201d; a denial of class certification adjudicates one of the issues. <em>U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n v. Geraghty, </em>445 U.S. 388, 402, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1211, 63 L.Ed.2d 479, 494 (1980) (holding that even when a court denied class certification, an action brought on behalf of a class did not become moot when the named plaintiffs substantive claim expired). A plaintiffs individual claim and the claim he represents a class are two separate issues. Thus, the district court could not deny the Edwardses individual standing based upon its denial of class certification. Because the Edwardses have standing, we can proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">B. The deed is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The district court also denied CEF and the Edwardses their motion for summary judgment on the grounds that no trust existed as a matter of law. The court first determined that the property was not held in a constructive trust because no facts showed that IPC acquired the Fitze property by fraud or mistake. Next, the court held that the property was not held in charitable trust for two reasons: (1) the deed from Fitze to IPC was unambiguous and silent as to any other agreement, so the merger doctrine applied to merge any prior agreement into the deed; and (2) even if the court could review the Minutes, the Minutes violated the statute of frauds because they were not signed by Fitze or IPC. The court acknowledged that the parties behaved in a certain way towards the property for a long time, but noted that the property was never placed in an express trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">CEF and the Edwardses argue that the district court erred when it applied real property law instead of trust law. They argue that admitting the 1929 Minutes under trust law and reading them with the deed shows that a trust exists as a matter of law. CEF and the Edwardses alternatively argue that \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d is an ambiguous phrase that makes the deed ambiguous and requires admitting the Minutes, which operate as a restraint on selling the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">A portion of the deed reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">And the above bargained premises in the quiet and peaceable possession of [IPC], his successors and assigns, against all and every person or persons lawfully claiming the whole or any part thereof, the said parties of the first part shall and will warrant and defend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">This property is donated and given to the [IPC] by F.W. Fitze and Lumira Fitze, his wife, for use of the Boy Scouts of America.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">If the deed is ambiguous, then CEF and the Edwardses argue they may use the Minutes to explain any ambiguity. However, if the deed is unambiguous, the merger doctrine applies. The merger doctrine merges a prior contract into a deed when the deed is delivered and accepted as performance of a conveyance contract. <em>Jolley v. Idaho Sec., Inc., </em>90 Idaho 373, 382, 414 P.2d 879, 884 (1966). Even when a deed\u2019s terms vary from an earlier contract, courts must look to the deed alone to determine parties\u2019 rights. <em>Id. </em>Thus, an unambiguous deed forecloses considering another agreement, including the Minutes. Accordingly, this case comes down to one question: whether the deed is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">1. <em>The deed\u2019s plain language is unambiguous.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">CEF and the Edwardses argue that \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d is subject to several reasonable interpretations and therefore the deed is ambiguous. They contend that the phrase is ambiguous because the deed describes the property\u2019s title going to IPC but the property itself as a gift for use of a different entity: the Boy Scouts of America. CEF and the Edwardses contend \u201cfor use\u201d means the property was held in trust for the Boy Scouts. They also argue that the deed is ambiguous as to whether Boy Scouts of America means the national non-profit corporation or individuals who are boy scouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">When this Court interprets a deed, our primary goal is to give effect to the parties\u2019 real intent. <em>Hoch v. Vance, </em>155 Idaho 636, 639, 315 P.3d 824, 827 (2013). If a deed\u2019s language is ambiguous, the parties\u2019 intent becomes a question of fact settled by a trier of fact. <em>Id. </em>The trier of fact must consider all of the surrounding facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>circumstances and view the deed as a whole and in its entirety. <em>Sells v. Robinson, </em>141 Idaho 767, 773, 118 P.3d 99, 105 (2005). However, \u201c[w]hen an instrument conveying land is unambiguous, the intention of the parties can be settled as a matter of law using the plain language of the document\u201d and without using extrinsic evidence. <em>Porter v. Bassett, </em>146 Idaho 399, 404, 195 P.3d 1212, 1217 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">A deed is ambiguous when its language is reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations. <em>Id. </em>A deed is not ambiguous merely because the parties present differing interpretations to the court. <em>Hoch, </em>155 Idaho at 639, 315 P.3d at 827. Instead, \u201cconflicting interpretations may arise when a phrase lends itself, without contortion, to a number of inconsistent meanings.\u201d <em>Porter, </em>146 Idaho at 404, 195 P.3d at 1217. To determine whether a deed is ambiguous, the deed must be reviewed as a whole. <em>Neider v. Shaw, </em>138 Idaho 503, 508, 65 P.3d 525, 530 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Some aspects of this gift deed are undisputed. The deed states the property was \u201cdonated and given\u201d by Fitze, which clearly shows donative intent and that the property was a gift. The property was delivered and accepted, as IPC has operated Camp Easton on the property for over eighty years. We analyze the deed within these undisputed facts and read the plain language \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d as part of the entire deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">The district court interpreted the deed\u2019s language to mean \u201cthat Fitze, for consideration, transferred fee simple title to the property to IPC, and that land was for the use of the Boy Scouts of America.\u201d The court explained that the deed \u201cdoes not contain a reversion, does not create or mention a trust, trustee, or beneficiary, does not restrict further alienation of the property, and does not otherwise restrict the use of the property. Had the parties desired ... they could have included such language in the Deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Here, \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts of America\u201d is the phrase in dispute. The word \u201cuse\u201d means \u201cthe privilege or benefit of using something.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster Dictionary </em>2523 (3d ed.1971). Thus, \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d means that scouts have the benefit of using the property. The deed never states that the land is \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts of America as a camp for boy scouts.\u201d The deed does not otherwise indicate that the property must be held and used as a camp. The deed also does not include limiting language to impose a condition on land use, like \u201cso long as the Boy Scouts of America use the property as a camp\u201d or that the property be used \u201conly as a camp.\u201d The deed has no provision for reversion and reentry if the Boy Scouts stop using the property. The deed never states that the land could not be sold. Thus, the deed does not state any limit on the Boy Scouts\u2019 use. The deed also states that the land is for use of the \u201cBoy Scouts of America,\u201d which is the full name of the national corporation and does not describe individual members.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">CEF and the Edwardses argue that \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d is ambiguous by analogizing to <em>Latham v. Garner, </em>105 Idaho 854, 673 P.2d 1048 (1983). In <em>Latham, </em>property owners purchased easements to build a roadway with granting documents that provided the easements were granted \u201cexclusively for their use, and unto their successors and assigns forever.\u201d 105 Idaho at 855, 673 P.2d at 1049. The servient estate owner challenged those easements, maintaining he could also use the road. <em>Id. </em>This Court held that the granting document was ambiguous because the phrase \u201cexclusively for their use\u201d was subject to three different reasonable interpretations: (1) granting an easement to the grantee and excluding everyone but the grantor; (2) granting an easement to the grantee that excluded everyone else; and (3) a fee simple grant to grantee. <em>Id. </em>at 858, 673 P.2d at 1052. However, the phrase \u201cexclusively for their use\u201d gave rise to these conflicting interpretations because the word \u201cexclusive\u201d was not sufficient to preclude the servient owner\u2019s use. <em>Id. </em>at 857, 673 P.2d at 1051. Also, the deed used the word \u201ctheir,\u201d which did not specify who could use the easement. In contrast, here the deed was very specific that the land was given to the IPC, a part of the Boy Scouts of America. Thus, <em>Latham </em>does not show the word \u201cuse\u201d creates ambiguity. Instead, it only shows deeds subject to conflicting interpretations are ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Additionally, CEF and the Edwardses argue that \u201cfor use of\u2019 means \u201cin trust for,\u201d which shows that a reasonable interpretation of the deed\u2019s language is that the property was held in trust. A settlor creates an express trust by manifesting an intention to create a trust. <em>Garner v. Andreasen, </em>96 Idaho 306, 308, 527 P.2d 1264, 1266 (1974). A settlor\u2019s intent \u201crequires no particular words or conduct; the settlor simply must evidence his intention, upon transferring the property, or res, to the trustee, that the trustee will hold the res for the benefit of a third person, the beneficiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A trust\u2019s essential characteristic is holding the legal and beneficial interests separately in a fiduciary relationship. <em>In re Eggan\u2019s Estate, </em>86 Idaho 328, 337, 386 P.2d 563, 568 (1963). Thus, no particular words are needed to create a trust, as long as the words show clear intent to transfer legal title to the trustee to hold the beneficial interest for a third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">CEF and the Edwardses support their argument with <em>Davis v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 472, 110 S.Ct. 2014, 109 L.Ed.2d 457 (1990), where the United States Supreme Court interpreted a section of the Internal Revenue Code that defined charitable contribution as \u201ca contribution or gift to or for the use of.\u201d There, the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">On its face, the phrase \u201cfor the use of\u2019 could support any number of different meanings. See, <em>e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed.1950) (\u201cuse\u201d defined in general usage as \u201cto convert to one\u2019s service\u201d; \u201cto employ\u201d; or, in law, \u201cuse imports a trust\u201d relationship).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-7\">... From the dawn of English common law through the present, the word \u201cuse\u201d has been employed to refer to various forms of trust arrangements. See 1 G. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 2, p. 9 (1935); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1382 (5th ed.1979) <em>(\u201cUses </em>and <em>trusts </em>are not so much different things as different aspects of the same subject. A use regards principally the beneficial interest; a trust regards principally the nominal ownership\u201d). In the early part of this century, the word \u201cuse\u201d was technically employed to refer to a passive trust, but less formally used as a synonym for the word \u201ctrust.\u201d See Bogert, su<em>pra, </em>at 9 (\u201cThe words \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018trust\u2019 are employed as synonyms frequently by writers and judges\u201d); 1 R. Baldes, Perry on Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 298 (7th ed.1929) (\u201cA <em>use, </em>a <em>trust, </em>and a <em>confidence </em>is one and the same thing ...\u201d); 1 Restatement of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 67-72 (Effect of Statute of Uses) (1935). The phrases \u201cto the use of\u2019 or \u201cfor the use of\u2019 were frequently used in describing trust arrangements. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Bowling, </em>256 U.S. 484, 486, 41 S.Ct. 561, 562, 65 L.Ed. 1054 [-] (1921); <em>Blanset v. Cardin, </em>256 U.S. 319, 321, 41 S.Ct. 519, 520, 65 L.Ed. 950 [952-53] (1921); <em>Rand v. United States, </em>249 U.S. 503, 508, 39 S.Ct. 359, 360, 63 L.Ed. 731 [734] (1919). Given that this meaning of the word \u201cuse\u201d precisely corresponded with Congress\u2019 purpose for amending the statute, it appears likely that in choosing the phrase \u201cfor the use of\u2019 Congress was referring to donations made in trust or in a similar legal arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-12\"><em>Davis, </em>495 U.S. at 479-81, 110 S.Ct. at 2020, 109 L.Ed.2d at 467-69. The Court observed the accepted meaning of \u201cuse\u201d was synonymous with the term \u201ctrust,\u201d which was also consistent with the statutory language and Congress\u2019s apparent purpose in adopting the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 482-84, 110 S.Ct. 2020-22, 109 L.Ed.2d at 469-70. However, <em>Davis </em>is distinguishable. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>was interpreting the Internal Revenue Code. The Court arrived at its conclusion by considering legislative history and the IRS\u2019s interpretation of that statute. Thus, the possible meaning of \u201cuse\u201d as \u201ctrust\u201d in a federal statute does not indicate that this deed is ambiguous as to whether INWC holds the legal title to property for the beneficial use of the Boy Scouts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">CEF and the Edwardses maintain that because they allege a charitable trust, broad interpretation standards apply. A charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>trust is \u201ca trust created to benefit a specific charity, specific charities, or the general public rather than a private individual or entity.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1649 (9th ed.2009). This Court has stated that \u201cseparation of legal and equitable titles are not so obvious in charitable trusts as in trusts of a noncharitable character.\u201d <em>In re Eggan\u2019s Estate, </em>86 Idaho at 337, 386 P.2d at 568. CEF and the Edwardses argue the deed\u2019s language should be construed more broadly, given that \u201ccharitable trusts are favorites of the law\u201d and courts \u201ctakes a sympathetic view of attempts to create charitable trusts\u201d and use liberal rules of construction. 14 C.J.S. <em>Charities </em>\u00a7 8 (2011). However, we cannot apply broad interpretation standards when the deed unambiguously shows this was a fee simple conveyance. Because the phrase \u201cfor use of the Boy Scouts\u201d is unambiguous and lacked any specificity as to how the Boy Scouts must use the property, the district court properly viewed the deed as a fee simple conveyance that allows alienation. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the grounds that the deed was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">\n<em>2. Trust law did not require the district court to admit extrinsic evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">CEF and the Edwardses argue courts must look beyond an absolute deed and consider extrinsic evidence to explain the donor\u2019s intent. CEF and the Edwardses cite <em>Garner v. Andreasen, </em>96 Idaho 306, 527 P.2d 1264 (1974), and <em>Bengoechea v. Bengoechea, </em>106 Idaho 188, 677 P.2d 501 (Ct.App.1984) to support this argument. However, neither case requires this Court to look beyond the Fitze deed. In <em>Garner, </em>we found that an assignment of real property that \u201cwas, by its terms, absolute\u201d actually had formed a trust. 96 Idaho at 308, 527 P.2d at 1266. However, all parties agreed the property was held in a trust arrangement, and the question was instead whether the district court erred in determining the continued existence of the trust. <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Garner </em>does not show this Court should always admit extrinsic evidence when one party alleges a trust. In <em>Bengoechea, </em>a grantor conveyed property to his son and daughter-in-law while telling his family that the conveyance only allowed them to sell the property if he needed money for medical care. 106 Idaho at 190, 677 P.2d at 503. The Court of Appeals found that while the deed was otherwise an absolute transfer, the trial court\u2019s findings supported the court imposing a resulting trust on the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 677 P.2d at 506. Extrinsic evidence may be used to establish a resulting trust. <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Bengoechea </em>also is not instructive. In this case, because the deed\u2019s language showed an unambiguous intent to donate the property in fee simple to the Boy Scouts, we do not consider the Minutes as extrinsic evidence of Fitze\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Also, CEF and the Edwardses argue that charitable trusts are implied when gifts are made to a recognized charitable organization. They describe this as treating charitable trusts with special care, which includes using extrinsic evidence to effectuate the donor\u2019s purpose. They cite <em>In re Eggan\u2019s Estate, </em>where we stated: \u201cwhen a testator gives property to a city for use by the public as a park or a public square there appears to be no clear separation of legal and equitable title. However, the courts are inclined to say that the land is held in trust for use by the public.\u201d 86 Idaho at 337, 386 P.2d at 568-69. CEF and the Edwardses also cite other jurisdictions for the concept that a gift to a charitable organization implies a trust relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">However, this is not the law in Idaho. Indeed, in <em>In re Eggan\u2019s Estate </em>we held a deed formed a trust when that deed stated the donor\u2019s estate was to be used \u201conly\u201d to build a youth center in Moscow, Idaho, \u201cto be used primarily for the recreation of the youth of this area.\u201d 86 Idaho at 331, 386 P.2d at 564. Here, the deed did not articulate that the property \u201conly\u201d be used for a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>purpose. This is unlike the deed in <em>In re Eggan\u2019s Estate </em>that declared property was only for a youth center primarily used for youth recreation. Instead, Fitze\u2019s deed unambiguously- gave the property in fee simple to the Boy Scouts without specifying that the property must be used as a camp. Thus, we cannot say that giving property for use of the Boy Scouts implies a trust or requires that we consider extrinsic evidence to determine donor intent. Because the deed was unambiguous, the 1929 Minutes will not be considered. We therefore do not need to reach the issues of whether the Minutes would be prohibited by the statute of frauds or whether the district court properly denied class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">CEF and the Edwardses also argue the district court improperly dismissed their case with prejudice because the court should have granted their request for another amended complaint and additional discovery. However, their request for an amended complaint never mentioned the applicable civil rule as required under I.R.C.P. 7(b)(1). Also, the request for additional discovery related to standing, class certification, and other issues; CEF and the Edwardses never requested more discovery on the trust issue. The district court noted this in its decision on reconsideration, stating that \u201cif the Plaintiffs were prepared to move for summary judgment on this claim, the Plaintiffs were surely in possession of enough information to defend a cross motion for summary judgment.\u201d Thus, the district court did not improperly dismiss the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Even when making all reasonable inferences in favor of CEF and the Edwardses, we find the deed was unambiguous. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Costs to INWC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b935-8\">Justices EISMANN, J. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-8\">. CEF and the Edwardses also state that hundreds of federal cases construe the words \"for the use of\u201d to mean a trust. However, they cite only one case, <em>Chew v. First Presbyterian Church of Wilmington, Del., </em>237 F. 219 (D.Del.1916), and provide little analysis. There, the deed read: \"to have and to hold \u2018for the use of a Meeting House, Burying Ground and such other pius uses forev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>er as they or a majority of them should 'at any time hereafter see most fitting and convenient, and to no other use, intent or purpose whatsoever.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>Chew, </em>237 F. at 223. The court found a charitable trust existed in perpetuity. <em>Id. </em>However, that deed specified that the purpose was for a meeting house, burying ground, or pious use, whereas the deed in this case did not describe a particular use and only gave use to the Boy Scouts of America. Also, the deed in <em>Chew </em>granted the use \"forever\u201d and allowed \"no other use whatsoever.\u201d Again, here the deed did not limit the Boy Scouts' use of the land. Thus, <em>Chew </em>does not demonstrate that \"for the use of\u201d means there is a trust.?</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
