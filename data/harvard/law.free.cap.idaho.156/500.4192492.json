Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">This appeal arises from a fraud, breach of contract, and breach of warranty action brought by April Beguesse, Inc. (ABI) against Kenneth Rammell (Rammell), the estate of Christa Beguesse (Christa), and Christa Beguesse, Inc. (CBI) (collectively Defendants) and a breach of contract counterclaim brought by CBI against ABI. The parties went to trial and the jury returned a verdict in favor of ABI on all claims. Defendants moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or in the alternative a new trial. The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for JNOV on the finding of fraud by Christa\u2019s estate and dismissed that claim. The district court also granted Defendants a new trial on the issue of damages unless ABI accepted a remittitur for damages assessed against CBI only. The district court denied Defendants\u2019 motion on the remaining claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty, and fraud. ABI accepted the remittitur. Defendants appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion. Defendants also seek a reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment or in the alternative a new trial on their counterclaim. They raise one evidentiary error. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">In 1996, Christa and her husband Rammell incorporated CBI in Idaho. CBI provided typesetting services to The Rutter Group (Rutter), a legal publisher. Christa and Rammell each owned fifty percent of stock in CBI with Christa as the president and Rammell as the secretary and treasurer. Christa did almost all of the typesetting work and had extensive knowledge and expertise in the field due to her years of experience. Rammell occasionally did accounting for CBI, but the parties agree that Rammell had limited involvement in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">In 1999, Rammell and Christa met with an attorney for estate planning purposes. Rammell and Christa valued CBI at $40,000. The parties agree that the value of the business reflected Rammell and Christa\u2019s belief that CBI would have little value without Christa because Christa was the sole typesetter for CBI and she never trained anyone else to do the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">In November of 2001, Rammell and Christa approached Christa\u2019s daughter April Beguesse (April) to purchase CBI after first spending two years working closely with Christa to learn the business. April agreed. April would work for CBI from 2002 to 2004, and in 2004 April would take over the business and pay CBI $12,000 a month for eight years, a total of $1,152,000. In exchange for the monthly payments, April believed that she would get consulting and assistance from Christa, CBI\u2019s office equipment, ownership of a library of computer files, and proprietary software developed by Christa. Christa and Rammell told April that she could sell the business in the future in a similar way that CBI would be sold to her. April believed that CBI owned the library of computer files, which CBI used to typeset for Rutter\u2019s publications specifically, and she believed that the library of files was valued at 1 to 1.3 million dollars. At trial April testified that she relied on Rammell\u2019s statements as to the value of the library of files and CBI\u2019s ownership of the files. April also believed that the proprietary software had unique codes created by Christa for efficient typesetting within a computer software program called PageMaker. April testified at trial that Christa told her that she created the proprietary software and that Christa made a similar statement during an Idaho Falls Exchange Club presentation. April testified that she did not know that Rammell had stock in CBI. She stated that she would not have agreed to purchase CBI if she knew Rammell was an owner or if she knew CBI did not own the library of files.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>On January 6, 2002, April began working for CBI. On January 7, 2002, April sent a letter to Rutter\u2019s editor-in-chief Linda Diamond Razniek to introduce herself and announce that she would be joining CBI. From January 6, 2002, to May of 2004, Christa trained April to typeset with the PageMaker software. In January of 2004, April transitioned CBI\u2019s typesetting business to ABI, and ABI began making monthly payments of $12,000 to CBI. On October 6, 2004, ABI and CBI signed a lease agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ABI frequently hired Christa for consulting work.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">In November of 2006, April studied the PageMaker manual for the first time during an update of the software. She learned that the proprietary software actually was provided by PageMaker. Christa had not developed any unique codes for typesetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">ABI continued to make monthly payments to CBI through November of 2008. On November 10, 2008, Christa died unexpectedly, and ABI stopped making payments to CBI. In total, ABI had paid CBI 59 monthly payments of $12,000, totaling $708,000, and $50,000 in consulting fees to Christa. According to Rammell, ABI owed CBI 37 more payments of $12,000, totaling $444,000, to fulfill the eight-year agreement. Christa\u2019s 2007 holographic will left her entire estate to Rammell.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">After Christa\u2019s death in late 2008, April contacted Razniek and learned that Rutter owned the library of files. Razniek told April that ABI could not sell the library of files upon April\u2019s retirement. April explained at trial that the ownership of the library was significant because she \u201cthought the Rutter Group needed us just as much as we needed them----and because of that, there was no need to even think about going anyplace else.\u201d It became a \u201cbig time\u201d concern for her that Rutter \u201ccould take the business away.\u201d Raznick\u2019s testimony corroborated April\u2019s understanding of the ownership of the library of files. Razniek testified that Rutter paid CBI and ABI to house the files on their servers, but Rutter owned the files and ABI could not sell the business without Rutter\u2019s approval. Razniek explained that she could not give assurances to CBI that Rutter would continue to do business with ABI when CBI sold the business. In March of 2009, April relocated ABI to Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">On May 8, 2009, ABI filed a suit in Bonneville County against Rammell, Christa\u2019s estate, and CBI seeking declaratory relief and raising claims of fraud, constructive fraud, breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of implied warranty, unjust enrichment, and quasi-estoppel. CBI filed a counterclaim against ABI for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, constructive trust, and violation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">After the district court resolved some of the parties\u2019 claims on summary judgment, the parties went to trial. ABI presented three claims: (1) fraud by Rammell, Christa\u2019s estate, and CBI; (2) breach of contract by CBI; and (3) breach of express warranty by CBI. For the fraud claim, ABI alleged that Rammell and Christa individually and on behalf of CBI knowingly made fraudulent material representations to induce ABI into the purchase agreement with CBI. Those representations were that (1) CBI owned a library of files worth at least one million dollars; (2) CBI owned proprietary software unique to CBI\u2019s business; and (3) the payments would cease in the event of Christa\u2019s death within the eight-year payment period. For the breach of contract claim, ABI alleged that CBI promised to assign or sell to ABI the library of files and proprietary software in exchange for the payments. For the breach of warranty claim, ABI alleged that CBI expressly warranted that CBI could transfer ownership of the library of files and proprietary software to ABI and that these warranties were material terms of the contract. CBI presented a breach of contract counterclaim against ABI. CBI alleged that ABI breached the purchase agreement by failing or refusing to continue the monthly $12,000 payments after Christa\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>April offered testimony on the value of the business at trial. She valued the furniture and office equipment at $8,500 and the Page-Maker software at $600. In her opinion, the value of the business when it became ABI in 2004 was $250,000, excluding the equipment and PageMaker software. That value included mentoring by Christa, such as \u201c[g]etting up to speed on the processes, the production work flow ... [and] things that had changed.\u201d April placed \u201cno value\u201d on the library of files. She did not believe that she could \u201cethically\u201d sell the business to a third party because she did not believe that she had anything to sell without ownership of the files. She could not \u201cin good faith\u201d guarantee a third party that Rutter would work with them and \u201csell anything tangible to somebody.\u201d She also explained that she could not successfully sell the business like Christa sold it to her because she bought the business with the belief that she could charge Rutter for return of the files and now she knows that she would have to return the files at no charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Rammell also testified at trial. He denied making an agreement with April that ABI\u2019s payments would cease on anyone\u2019s death. He testified that he told April that she could sell the business in the same way that he and Christa were selling it to her. He explained that he calculated the $12,000 monthly payments to obtain a little over one million dollars to retire and provide an income for April. He acknowledged that CBI would not be worth anything if Rutter took its business elsewhere, but stated that ABI would have to pay CBI even if Rutter left. Rammell agreed that it was possible that Christa and April could have had separate oral agreements without his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Rammell denied that he indicated to April that the files were worth at least one million dollars. He testified that he never represented to April that the files had any value outside of the business. He stated that the files had no value without Christa. He explained, \u201cIf the files would have been worth a million dollars, I\u2019d have just sold the files for a million dollars, put it in the bank, and discontinued the business.\u201d He was not aware that April ever raised the issue of ownership of the library of files with him. He also testified that he \u201ccame up with the value of the business that they were selling to April.\u201d He valued the business by considering only \u201cwhat [he] wanted to get out of the business and what April could afford to pay.\u201d To contradict these statements, ABI had Rammell read his deposition testimony. In his deposition, he testified that he did not value the business to April and he had \u201cno understanding\u201d of whether CBI owned a library of files and \u201cno way to evaluate\u201d the files. ABI then had Rammell read his deposition testimony from the second day of his deposition, after Rammell had met with his attorney, wherein he testified that he believed CBI owned the library of files and that he communicated to April that the files were part of the business\u2019s value. Regarding the proprietary software, Rammell testified that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if he told April that the proprietary software was written by Christa, but he knew that April knew it was written by Christa. He later testified that he did not tell April that Christa wrote the software and he never heard Christa tell that to April. Rammell also testified that he was aware that CBI at one time owned intellectual property or trade secrets because \u201call of the things that Christa added to her programs are a trade secret to her,\u201d but then he read his deposition testimony denying knowledge of any intellectual property or trade secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Defendants also called Stephan Douglas Hall, who explained that about five to ten years ago Christa gave a presentation at the Idaho Falls Exchange Club about her typesetting business. Although his memory was \u201cvague,\u201d he remembered that Christa said something about developing software or writing software. He testified that he asked Christa if she developed proprietary software and she eventually responded that she used an off-the-shelf publishing software package. Hall knew April was present during the presentation, but he was not sure if April heard his question or Christa\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Among other exhibits, the jury was provided a copy of the lease agreement. The jury was instructed that the agreement was \u201cnot an enforceable contract,\u201d but \u201cmay be evidence as to the actual agreement entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>into by the Parties.\u201d The jury also was provided an exhibit of the QuickBooks register of the payments ABI made to CBI and a 2004 cash flow statement prepared by Rammell for April during the parties\u2019 2001 meeting to purchase the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">On April 13, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of ABI on all claims. The jury determined that ABI\u2019s fraud claim was not barred by the statute of limitations and that Rammell, Christa\u2019s estate, and CBI each committed fraud. The jury awarded $354,000.00 in damages. For the breach of contract and express warranty claims, the jury determined that these claims also were not barred by the statute of limitations. The jury verdict form divided these claims by the subjects \u201cproprietary software\u201d and \u201clibrary of files.\u201d The jury determined that CBI \u201cbreach[ed] its contact and/or warranty\u201d with ABI \u201cas to a library of files\u201d and awarded $190,013.00 in damages. Next the jury determined that CBI \u201cbreach[ed] its contact and/or warranty\u201d with ABI \u201cas to proprietary software,\u201d but awarded no damages. In total, Rammell, Christa\u2019s estate, and CBI were jointly and severally liable for $354,000 in damages for fraud, and CBI was liable for an additional $190,013 in damages for breach of contract and breach of warranty as to the library of files, a total of $544,013 against CBI. For Defendants\u2019 counterclaim, the jury determined that ABI did not breach its contract with CBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Defendants moved for JNOV or a new trial in the alternative. The district court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict except as to ABI\u2019s fraud claim against Christa\u2019s estate. As such, the district court dismissed the fraud claim against Christa\u2019s estate. In addition, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial on the issue of damages unless ABI accepted a remittitur to reduce the damages against CBI by $90,113. The district court stated that ABI paid CBI $708,000 to purchase the business, but April testified that the business was worth $254,100. Thus, the district court concluded that the total possible amount of damages incurred by ABI was $453,900, the amount paid by ABI less the business\u2019 worth. By awarding ABI $544,013 in damages against CBI, the district court calculated that the jury exceeded the total amount of damages by $90,113. The district court determined that the excess amount was inexplicable and based on passion and prejudice. ABI accepted the district court\u2019s remittitur. Defendants appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">1. Whether the district court erred in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and JNOV on ABI\u2019s fraud claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">2.

Whether the district court erred in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for JNOV on ABI\u2019s breach of contract and breach of warranty claims due to the statute of limitations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">4.

Whether the judgment on Defendants\u2019 counterclaim should be reversed or remanded for a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">6. Whether either Defendants or ABI is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">IV. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decision whether to admit or exclude evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Harris, Inc. v. Foxhollow Const. &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>151 Idaho 761, 770, 264 P.3d 400, 409 (2011). \u201cTo determine whether a trial court has abused its discretion, this Court considers whether the district court: (1) perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the outer boundaries of that discretion consistent with applicable legal standards; and (3) reached its decision through the exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Hansen v. Roberts, </em>154 Idaho 469, 472, 299 P.3d 781, 784 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">\u201cWhen reviewing a decision to grant or deny a motion for a directed verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>this Court applies the same standard the trial court applied when originally ruling on the motion.\u201d <em>Enriquez v. Idaho Power Co., </em>152 Idaho 562, 565, 272 P.3d 534, 537 (2012). The Court determines</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQO\">whether there was sufficient evidence to justify submitting the claim to the jury, viewing as true all adverse evidence and drawing every legitimate inference in favor of the party opposing the motion for a directed verdict. This test does not require the evidence be uncontradicted, but only that it be of sufficient quantity and probative value that reasonable minds could conclude that a verdict in favor of the party against whom the motion is made is proper. Where a non-moving party produces sufficient evidence from which reasonable minds could find in its favor, a motion for directed verdict should be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">When reviewing a decision to grant or deny a motion for JNOV, this Court also applies the same standard as the trial court. <em>Athay v. Rich Cnty., </em>153 Idaho 815, 825, 291 P.3d 1014, 1024 (2012).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">A jury verdict must be upheld if there is evidence of sufficient quantity and probative value that reasonable minds could have reached a similar conclusion to that of the jury. In reviewing a grant or denial of a motion for JNOV the court may not reweigh evidence, consider witness credibility, or compare its factual findings with that of the jury. The court reviews the facts as if the moving party had admitted any adverse facts, drawing reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcJ\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hall v. Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co., </em>145 Idaho 313, 324, 179 P.3d 276, 287 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">V. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">A. The District Court Did Not Err In Denying Defendants\u2019 Motion For A Directed Verdict And JNOV On ABI\u2019s Fraud Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">ABI pursued its fraud claim based on three representations: (1) CBI owned a library of computer files worth at least one million dollars; (2) CBI developed proprietary software; and (3) ABI could cease its monthly payments to CBI if Christa died before ABI completed the payments. The nine elements of a fraud claim are: \u201c(1) a statement or a representation of fact; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of its falsity; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent that there be reliance; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the falsity of the statement; (7) reliance by the hearer; (8) justifiable reliance; and (9) resultant injury.\u201d <em>Bank of Commerce v. Jefferson Enters., LLC, </em>154 Idaho 824, 833, 303 P.3d 183, 192 (2013) (quoting <em>Chavez v. Barrus, </em>146 Idaho 212, 223, 192 P.3d 1036, 1047 (2008)). \u201cFraud is to be determined from all the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Ireton, </em>57 Idaho 466, 482, 65 P.2d 1032, 1039 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">1. <em>There was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Defendants committed fraud through their representation to ABI that ABI purchased from CBI a library of computer files worth at least one million dollars.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">Defendants argue that any representation by Rammell or CBI as to the value or ownership of the library of files was an opinion, not a fact. This Court concludes that Rammell\u2019s and CBI\u2019s representations fall into an exception to the general rule that fraud cannot be based on an opinion or prediction. Defendants also argue that ABI failed to show any damages from the fraudulent statements. This Court concludes that ABI presented sufficient evidence of damages to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">a. <em>It was reasonable to conclude from the evidence that Rammell and CBI knowingly made false representations with the intent to induce ABI into purchasing CBI.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">In general, \u201cthe representation forming the basis of a claim for fraud must concern past or existing material facts.\u201d <em>Maroun v. Wyreless Sys., Inc., </em>141 Idaho 604, 615, 114 P.3d 974, 985 (2005) (quoting <em>Magic Lantern Prods., Inc. v. Dolsot, </em>126 Idaho 805, 807, 892 P.2d 480, 482 (1995)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cOpinions and predictions cannot form the basis of a fraud claim because they do not speak to matters of fact.\u201d <em>Country Cove Dev., Inc. v. May, </em>143 Idaho 595, 601, 150 P.3d 288, 294 (2006). Thus, \u201ca representation consisting of promise or a statement as to a future event will not serve as basis for fraud, even though it was made under circumstances as to knowledge and belief which would give rise to an action for fraud had it related to an existing or past fact.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Idaho Inv. Corp., </em>95 Idaho 113, 122, 504 P.2d 386, 395 (1972). Similarly, \u201c[o]pinions or predictions about the anticipated profitability of a business are usually not actionable as fraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The Court has recognized two exceptions to the general rule that fraud cannot be based on an opinion or prediction of future events. <em>Gillespie v. Mountain Park Estates, LLC, </em>142 Idaho 671, 673-74, 132 P.3d 428, 430-31 (2006). One exception exists \u201cwhere a false prediction or opinion is given with the intent to mislead.\u201d <em>Country Cove Dev., </em>143 Idaho at 601, 150 P.3d at 294. Under this exception, the speaker makes \u201cthe promise without any intent to keep it, but to induce action on the part of the promisee.\u201d <em>Gillespie, </em>142 Idaho at 674, 132 P.3d at 431. For example, this exception is triggered \u201cwhere a speaker gives an opinion when he is aware of facts incompatible with such opinion ... made with the intention of deceiving or misleading.\u201d <em>Country Cove Dev., </em>143 Idaho at 601, 150 P.3d at 294 (quoting <em>Jordan v. Hunter, </em>124 Idaho 899, 907, 865 P.2d 990, 998 (Ct.App.1993)). Similarly, this exception occurs \u201c[w]here actual value is known and false statements are knowingly made with intention to deceive, and do deceive the parties to whom they are made____ Such statements are not expressions of opinion but are statements of material facts.\u201d <em>Fox v. Cosgriff, </em>66 Idaho 371, 380, 159 P.2d 224, 227 (1945). The second exception exists where \u201cthe promise was accompanied by statements of existing fact which show the promisor\u2019s ability to perform the promise and those statements were false.\u201d <em>Gillespie, </em>142 Idaho at 674, 132 P.3d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In this case, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Rammell\u2019s and CBI\u2019s representations that CBI owned a library of files worth at least one million dollars were more than mere opinions or predictions. These representations fall under the first exception for false opinions with the intent to mislead. The evidence showed that Rammell and Christa valued the business at $40,000 to their attorney in 1999, and they believed that the business had little value without Christa. The evidence also showed that Rammell stated in his deposition prior to consulting with his attorney that he had no understanding of whether CBI owned the files. Yet, according to April, Rammell and Christa told her that she was purchasing from CBI a library of files worth at least one million dollars. In addition, the evidence showed that one of Rammell and Christa\u2019s motives for the sale was to secure a retirement income. Based on this evidence presented at trial, reasonable minds could conclude that Rammell and Christa, motivated to secure a retirement income, provided a false opinion of the value and ownership of the library of files with the intent to induce April to purchase the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">b. <em>It was reasonable to conclude from the evidence that ABI had a resultant injury and incurred damages from Rammell\u2019s and CBI\u2019s fraudulent statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">\u201cIn order to secure relief on a basis of fraud, the party seeking redress must have been damaged, injured or harmed as a result of the asserted fraud. A false representation which causes no loss is not actionable.\u201d <em>Bryant Motors, Inc. v. Am. States Ins.

Jukich, </em>73 Idaho 301, 308, 251 P.2d 542, 546 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In this case the jury was instructed to \u201cdetermine the amount of money that will reasonably and fairly compensate ABI for any damages provided by the evidence to have resulted from the breach or fraud.\u201d The jury also was instructed against awarding duplicative damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The Court finds that April\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence of ABI\u2019s damages from Defendants\u2019 fraud. April testified that she could not sell the business because, in her opinion, it had no value without ownership of the library of files. The evidence showed that ABI agreed to pay CBI $1,152,000 over eight years, and paid only $708,000 due to Christa\u2019s death. April stated that the value of CBI when it transitioned to ABI was $250,000 plus $600 for the Page-Maker software and $3,500 for office equipment, which totals to $254,100. Defendants offered no evidence to refute or challenge the $254,100 value. Taking the difference of the $254,100 value with the $708,000 payment, April testified that ABI had a claim for \u201cabout $455,000,\u201d an out-of-pocket calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Defendants showed that ABI recouped the money it paid for CBI and that April was successfully running the business. Defendants also showed that April believed that she would sell the files with the business if she ever sold ABI. In other words, she would not sell the files independently. She acknowledged that CBI told her she could sell the business like it was sold to her: to a third party to continue business with Rutter with the same files. April agreed that she had not tried to sell the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Defendants focus on ABI\u2019s ability to sell the business in the future as the measure of damages. They claim that ABI was not injured by any fraudulent statements because no evidence showed that ABI could not sell the business to a third party in the way that CBI was sold to her. The flaw in Defendants\u2019 argument is their assumption that a future sale is the only way to calculate damages. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury could have calculated damages in other ways. The jury reasonably could have concluded that ABI\u2019s injury was not in its inability to sell the files independent of the business, but in its purchase of a business worth much less than its represented value. Put another way, the jury reasonably could have determined that ABI was injured because CBI knowingly overcharged ABI, and, although ABI profited from the business, ABI still overpaid based on CBI\u2019s misrepresentations. In sum, the evidence showed that ABI believed it was purchasing a business with property worth at least one million dollars, but learned later that the business was worth only $254,100 without any ownership rights to the represented property.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The resolution of this damages issue, like many other issues in this case, depended on which witnesses the jury found credible. Based on the evidence, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude April\u2019s testimony of the business\u2019 value was credible, especially con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sidering that Defendants offered no contrary-evidence. The Court concludes that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to calculate an award of damages based on ABI\u2019s purchase of a business with a misrepresented value.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Based on the above reasons, the Court holds that the district court did not err in denying Defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and JNOV on the fraud claims because reasonable minds could conclude from the evidence presented at trial that ABI was defrauded by Rammell and CBI regarding their purported ownership of a library of files worth at least one million dollars. This Court declines to review whether the evidence also was sufficient for the jury to find fraud based on the proprietary software because there was sufficient evidence of fraud based solely on the library of files.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">B. The District Court Did Not Err In Issuing A Remittitur And Denying In Part Defendants\u2019 Motion For A Directed Verdict And JNOV On ABI\u2019s Breach of Contract and Breach Of Warranty Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">For the breach of warranty claims, the jury was instructed that ABI had the burden to prove: (1) CBI made a warranty as part of the sale of the business; (2) CBI breached the warranty; (3) ABI incurred damage due to the breach; and (4) the amount of damages. The jury instruction explained \u201cexpress warranty\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">An express warranty is a warranty created by words or actions of the seller. Express warranties may be created by affirmation of fact or promises made by the seller to the buyer relating to the goods that become the basis of the bargain; (2) a description of the goods that becomes part of the bargain; (3) a sample or model made part of the basis of the bargain____ An affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller\u2019s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">This explanation of express warranty mirrors I.C. \u00a7 28-2-313. \u201cWhether a statement by the seller was an express warranty is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Keller v. Inland Metals All Weather Conditioning, Inc., </em>139 Idaho 233, 237, 76 P.3d 977, 981 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">The two warranties at issue at trial pertained to CBI\u2019s ability to transfer to ABI (1) ownership of the library of files and (2) the proprietary software. The jury found that both express warranties were breached by CBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">Regarding the library of files, there was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to conclude that CBI warranted more than a mere affirmation of the value of the files. The evidence showed that CBI informed ABI that ABI would have ownership of files worth at least one million dollars by purchasing the business. Reasonable minds could conclude that this warranty was more than the mere value of the business because ownership of the library of files represented to ABI that it had some security in its business relationship with Rutter. The evidence showed that ABI believed it could charge Rutter for return of the files if Rutter ceased doing business with ABI. The promise of ownership also suggested to ABI that it could sell the files to a third party with the business and, as such, those files had an additional value separate from the other business assets. Based on the evidence presented at trial, reasonable minds could conclude that CBI made an express warranty to ABI regarding the library of files and this warranty was a basis of the purchase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Regarding the proprietary software, there also was sufficient evidence for the jury reasonably to conclude that CBI warranted that ABI would own unique software developed by CBI exclusively for servicing Rutter\u2019s publications. April testified that Christa informed her that she created proprietary software to work with Rutter. The evidence showed that ABI believed it would be purchasing this software to run the business efficiently and successfully without spending additional time and resources to recreate the software for Rutter. The evidence also showed that ABI knew it took CBI many years to develop the macros and commands specific to Rutter\u2019s typesetting needs. Like the ownership of the library of files, the ownership of the propriety software gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ABI security in its business relationship with Rutter. Therefore, the jury reasonably could have concluded that obtaining ownership of the proprietary software was an express warranty that formed a basis of the purchase agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Further, the evidence was sufficient for the conclusion that CBI breached both of these express warranties. Defendants focus on ABI\u2019s ability to sell the files to a third party, but Defendants ignore April\u2019s testimony that she believed she could charge Rutter for return of the files, which indicated that the files had value outside of a sale of the business. Additionally, reasonable minds could conclude that the evidence showed that ABI believed that Rutter would want to approve the purchaser, but ABI still had the authority to sell the files with the caveat that Rutter may not continue to do business with that purchaser. As to the proprietary software, the evidence showed that CBI breached its warranty because CBI did not develop any unique propriety software. Based on the evidence presented, reasonable minds could determine that CBI breached the express warranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">1. <em>The district court corrected any error in the jury\u2019s calculation of damages by issuing a remittitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In this case, the jury determined that ABI incurred $190,013 in damages due to CBI\u2019s \u201cbreach of contract and/or warranty as to the library of files, not otherwise awarded [for fraud],\u201d in addition to the $354,000 damages amount for fraud. The jury awarded no additional damages for CBI\u2019s breach of contract and breach of warranty due to the proprietary software.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The district court reduced the damages award for breach of contract and breach of warranty as to the library of files by $90,113 because the district court determined that that sum was in excess of the total amount of damages shown by ABI at trial. ABI accepted the remittitur. As such, CBI was liable for $99,900 in damages for breach of contract and breach of warranty and jointly and severally liable for $354,000 for fraud. The damages against CBI totaled to $453,900, which was the difference between the $708,000 sum paid by ABI and the $254,100 value of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">\u201cA new trial is warranted where the jury\u2019s determination of damages appears to have resulted from passion or prejudice.\u201d <em>Kuhn v. Coldwell Banker Landmark, Inc., </em>150 Idaho 240, 248, 245 P.3d 992, 1000 (2010) (citing <em>Quick v.

An alternative to granting a new trial based on excessive damages is a remittitur. <em>Quick, </em>111 Idaho at 770, 727 P.2d at 1198. Remittiturs are limited to correcting errors in damages. <em>Id. </em>Remittiturs are improper \u201cif the verdict was the result of passion or prejudice to such an extent that such passion or prejudice may have infected the jury\u2019s decision on liability as well as damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cHence, the amount by which the trial judge offers to reduce the damage award is a discretionary decision that is inexorably linked to the exercise of discretion in ruling on a new trial motion under I.R.C.P. 59(a)(5).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">The Court first highlights that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude, based on the evidence, that ABI incurred damages from the breach of contract and express warranty claims. Reasonable minds could determine that ABI agreed to purchase the business for $1,152,000 because CBI warranted that ABI would receive a library of files worth at least one million dollars and unique proprietary software developed by Christa over many years. The evidence then showed that ABI learned that CBI did not create any software after ABI paid $420,000 and ABI learned that CBI did not own the library of files after ABI paid $708,000. April\u2019s testimony, which was not contradicted by Defendants, provided that the actual value of the business at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>time of the transition to ABI was $254,100. The jury also was provided with ABI\u2019s documentation of payments to CBI, Rammell\u2019s projected business cash flow, and testimony regarding the profits and expenses of ABI. Due to the conflicting testimony and credibility determinations, there were multiple means by which the jury could have calculated and divided damages in a reasonable manner based on sufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Although there was sufficient evidence on the issue of damages for the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims, the district court concluded that the jury awarded excessive damages based on passion and prejudice. As such, the district court issued a remittitur for the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims as to the library of files. This decision was reasonable based on the evidence presented at trial, and it corrected any error in the jury verdict. The Court recognizes that the jury could have been influenced by passion and prejudice due to the evidence presented at trial. However, the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice does not invalidate the jury\u2019s verdict. There was sufficient evidence of Defendants\u2019 liability for breach of contract and breach of warranty to avoid any infection from the jury\u2019s passion and prejudice as to damages. Many issues in this case turned on the credibility determinations made by the jury. Reasonable minds could conclude based on the evidence that Defendants were liable for the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims without any influence of passion or prejudice. The Court concludes that any error in the jury\u2019s award of damages for breach of contract and breach of warranty as to the library of files was properly resolved by the district court\u2019s remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">In conclusion, the Court holds that the district court properly ruled on Defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict and JNOV regarding the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">C. The District Court Did Not Err In Denying Defendants\u2019 Motion For JNOV On ABI\u2019s Breach Of Contract And Breach Of Warranty Claims Due To The Statute Of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">ABI filed its suit on May 8, 2009, and the jury concluded that ABI\u2019s breach of contract and breach of warranty claims were not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Based on the evidence presented at trial, the Court finds that reasonable minds could have reached a similar conclusion to that of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">For the claims based on the library of files, the jury was instructed that ABI had four years to bring the claims and that the claims began \u201cto run from the time ABI knew of the Rutter Group\u2019s claim of ownership interest in the library of files.\u201d The evidence reasonably supports a conclusion that April interpreted the caveat that Rutter had to approve the sale of the business to a third party to mean that Rutter had to approve the purchaser, and not necessarily that CBI or ABI did not have ownership of the files. Additionally, the jury could have concluded that \u201cownership\u201d included not only ABI\u2019s ability to sell the files, but also ABI\u2019s ability to charge Rutter for return of the files if Rutter ceased to do business with ABI. According to April, she did not learn until late 2008 that ABI had no ownership of the files and could not charge Rutter to return the files. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that ABI had knowledge of Rutter\u2019s ownership in late 2008 and filed its suit within the four year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">For the claims based on the proprietary software, the jury was instructed that the claims began \u201cto run from the time the Parties entered into the contract,\u201d but \u201cestoppel may apply to bar the application of the statute of limitations to this claim.\u201d The district court further instructed the jury on the estoppel elements. The evidence showed that April waited to read the manual until November of 2006, but also that April relied on an information technology employee and Christa as a consultant. The evidence also showed that the macros and commands in PageMaker took years to develop. Additionally, April testified that Christa told her that she created the proprietary software. April\u2019s belief that Christa created the software was further supported by Christa\u2019s statements at the Idaho Falls Exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Club, which were corroborated by Hall. This evidence supports a conclusion that it would be reasonable for April to believe Christa developed the proprietary software and to wait to read the manual until necessary. Moreover, the reasonableness of ABI\u2019s actions was a determination for the jury. Based on the evidence presented, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that estoppel barred the application of the statute of limitations and that ABI acted with due diligence in asserting its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">D. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion By Admitting April\u2019s Testimony Regarding Christa\u2019s Will.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">ABI inquired into April\u2019s inheritance during April\u2019s testimony regarding her meeting with Rammell and Christa about the purchase of CBI. Defendants objected to this line of questioning pursuant to Idaho Rule of Evidence (I.R.E.) 601. The district court took up Defendants\u2019 objection outside the presence of the jury. The district court recognized an overlap between ABI\u2019s claim against Christa\u2019s estate for fraud and ABI\u2019s claims against CBI for fraud, breach of contract, and breach of warranty. The district court determined that the rules of evidence permitted April\u2019s testimony about Christa\u2019s \u25a0will as it related to ABI\u2019s claims against CBI, but not as it related to ABI\u2019s fraud claim against Christa. Upon the jury\u2019s return to the courtroom, the district court gave a limiting instruction before April continued her testimony and advised the jury that CBI \u201cis a different entity\u201d than Christa\u2019s estate. The district court instructed the jury that April\u2019s testimony of Christa\u2019s will was not admissible evidence for purposes of supporting a claim against Christa\u2019s estate. April then testified about statements Christa made to her about April\u2019s inheritance, her ownership of the business, and payment cessation upon Christa\u2019s death. The district court also provided a jury instruction regarding this testimony for deliberations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">In this ease, certain evidence was admitted for a limited purpose. Specifically, the testimony of April Beguesse as to statements made by Christa Beguesse may not be considered as evidence in supporting a claim against the Estate of Christa Beguesse. Such evidence however may be used for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">Defendants challenge the district court\u2019s admission of April\u2019s testimony. They argue that April\u2019s testimony was inadmissible under I.R.E. 601 and irrelevant. Each issue will be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">1. <em>I.R.E. 601(b) does not prohibit April\u2019s testimony regarding Christa\u2019s will because ABI pursued claims against parties other than Christa\u2019s estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">I.R.E. 601(b) \u201cbars (1) certain persons from testifying (2) in specified actions (3) as to certain communications.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. Montgomery, </em>147 Idaho 1, 8, 205 P.3d 650, 657 (2009) (quoting <em>In re Estate of Keeven, </em>110 Idaho 452, 460, 716 P.2d 1224, 1232 (1986)). The rule \u201cprohibits] a party making a claim against an estate from testifying as to any unwritten communication with the deceased.\u201d <em>Lunders v. Estate of Snyder, </em>131 Idaho 689, 698-99, 963 P.2d 372, 381-82 (1998). \u201cI.R.E. 601(b) is virtually identical to I.C. \u00a7 9-202(3),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the so-called \u2018Deadman\u2019s Statute.\u2019 \u201c <em>Montgomery, </em>147 Idaho at 7-8, 205 P.3d at 656-57. \u201cGiven the virtual identity of the rule and statute,\u201d the Court applies the same analysis to the evidentiary rule and the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 205 P.3d at 657. \u201cApplication of a dead man\u2019s statute is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Lunders, </em>131 Idaho at 699, 963 P.2d at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The Court has \u201cnot interpreted this provision so broadly as to bar testimony concerning a state of affairs or matters of fact occurring before a decedent[\u2019]s death.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>147 Idaho at 8, 205 P.3d at 657. Additionally, I.R.E. 601(b) \u201cdoes not apply where ... the action is not against the executor or administrator of an estate and the claim does not represent a demand against the estate.\u201d <em>Rowan v. Riley, </em>139 Idaho 49, 54, 72 P.3d 889, 894 (2003). Nor does it apply \u201cwhen the testimony is being offered to defend against a counterclaim.\u201d <em>Lunders, </em>131 Idaho at 699, 963 P.2d at 382. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>allowing April\u2019s testimony because I.R.E. 601(b) allows a party to testify to unwritten communication with the deceased if the party\u2019s claim is not against the estate. For example, in <em>Argyle v. Slemaker </em>the plaintiff sought to testify regarding certain communications with the deceased in a property dispute. 99 Idaho 544, 545-46, 547, 585 P.2d 954, 955-56, 957 (1978). The plaintiff brought a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate and also the decedent\u2019s grantee, a third party corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 585 P.2d at 955-56. \u201cAn additional reason\u201d the Court held that the plaintiffs testimony was not barred was because the deadman\u2019s statute \u201cprohibits testimony introduced against the estate of a deceased person,\u201d but \u201cdoes not prohibit the admissibility of this evidence as against ... a corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547-48, 585 P.2d at 957-58. Similarly, April\u2019s testimony was prohibited as to her fraud claim against Christa\u2019s estate, but her testimony was not prohibited as to her claims against CBI. The district court recognized this distinction with the limiting instruction. Therefore, this Court concludes that the district court perceived the admissibility of April\u2019s testimony as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of that discretion consistent with I.R.E. 601, and reached its decision to admit the evidence through an exercise of reason. There was no error in admission of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">2. <em>April\u2019s testimony regarding Christa\u2019s will was relevant to ABI\u2019s claims against CBI.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe question of relevancy is not a discretionary matter as there is no issue of credibility or finding of fact for the trial court to resolve prior to deciding to admit or reject the evidence.\u201d <em>Lubcke v. Boise City/Ada Cnty. Hous. Auth., </em>124 Idaho 450, 466, 860 P.2d 653, 669 (1993). As such, the Court reviews a trial court\u2019s relevancy decision de novo. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Relevant Evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d I.R.E. 401. \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible.... Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d I.R.E. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Defendants argue that April\u2019s testimony regarding Christa\u2019s will was irrelevant because (1) fraud cannot be premised on the promise to make a will and (2) the district court granted Defendants a directed verdict on the fraud claim based on CBI\u2019s representation that payments would cease upon Christa\u2019s death if within the eight-year purchase agreement. First, ABI\u2019s fraud claim against CBI was not premised on the promise to make a will, but rather on the representation by CBI that ABI could cease payments to CBI if Christa died within eight years of the business purchase. As discussed above, fraud may be premised on a promise if the speaker makes the promise with no intention to keep it, but to induce the promisee. <em>See Gillespie v. Mountain Park Estates, LLC, </em>142 Idaho 671, 673-74, 132 P.3d 428, 430-31 (2006). In this case, the jury could have considered April\u2019s testimony of Christa\u2019s will as evidence to support ABI\u2019s claim that CBI promised ABI it could cease payments if Christa died within eight years to induce ABI to purchase the business, even though CBI had no intention of allowing ABI to cease payments. In addition, April\u2019s testimony was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of terms of the oral contract between ABI and CBI. Second, the district court did not grant Defendants a directed verdict as to a fraud claim based on a representation regarding a promise of payment cessation upon Christa\u2019s death. In fact, the district court stated that it was not granting a directed verdict on that claim. Rather, the district court granted Defendants a directed verdict as to ABI\u2019s fraud claim that CBI\u2019s assets would be bequeathed to April upon Christa\u2019s death. Thus, the district court barred ABI from presenting evidence of Christa\u2019s will to prove a fraudulent representation of the existence of a will, but allowed ABI to present that same evidence to support a claim that CBI fraudulently represented the conditions for ABI to cease payment. April\u2019s testimony regarding Christa\u2019s will was admissible and relevant to ABI\u2019s breach of contract and fraud claims against CBI.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">E.
