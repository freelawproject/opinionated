Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">Appellant Irina N. Shea brought a negligence suit against Respondent Kevic Corporation (Kevie), d/b/a Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash, located in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho. Shea claimed that she was injured when she slipped and fell on ice near the exit of the car wash due to Kevic\u2019s negligence in allowing ice to build up near the ear wash exit or in failing to warn of the danger of ice buildup. The district court granted Kevic\u2019s motion to strike portions of the affidavit of Shea\u2019s attorney Henry Madsen and also granted Kevic\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Shea appeals these rulings. In addition, Shea appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her two motions for reconsideration. Kevie cross-appeals the district court\u2019s order denying its motion to strike portions of Shea\u2019s affidavit, which Shea had filed in support of her first motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">On November 14, 2011, Shea filed a complaint and demand for a jury trial against Kevic. Shea alleged that on January 22, 2011, she \u201csustained certain injuries as a result of a fall on the ice at the premises of\u2019 Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash, \u201cwhen she exited her vehicle to adjust her mirrors which had been moved during the ear wash.\u201d Shea asserted that Kevie was negligent in allowing ice to build up at Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash premises and in failing to warn or protect patrons from the ice. Shea sought over $30,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-19\">Kevie moved for summary judgment. Shea responded in opposition to Kevic\u2019s motion and submitted an affidavit of her attorney Madsen in support of her opposition. Kevic moved to strike portions of the affidavit and two of its accompanying exhibits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The district court granted Kevic\u2019s motion to strike and motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Shea moved for reconsideration. In support of her motion, Shea submitted her own affidavit. Kevic moved to strike Shea\u2019s affidavit, but the district court denied Kevic\u2019s motion. The district court also denied Shea\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The district court entered judgment in favor of Kevic.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Shea filed a second motion for reconsideration and Madsen submitted another affidavit in support of the motion. Kevic again moved to strike portions of the affidavit and its accompanying exhibits. The district court granted Kevic\u2019s motion. The district court also denied Shea\u2019s second motion for reconsideration and granted Kevic\u2019s motion for Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure (I.R.C.P.) 11 sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Shea appeals to this Court, asserting that the district court erred in (1) granting Kevic\u2019s motion for summary judgment; (2) granting Kevic\u2019s motions to strike; (3) denying Shea\u2019s first motion for reconsideration; and (4) denying Shea\u2019s second motion for reconsideration. Kevic cross-appeals, raising the issue of whether the district court erred in denying Kevic\u2019s motion to strike Shea\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">1. Whether the district court abused its discretion in granting Kevic\u2019s two motions to strike portions of Madsen\u2019s affidavits and accompanying exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">2. Whether the district court erred in granting Kevic\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">3. Whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Kevic\u2019s motion to strike Shea\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">4. Whether the district court erred in denying Shea\u2019s two motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">IV. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Ab9G\">A. Motions to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">\u201cSummary judgment proceedings are decided on the basis of admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Kvamme, </em>155 Idaho 692, 696, 316 P.3d 104, 108 (2013). Hence, \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence contained in affidavits and depositions in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment is a threshold matter before applying the liberal construction and reasonable inferences rule to determine whether the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact for trial.\u201d <em>Fragnella v. Petrovich, </em>153 Idaho 266, 271, 281 P.3d 103, 108 (2012). \u201cThis Court applies an abuse of discretion standard when determining whether testimony offered in connection with a motion for summary judgment is admissible.\u201d <em>Gem State Ins. Co. v. Hutchison, </em>145 Idaho 10, 15, 175 P.3d 172, 177 (2007). \u201cA trial court does not abuse its discretion if it (1) correctly perceives the issue as discretionary, (2) acts within the bounds of discretion and applies the correct legal standards, and (3) reaches the decision through an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Fragnella, </em>153 Idaho at 271, 281 P.3d at 108 (quoting <em>O\u2019Connor v. Harger Constr., Inc., </em>145 Idaho 904, 909, 188 P.3d 846, 851 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">\u201cIn an appeal from an order granting summary judgment, this Court\u2019s standard of review is the same as that used by the trial court in ruling on the motion.\u201d <em>Summers v. Cambridge Joint Sch. Dist. No. 432, </em>139 Idaho 953, 955, 88 P.3d 772, 774 (2004). Under I.R.C.P. 56, summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-17\">The party initially bringing the motion has the burden to prove that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. After the moving party meets this burden, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. This Court will construe the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party\u2019s favor. However, the adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations in the pleadings, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>must set forth by affidavit specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><em>Gagnon v. W. Bldg. Maint, Inc., </em>155 Idaho 112, 114-15, 306 P.3d 197, 199-200 (2013) (quoting <em>Boise Mode, LLC, v. Donahoe Pace &amp; Partners Ltd., </em>154 Idaho 99, 103-04, 294 P.3d 1111, 1115-16 (2013)). \u201cCircumstantial evidence can create a genuine issue of material fact____However, the non-moving party may not rest on a mere scintilla of evidence.\u201d <em>ParkWest Homes, LLC, v. Barnson, </em>154 Idaho 678, 682, 302 P.3d 18, 22 (2013) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">C. Motions to Reconsider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">As for motions to reconsider, we recently clarified that the standard of review was \u201cthe same standard of review used by the lower court in deciding the motion for reconsideration.\u201d Thus, when the district court grants summary judgment and then denies a motion for reconsideration, \u201cthis Court must determine whether the evidence presented a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment.\u201d This means the Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration de novo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\"><em>Bremer, LLC, v. E. Greenacres Irrigation Dist., </em>155 Idaho 736, 744, 316 P.3d 652, 660 (2013) (quoting <em>Fragnella, </em>153 Idaho at 276, 281 P.3d at 113).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">V. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Granting Kevic\u2019s Two Motions To Strike Portions Of Mad-sen\u2019s Affidavits And Accompanying Exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Kevic moved to strike two separate affidavits submitted by Madsen. The first affidavit was submitted with Shea\u2019s opposition to Kevic\u2019s motion for summary judgment (Madsen\u2019s first affidavit) and the second with Shea\u2019s second motion for reconsideration (Madsen\u2019s second affidavit). The district court granted both of Kevie\u2019s motions to strike portions of these affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">1. <em>The district court properly granted Kevic\u2019s motion to strike select portions of Madsen\u2019s first affidavit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">Kevic moved to strike two items in Mad-sen\u2019s first affidavit. The first item was part of the deposition testimony of Kevin Lett, the owner of Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash, regarding a photograph of the car wash exit that Lett was shown during the deposition. Lett testified to the following regarding the photograph, referred to as Plaintiffs Exhibit 8:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-15\">Q. (By Mr. Madsen) And with regards [sic] to Plaintiffs \u2014 can I have you take a look at Plaintiffs Exhibit 8? Do you recognize that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-17\">Q. And is that the exit from the car wash, also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-19\">Q. And what does Plaintiffs Exhibit\u2014 you don\u2019t know when that was taken, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-20\">A. I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-21\">Q. What does Plaintiffs Exhibit 8 depict? A. A wet exit area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-22\">Q. Does it also depict ice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-23\">MR. HANSEN: Object to the form. Lack of foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-24\">THE DEPONENT: I can\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t tell if it was ice or water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-25\">Q. (By Mr. Madsen) Does it \u2014 in your opinion looking at the picture, it\u2019s not smooth, is it? This surface isn\u2019t smooth with regard to the picture, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-26\">MR. HANSEN: Object to the form. Lack of foundation. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-27\">THE DEPONENT: I can\u2019t tell one way or the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-28\">Q. (By Mr. Madsen) Does the picture have somewhat of an icy look?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-29\">MR. HANSEN: Object to the form. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-30\">THE DEPONENT: Uh, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-31\">Kevic did not move to strike any other portion of Lett\u2019s deposition testimony provided in Exhibit A of Madsen\u2019s first affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The district court properly exercised its discretion in striking Lett\u2019s deposition testimony of the car wash photograph. \u201cAuthentication or identification of documentary evidence is a condition precedent to its admissibility.\u201d <em>Harris, Inc., v. Foxhollow Constr. &amp; Trucking, Inc., </em>151 Idaho 761, 770, 264 P.3d 400, 409 (2011) (citing Idaho Rule of Evidence (I.R.E.) 901). Pursuant to I.R.E. 901(a), authentication or identification \u201cis satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d I.R.E. 901(a). \u201cOne example of \u2018authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule\u2019 is \u2018testimony of a witness with knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to be.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Joy, </em>155 Idaho 1, 15, 304 P.3d 276, 290 (2013) (alteration in original) (quoting I.R.E. 901(b)(1)). \u201cPhotographs are generally admissible where the witness who identifies them testifies that they correctly portray relevant scenes or objects.\u201d <em>McKee v. Chase, </em>73 Idaho 491, 501, 253 P.2d 787, 792 (1953).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">This Court has held that changes in the conditions portrayed between the time of the event under investigation and the taking of the photograph do not render the photograph inadmissible if the changes can be explained by a witness, and if the changes are not of such a character as to render the photograph deceptive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Riksem v. Hollister, </em>96 Idaho 15, 16, 523 P.2d 1361, 1362 (1974). \u201cWhether there is a proper foundation upon which to admit evidence is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>151 Idaho at 770, 264 P.3d at 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Here the district court recognized that the car wash photograph was taken six days after the accident and that no testimony or other evidence showed that the photograph depicted the same conditions at the time of the accident. To the extent that the photograph was to depict the conditions at the time of the accident, the district court properly recognized that the photograph did not portray that relevant scene. The photograph may be admissible to show the general layout of the car wash, but the photograph was not submitted for that purpose. The district court applied the correct legal standards for authentication and identification and reached its decision to exclude this evidence through an exercise of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Further, to the extent that Shea claims that the conditions depicted in the photograph were evidence of an ongoing condition, the district court properly recognized that the photograph still lacked the proper foundation for admissibility. An ongoing condition of ice buildup cannot be evidenced by one example of \u201ca wet exit area\u201d with \u201csomewhat of an icy look\u201d at an unknown date and time, especially in light of the nature of the condition here. During introduction of the photograph, Shea developed no testimony from Kevic that showed that the conditions depicted in the photograph were indicative of an ongoing condition. The photograph is potentially deceptive if offered to prove an ongoing condition without any explanation showing that the conditions in the photograph actually represented the ongoing condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The second item Kevic moved to strike was a copy of a letter Madsen received from a senior claims adjuster with EMC Insurance Company, which was submitted as Exhibit C with Madsen\u2019s first affidavit. The letter, dated March 10, 2011, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">Dear Mr. Madsen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">I have completed my investigation of Irina Shea\u2019s slip and fall at Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash. I interviewed our insured, had an independent adjuster take photographs of the premise and diagram the area. You refused to allow me to interview Ms. Shea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">The car wash has an attendant at the beginning to collect the money and prep the car for the wash. The car then travels a conveyor to the exit. Ms. Shea drove just out of the car wash by the exit, stopped, and got out to unfold her door mirrors. Water from the wash had created ice just outside of the exit. Ms. Shea stepped on the ice, slipped and fell injuring herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">Our obligation is to pay claims which our insured has been shown to be negligent and, therefore, legally responsible. My in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>vestigation does not reveal any legal obligation Lett\u2019s Downtown Car Wash would have for Ms. Shea\u2019s bodily injury. There was ample parking off to the side of the building and she had been there on other occasions so was [sic] aware of the conditions in and around the ear wash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">We do have Medical Payments Coverage available for her medical treatment----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The district court properly exercised its discretion by striking the letter from EMC Insurance Company. A senior claims adjuster with EMC Insurance Company interviewed Kevie and reviewed photographs by an independent insurance adjuster to reach the conclusion that \u201cwater from the wash had created ice just outside of the exit,\u201d which caused Shea to fall. Shea introduced the senior claims adjuster\u2019s statement in the letter to prove the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 \u201cthere was ice on the ground at the exit of the ear wash.\u201d As hearsay, this statement is admissible only if it falls under a hearsay exception. I.R.E. 802. Shea claims that the statement falls under the business records exception pursuant to I.R.E. 803(6). This exception allows the trial court to admit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[a] memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, in any form, of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnoses, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the memorandum, report, record, or data compilation, all as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902(11), unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">I.R.E. 803(6). \u201cThe general requirements for the admission of business records are that the documents be \u2018produced in the ordinary course of business, at or near the time of occurrence and not in anticipation of trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hurtado v. Land O\u2019Lakes, Inc., </em>147 Idaho 813, 815, 215 P.3d 533, 535 (2009) (quoting <em>Beco Corp. v. Roberts &amp; Sons Constr. Co., </em>114 Idaho 704, 711, 760 P.2d 1120, 1127 (1988)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-10\">The records or reports sought to be admitted into evidence under the business records exception to the hearsay rule need not be authenticated by the person who made the records, but it is necessary that the records be authenticated by a person who has custody of the record as a regular part of his or her work or who has supervision of its creation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-11\"><em>Henderson v. Smith, </em>128 Idaho 444, 450, 915 P.2d 6, 12 (1996). Shea presented no evidence to qualify this letter for the business records exception. There is no testimony that the letter was produced in the ordinary course of business and not in anticipation of trial. The letter was not authenticated by any person who made the letter, had custody of the letter, or supervised its creation. Shea cannot invoke the business records exception to obtain admission of this letter into evidence. Also, the statement must be made \u201cby, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge.\u201d I.R.E. 803(6). There was no showing that the senior claims adjuster or the individuals interviewed by the adjuster had knowledge. The district court correctly recognized that Shea provided no foundation for the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and therefore the letter was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">2. <em>Shea waived her appeal of whether the district court erred in striking portions of Madsen\u2019s second affidavit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">Shea claimed in her notice of appeal that she intended to appeal the district court\u2019s decision to strike portions of Mad-sen\u2019s second affidavit, which was filed in support of Shea\u2019s second motion for reconsideration. In this affidavit, Madsen stated in paragraph three that he attached the complete deposition of Lett, not only select portions as submitted in his first affidavit. Kevie moved to strike all discussion in Lett\u2019s deposition of eight different photographs that Shea had shown Lett during the deposition, claiming that there was no foundation to admit these photographs and Lett\u2019s corresponding testimony. The district court granted Kevic\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Shea offers no argument or authority in her appellate brief on the issue of the district court\u2019s order to strike portions of Madsen\u2019s second affidavit. Shea has waived her appeal of this issue. Idaho Appellate Rule (I.A.R.) 35(a)(6); <em>Bach v. Bagley, </em>148 Idaho 784, 790, 229 P.3d 1146, 1152 (2010). We decline to address it and affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">B. The District Court Erred In Granting Summary Judgment To Kevic Because Shea Has Shown Genuine Issues Of Material Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The elements of a negligence claim are: \u201c(1) a duty, recognized by law, requiring the defendant to conform to a certain standard of conduct; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.\u201d <em>Cumis Ins. Soc\u2019y, Inc., v. Massey, </em>155 Idaho 942, 947-48, 318 P.3d 932, 937-38 (2014) (quoting <em>Nation v. State of Idaho, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>144 Idaho 177, 189, 158 P.3d 953, 965 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\u201cThe duty of a landowner to the person injured on the land turns on the status of the injured person.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Romine, </em>131 Idaho 537, 540, 960 P.2d 1266, 1269 (1998) (citing <em>Holzheimer v. Johannesen, </em>125 Idaho 397, 399, 871 P.2d 814, 816 (1994)). Kevic concedes that Shea had the status of an invitee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ear wash premises. As an invitee, the landowner owes a duty to the invitee \u201cto warn of hidden or concealed dangers and to keep the land in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d <em>Peterson, </em>131 Idaho at 540, 960 P.2d at 1269.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">To establish a prima facie negligence case, the invitee also must show that the landowner knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the alleged dangerous condition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-10\">The law is well settled in this state that, to hold an owner or possessor of land liable for injuries to an invitee caused by a dangerous condition existing on the land, it must be shown that the owner or occupier knew, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the existence of the dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-13\"><em>All v. Smith\u2019s Mgmt. Corp., </em>109 Idaho 479, 481, 708 P.2d 884, 886 (1985) (quoting <em>Tommerup v. Albertsons\u2019s, Inc., </em>101 Idaho 1, 3, 607 P.2d 1055, 1057 (1980)). For a nonrecurring or isolated incident, the invitee must show actual or constructive notice of the specific condition. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McDonald v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>109 Idaho 305, 308, 707 P.2d 416, 419 (1985); <em>Tommerup, </em>101 Idaho at 3-4, 607 P.2d at 1057-58). For a recurring or continuing condition, the invitee must show \u201cthat the operating methods of the landowner or possessor are such that dangerous conditions are continuous or easily foreseeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tommerup, </em>101 Idaho at 3-4, 607 P.2d at 1057-58).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">Even with a recurring or continuing condition, the invitee must show that the landowner had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition. For example, the plaintiff in <em>All </em>alleged that she was injured by falling into a pothole in the defendants\u2019 parking lot, but the plaintiff was unable to identify which specific pothole of many caused her injury. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 708 P.2d at 885. The Court determined that the district court improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 482, 708 P.2d at 887. The Court reasoned that the formation of potholes was not an isolated incident and therefore the plaintiff did not have to show the defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of the specific pothole. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt was enough to show that [the defendants] were aware of the continuous formation of potholes in the parking lot through the winter and spring\u201d of the year of the plaintiffs injury. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">In summary, the invitee must show actual or constructive knowledge on behalf of the landowner to establish a prima facie negligence claim regardless of the nature of the condition. The distinction between an isolated and continuing condition does not elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>nate the invitee\u2019s burden to establish the landowner\u2019s knowledge. In some cases it may be easier for the invitee to show knowledge when the alleged condition is recurring or continuous, but an allegation of a continuous condition does not extinguish the invitee\u2019s burden simply because the dangerous condition is regularly occurring. The invitee still must show that the landowner knew or should have known his operating methods caused or were likely to cause a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">In this case, Shea alleged in her complaint that Kevic \u201callowed ice to build up at the premises of Lett\u2019s Car Wash\u201d and that Kevic did not use any \u201cwarning signs, barriers, sanding or melting devices ... to warn or protect business patrons from the hazardous conditions.\u201d By \u201callowing the condition to exist and failing to warn or protect patrons,\u201d Shea claimed that Kevic was negligent. Shea also alleged that Kevic owed her a duty \u201cto protect her from such a fall by removing the ice from the premises or creating a barrier or warning to patrons about the icy conditions.\u201d According to Shea, Kevic \u201cbreached such duty by allowing the hazardous condition, failing to warn [Shea] of its existence, and failing to create a barrier to keep [Shea] from falling on the ice.\u201d Based on the evidence in the record, the Court holds that the district court erred in concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and granting summary judgment to Kevic.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Construing the record in the light most favorable to Shea and drawing all reasonable inferences in Shea\u2019s favor, the evidence creates a genuine issue of material fact as to Kevie\u2019s knowledge of the alleged dangerous condition. Shea testified in her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">Q. And when you were walking \u2014 when you got out of your car, when you first put your feet on the ground as you got out of the driver\u2019s seat, do you recall whether the ground was wet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">A. It was not wet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-8\">Q. Was it dry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">A. It was dry. Everything was just amazingly dry just like right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">Q. Okay, and when you walked around by the headlight\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">A. Yeah. When I was just making around first move, and apparently there was water trickling down from underneath my ear\u2014 from my ear wash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">Q. Was it water or was it ice or what was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">A. I don\u2019t know because when \u2014 I fell right away, and apparently it was slippery, so it was maybe water and ice all together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APT\">Shea also testified that, as she was \u201cgetting out of the car and putting the tip money and as [she] started to walk around,\u201d she did not see any snow or ice on the ground. Shea explained, \u201cThere was just nice weather, and everything was so dry. Nothing would suggest that it could be that.\u201d Shea stated that she did not see what she slipped on. She also stated that she did not notice any ice around her ear before or after she fell. After her fall, she explained, \u201cIt was so dry and nice.\u201d Shea also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-14\">Q. Your Complaint alleges that my client allowed ice to build up at the premises. What is the basis of that claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-15\">A. Well, can I ask Henry [Madsen] how\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-16\">Q. Let me ask it this way. Do you recall any build-up of ice at the time of the accident, at the time of the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-17\">A. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t see it. I\u2019ll, um \u2014 if I can add to it, unsure about physical process could be in this kind of weather conditions going on with the water on the surface. That would \u2014 for afterwards I thought it could be water and ice which wasn\u2019t really looking like ice. It could be all like together water and ice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-18\">Q. As I understood your testimony earlier, as near as you could tell where you walked was dry. Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-19\">A. It was. Where I \u2014 I mean the spot where I fell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-20\">In Lett\u2019s deposition, he stated that every car that comes out of the car wash \u201cis dripping a little water\u201d and he agreed that \u201cwhen it\u2019s cold ... the water that vehicles ... track from the car wash ... freezes.\u201d Lett also testified that \u201c[t]he employees are instructed to spread de-icer on the icy areas as needed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Lett discussed his actions and observations immediately following Shea\u2019s accident. Lett was working at the car wash the day of the accident, and he explained that an individual notified him that someone had fallen and broken their wrist in the car wash parking lot. Lett went over to the car wash exit and assisted the injured person, Shea, in getting out of the vehicle and obtaining medical treatment. During this discussion of the events following Shea\u2019s accident, Lett was asked, \u201cAnd at the exit of the ear wash that day what were the conditions like?\u201d He responded, \u201cIt was cold and icy.\u201d Shea provided in her response in opposition to Kevic\u2019s motion to strike portions of Madsen\u2019s first affidavit that the temperature on the day of her alleged accident ranged from 28.9 degrees Fahrenheit to 38.9 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The Court initially notes that Shea\u2019s deposition testimony that there was \u201cmaybe ice and water all together\u201d on the ground at the front of her vehicle does not establish Kevic\u2019s actual knowledge of the specific dangerous condition of ice buildup in front of Shea\u2019s car at the time of the accident. <em>See Giles v. Montgomery Ward Co., </em>94 Idaho 484, 485, 491 P.2d 1256, 1257 (1971) (plaintiffs claim of negligence based solely on his allegation that there was something slippery which caused him to fall did not establish that the defendant knew of the condition, or that the condition was of such a nature that the defendant, in exercising reasonable care for the safety of its customers, should have been aware). Nonetheless, there is more than a mere scintilla of evidence showing that Kevic had actual or constructive knowledge of the operating methods that would cause the dangerous condition of ice buildup.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The evidence, construed in Shea\u2019s favor, shows that: (1) vehicles drip water after exiting the car wash; (2) the water that vehicles track from the ear wash exit freezes when it is sufficiently cold; (3) Lett observed after being notified of Shea\u2019s injury that the conditions at the exit of the car wash on the day of Shea\u2019s injury were cold and icy; and (4) the employees are instructed to sprinkle de-icer if there is ice. It is reasonable to infer from this evidence that ice exists outside the car wash exit on certain cold days. It is also reasonable to infer that Kevic knew or should have known of the ice based on Lett\u2019s instruction to employees to de-ice the premises when necessary and Lett\u2019s general acknowledgment of ice on cold days. Additionally, the temperature the day of Shea\u2019s injury was below freezing at some point, but it is not known what the temperature was at the time and location where Shea fell. Although Shea has not shown that Kevic had actual knowledge of the specific ice buildup in front of Shea\u2019s car, and that it had existed for a sufficient time to allow warning or correction, this Court concludes that Shea has offered more than a scintilla of evidence to prove that Kevic had actual or constructive notice of operating methods that could cause a dangerous condition of ice buildup when and where Shea fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">With reasonable inferences construed in Shea\u2019s favor, this case possesses some similarities with <em>McDonald, </em>109 Idaho 305, 707 P.2d 416. In that case, the plaintiff presented evidence that she slipped on a cream-colored substance appearing to be melted ice cream at the defendant\u2019s grocery store and also that the defendant had an ice cream demonstration at the store that day. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 707 P.2d at 417. The Court concluded that \u201cthe record before the trial court permitted the reasonable inference that [the defendant] Safeway knew or should have known of the dangerous condition, that it had sufficient time to remedy the situation and that in the exercise of reasonable care, its employees should have cleaned the spill.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 707 P.2d at 418-19. The Court reasoned that an ice cream demonstration created a reasonable probability that ice cream would fall on the floor, melt, and cause individuals to slip. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 707 P.2d at 419 (discussing <em>Jasko v. F.W. Woolworth Co., </em>177 Colo. 418, 494 P.2d 839 (1972)). Thus, the defendants were on notice of that dangerous condition without having knowledge of the specific ice cream spill injuring the plaintiff. Like <em>McDonald, </em>it is reasonable to infer that by allowing vehicles to track water out of the car wash exit Kevic knew or should have known of a reasonable probability that the water would freeze on some cold days and cause individuals to slip.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Likewise, Shea\u2019s cause of action is similar to the plaintiffs pothole injury in <em>All, </em>109 Idaho 479, 708 P.2d 884. If Shea is able to establish that Kevic had knowledge that ice generally forms at the car wash exit on cold days, she does not need to prove that Kevic had knowledge of the specific ice buildup that caused her fall. <em>See id. </em>at 482, 708 P.2d at 887. It was enough for her to show at this stage in the proceedings that Kevic had knowledge of the \u201ccontinuous formation\u201d of ice buildup at the ear wash exit at certain times during the winter months. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">In summary, the district court erred in concluding that Shea had not met her burden to satisfy the knowledge requirement in her negligence action. Reasonable inferences in her favor show that Kevic had knowledge of operating methods that could create ice buildup at the car wash exit on cold days. Summary judgment to Kevic was in error due to the genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">C.The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion In Denying Kevic\u2019s Motion To Strike Shea\u2019s Affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">After the district court granted summary judgment to Kevic, Shea moved for reconsideration and submitted an affidavit in support of her motion. In this affidavit, Shea stated that there \u201cwas definitely ice on the ground\u201d in front of her car and that she slipped on it. She explained that she stated in her deposition that it was \u201cmaybe water and ice all together\u201d because she was unsure whether it was a combination of water and ice or just ice. Kevic moved to strike the affidavit. The district court denied Kevic\u2019s motion on the ground that Shea\u2019s deposition testimony was \u201cvague as to what she stated as to the cause for her fall.\u201d Kevic argues on cross-appeal that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">This Court finds that the district court acted within its discretion. \u201cA motion for reconsideration of any interlocutory orders of the trial court may be made at any time before the entry of final judgment but not later than fourteen (14) days after the entry of the final judgment.\u201d I.R.C.P. 11(a)(2)(B). Shea submitted her motion for reconsideration and supporting affidavit within this timeframe. \u201cOn a motion for reconsideration, the court must consider any new admissible evidence or authority bearing on the correctness of an interlocutory order.\u201d <em>Fragnella v. Petrovich, </em>153 Idaho 266, 276, 281 P.3d 103, 113 (2012). Kevic contends that Shea\u2019s affidavit is a sham affidavit that directly contradicts her deposition testimony. \u201cThis Court has never adopted the sham affidavit doctrine.\u201d <em>Major v. Sec. Equip. Corp., </em>155 Idaho 199, 206, 307 P.3d 1225, 1232 (2012). Hence, Kevic\u2019s contention is without merit. Further, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Shea\u2019s deposition was vague was reasonable. Shea testified that the ground was dry in the spot where she fell, but also that the ground was maybe water and ice all together and apparently slippery. It was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that Shea\u2019s affidavit might clarify the existing evidence in the record. Shea\u2019s deposition testimony and her affidavit filed in support of her motion for reconsideration are inconsistent and contradictory concerning the conditions on the ground where Shea fell, but those inconsistencies and contradictions are matters for cross-examination. It is the role of the jury to determine which of Shea\u2019s observations concerning the conditions where she fell are credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">D. This Court Will Not Address The Merits Of Shea\u2019s Two Motions For Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Shea also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her two motions for reconsideration. We find that the district court erred in denying Shea\u2019s motions for reconsideration in the sense that the district court declined to reconsider and vacate its erroneous decision. It is not necessary for this Court to further review the district court\u2019s decisions on Shea\u2019s motions to reconsider. This Court vacates the district court\u2019s judgment based on the district court\u2019s original error in granting Kevic summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">E. The Court Does Not Award Attorney\u2019s Fees On Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Both parties seek attorney\u2019s fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-121. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>statute \u201cprovides for the award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Chisholm v. Twin Falls Ctny., </em>139 Idaho 131, 136, 75 P.3d 185, 190 (2003). \u201cAn award of attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-121 is not a matter of right to the prevailing party, but is appropriate only when the court, in its discretion, is left with the abiding belief that the case was brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Michalk v. Michalk, </em>148 Idaho 224, 235, 220 P.3d 580, 591 (2009). There is no indication that this appeal was brought, pursued, or defended frivolously, unreasonably, or without foundation. Therefore, neither party is awarded attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The district court\u2019s rulings on Kevic\u2019s motions to strike Madsen\u2019s affidavits and Shea\u2019s affidavit are affirmed. The judgment of dismissal is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion. The Court does not award attorney\u2019s fees on appeal, but awards Shea costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b584-6\">Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices EISMANN, J.
