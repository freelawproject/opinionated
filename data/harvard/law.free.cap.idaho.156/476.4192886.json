JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">This appeal arises out of a products liability case. In early June of 2007, Karrin Massey consumed at least one, but perhaps several, poultry pot pies that were manufactured by ConAgra Food, Inc. and sold under the Banquet brand name. Soon after, Karrin, who was six months pregnant at the time, developed salmonellosis. After an outbreak of salmonella was linked to Banquet pot pies, it was discovered that Karrin\u2019s strain of salmonella matched the strain of salmonella found in the contaminated pot pies. Karrin, her husband, Mark Massey, and their daughter Emma filed suit against ConAgra, alleging claims of product liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. The district court eventually granted ConAgra\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Masseys had failed to establish the pot pies in question were defective. The Masseys filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied. The Masseys then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">In early May of 2007, the Centers for Disease Control (\u201cCDC\u201d) identified a salmonella outbreak in several states, including Idaho. After an extensive investigation, the most likely source of the outbreak was identified as pot pie filling that was manufactured by ConAgra and marketed as part of the Banquet brand.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">Appellant Karrin Massey had long enjoyed pot pies as part of her diet. In the first part of June, 2007, Ms. Massey consumed one or more Banquet pot pies. Ms. Massey does not remember if she cooked the pot pies in the oven or in the microwave. She testified that she usually \u2014 but not always \u2014 cooked them in the oven, and that she \u201calways followed [cooking] time instructions.\u201d During the first week of June, Ms. Massey began to experience diarrheal symptoms and was hospitalized twice due to dehydration. On June 10, 2007, a stool sample was cultured for salmonella. The sample tested positive, and Ms. Massey was hospitalized on June 13 for treatment. On June 14, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (\u201cIDHW\u201d) interviewed her in hopes of determining a possible source of her infection. At this time, Ms. Massey was approximately six months pregnant with her daughter, Emma. Because she was pregnant, Ms. Massey declined to take certain medications that may have been more effective in treating salmonellosis, but could have harmed her unborn child. Emma Grace Massey was born on October 3, 2007. On appeal, the Masseys do not delve into how Emma was injured, although ConAgra notes that Emma\u2019s birth itself was without complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-21\">Ms. Massey was treated for salmonellosis until approximately September 4, 2007, at which time three consecutive stool samples tested negative for the presence of salmonel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>la. Ms. Massey\u2019s particular strain of bacteria was later identified as salmonella ent\u00e9rica, serovar 4, 5,12:i:-monophasic.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">According to the Masseys, near the end of 2007, CDC investigators collected samples of pot pie crust and filling at ConAgra\u2019s plant, which were found to contain salmonella ent\u00e9rica, serovar 4, 5, 12:i:-, the same strain present in Ms. Massey\u2019s stool sample. Con-Agra disputes this, stating that in fact, \u201cno salmonella was ever found within ConAgra\u2019s pot pie facility.\u201d In any event, salmonella ent\u00e9rica, serovar 4, 5, 12:i:-, the same strain present in Ms. Massey\u2019s stool sample, was later found in Banquet pot pies sampled from a Boise store.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Ms. Massey and her husband Mark filed a complaint on April 2, 2010, individually and on behalf of their daughter Emma. Therein, they alleged claims based on product liability, breach of warranty, and negligence. On March 21, 2012, ConAgra moved for summary judgment, alleging that the Masseys\u2019 claims were barred because of the statute of limitations and that the Masseys could not establish that the pot pies in question were defective. The district court, upon request, granted the Masseys a continuance so that they could depose Dr. Leslie Tengelsen, an Idaho State Deputy Epidemiologist. Shortly after Dr. Tengelsen\u2019s deposition was taken, ConAgra filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. The district court held a hearing on ConAgra\u2019s renewed motion on June 4, 2012. In its resulting July 3, 2012 order (\u201cSummary Judgment Order\u201d), the district court found in ConAgra\u2019s favor, holding that the Masseys had failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether a product defect existed. The Masseys filed a timely motion for reconsideration, arguing that the district court misunderstood the main issue of the case and misconstrued certain facts. The district court entered an order denying the Masseys\u2019 motion on September 28, 2012 (\u201cOrder Re: Motion for Reconsideration\u201d). The Masseys filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">I.Whether the district court erred in determining that the Masseys failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the pot pies were defective?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">II.

Spokesman-Review, </em>138 Idaho 249, 251, 61 P.3d 606, 608 (2002). Under I.R.C.P. 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c).

Summary judgment is not appropriate \u201c[i]f the evidence is conflicting on material issues, or if reasonable minds could reach different conclusions.\u201d <em>Peterson v. Romine, </em>131 Idaho 537, 540, 960 P.2d 1266, 1269 (1998).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-18\"><em>Liberty Northwest Ins. Co. v. Spudnik Equip. Co., LLC, </em>155 Idaho 730, 732-33, 316 P.3d 646, 648-49 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Additionally, this Court has recently clarified the standard of review utilized in reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider. \u201c[W]hen the district court grants summary judgment and then denies a motion for reconsideration, \u2018this Court must determine whether the evidence presented a genuine issue of material fact to defeat summary judgment.\u2019 This means the Court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration de novo.\u201d <em>Bremer, LLC v. E. Greenacres Irrigation Dist., </em>155 Idaho 736, 744, 316 P.3d 652, 660 (2013) (quoting <em>Fragnella v. Petrovich, </em>153 Idaho 266, 276, 281 P.3d 103, 113 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">B. The district court erred in determining that the Masseys failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the pot pies were defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In their complaint, the Masseys put forth three claims: products liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. In order \u201c[t]o establish a <em>prima facie </em>case in a products liability action, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that \u20181) he was injured by the product; 2) the injury was the result of a defective or unsafe product; and 3) the defect existed when the product left the control of the manufacturer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Liberty, </em>155 Idaho at 733, 316 P.3d at 649 <em>(quoting Farmer v. Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>97 Idaho 742, 746-47, 553 P.2d 1306, 1310-11 (1976)). The district court granted summary judgment on the grounds that the Masseys did not show that a genuine issue of material fact existed with regard to whether the pot pies were defective. In its Summary Judgment Order, the district court determined that \u201c[a] pot pie contaminated with salmonella is not defective because salmonella in an uncooked or under cooked product is not considered an adulterant.\u201d The district court explained that \u201c[e]ven assuming that a pot pie eaten by Massey was contaminated by salmonella, the deposition testimony of Dr. Tengelsen clearly fails to establish that a pot pie contaminated with salmonella is defective.\u201d The district court also concluded that a Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) investigation and its \u201cconclusions drawn therefrom does not determine that any of the pot pies were adulterated, and therefore, defective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The Masseys argue that Karrin\u2019s affidavit established a defect under Idaho law, that Dr. Tengelsen\u2019s testimony did the same, and that the district court erred in its analysis of certain nonbinding case law. ConAgra disputes all of these assertions, and adds that the district court did not err in failing to find evidence of a defect based on USDA guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u201c[T]he term \u2018defect\u2019 is not susceptible of a general definition but must be considered on a case by case basis.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>97 Idaho at 747, 553 P.2d at 1311. In defining what constitutes a defect, this Court has favorably quoted the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 402A (comment g 1965) as follows: \u201cDefective condition. The rule stated in this Section applies only where the product is, at the time it leaves the seller\u2019s hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Comment i to \u00a7 402A defines \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d as \u201cdangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court has also quoted Prosser on Torts for the proposition that \u201c \u2018the prevailing interpretation of \u201cdefective\u201d is that the product does not meet the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer as to its safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Prosser, Torts, \u00a7 99, p. 659 (4th ed.1971)). A defect can be shown either by direct evidence, or by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA circumstantial evidence showing under the <em>Farmer </em>case [requires] proof of: (1) the malfunction of the product; (2) the lack of evidence of abnormal use; and (3) proof excluding the possibility of other \u2018reasonable causes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doty v. Bishara, </em>123 Idaho 329, 332, 848 P.2d 387, 390 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">When circumstantial evidence is presented, it is the trier of fact who \u201cis invited to infer the existence of a defect.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Conchemco, Inc., </em>111 Idaho 851, 852, 727 P.2d 1279, 1280 (Ct.App.1986). Furthermore, the defect may be established solely based upon the \u201c[t]estimony of the user [or] operator of the product as to the circumstances of the event.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>97 Idaho at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>748, 553 P.2d at 1312. This Court has explicitly refused to require a plaintiff to proffer expert testimony as part of its <em>prima facie </em>products liability case, stating: \u201c[t]hough it is no doubt true that a plaintiff may bolster his or her case considerably through the use of expert testimony, we nevertheless decline to require such expert testimony for the establishment of a plaintiffs prima facie case.\u201d <em>Fouche v. Chrysler Motors Corp., </em>107 Idaho 701, 704, 692 P.2d 345, 348 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The district court erred in its analysis of what constitutes a product defect under Idaho law. Specifically, it was error to equate \u201cdefective\u201d with \u201cadulterated.\u201d The origin and rationale behind using these terms interchangeably is unclear, although it was the Masseys who first made mention of the term in their complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAdulterated\u201d is a defined term under Chapter 10 of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 453, a federal statute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 453.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Generally, Chapter 10 discusses \u201cPoultry and Poultry Products Inspection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No link exists between a defined term in a federal statute and what constitutes a product defect under Idaho law; thus, the district court\u2019s erroneous assumption to the contrary was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Instead of determining that a pot pie must be \u201cadulterated\u201d to be defective, the district court should have looked to existing ease law to determine what constitutes a product defect in Idaho. Under <em>Farmer, </em>a defect can be established solely based on the testimony of the user.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, Karrin testified that (1) she ate at least one and possibly several Banquet brand pot pies during the last part of May and the first part of June; (2) despite not remembering whether she cooked those pot pies in the microwave or oven, she \u201calways followed time instructions\u201d on the box; (3) she was diagnosed with salmonellosis on June 13, 2007; and (4) her particular strain of salmonella was later found in Banquet brand pot pies. As for whether there was proof of the lack of evidence of abnormal use and the lack of other reasonable causes \u2014 which again is required under <em>Farmer </em>when making a showing of circumstantial evidence \u2014 those are questions best answered by a jury, since it is the trier of fact who \u201cis invited to infer the existence of a defect.\u201d In this case, the Masseys requested a jury trial. Based on Karrin\u2019s testimony alone, a jury could reasonably conclude that a pot pie cooked according to the instructions that nonetheless retains salmonella bacteria is \u201cdangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer,\u201d \u201cdoes not meet the reasonable expectations of the ordinary consumer as to its safety,\u201d and is therefore defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">Because the district court erred in its analysis of what constitutes a product defect under Idaho law, and because a jury could reasonably conclude that Karrin\u2019s testimony sufficiently demonstrated product defect, we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">C. The district court erred in granting summary judgment on the issue of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">The district court also granted summary judgment on the Masseys\u2019 negligence claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>again because of a failure to show product defect. On appeal, the Masseys seem to be arguing that because the Idaho pattern jury instruction for negligence does not make mention of the term \u201cdefect,\u201d a negligence claim does not require that element.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Regardless of whether a products liability case \u201cis based on warranty, negligence or strict products liability, plaintiff has the burden of alleging and proving that 1) he was injured by the product; 2) the injury was the result of a defective or unsafe product; and 3) the defect existed when the product left the control of the manufacturer.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>97 Idaho at 746-47, 553 P.2d at 1310-11. Thus, product defect is a necessary element in a products liability case that is based on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Because we hold that the district court erred in its product defect analysis, the Masseys\u2019 negligence claim survives. We thus vacate the district court\u2019s decision as to the Masseys\u2019 negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">D. The Masseys did not waive their right to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">In its response brief, ConAgra asserts that because the Masseys \u201cnever challenge or request this court to reverse\u201d the district court\u2019s Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration, the Masseys have waived both the right to contest that order, as well as the right to make any arguments on appeal that were first made in their memorandum in support of their motion for reconsideration. The Masseys reply that the district court\u2019s two orders \u2014 its Summary Judgment Order and its Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration \u2014 are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d because the Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration essentially just reiterates what had already been decided in the previous Summary Judgment Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">For its assertion that the Masseys waived some of their arguments, ConAgra relies on the following oft-cited rule and other variations thereof: \u2018When issues cited on appeal are not supported by propositions of law, authority, or argument, they will not be considered.\u201d <em>Langley v. State Indus. Spec. Indem. Fund, </em>126 Idaho 781, 784, 890 P.2d 732, 735 (1995). ConAgra states that the Masseys\u2019 \u201cwaiver is further highlighted by their omission of the appropriate standard of review that\u201d guides this Court when analyzing orders granting or denying motions to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">This argument is unpersuasive. The notice of appeal and a subsequent amended notice both indicate that the Masseys are appealing both the Summary Judgment Order and the Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration. Moreover, the contents of both orders are much the same, with one exception. In its Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration, the district court addressed for the first time the issue of whether the Masseys sufficiently pleaded a failure to warn claim. The Masseys have unequivocally raised the appropriateness of this holding as an issue on appeal. ConAgra cites to no authority that holds the omission of one of the applicable standards of review constitutes a waiver of that argument when that argument is otherwise made within the appellate brief. The Masseys are obviously disputing the holdings in the district court\u2019s Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration, and while they may have omitted the applicable standard of review, that does not constitute a waiver of the arguments that they otherwise supported with authority and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">E. The district court erred in finding that the Masseys\u2019 failure to warn claim was not adequately pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">The Masseys argue that the district court erred in its Order Re: Motion to Reconsider when it determined, <em>sua sponte, </em>that the Masseys did not adequately plead a failure to warn claim. The Masseys allege that the factual allegations within the complaint put ConAgra on actual notice that a failure to warn claim was being made. ConAgra counters that \u201c[i]n reality, Appellants did not even attempt to suggest they had [pleaded] such a claim until after the [district [c]ourt had granted [s]ummary [judgment and Appellants realized they had no evidence of product defect.\u201d ConAgra\u2019s full response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>this argument takes up a half page and is devoid of any legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">In its Order Re: Motion for Reconsideration, the district court stated: \u201cIt is obvious at this point that Plaintiffs are making a standard failure to warn argument----However, Plaintiffs failed to plead a failure to warn claim in their Complaint.\u201d The district court subsequently denied the Masseys\u2019 motion to reconsider \u201cas it relates to their failure to warn arguments.\u201d Notably, ConAgra did not \u2014 at any point \u2014 assert in its district court briefing that the Masseys insufficiently pleaded a failure to warn claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>determination was in error. First, while their complaint could have been clearer, the Masseys did adequately plead a failure to warn claim. Second, a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a claim based on an insufficient pleading is in error when neither party raised the issue and no opportunity was given to argue that, in fact, the claim was sufficiently pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The language that constitutes a failure to warn claim is found in paragraph 19 of the Masseys\u2019 complaint, under a \u201cProduct Liability\u201d heading. That paragraph states in part: \u201c[t]he pot pie consumed by [Ms. Massey] was contaminated with Salmonella because ConAgra ... failed to ensure that its cooking instructions would, if followed by the consumer, kill Salmonella and other pathogens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">In its brief in support of its motion to reconsider, the Masseys wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">The Court\u2019s decision also rests on the premise that the only defect identified by the Plaintiffs was the pies\u2019 \u201cadulteration\u201d with <em>Salmonella. </em>However, Plaintiffs also identify faulty cooking instructions and warnings as defects. In a products liability ease, a plaintiff may prevail by showing that a product is unreasonably dangerous either because it is inherently defective or because the manufacturer fails to warn of dangers, or provides inadequate instructions. A failure to provide adequate warning of dangers renders a manufacturer liable under products liability principles____ In this case, regardless of whether <em>Salmonella </em>is considered an adulterant, the pie is still unreasonably dangerous because the cooking instructions were confusing, inadequate to ensure safe cooking, and failed to warn of the danger of Salmonella____The evidence establishes at least a question of fact whether the cooking instructions were adequate. Karrin\u2019s affidavit establishes that she cooked the pie per the instructions but still contracted salmonellosis____ That alone is evidence from which a jury could conclude that the instructions were inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">ConAgra\u2019s response brief in opposition of the Masseys\u2019 motion to reconsider indicates that the adequacy of the cooking instructions was raised earlier. ConAgra wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-16\">The Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling also considered and analyzed additional arguments made by Plaintiffs concerning cooking instructions. Plaintiffs had argued that: \u201cDefendant ... failed to verify that it[s] cooking instructions were adequate to protect consumers.\u201d ... The Court concluded that: \u201cThis alleged failure does not establish the first two elements of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as asserted in the Complaint in this case.\u201d ... Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments regarding cooking instructions likewise are misguided. Plaintiffs focus on language on the front of the product packaging about the product being \u201cReady in 4 minutes\u201d in a microwave, but Plaintiffs have never offered any evidence indicating that Karrin Massey cooked the product for 4 minutes in a microwave.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-17\">Again, noticeably absent from ConAgra\u2019s response brief is any allegation that the Masseys did not adequately plead a failure to warn claim. At the hearing on the motion to reconsider, however, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-18\">Court: Okay, ... it goes to the second part of their argument, which is the instruction part. That is, I prepare the product according to instruction, it\u2019s got salmonella in it. I\u2019m going to get sick and if I \u2014 even if I prepare it according to instructions, I\u2019m still possibly going to get sick. That\u2019s the question. Does that make the product defective? Essentially, it\u2019s a failure to warn case, a failure to instruct ease. Isn\u2019t that what we \u2014 isn\u2019t that what they\u2019re arguing and how do you respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>[Counsel for ConAgra]: It\u2019s not plead[ed] here and it\u2019s not my burden to establish that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">This appears to be the only instance in the record where ConAgra had anything to say about whether a failure to warn claim was, or was not, pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(1) requires a complaint to include \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d I.R.C.P. 8(a)(1). This Court has long abandoned any technical rules of pleading. <em>Clark v. Olsen, </em>110 Idaho 323, 325, 715 P.2d 993, 995 (1986). \u201cThe general policy behind the current rules of civil procedure is to provide every litigant with his or her day in court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201c[t]he purpose of a complaint is to inform the defendant of the material facts upon which the plaintiff bases his action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To reiterate, \u201c[a] complaint need only contain a concise statement of the facts constituting the cause of action and a demand for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFailure to warn can be a basis for recovery in a products liability action, whether alleged under a theory of strict liability in tort or negligence.\u201d <em>Puckett v. Oakfabco, Inc., </em>132 Idaho 816, 823, 979 P.2d 1174, 1181 (1999). While jurisdictional issues and the illegality of a contract may be raised <em>sua sponte </em>by a court at any time <em>(See, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare v. Doe I, </em>147 Idaho 314, 315, 208 P.3d 296, 297 (2009); <em>Trees v. Kersey, </em>138 Idaho 3, 6, 56 P.3d 765, 768 (2002)), there does not appear to be any ease law discussing a district court\u2019s ability to dismiss certain claims based on its <em>sua sponte </em>determination that the claim in question was not adequately pleaded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">While the Masseys\u2019 complaint is nothing if not concise, it nonetheless satisfied the bare-bones standard under Rule 8(a). Because a failure to warn claim is a specific type of products liability action, the inclusion of certain language such as: \u201c[ConAgra] failed to ensure that its cooking instructions would, if followed by the consumer, kill Salmonella and other pathogens\u201d under a general \u201cProducts Liability\u201d heading is sufficient for ConAgra to infer that a failure to warn claim was being alleged. And, importantly, ConAgra did make that inference. Thus, the general purpose behind a complaint \u2014 to inform the defendant of the plaintiffs allegations \u2014 was not circumvented here. ConAgra acknowledged in its response brief in opposition of the Masseys\u2019 motion to reconsider that the Masseys had raised the issue of inadequate instructions prior to the district court\u2019s ruling on ConAgra\u2019s summary judgment motion. ConAgra did, in response to the district court\u2019s inquiry at hearing, state that a failure to warn claim was not pleaded, but in doing so appears to have misconstrued the import of paragraph 19 of the complaint and the parties\u2019 briefing with respect to that issue. The district court erred in dismissing the Masseys\u2019 failure to warn claim based on a failure to plead. Furthermore, the Masseys had no notice that the sufficiency of their complaint was at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Y. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">We vacate the judgment and award costs to the Masseys.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-12\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES, and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\">. Paragraph 20 of the Masseys\u2019 complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">Defendant ConAgra had a duty to comply with all statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to the manufacture, distribution, storage, labeling, and sale of food products, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, which bans the sale and distribution of <em>adulterated </em>food.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">. That provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">(g) The term \"adulterated\u201d shall apply to any poultry product under one or more of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\">(1) if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance, such article shall not be considered adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in or on such article does not ordinarily render it injurious to health;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-18\">(4) if it has been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 453.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-20\">.Because of this rule, the parties\u2019 relentless focus on whether the deposition testimony of Dr. Tengelsen established a product defect is irrelevant. Again, expert testimony is not required for a plaintiff to establish the existence of a product defect. <em>Fouche, </em>107 Idaho at 704, 692 P.2d at 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
