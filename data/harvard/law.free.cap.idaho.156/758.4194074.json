JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b791-32\">Northwest Farm Credit Services recovered a deficiency judgment against the Appellants following the foreclosure of two mortgages on property located in Valley County. Lake Cascade Airpark, LLC, Donald Miller, and Candace Miller appealed the judgment, contending that the reasonable value of their foreclosed property was substantially more than the value determined by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-33\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-34\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b791-35\">Although currently inactive, the Lake Cascade Airstrip, which lies next to Lake Cascade in Valley County, was at one point \u201cone of the premier recreational strips in Idaho.\u201d In 2004, hoping to create a residential community \u2014 an \u201cairpark\u201d \u2014 around this airstrip, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Donald and Candace Miller and David and Karen Buich formed Lake Cascade Airpark, LLC, with the intention of acquiring development property. Subsequent to its formation, the LLC purchased 333.63 acres adjacent to the airstrip (\u201cthe Property\u201d), which is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In 2008, the LLC, the Millers, and the Buichs borrowed $2,450,000.00 from Northwest Farm Credit Services, FLCA, and executed a Note and Loan Agreement. The loan was secured by a mortgage on the Property. At the same time, the LLC, the Millers, and the Buichs borrowed another $500,000 from Farm Credit through an equity line of credit and executed an Equity Line of Credit Note and Loan Agreement. This line of credit was also secured by a mortgage on the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Eventually, the LLC, the Millers, and the Buichs failed to make their required payments, and in 2012 Farm Credit filed a complaint to foreclose the mortgages securing those loans and to obtain a deficiency judgment. Farm Credit filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted in part, holding that the defendants defaulted on the loans and granting Farm Credit foreclosure of the mortgages. Because the district court determined that genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to the amount due and owing on the loans and the reasonable value of the mortgaged property, it denied summary judgment on those issues. After a bench trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court entered its Partial Findings and Conclusions and Partial Judgment, holding that the Property had a reasonable value of $4,500.00 per acre, or $1,501,500.00 for the entire parcel, rounded up from $1,501,355.00 and that $3,532,277.04 was owing on the mortgage notes as of September 24, 2012. The LLC and the Millers moved to amend the district court\u2019s Partial Findings and Conclusions and, in the alternative, for a new trial. The district court denied these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Farm Credit purchased the Property at a sheriffs sale and then moved for entry of a judgment for the deficiency. The district court entered a deficiency judgment in the amount of $2,105,986.16 on March 19, 2013. The LLC and the Millers filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">I.

Anthony, </em>109 Idaho 977, 979, 712 P.2d 678, 680 (Ct.App.1985). Thus, the district court must determine \u201cthe fair market value of the mortgage[d] property before a deficiency judgment can be awarded.\u201d <em>Placerton, </em>100 Idaho at 870, 606 P.2d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">At the bench trial, the parties presented appraisals and testimonial evidence to establish the Property\u2019s fair market value. Farm Credit offered the testimony of Susan Robbins \u2014 Farm Credit\u2019s employee and a senior appraiser \u2014 and the appraisal Robbins performed in May 2012. To prepare her appraisal, Robbins inspected the Property and found that it is irrigated with level topography and, at the time of trial, was \u201cbeing used as irrigated pastureland.\u201d She explained that she had performed an analysis to determine the \u201chighest and best use\u201d of the Property. To perform a highest and best use analysis, an appraiser looks at \u201cfour uses that contribute to a subject property.\u201d Robbins explained that the \u201cfour uses\u201d of a property are its legal use, physical use, feasible use, and maximum productive use.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">So, the legal uses can be any type of uses that the County allows. The physical uses would be topography, location, access, water rights, soils, what physically is on that property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">The feasibility use looks at what\u2019s feasible on this property; is it cost productive or feasible to develop, or to do any other type of uses, or is it not cost effective on the subject property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">Then you look at the maximum productive use of the property. What are other surrounding properties doing; is there any buyers for those type of uses? And then, you conclude what the highest and best use is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">As to legal use, Robbins explained that although the Property \u201cis zoned multiple use[,]\u201d the County \u201cdid not feel\u201d it \u201cwas suitable for development____\u201d because of its \u201chigh water table. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s considered not able to allow for individual septic systems.\u201d And, \u201c[according to the County,\u201d the Property could not be developed into multiple housing units and would instead \u201cbe kept in agricultural use.\u201d As to the physical use, Robbins found the Property\u2019s soils \u201cconducive to irrigated pastureland or agriculture.\u201d In her view, the Property \u201cconform[ed] to the ... surrounding areas; all the properties around ... the subject are also irrigated pastureland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">As to the Property\u2019s feasible use, Robbins stated that \u201cthe owners had platted\u201d the Property, but it \u201chadn\u2019t been approved by the County.\u201d She explained that by May of 2012, the real estate market was \u201cdepressed\u201d and showed \u201clittle activity.\u201d As a result, there were \u201cno active developer buyers\u201d in the market, so at the \u201cdate of the appraisal report,\u201d the Property \u201cwould not be suitable for development\u201d or for sale \u201cas development property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">Robbins also noted that the Property\u2019s owners had previously attempted to develop a wetland mitigation bank on the Property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>She explained that she understood wetland mitigation banking to mean \u201cthat when an owner of a property has wetlands, and he destroys the wetlands or changes the use of the wetlands, that under the Clean Water Act he is obligated to replace what acreage of that wetlands was \u2014 that he destroyed.\u201d Robbins stated that the owner can then \u201ceither go and buy similar property, that has the same acreage that he destroyed of wetlands, or he can go into the Wetland Bank and buy credits.\u201d As to the Property, she explained that \u201c[t]here was a proposal for a wet land bank on this property in 2008____ The owner, in 2008, was planning on using the wet land areas for his open space in his development. This development did not happen.\u201d Robbins explained that in making her appraisal, she \u201cconsidered the wetland mitigation. The cost to do that is very high, the time \u2014 it\u2019s very time consuming, and I determined that that would not be a feasible] use on the subject property.\u201d As to the maximum productive use, Robbins \u201cdetermined that because the buyers out there are neighboring ranchers or neighbors in that area, wanting to keep it in ... agricultural use,\u201d agriculture would be the Property\u2019s maximally productive use. After engaging in this analysis, Robbins found that \u201c[t]he highest and best use of the [Pjroperty is as agriculture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">To appraise the Property\u2019s value, she also researched other property for sale, \u201cinvestigated\u201d other sales in the area, and discussed the market with other appraisers. She identified comparable sales varying from $2,717 per acre to $7,568 per acre. Ultimately, Robbins valued the property at $1,335,000.00, or $4,001.00 per acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">For their part, the Appellants offered into evidence a previous appraisal of the Property by Robbins, the testimony of Donald Miller, and the testimony of James Fronk. Susan Robbins had previously appraised the Property for Farm Credit in 2008 when the loans were initiated. At that time, she valued the Property at $5,140,000.00, or $15,406.00 per acre. She explained that the difference in her 2008 and 2012 appraisal values was due to the difference in the 2008 and 2012 markets. \u201cThe influence of residential subdivisions for recreational properties increased in 2004-2008. The resort town of McCall and the creation of the new ski resort, Tamarack, elevated values above that of the historic agricultural based land values as well as residential lots during that time period.\u201d Yet, \u201c[i]n late 2008 and early 2009, Tamarack declared bankruptcy and closed for the 2009 season.\u201d Tamarack\u2019s closure \u201cdepressed the market very much.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Miller testified in his role as a principal in the LLC and as a person with experience in real estate. He stated that \u201c[t]he highest and best use\u201d of the Property was as a wetland mitigation bank and as \u201ca limited development for an air park concept.\u201d He noted that \u201cwithin the last 30 days,\u201d before trial, ten mitigation bank credits were sold \u201cto the City of Boise for $4.50 per square foot, which is equivalent to approximately [$]180,000 per credit.\u201d In Miller\u2019s opinion, the Property\u2019s value was, at minimum, 4.5 million dollars. He based his opinion on \u201cthe potential for the sale of wetland credits, either on a wholesale basis or a sale of the bank, once approved, and sale of interests in the air park concept____\u201d Miller did not testify as to the value of this \u201cpotential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">Fronk is an Army Corps of Engineers certified wetland delineator and the owner of Secesh Engineering. While testifying, he explained wetland mitigation banks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-13\">Wetland banking is basically an instrument that\u2019s created where it is approved, and ... in our area by a group of agency people, lead [sic] by the Army Corp of Engineers, that go through the process to see if it meets the criteria set forth in the Clean Water Act and the 404 section of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Once that\u2019s established and they are accredited wetlands, some kind of format, either acre-for-acre or a ratio there of [sic], \u2018cause there\u2019s different hierarchies of wetlands. There\u2019s emergent, shrub-scrub, and \u2014 and furthermore other ones higher than that. There\u2019s ... degraded wetlands that you can then ... uplift to another level, so there\u2019s different formulas that you can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-4\">But ... the Clean Water Act says that you have to replace all wetlands or waters of the United States in like, in kind. You have to \u2014 if you\u2019re going to impact them here, you have to replace them in some place that\u2019s viable, and it\u2019s the same kind of type and character of wetlands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-5\">So, the ... banking instrument allows for you to do that. Where if I had, say, five acres of emergent wetlands that were impacted by a regional project, you could go to this bank that\u2019s been accredited, purchase five acres of emergent wetlands from them, and meet that replacement goal____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">He further explained that \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t use existing wetlands to replace wetlands. You have to replace them with new wetlands that meet the same criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">From 2007 to 2009, Fronk investigated the property to determine whether it met the criteria for a wetland mitigation bank. He testified that the Property was \u201ca prime spot for a wetland bank\u201d but that the project was \u201con hold,\u201d and it would take \u201capproximately a year\u201d for the project to reach completion. Fronk stated that the Idaho Transportation Department had \u201crecently ... purchased approximately three or four acres of emergent wetlands from a bank, and ... they paid approximately [$]25,000 per tenth of acre.\u201d He explained that the sale of credits in Idaho is \u201cfairly new\u201d and believed that at the time of trial, there were four mitigation banks in Idaho. Fronk did not opine as to the value of the Property\u2019s potential credits or the value this potential added to the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The district court evaluated this evidence in its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. The district court first noted that the Property, or at least part of it, had \u201cfuture potential as a source of wetland mitigation.\u201d He also noted that Miller \u201ccriticized the plaintiffs appraiser for not taking into account the future potential for recreational airpark development and wetland credits, as well as for failing to look for comparables outside Valley County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Nonetheless, the district court, \u201c[a]fter considering all the evidence,\u201d ultimately concluded \u201cthat the valuation given by [Farm Credit\u2019s] appraiser is more credible than the one given by Mr. Miller.\u201d The district court observed that \u201cMr. Miller\u2019s opinion has a large component of wishful thinking about what might have been if the market had not taken a disastrous turn for the worse.\u201d It found that Robbins\u2019 \u201cappraisal appears to be much more in touch with the reality of the marketplace, although a bit on the low side.\u201d Ultimately, the district court determined that the Property \u201cin its current condition and in the current market\u201d had \u201ca reasonable or fair market value of $4,500.00 per acre or $1,501,385.00, rounded to $1,501,500.00, as of September 25,2012.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">The Appellants argue that the record does not support the district court\u2019s finding that the Property was \u201cvaluable only as agricultural land....\u201d On appeal, \u201c[w]hen findings of fact are challenged, the appellant has the burden of showing error, and the reviewing court will review the evidence in a light most favorable to the respondent.\u201d <em>Higginson v. Westergard, </em>100 Idaho 687, 689, 604 P.2d 51, 53 (1979). The Court will not disturb the district court\u2019s finding of fact unless the finding is clearly erroneous. <em>PacifiCorp v. Idaho State Tax Commission, </em>153 Idaho 759, 767, 291 P.3d 442, 450 (2012). A finding is clearly erroneous if is not supported by substantial and competent evidence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial and competent evidence is relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Jarvis v. Rexburg Nursing Center, </em>136 Idaho 579, 583, 38 P.3d 617, 621 (2001). Here, the Appellants do not challenge the competency of the evidence. Thus, the only issue is whether the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision is substantial. \u201cEvidence is substantial if a reasonable trier of fact would accept it and rely upon it in determining whether a disputed point of fact has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>proven.\u201d <em>PacifiCorp, </em>153 Idaho at 768, 291 P.3d at 451 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is less than a preponderance of evidence, but more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Chisholm v. Idaho Dept. of Water Resources, </em>142 Idaho 159, 164, 125 P.3d 515, 520 (2005). It \u201cneed not be uncontradicted, nor does it need to necessarily lead to a certain conclusion; it need only be of such sufficient quantity and probative value that reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion as the fact finder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">The Appellants argue that the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s decision was not substantial because Robbins did not have the necessary knowledge or experience to correctly appraise the value of a property with wetland mitigation bank potential and that the potential for the Property itself to become a mitigation bank was much more favorable than Robbins believed. Specifically, the Appellants argue that the Property \u201cis uniquely situated for the establishment of new wetlands and a wetland mitigation bank____\u201d and that Fronk\u2019s testimony proved \u201cRobbins\u2019 assumptions about the expense and time involved to complete development of a mitigation wetland bank on the property ... wrong.\u201d They contend that \u201cFronk also explained, again contrary to Robbins\u2019 assumptions, ... that a market for the wetland credits already exists in Idaho and is not limited to just Valley County but would be positioned for sale within a service area that includes the Payette River, Weiser River, and Boise River drainages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">Appellants\u2019 argument as to Robbins\u2019 knowledge and experience may go to Robbins\u2019 qualifications as an expert. An expert possesses \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue....\u201d I.R.E. 702. The Appellants do not, however, specifically contend that Robbins was not qualified under I.R.E. 702. Thus, it seems Appellants contend that Robbins\u2019 alleged lack of knowledge and experience damaged the credibility of her testimony. \u201cThe determination of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are exclusively within the province of the trier of facts.\u201d <em>Higginson, </em>100 Idaho at 692, 604 P.2d at 56. Thus, \u201c[i]n determining whether there was substantial evidence to support the district court, this Court must give due regard to the special opportunity of the trial court, acting as the fact finder, to judge the credibility of those witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the regard this Court must provide to the district court\u2019s judgment as to Robbins\u2019 credibility, we will not evaluate the credibility of Robbins\u2019 testimony and appraisals.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">Furthermore, Appellants\u2019 argument that Fronk\u2019s testimony disproved the evidence offered by Farm Credit seems to ask this Court to reweigh the conflicting evidence presented to the district court. The Court, however, will not disturb conflicting evidence that is substantial and competent. <em>Aspiazu v. Mortimer, </em>139 Idaho 548, 550, 82 P.3d 830, 832 (2003) (\u201cFindings based on substantial, competent evidence, although conflicting, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Here, Robbins\u2019 testimony and 2012 appraisal constitute substantial evidence because they allow reasonable minds to reach the same conclusion as the district court and provide more than a mere scintilla of evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination. Robbins testified that the Property was valuable as agricultural land and provided values from comparable property sales. She addressed the notion that the property had value for its mitigation bank potential, yet determined that wetland banking was not a feasible use. The Appellants themselves admit that wetland mitigation banking is new in Idaho and failed to present any concrete evidence as to the value added by the potential for developing a wetland mitigation bank. In conclusion, because the district court\u2019s determination of the Property\u2019s reasonable value is supported by substantial evidence and therefore not clearly erroneous, we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">B. Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">The Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to amend its findings or, in the alternative, grant a new trial on the reasonable value of the property. The Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>motion to amend findings or to grant a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Belstler v. Sheler, </em>151 Idaho 819, 823, 264 P.3d 926, 930 (2011); <em>Lanham v. Idaho Power Co., </em>130 Idaho 486, 497-98, 943 P.2d 912, 923-24 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-4\">The test for whether a trial court has abused its discretion is three-fold: (1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-5\"><em>Burgess v. Salmon River Canal Co., Ltd., </em>127 Idaho 565, 573, 903 P.2d 730, 738 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The Appellants admit that \u201cthe district court recognized the discretion it is afforded in deciding motions to amend and for a new trial.\u201d They contend, however, that the district court acted outside the bounds of its discretion and did not reach its decision through an exercise of reason when denying these motions because \u201cthe district court\u2019s finding that the property should be valued only as agricultural land, because a wetland mitigation bank was not feasible, was not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d This argument fails because, as discussed above, the district court\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">C. Attorney Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Farm Credit argues that it is entitled to its attorney fees under the attorney fee provisions of the Notes, the Loan Agreements and the Mortgages. Both Notes and Loan Agreements provide that \u201cBorrower shall pay Lender on demand all attorney fees and costs incurred to protect or enforce any of Lender\u2019s rights in bankruptcy, appellate proceedings, or otherwise under this Note or the Loan Documents.\u201d Both mortgages provide that \u201cany advances, including, without limitation, attorney fees or costs, paid or incurred by Mortgagee to protect or enforce its rights under the Loan Documents, in bankruptcy, appellate proceedings or otherwise, shall be payable on demand and shall become a part of the indebtedness secured by this mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">The \u201cAppellants concede\u201d that if Farm Credit prevails, \u201cthe two loan agreements entitle\u201d Farm Credit \u201cto recover its reasonable attorney fees on appeal.\u201d Because Farm Credit prevails in this appeal, it is entitled to its fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Farm Credit is awarded its attorney fees and costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b797-14\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\">.
