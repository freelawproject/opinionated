On that charge, the State sought an enhanced sentence based upon Glenn\u2019s 2001 DUI conviction. The district court had previously dismissed Glenn\u2019s 2001 DUI conviction pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2604. Glenn argues on appeal that the district court erred because Idaho Supreme Court precedent holds that cases dismissed pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 are a nullity and cannot later be used as sentencing enhancements. The State contends that the district court erred in considering the merits of Glenn\u2019s untimely motion to dismiss and that precedent allows an enhanced sentence based on a previously dismissed DUI conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">Samuel Glenn was arrested and cited for driving under the influence in 2001. He pled guilty to a felony DUI, which resulted in a suspended sentence and five years of probation. After Glenn completed probation, he moved the district court to reduce his charge to a misdemeanor. The district court treated this as a motion pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) and granted the motion on March 22, 2007, ordering that Glenn\u2019s guilty plea be set aside and the case finally dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Glenn was again arrested and cited for DUI on October 5, 2010. The State filed an amended complaint that enhanced the charges pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(9) because Glenn had a prior felony DUI conviction within the past fifteen years. Glenn\u2019s only felony that qualified was his 2001 DUI that the district court dismissed in 2007. Glenn pled not guilty to the 2010 DUI charge on February 11, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">On April 26, 2011, Glenn moved to dismiss his 2010 indictment, arguing that the enhancement was improper given that his 2001 guilty plea was withdrawn and dismissed pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-2604. Glenn argued that because this conviction was dismissed, there was no prior conviction for the State to base its enhancement on. The state opposed Glenn\u2019s motion, arguing that (1) the motion was untimely under I.C.R. 12(d) without any showing of good cause or excusable neglect and (2) Idaho Court of Appeals precedent in <em>State v. Reed, </em>149 Idaho 901, 243 P.3d 1089 (Ct.App.2010), controlled. The district court denied Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss based on <em>Reed. </em>Glenn then entered a conditional guilty plea and reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss. The district court accepted that plea. Glenn timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">A. This Court will use its plenary power to decide Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-16\">In the district court, the State objected to Glenn\u2019s untimely motion to dismiss pursuant to I.C.R. 12(d). The State argues that the district court abused its discretion in hearing the untimely motion on its merits because nothing in the record gave the district court a basis to find good cause or excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-17\">Motions to dismiss filed under I.C.R. 12(b) \u201cmust be filed within twenty-eight (28) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>days after the entry of a plea of not guilty or seven (7) days before trial whichever is earlier.\u201d I.C.R. 12(d). Glenn filed his motion to dismiss more than twenty-eight days after he pled not guilty. However, the trial court has discretion to \u201cenlarge the time provided herein, and for good cause shown, or for excusable neglect, may relieve a party of failure to comply with this rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We uphold the trial court\u2019s decision when the court \u201c(1) correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>State v. Gurney, </em>152 Idaho 502, 503, 272 P.3d 474, 475 (2012) (quoting <em>Sun Valley Potato Growers, Inc. v. Tex. Refinery Corp., </em>139 Idaho 761, 765, 86 P.3d 475, 479 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Here, the district court was silent as to why it allowed the motion, which makes it difficult to determine whether the court properly exercised its discretion. However, this Court invokes its plenary power to decide this case on the substantive issue. The Idaho Constitution states that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to review, upon appeal, any decision of the district courts . . . .\u201d Idaho Const. art. V, \u00a7 9. We rarely exercise this plenary power of review, which we narrowly apply and limit to compelling cases. <em>State v. Young, </em>133 Idaho 177, 179, 983 P.2d 831, 833 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We entertain appeals within our plenary jurisdiction that do not fully meet the criteria in the appellate rules. <em>Izaguirre v. R &amp; L Carriers Shared Servs., LLC, </em>155 Idaho 229, 232, 308 P.3d 929, 932 (2013). Indeed, \u201c[w]here a case presents an important issue that will provide helpful guidance to the affected legal community, there is some value in resorting to our plenary jurisdiction to consider and decide it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court has used this power to clarify important and reoceurring questions in the construction <em>of criminal </em>statutes, \u201cthe resolution of which will be of practical importance in the administration of the criminal justice system in this state\u201d and prevent improper dismissals and reduce erroneous rulings. <em>Stockwell v. State, </em>98 Idaho 797, 802, 573 P.2d 116, 121 (1977). Thus, the parties must present more than only speculation to indicate that the substantive issue may reoccur. <em>See State v. Loomis, </em>146 Idaho 700, 704, 201 P.3d 1277, 1281 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Here, these facts are reoceurring and the issue is important. The Court of Appeals has already heard two cases on the relationship of I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) and \u00a7 18-8005. <em>State v. Deitz, </em>120 Idaho 755, 819 P.2d 1155 (Ct.App.1991); <em>State v. Reed, </em>149 Idaho 901, 243 P.3d 1089 (Ct.App.2010). In addition, in 2013 there were over 6,500 DUI cases filed in Idaho magistrate courts and over 600 felony DUI cases filed in Idaho district courts. Thus, we will address this case on the merits. .However, this does not indicate that we discount the importance of following procedure or will ignore procedural time limits in the future. We note that it would have been better practice for the district court to use more than silence to explain why it found good cause or excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">B. The district court properly denied Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss on its merits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">The district court denied Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss because it held that <em>State v. Reed </em>controlled. In <em>Reed, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a guilty plea set aside under I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) can be used to enhance a sentence under I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 because it is not the form of the judgment, but the determination of guilt that allowed the State to seek an enhanced sentence under I.C. \u00a7 18-8005. 149 Idaho at 902-05, 243 P.3d at 1090-93. Both <em>Reed </em>and this case involve the question of whether a set aside guilty plea can later be used for a sentencing enhancement based on I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 and I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1). Glenn argues that the district court erred because <em>Reed </em>broke from this Court\u2019s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">This Court exercises free review when it interprets a statute. <em>State v. Robin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>son, </em>143 Idaho 306, 307, 142 P.3d 729, 730 (2006). This Court begins with the statute\u2019s words, giving those words their plain, obvious, and rational meaning. <em>State v. Burnight, </em>132 Idaho 654, 659, 978 P.2d 214, 219 (1999). If the statute\u2019s language is unambiguous, this Court follows the statute as written. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, we begin with whether the statutory language is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Idaho Code section 18-8005 imposes sentencing enhancements for any person \u201cwho has pled guilty or has been found guilty\u201d of more than one DUI. When the trial court decides whether the statute applies to a defendant, it considers the determination of guilt. <em>State v. Bever, </em>118 Idaho 80, 81-82, 794 P.2d 1136, 1137-38 (1990). Here, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005(9) is at issue, which applies to a person who \u201cpleads guilty or is found guilty\u201d of a DUI and who has within the last fifteen years \u201cpled guilty or has been found guilty\u201d of a prior felony DUI violation \u201cnotwithstanding the form of the judgment(s) or withheld judgment(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Idaho Code section 19-2604(1) is a separate statute that allows a court to dismiss a case against a guilty defendant with a withheld judgment when the defendant has no probation violations, the court\u2019s dismissal is \u201ccompatible with the public interest,\u201d and the court is convinced there is no longer a need for the defendant to continue probation. I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1). If those circumstances are met, \u201cthe court may ... terminate the sentence or set aside the plea of guilty or conviction of the defendant, and finally dismiss the case and discharge the defendant. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, a final I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) dismissal \u201cshall have the effect of restoring the defendant to his civil rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Glenn contends that because the legislature only mentioned \u201cthe form of the judgment\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 18-8005, the legislature presumed a valid judgment would exist. He states that it is obvious a non-existent judgment is invalid. Glenn also argues that I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) is unambiguous because its unlimited scope makes a valid judgment and conviction non-existent within the entire case history.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">However, Glenn\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 provides sentencing enhancements for any person who \u201cpled guilty or has been found guilty\u201d of more than one DUI within a specified amount of time, which applies when there is a determination of guilt by a conviction or plea. <em>Bever, </em>118 Idaho at 81-82, 794 P.2d at 1137-38. The focus of I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 is then not on performance during probation, but instead on the instant the finding of guilt is made either by the jury or the defendant\u2019s plea. Here, Glenn was a person who pled guilty to more than one DUI within fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">Second, I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 is a completely separate statute that never states that a guilty plea or judgment disappears, only that the plea or conviction is \u201cset aside\u201d and the case dismissed. Thus, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005\u2019s phrase \u201cnotwithstanding the form of the judgment(s) or withheld judgment(s)\u201d indicates that I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 includes a dismissed judgment, as it plainly states the judgment\u2019s form does not matter. Any form of judgment in history would satisfy that requirement, even if that judgment was later dismissed. So I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 does not erase the fact that a defendant pled guilty or was found guilty of a previous DUI. Thus, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 gives no indication that using a dismissed case to seek an enhanced sentence is improper. We hold that I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 unambiguously applies to Glenn.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">This holding does not conflict with our precedent as Glenn contends. Glenn relies on several often-quoted sentences from this Court\u2019s precedent to argue the dismissal of a conviction under I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 makes the conviction a legal nullity and therefore makes the underlying guilty plea a legal nullity as well. Glenn maintains that this concept began with <em>State v. </em>Barwick\u2019s holding that a vacated conviction was \u201ca nullity and the effect [was] as if it had never been rendered at all.\u201d 94 Idaho 139, 143, 483 P.2d 670, 674 (1971). Glenn then notes that this Court cited the <em>Barwick </em>\u201cnullity\u201d language in <em>Manners v. State, </em>107 Idaho 950, 952, 694 P.2d 1298, 1300 (1985), <em>State v. Parkinson, </em>144 Idaho 825, 828, 172 P.3d 1100, 1103 (2007) <em>(iabrogated on other grounds by Verska v. Saint Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>151 Idaho 889, 895, 265 P.3d 502, 508 (2011)), and <em>Robinson, </em>143 Idaho at 308, 142 P.3d at 731. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>argues these eases established a fundamental rule that I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 relief erases a vacated conviction and then treats the underlying guilty plea as if it never existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">However, none of these cases hold that I.C. \u00a7 19-2604 can erase a guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, withdrawing a guilty plea and dismissing the case does not change the fact that the defendant pled guilty or was found guilty. <em>See Parkinson, </em>144 Idaho at 828, 172 P.3d at 1103. Idaho Code section 18-8005 does not require a current conviction or judgment; it applies whenever a person \u201cpled guilty or has been found guilty.\u201d This Court has \u201caccepted the proposition that the effects of I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) could be overridden by another statute,\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>143 Idaho at 310, 142 P.3d at 733, which is exactly what has happened here with I.C. \u00a7 18-8005. Thus, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005\u2019s plain language controls and I.C. \u00a7 19-2604\u2019s relief does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Glenn notes that this Court stated in <em>Robinson </em>that \u201c[i]f a case has been dismissed, there is no longer anything in which a judgment of conviction can stand; likewise, if a charge has been dismissed there no longer remains a conviction for that charge\u201d which is \u201ctrue even if the order does not expressly state that the plea was being set aside.\u201d 143 Idaho at 310, 142 P.3d at 733. Glenn argues that this language means that the guilty plea is no longer of legal consequence. Given the plain language in I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 that a defendant \u201cpled guilty or has been found guilty\u201d of a previous DUI, the <em>Robinson </em>Court\u2019s language is irrelevant to Glenn\u2019s case. This is because whether Glenn\u2019s judgment of conviction stands has nothing to do with whether Glenn pled or was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Glenn also argues that the holding in <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>145 Idaho 403, 179 P.3d 1059 (2008), supports his argument that in order to have a predicate felony for enhancement purposes, a judgment must be an \u201coutstanding\u201d conviction that is currently on a defendant\u2019s record. In <em>Sharp, </em>the Court first noted that the defendant did not move to have his withheld judgment dismissed and guilty plea set aside under I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1). 145 Idaho at 407, 179 P.3d at 1063. This Court then held that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was a prior outstanding conviction because \u201c[a]n outstanding withheld judgment based on a guilty plea qualifies as a conviction under Idaho law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Glenn contends that this holding and the Court\u2019s single reference to I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) implicitly means that if a defendant moved for I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) relief, then the judgment and plea would not be outstanding. However, Glenn reads too much into <em>Sharp. </em>There, the issue was whether an outstanding withheld judgment based on a guilty plea qualified as a conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 403, 179 P.3d at 1059. Here the issue is different: whether a defendant has pled guilty to a previous DUI. Thus, <em>Sharp </em>does not inform our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">We hold that I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 is unambiguous. Therefore, a I.C. \u00a7 19-2604(1) dismissal does nothing to vacate or erase a defendant\u2019s original entry of a guilty plea or a jury\u2019s original finding of guilt. Here, I.C. \u00a7 18-8005 applies because Glenn was a person who in 2010 pled guilty to a DUI within fifteen years of pleading guilty to a previous felony DUI. Thus, the district court correctly denied Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Glenn\u2019s motion to dismiss on its merits.</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-13\">Justices EISMANN, J.
