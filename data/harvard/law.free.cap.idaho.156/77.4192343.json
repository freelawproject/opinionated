JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">This case comes to the Court as a certified question from the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, the Honorable Edward J. Lodge, U.S. District Judge, presiding. Karen White and her development company, Elkhom, LLC, seek to recover $166,496 paid to Valley County for \u201ccapital investments for roads in the vicinity of [their] White Cloud development.\u201d Pursuant to I.A.R. 12.3(c), this Court accepted the certified question and we hereby answer the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">When considering a certified question of law, this Court will consider \u201conly those facts contained in the [certification] order.\u201d <em>Kunz v. Utah Power &amp; Light Co., </em>117 Idaho 901, 902 n. 1, 792 P.2d 926, 927 n. 1 (1990). Thus, the following facts are drawn and recited verbatim from the U.S. District Court\u2019s certification order (Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">In 2005, Valley County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) initiated a Capital Improvements Program (\u201cCIP\u201d) in response to an increase in development within the County and in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of the developments on the County\u2019s roads and bridges. The CIP is described in the County\u2019s Master Transportation Plan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-18\">Capital Improvement Program Process and Purpose</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-19\">In 2005, the Valley County Commissioners initiated a Road Development Agreement (RDA) process <em>to require new developments to pay a fee to mitigate the impacts </em>of their developments on the roads and bridges in Valley County. The RDA process replaced the Capital Contribution Agreements that were used by Valley County for larger developments that needed infrastructure improvements. <em>The RDA requires all developers to pay a fee </em>based on the number of trips their developments generate. <em>Developers are, in effect, required to pay for the roadway capacity their developments use. The fee must be paid at time of final plat. </em>Credit is given for [right of way] required from the development and any in-lieu-of contributions, such as construction materials or developer sponsored construction of portions of roads and bridges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-20\">(bolding and underlining provided by Plaintiffs).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-21\">During the same year the County initiated the CIP, Karen White (Plaintiff) and her father, E.T. Usher,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were in the process of developing a residential subdivision in Valley County known as White Cloud. The subdivision included a preliminary plat for 80 lots on 210 acres and was approved on May 12, 2005. Phase I of the development included 44 lots. All land within Valley County\u2019s jurisdiction is zoned multiple use, pursuant to Valley County\u2019s Land Use Development Ordinance. Within the district, various uses are listed as \u201callowed,\u201d while others are listed as \u201cconditional\u201d necessitating a conditional use permit (\u201cCUP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-22\">The CUP for Phase I of White Cloud was approved by the County on May 24, 2005. The CUP included as a condition that Plaintiff enter into a Development Agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>with the Board of County Commissioners. To satisfy this requirement, White entered into a Road Development Agreement (\u201cRDA\u201d) with the County in June of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Negotiations on the RDA began sometime in the late spring or summer of 2005 and the County has provided evidence that a draft RDA was sent to the engineering firm working on the White Cloud development in August of 2005. The final RDA was provided to Scott Findlay, project manager for White Cloud, on or about June 24, 2006. The final RDA differed from the draft RDA in that it covered only the 44 lots being developed in Phase I and eliminated an offset for a dedicated roadway right of way. The RDA contained the following provision: \u201cThe developer agrees to pay Valley County their proportionate share of roadway costs for a total cash payment of $166,496 due at the time of Final Plat approval.\u201d Plaintiff signed the RDA on June 26, 2006, and paid the required fees under the RDA on July 21, 2006. The County executed the RDA on July 24, 2006, and the RDA was recorded on July 26, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Phase I of White Cloud has been completed and it appears undisputed by the parties that the RDA monies paid for Phase I were used by the County to complete capital investments for roads in the vicinity of the White Cloud development.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The County concedes that it did not adopt an impact fee ordinance or administrative procedures for the impact fee process as required by the Idaho Development Impact Fees Act (\u201cIDIFA\u201d). Idaho Code \u00a7 67-8201 <em>et seq. </em>IDIFA prohibits certain impact fees unless they are imposed pursuant to an ordinance in compliance with the statute. The County concedes it did not enact an IDIFAcompliant ordinance, because, at the time, the County believed in good faith that none was required____</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">On October 1, 2009, Plaintiff filed suit against the County claiming that the road development fee imposed by the County as a condition for approval of the White Cloud project violated Idaho state law and deprived Plaintiff of due process under both the federal and Idaho constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In her Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff raised two claims for relief. The first claim for relief alleged that \u201cValley County\u2019s practice of requiring developers to enter into a Road Development Agreement (or any similar written agreement) solely for the purpose of forcing developers to pay money for its proportionate share of road improvement costs attributable to traffic generated by their development is a disguised impact fee, is illegal and therefore should be enjoined.\u201d The first claim for relief also alleged that, because the County failed to enact an impact fee ordinance under IDIFA, the imposition of the road development fees constituted an unauthorized tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">Plaintiffs second claim for relief alleged that the County\u2019s imposition of the road development fee constituted a taking under the federal and Idaho constitutions and sought relief under the theory of inverse condemnation. Ultimately, Plaintiff has requested that the Court declare the County\u2019s practice of imposing impact fees illegal under Idaho law, enjoin the County from the continued implementation of the practice, and order the County to refund the $166,496 paid by Plaintiff in connection with Phase I of the White Cloud project.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">The County maintains that Plaintiff voluntarily agreed to pay the RDA monies. Plaintiff denies that the payment was voluntary since it was required to obtain the final plat approval. It is undisputed that Plaintiff did not file an appeal of the CUP or final plat approval for Phase I after Plaintiff paid the RDA fees of $166,496. Nor did Plaintiff file an inverse condemnation claim in state court regarding the monies paid under the RDA for Phase I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">The U.S. District Court noted the rather lengthy procedural history of the case, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>eluding two summary judgment motions by the County. The first motion sought dismissal of all federal and state claims. The District Judge granted summary judgment with regard to the federal takings claim but denied it with regard to the state law claims, observing that \u201cthe parties were unclear on which statute of limitations applied, but the County ultimately argued that \u2018Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims (takings and anything else) are subject to the state\u2019s catch-all four-year statute of limitations.\u201d The District Court declined to grant summary judgment on the inverse condemnation claim because, \u201c[v]iewing the facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs,\u201d they \u201cwere not \u2018fully aware\u2019 of the alleged taking until they received the final RDA setting forth the requirement that $166,496 was due for proportional road impact fees relating to Phase I of the project.\u201d The District Court noted that the County had not made any arguments with regard to an accrual date for the illegal tax claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The County again moved for summary judgment and also filed a motion to certify several questions to this Court. In its Order, the District Court determined that only one question met the requirements for certification under I.A.R. 12.3. According to the Court, \u201c[t]hat question concerns the accrual date of Plaintiffs claim that the road development fees imposed by the County constitute an illegal tax under Idaho law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">CERTIFIED QUESTION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The District Court certified the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">Under Idaho law, when does the statute of limitations begin to run on a cause of action arising out of an allegedly illegal impact fee imposed by a local government entity as part of a land use application?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Because this question involves some fine distinctions and qualifications, the Court deems it necessary to reword the question in such a fashion that it comports with the intent of the Order without entailing possible unintended consequences. For instance, the question initially proposed by the County in its motion inquired about an allegedly illegal \u201ctax,\u201d but the Order inquires about an allegedly illegal \u201cimpact fee.\u201d In their briefing, the parties used the terms \u201ctax\u201d and \u201cfee\u201d interchangeably, which provides a source of confusion. Decisions made by this Court following the certification of the question may well have a bearing upon the issues subsequently to be determined by the U.S. District Court. In that regard, the Order inquires about an imposition made by a local government entity as part of a land use application, which implicates the Local Land Use Planning Act (LLUPA), I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 67-6501 to 6536. Because we have not been requested to address the issue of exhaustion of remedies under LLUPA, we have further revised the question to make it clear that we do not opine on that issue. Therefore, we revise the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">When does the limitations period commence for statutory remedies made available under Idaho law to obtain a refund of an illegal county tax?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">\u201cCourts of the United States may certify a controlling question of law in a pending action to the Idaho Supreme Court for determination where there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Idaho Supreme Court and the determination would materially advance the orderly resolution of the litigation in the United States court.\u201d <em>St. Luke\u2019s Magic Valley Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr. v. Luciani, </em>154 Idaho 37, 39-40, 293 P.3d 661, 663-64 (2013) (citing I.A.R. 12.3(a)). \u201cThe date when a cause of action accrues is a question of law to be determined by this Court where no disputed issues of material fact exist.\u201d <em>Harris v. State, ex rel. Kempthorne, </em>147 Idaho 401, 405, 210 P.3d 86, 90 (2009). The Court\u2019s role \u201cis limited to answering the certified question\u201d when the question it presents is narrow. <em>Peone v. Regulus Stud Mills, Inc., </em>113 Idaho 374, 375, 744 P.2d 102, 103 (1987) (noting that \u201cto now decide [extraneous matters] would result in an advisory opinion on a question not certified\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>y.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">QUESTIONS THIS COURT DECLINES TO ANSWER</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The County has briefed and argued a number of issues that go beyond the specific inquiry addressed to us by the U.S. District Court. The Plaintiffs<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> do so to a lesser extent. Because the answer we give to the narrow question addressed to us depends on certain legal assumptions including but not limited to: whether the road development fee was voluntarily agreed to in an arm\u2019s length transaction that benefitted both parties; if not, whether the fee is violative of IDIFA and, if so, whether it is an illegal tax; and whether or not the fee should have been challenged in the zoning and planning process \u2014 it is important for this Court to state what we are not deciding. Furthermore, because the determination of some of these ancillary issues, which have a bearing on the question we are asked to answer, are dependent upon a full developed factual record that we do not have, we are simply not in a position to address those ancillary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">We first note the comments of the District Judge in the Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">As a preliminary matter, given the claims and defenses raised in this case, and the fact that two cases raising similar issues are currently on appeal before the Idaho Supreme Court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it is of some importance to explain what this Court is not asking the Idaho Supreme Court to address in this request for certification. This Court is not asking the Idaho Supreme Court to address the accrual date for inverse condemnation claims. The Idaho Supreme Court has addressed that particular legal issue in multiple eases. <em>See, e.g., McCuskey v. Canyon County Comm\u2019rs </em>[128 Idaho 213], 912 P.2d 100 (Idaho 1996); <em>Rueth v. State </em>[103 Idaho 74], 644 P.2d 1333 (Idaho 1982); <em>Tibbs v. City of Sandpoint </em>[100 Idaho 667], 603 P.2d 1001 (Idaho 1979). Those eases stand for the proposition that, in the context of inverse condemnation claims, \u201c[t]he time of taking occurs, and hence the cause of action accrues, as of the time that the full extent of the plaintiffs loss of use and enjoyment of the property becomes apparent.\u201d <em>McCusky [McCuskey, </em>128 Idaho at 217], 912 P.2d at 104. This is the date on which the plaintiff \u201cwas fully aware of the extent to which [the government] interfered with his full use and enjoyment of the property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">In <em>Tibbs v. City of Sandpoint, </em>the Idaho Supreme Court stated that \u201c[t]he actual date of taking, although not readily susceptible to exact determination, is to be fixed at the point in time at which the impairment, of such a degree and kind as to constitute a substantial interference \"with plaintiffs\u2019 property interest, <em>became apparent.\u201d </em>[100 Idaho at 671,] 603 P.2d at 1005 (emphasis added). Explaining when an interference becomes \u201capparent,\u201d in <em>Rueth v. State, </em>the Idaho Supreme Court held that the date of a taking accrued on the date at which time there was \u201crecognition of the severity of the problem.\u201d [103 Idaho at 79,] 644 P.2d at 1338.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">Therefore, we do not address the issue of the application of the statute of limitations for an inverse condemnation claim. The District Court correctly concluded that the four-year statute of limitations in Idaho Code \u00a7 5-224 applies to such a claim, citing several eases that deal with the issue of when such a claim accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">Although the question proposed to us would only apply in the situation where a fee was determined to be an illegal tax, we express no opinion as to the legality of the road development fee at issue here. Just because what appears to be an impact fee is not IDIFA compliant does not necessarily mean that it is an illegal fee. In <em>Buckskin, </em>where the County had no IDIFA compliant ordinance, this Court held that \u201ca developer and a governing board can legally enter into a voluntary agreement to fund capital improvements to be made by the governmental entity that facilitate the developer\u2019s development plans.\u201d 154 Idaho at 493, 300 P.3d at 25. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>That case also involved a suit by a developer against the County, seeking recovery of road development fees based on claims of an illegal impact fee and inverse condemnation. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 300 P.3d at 21. We first addressed the legality of the agreement, finding that issue to be \u201ccentral to the determination\u201d of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 490, 300 P.3d at 22. We observed that \u201ca voluntary agreement between a governmental entity and a developer, whereby the developer voluntarily agrees to pay for capital improvements that will facilitate his development plans, does not run afoul of IDIFA. The key is whether the agreement is truly voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491, 300 P.3d at 23. In <em>Buckskin, </em>we upheld the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment against Buckskin because the record contained no evidence \u201cindicating that Buckskin was strong-armed into signing the ... RDA; that it voiced any objection to anyone, at any time, to making the payment required under [the] agreement; or that it did not, as the County avers, benefit from the agreement by virtue of the road improvements facilitated by its payments.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 492, 300 P.3d at 24. The question of whether or not such an agreement is voluntarily entered into by the developer is factual in nature and will therefore need to be determined by the U.S. District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We have not been asked to address the County\u2019s contention that the Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the LLUPA. We addressed the exhaustion issue in <em>Buckskin </em>(154 Idaho at 493-94, 300 P.3d at 25-26) but decline the County\u2019s invitation to address it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">THE LIMITATIONS PERIOD FOR STATUTORY REMEDIES MADE AVAILABLE UNDER IDAHO LAW TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF AN ILLEGAL COUNTY TAX COMMENCES UPON PAYMENT OF THE TAX.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">While the parties dispute the date on which the Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims began to run, both parties assert the claims are subject to Idaho Code \u00a7 5-224. Under that statute, \u201c[a]n action for relief not hereinafter provided for must be commenced within four (4) years after the cause of action shall have accrued.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 5-224. Plaintiffs contend that where a person seeks to obtain a refund of money paid to satisfy an impact fee that is actually an illegal tax, the four-year statute of limitations in I.C. \u00a7 5-224 runs from the date the payment was made. The County, however, argues that this \u201ccase consists of a single cause of action, informally known as inverse condemnation,\u201d and should be treated as such for purposes of determining the accrual date. The County contends the action accrued upon issuance of the CUP on May 24, 2005, or at the latest when the draft RDA was furnished to Plaintiffs\u2019 engineering firm in August of 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">A careful reading of the Order discloses that the District Judge had concerns about treating a tax refund claim the same as an inverse condemnation claim. Otherwise, there would be no apparent reason for certifying the question. In this regard, the District Judge was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">Before proceeding further, it is necessary to acknowledge some confusion resulting from the parties\u2019 interchangeable use in their briefing of the terms \u201cfee\u201d and \u201ctax.\u201d A tax is generally a tax. A fee can be either a legitimate fee or a disguised tax. The question as to the true nature of the amount sought to be recovered by the Plaintiffs will necessarily be determined by the District Judge. For purposes of answering the certified question, we will assume that we are presented with a situation where the payment sought to be recovered by the Plaintiffs is clearly an illegal tax. Indeed, they state in their brief, \u201cWhite filed this lawsuit seeking a declaration that the payment of the impact fee was an illegal tax and therefore the money White paid should be returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The process of avoiding or recovering payment of an allegedly illegal county tax is informed by a framework of statutes and caselaw. It is useful to review some history in Idaho county tax law. In <em>Howell v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of Ada Cnty., </em>the Ada County Board of Commissioners assessed the plaintiff more tax than he actually owed. 6 Idaho 154, 53 P. 542 (1898). After paying the tax, the plaintiff presented his refund claim to the board of commissioners, which denied his claim. <em>Id. </em>at 155, 53 P. at 542. He then appealed, but the Court ultimately found that the board did not have the authority to refund the plaintiffs tax payment because at the time, we knew \u201cof no law in this state, nor has counsel cited us to any, authorizing a board of county commissioners to refund a tax which has been paid, whether the tax is illegal or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 53 P. at 543. The Court went on to explain the process by which a taxpayer may seek to avoid or recover an erroneous payment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">Our statutes are ample to protect the citizen from illegal taxation, and in case an illegal tax is levied, if the person fails to appear before the board of equalization that is provided for by law, he has another remedy \u2014 by injunction \u2014 to prevent the collection thereof. But when, as in this case, there is no appearance before the board of equalization, and no application made for the correction of said assessment, and the tax is voluntarily paid, the board is without authority to refund the tax so paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 53 P. at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Court subsequently observed that in <em>Howell, </em>\u201cthe court held that in the absence of a statute county commissioners had no right to refund taxes voluntarily paid though illegal and void.\u201d <em>Asp v. Canyon Cnty., </em>43 Idaho 560, 563, 256 P. 92 (1927). In <em>Asp, </em>the issue before the Court was whether the plaintiff was entitled to a refund of taxes paid under an assessment later found to be illegal. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to a refund because he did not pay the tax under protest, explaining that \u201c[t]he general rule is that taxes voluntarily paid may not be recovered____ Not having been paid under protest, the taxpayers were not \u2018entitled\u2019 \u201d to a refund. <em>Id. </em>at 563, 256 P. at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">In <em>Walker v. Wedgwood, </em>64 Idaho 285, 130 P.2d 856 (1942), the Court considered whether a plaintiff was required to pay under protest to recover income taxes paid to the State when the income tax statutes did not mention a requirement of payment under protest. At the time the income tax law was passed, the Court \u201chad uniformly held that other forms of taxes could not be recovered unless there was a protest made at the time of their payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 130 P.2d at 857 (citing <em>Howell </em>and Asp).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">We held in <em>Lundy v. Pioneer Irr. Dist., </em>that the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief from assessments they had paid when they had previously \u201cfailed to avail themselves\u201d of the rights statutorily granted them under former I.C.A. \u00a7 42-703 (now I.C. \u00a7 43-703). 52 Idaho 683, 690, 19 P.2d 624, 626 (1933). The plaintiffs, having \u201cfailed to appear before the board of correction and present their objections, are deemed to have waived them, and thus having a remedy at law and failing to avail themselves thereof, they are precluded from obtaining equitable relief.\u201d 52 Idaho at 690-91, 19 P.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">The foregoing cases tell us that, generally, a taxpayer may not seek to obtain a refund of a tax, whether legal or not, without having lodged a protest to payment of the same. However, we have held that the payment under protest requirement does not apply to an illegal fee. <em>BHA Investments Inc. v. City of Boise, </em>141 Idaho at 168, 176, 108 P.3d 315, 323 (2004). This brings us back to the issue of whether the charge in this case was a tax or a fee and, again, we decline to make that determination. The more important lesson to draw from these cases is that, regardless of whether payment is made under protest, available statutory remedies must be resorted to in order to recover what is alleged to be an illegal tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">There are two statutory remedies that appear to be available to a taxpayer in the circumstances presented in this case. Idaho Code \u00a7 31-1501 applies to general claims asserted against the county and I.C. \u00a7 63-1308 applies to property taxes or money paid to a county. The limitations period for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>former provision is one year and that for the latter provision is 60 days after payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Idaho Code \u00a7 31-1501 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">The board of commissioners must not hear or consider any claim against the county unless accompanied by a receipt or documentation giving all items of the claim, duly certified by the authorized county official that the amount claimed is justly due or services were rendered. No claim shall be paid if not presented to the board within a year from the date the bill was generated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The predecessor of this provision, C.S. \u00a7 3506 (1919), was held in <em>Wilson v. Twin Falls Cnty. </em>to apply to proceedings by a taxpayer to obtain a refund of amounts paid for void delinquency tax certificates. 47 Idaho 527, 531, 277 P. 1114, 1115 (1929). The \u201cdate the bill was generated\u201d would, in the instance of the payment of a tax, be the date of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 63-1308(2) provides: \u201cAn action against a county ... for property taxes or money paid to such county ... under protest ... and which it is claimed ought to be refunded, shall be commenced within sixty (60) days after such payment.\u201d While one might argue that this provision applies only to property taxes, I.C. \u00a7 63-1301 would indicate otherwise. That section says that \u201c[t]he provisions of [Title 63 of the Idaho Code] governing ... collection of state and county property taxes, are hereby made applicable to all general and special taxes of any taxing district ... under any general or special laws of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">These seemingly short limitations provisions are not unreasonable when considered in context. This Court recently held that a developer requesting a refund of what was determined to be an illegal city tax had to file a claim for the refund within 180 days from the date the claim arose in order to pursue recovery. <em>Hehr, </em>155 Idaho at 96, 305 P.3d at 540. According to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">Idaho Code \u00a7 50-219 states, \u201cAll claims for damages against a city must be filed as prescribed by chapter 9, title 6, Idaho Code.\u201d Idaho Code \u00a7 6-906 requires that a notice of claim against a city be filed with the city clerk or secretary within 180 days from the date the claim arose or reasonably should have been discovered, whichever is later. Greystone concedes that section 6-906\u2019s notice requirement applies to its state law claim and that more than 180 days passed after this claim initially accrued. Thus, Greystone failed to provide sufficient notice of its state law inverse condemnation claim ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-12\"><em>Id. </em>Of course, I.C. \u00a7 50-219 does not apply to claims against counties. However, I.C. \u00a7 31-1501 does apply to counties and imposes a one year cut-off for claims against the county-</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">It all boils down to this: a person wishing to challenge an allegedly illegal tax must either pay the tax under protest and then bring a cause of action in court within sixty days or file a claim with the board of county commissioners within a year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In either case, the limitations period commences upon payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Based on the foregoing, we provide the following answer to the certified question: \u201cThe limitations period for statutory remedies made available under Idaho law to obtain a refund of an illegal county tax commences upon payment of the tax.\u201d No costs are awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-17\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W.

One possible difference between this case and <em>Buckskin </em>is that in <em>Buckskin </em>the developer proposed payment of a road development fee in its initial application, whereas the record here does not disclose that to be the case. <em>Id. </em>at 492, 300 P.3d at 24. However, in <em>Buckskin </em>the developer contended it only offered to pay the fee because it knew the County would require it. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, however, this disputed issue was not deemed material to our decision so as to preclude summary judgment against the developer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b116-10\">.
