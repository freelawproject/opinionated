JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">This appeal concerns the priority of liens as between Teufel Nursery\u2019s mechanics lien and Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages. The district court held that while Teufel had a valid and enforceable lien, it was inferior to Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages. On appeal, Teufel argues that such holding was in error and that the district court also erred in calculating Teufel\u2019s lien amount, interest, and attorney fees. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">This appeal stems from the failure of Tamarack Resort (\u201cResort\u201d), which was owned, developed, and operated by Tamarack Resort, LLC (\u201cTamarack\u201d). The Resort was slated as a year-round community, complete with cross-country and downhill skiing, a championship golf course, hotel and conference facilities, retail shopping, restaurants, and lounges. Tamarack planned to offer a panoply of real estate options, including custom homes, condominiums, townhomes, chalets, and cottages. In 2003, construction at the Resort began. Housing units were built and sold, hotel facilities were developed, and by 2006, the ski areas, golf course, retail shops, and restaurants were up and running. In 2004, Tamarack hired Teufel Nursery as its landscape developer. Teufel provided landscaping services at the Resort from 2004 until early 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">On May 19, 2006, Tamarack obtained a loan in the amount of $250,000,000.00 from a group of lenders, one of which was Credit Suisse. The loan allowed Tamarack to refinance its existing debt, pay accounts receivable, and continue developing the Resort. The loan was secured by two mortgages, which were recorded in Valley County on May 19, 2006. In 2007, Tamarack began to experience significant financial difficulties. Soon thereafter, it defaulted on its loan from Credit Suisse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">In August of 2007, Tamarack also fell behind on its payments to Teufel. At this time, Tamarack approached Teufel about modifying their existing 2007 agreement. Tamarack presented Teufel with a Master Construction Services Agreement (\u201cMaster Agreement\u201d) that would constitute their sole agreement. However, the Master Agreement was never accepted or executed by Teufel. As Teufel explained, its extant \u201c2007 Landscape Construction Agreement [with Tamarack] already established the material unit prices and hourly rates so Teufel did not feel it was necessary to modify its agreement with Tamarack.\u201d Teufel continued working at the Resort until early 2008, even though by that time it had not been paid for several months. On March 21, 2008, Teufel recorded its Claim of Lien against certain Resort properties in the amount of $564,560.23. The lien amount was adjusted to $406,199.07 at trial because, according to Teufel, when its former counsel filed a complaint to foreclose, he failed to name certain property owners in the lawsuit. As a result of such omissions, \u201cmany of the parcels in Teufel\u2019s Claim of Lien were subsequently released without payment to Teufel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">Credit Suisse filed its complaint for foreclosure of mortgages in Valley County on March 11, 2008. Teufel was named as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>defendant when Credit Suisse filed its amended complaint in the action on August 28, 2008. Shortly thereafter, Teufel filed its own complaint for foreclosure on its lien, naming Credit Suisse as a defendant. On October 17, 2008, the district court entered an order consolidating the Credit Suisse and Teufel lawsuits, along with other pending mechanics lien suits. On February 10, 2009, the district court entered an order requiring all of the mechanics lien claimants to file a disclosure form within twenty-one days. The disclosures were to include the claimant\u2019s controlling eontraet(s), as well as the date on which the claimant first provided labor and material to the property, and each claimant\u2019s purported priority date. That same day, Teufel\u2019s former counsel of record filed Teufel\u2019s disclosure form in which he listed various dates in 2007 as its lien priority dates. At that time, Teufel also identified twenty-seven recorded partial releases of its lien claim. On March 8, 2009, Teufel filed an amended disclosure form, which again listed various dates in 2007 as its lien priority dates. This amended disclosure form utilized an alphabetized parcel system to identify those properties upon which it sought to foreclose, and it allocated the alleged amounts owing on each parcel. In June of 2009, Teufel then filed a supplemental disclosure form and attached the Master Agreement as the controlling contract between Teufel and Tamarack.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On June 30, 2009, new counsel entered an appearance on Teufel\u2019s behalf. After Credit Suisse filed a motion for summary judgment based on the lien priority dates in Teufel\u2019s disclosure forms, but prior to the time set for argument, Teufel\u2019s new counsel filed a second amended lien disclosure form wherein the priority dates were amended from the 2007 dates to June 14, 2004. It was via this second amended lien disclosure form, filed on September 25, 2009, that Teufel first asserted that it provided labor and materials for the Resort beginning in 2004. In conjunction with its opposition to Credit Suisse\u2019s summary judgment motion, Teufel submitted the affidavit of Rick Christensen, Teufel\u2019s Landscape Division Manager. In his affidavit, Christensen identified four separate Landscape Construction Agreements \u2014 dated in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 \u2014 as the contracts that governed the relationship between Teufel and Tamarack. The district court ultimately denied Credit Suisse\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding Teufel\u2019s priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Teufel filed its own motion for summary judgment on April 29, 2010, asserting that based on its priority date of June 14, 2004, it had priority over the Credit Suisse mortgages. The district court denied Teufel\u2019s motion for the same reason it had denied Credit Suisse\u2019s there was a genuine issue of material fact as to Teufel\u2019s priority date.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">A court trial regarding the validity, priority, and amount of Teufel\u2019s lien was held on October 5 and 6, 2010. On May 11, 2011, the district court entered its Omnibus Findings and Conclusions Re: Validity, Priority and Amount of Various Lien and Mortgage Claims (\u201cOmnibus Order\u201d). In the Omnibus Order, the district court determined that: (1) Teufel\u2019s claim of lien is valid and enforceable; (2) Teufel\u2019s lien claim is inferior to the Credit Suisse mortgages; and (3) Teufel\u2019s claim of lien amounts to $122,066.98. Subsequently, Teufel filed a motion to clarify, followed by a motion to reconsider. Credit Suisse filed its own motion to clarify. On July 28, 2011, the district court entered orders granting the motions to clarify but denying Teufel\u2019s motion to reconsider. As a result of granting the motions to clarify, and to correct certain clerical errors and omissions, the district court entered its Substitute Omnibus Findings and Conclusions Re: Validity, Priority and Amount of Various Lien and Mortgage Claims (\u201cSubstitute Omnibus Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">With regard to the subject matter of this appeal, the only substantive change reflected in the Substitute Omnibus Order was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>district court\u2019s calculation of Teufel\u2019s lien amount. In its Substitute Omnibus Order, the district court increased Teufel\u2019s lien amount to $306,543.30, or $184,476.32 more than the original $122,066.98 awarded in the Omnibus Order. This increase was based on Teufel\u2019s argument in support of its motion to clarify that it had an additional $184,476.32 lien on a certain parcel that the district court had failed to take into account in its Omnibus Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">On September 27, 2011, Teufel filed a motion seeking prejudgment interest in the amount of $99,911.62, as well as a default judgment against Tamarack for the full amount of the claim of lien, plus interest, costs, and attorney fees. On December 12, 2011, the district court entered default judgment against Tamarack and in favor of Teufel in the amount of $993,686.17 \u2014 the full amount of Teufel\u2019s original claim of lien, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees. Subsequently, on February 3, 2012, the district court entered its Memorandum Decision and Order Re: Various Requests for Awards of Attorneys\u2019 Fees, Costs and Prejudgment Interest (\u201cOrder Re: Attorney Fees\u201d). Therein, the district court found that Teufel had only partially prevailed as against Credit Suisse, and thus apportioned its attorney fees and costs \u201cby subtracting forty percent ... from the overall amount.\u201d After subtracting forty percent, the district court ended up awarding attorney fees to Teufel in the amount of $162,775.20, costs as a matter of right in the amount of $4,329.23, discretionary costs in the amount of $4,865.56, and prejudgment interest calculated at a variable rate in the amount of $63,153.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On June 18, 2012, the district court entered its Memorandum Decision and Order: Re: Proposed Judgments and Decrees of Foreclosure and Orders for Sale, as well as its Second Amended Second Revised Judgment and Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale (\u201cSecond Amended Order\u201d). The Second Amended Order contained a certificate of final judgment consistent with I.R.C.P. 54(b). Teufel filed a timely notice of appeal, which indicated that it was appealing both the Substitute Omnibus Order and the Second Amended Order. Its briefing reflects that it is also appealing findings made by the district court in its Order Re: Attorney Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-11\">I.

Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">The Court has previously articulated the appropriate standard of review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-19\">This Court limits its review of a trial court\u2019s decision to determining \u201cwhether the evidence supports the findings of fact, and whether the findings of fact support the conclusions of law.\u201d Unless the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, they will not be set aside. Accordingly, \u201ceven if the evidence is conflicting, if the findings of fact are supported by substantial and competent evidence [we] will not disturb those findings on appeal.\u201d Conversely, when reviewing a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, \u201cthis Court is not bound by the legal conclusions of the trial court, but may draw its own conclusions from the facts presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-20\"><em>City of Meridian v. Petra Inc., </em>154 Idaho 425, 434-35, 299 P.3d 232, 241-42 (2013). Additionally, interpreting an unambiguous contract is a question of law and subject to free review. <em>Id. </em>at 435, 299 P.3d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">With regard to the issue of the lien amount, \u201c[a] district court\u2019s findings of fact in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>a court-tried case will be liberally construed on appeal in favor of the judgment entered, in view of the district court\u2019s role as trier of fact.\u201d <em>Franklin Bldg. Supply Co. v. Sumpter, </em>139 Idaho 846, 849, 87 P.3d 955, 958 (2004). Indeed, \u201c[i]f the findings of fact are based on substantial evidence, even if the evidence is conflicting, they will not be overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">A district court\u2019s determination of a reasonable attorney fee under I.C. \u00a7 45-513 is a factual determination to which this Court applies an abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Elec. Wholesale Supply Co., Inc. v. Nielson, </em>136 Idaho 814, 824, 41 P.3d 242, 252 (2001). Thus, the Court must inquire \u201c(1) whether the trial court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the trial court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the legal standards applicable to the specific choices available to it; and (3) whether the trial court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">B. The district court did not err in holding that Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages have priority over Teufel\u2019s claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">This Court has held that when \u201ca lien is filed within ninety days after the completion of the labor or services, the lien may encompass the entirety of the work performed under a single contract.\u201d <em>Terra-West, Inc. v. Idaho Mut. Trust, LLC, </em>150 Idaho 393, 400, 247 P.3d 620, 627 (2010). Therefore, the determination of this case depends on whether one continuous contract controlled, or whether Teufel\u2019s relationship with Tamarack was in fact governed by four separate contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The district court ultimately found that Teufel\u2019s claim of lien was inferior to Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages because \u201cthe work that Teufel performed in 2007 was not done as part of Teufel\u2019s 2004 contract.\u201d Instead, the district court found that Teufel and Tamarack\u2019s relationship was governed by four distinct contracts and that \u201c[t]he priority for Teufel\u2019s claim of lien relates back to when Teufel first provided labor or materials for the work specified in the 2007 contract.\u201d This determination by the district court was essentially the <em>coup de grace </em>to Teufel\u2019s case because Tamarack\u2019s \u201cproperty value is almost certainly much less than the total of claims, [and therefore] it is unlikely that any lien claimant whose interest is inferior or subordinate to Credit Suisse will receive any part of the foreclosure proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">On appeal, Teufel asserts that the district court made erroneous findings of fact that led to incorrect conclusions of law. Primarily, Teufel takes issue with the district court\u2019s finding that Teufel\u2019s work was governed by four separate contracts. Teufel argues that, based on this erroneous factual finding, the district court\u2019s conclusion of law should be reversed. Credit Suisse counters that there was substantial and competent evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">1. Substantial, competent evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that four separate contracts \u2014 as opposed to one continuous contract \u2014 governed the relationship between Teufel and Tamarack.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">At trial, Teufel was unable to provide signed copies of any of its operative agreements with Tamarack. However, the district court found, based on the trial evidence, that unsigned copies of the 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 contracts offered into evidence by Teufel were the operative agreements between the parties. In its analysis, the district court first looked to the 2004 contract. It found that the scope of work \u2014 which enumerated eleven specific projects and also contained one general provision allowing for the completion of \u201csuch other tasks as may be directed by the Owner\u2019s Representative\u201d \u2014 was plain and unambiguous. The district court then found that the 2005, 2006, and 2007 contracts were not renewal contracts because each had a \u201cnew scope of work and a substantial completion date.\u201d But more than that, after examining each contract\u2019s language, the district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">There is nothing in the agreements that required Tamarack to employ Teufel in subsequent years. There is nothing in the 2004 contract that obligates either Tamar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ack or Teufel beyond the 2004 contract. Teufel was under no obligation to accept future work and Tamarack had no obligation to award the work to Teufel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">On appeal, however, Teufel argues, \u201cthe contracts entered into in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were not separate contracts but modifications and extensions of the 2004 Landscape Construction Agreement.\u201d In support of this contention, Teufel asserts the following: (1) Teufel was hired as the exclusive landscape company; (2) during negotiations Tamarack represented that the project would be a multiyear project; (3) drafting a multiyear contract was \u201cimpossible because there was no [landscape] plan to provide the basis for the contract\u201d; (4) the yearly agreements were drafted to allow for changes in plant material and costs; (5) Teufel worked at Tamarack outside the dates contemplated in the yearly agreements; (6) Teufel worked outside the scope of work included in each yearly agreement; (7) most of the projects were multiyear endeavors; and (8) \u201c[t]he plain language of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 [agreements] demonstrates that the contracts were extensions of previous contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Credit Suisse counters that there was substantial evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Teufel had four separate agreements as opposed to a single continuous contract. Specifically, Credit Suisse points out that Tamarack\u2019s project manager Rick Christensen \u201ctestified that his company required a signed written contract each year as a condition to its own commitment to its local growers to purchase trees and shrubs.\u201d Moreover, Credit Suisse argues, Tamarack employee Chris Kirk testified that Teufel wanted a signed contract \u201cbecause it was a huge financial commitment for Teufel\u201d and \u201c[t]hey wanted a comfort level that [Tamarack] was going to be able to provide payment.\u201d Most importantly, Credit Suisse says, was the district court\u2019s reliance on the language contained in the yearly agreements themselves. Credit Suisse argues that the plain language in the yearly agreements make it clear that the 2005, 2006, and 2007 contracts were not extensions or modifications of the 2004 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The Court\u2019s \u201cprimary objective when interpreting a contract is to discover the mutual intent of the parties at the time the contract is made.\u201d <em>Straub v. Smith, </em>145 Idaho 65, 69, 175 P.3d 754, 758 (2007). When feasible, \u201cthe intent of the parties should be ascertained from the language of the agreement as the best indication of their intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whether a contract is <em>ambiguous </em>\u2014 i.e. reasonably subject to conflicting interpretations \u2014 is a question of law. <em>Bakker v. Thunder Spring-Wareham, LLC, </em>141 Idaho 185, 190, 108 P.3d 332, 337 (2005). Moreover, \u201c[a]n unambiguous contract will be given its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, neither party suggests that the 2004 contract is anything but unambiguous. And, the district court found that the 2004 contract was unambiguous. As an unambiguous contract, \u201cits interpretation and legal effect are questions of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">This brings us to the plain language of the contracts. First, a reading of the 2004 contract yields no language that suggests that Teufel was obligated to work during any time other than from the date the agreement was entered into, June 4, 2004, to when it was required to \u201cachieve substantial completion of the entire Work not later than November 30, 2004.\u201d The scope of work in the 2004 contract was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">The Owner and Contractor acknowledge that no landscape plans or specifications for Project have been created and, therefore, the Contractor\u2019s scope of Work shall be to perform all grading, landscaping, restoration, irrigation and related site work for the following projects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">1. Twenty (20) \u201cTwin Creek\u201d Chalets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">2. Eighteen (18) \u201cDiscovery\u201d Chalets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">3. Twenty-four (24) Cottages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">4. Pioneer Village, including the irrigation and seeding of the snow front;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">5. Ski-over and Ski-under bridges (including retaining walls);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">6. Discovery Drive, including key intersections thereon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">7. Roundabouts for Whitewater Road and West Valley Road;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">8. Pinnacle Place and Sugarloaf Road;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">9. The Dining Yurt <em>and existing Recreation Yurt areas;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>10. Screening of parking at the entrance and other parking overflow areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">11. <em>At Owner\u2019s direction, screening of specific utilities throughout the Project; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">12. Such other tasks as may be directed by the Owner\u2019s Representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Similarly, the 2005 contract was entered into on April 12, 2005 and required Teufel to \u201cachieve substantial completion of the entire Work not later than December 31, 2005.\u201d The scope of work in the 2005 contract included some overlap with the scope of work outlined in the 2004 contract, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">1. Finish landscape installation for 20 Twin Creek Chalets and Rock Creek Cottages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">3. Complete landscaping for the Entry &amp; Whitewater Roundabouts</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avy\">Likewise, the 2006 contract was entered into on May 16, 2006 and Teufel was to substantially complete the work by December 31, 2006. The 2006 contract\u2019s scope of work includes the following: \u201cCompletion of the landscape for the Bayview Sales Mod.\u201d Finally, the 2007 contract was entered into on May 2, 2007 and Teufel was to substantially complete the work by December 31, 2007. The 2007 contract includes \u201cCompletion of Golden Bar Townhomes\u201d within the scope of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">The district court\u2019s factual finding that four separate contracts controlled was supported by substantial, competent evidence. Teufel asserts that \u201c[t]he plain language of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 [contracts] demonstrates that the contracts were extensions of previous contracts.\u201d Teufel argues that the language used in the scope of work sections, in particular \u201cfinish,\u201d \u201ccomplete,\u201d and \u201ccompletion,\u201d is \u201ca clear indicator that the work was ongoing, uniform and one part of the same improvement.\u201d By making this argument, Teufel seeks to expand the definition of \u201cfinish\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d beyond their plain meanings. Hypothetically, Teufel could have been \u201cfinishing\u201d or \u201ccompleting\u201d another nursery\u2019s prior work \u2014 and in that scenario, a second contract that provides for the completion of another\u2019s work certainly would not be deemed an extension of the first contract between Tamarack and another nursery. Simply put, there is no language of modification or extension within any of the yearly contracts. Including uncompleted projects from prior years within the scope of work does not change that.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">Moreover, the additional evidence submitted by Teufel cannot override the plain language of the agreements. In essence, each of Teufel\u2019s remaining arguments attempts to do just that. For example, Tamarack indicated that Teufel would be the exclusive landscaper and that the project would cover multiple years. The district court agreed with this, finding that \u201cTamarack desired to have the same landscape contractor for the entire project. Teufel expected to be the landscape contractor for the entire project.\u201d Importantly, though, the district court noted that that \u201cintent or expectation was not made part of any binding agreement between Tamarack and Teufel.\u201d Teufel\u2019s argument that drafting a multiyear contract was \u201cimpossible\u201d is unconvincing, especially in light of the fact that the Master Agreement presented to Teufel by Tamarack provided that it would \u201cautomatically renew for additional one (1) year periods unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its intent not to renew____\u201d Although Teufel rejected the Master Agreement, the language in the proposal demonstrates that drafting a multiyear contract was actually as simple as including explicit language to that effect. Teufel\u2019s claims that it worked at Tamarack outside the dates contemplated in each of the yearly contracts and beyond the scope of work provided therein may be accurate, but again, the actual services provided and the dates they were provided does not somehow transform the 2005, 2006, and 2007 contracts into extensions or modifications of the 2004 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">The district court\u2019s determination that Teufel\u2019s relationship with Tamarack was governed by four separate contracts was supported by substantial and competent evidence, namely, the plain language of the contracts themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>2. Teufel and Tamarack\u2019s relationship was not governed by an open account.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Teufel also argues that it had one continuous contract with Tamarack based upon an open account. Although Teufel did raise this argument below, the district court did not address whether an open account was in play-in this case. The district court\u2019s failure to address this argument is not problematic because the record yields an obvious answer to the relevant question. <em>See Kugler v. Northwest Aviation, Inc., </em>108 Idaho 884, 887, 702 P.2d 922, 925 (Ct.App.1985) (finding that the question of whether an open account existed would need to be determined on remand by the trial court because the Court could only overlook the trial court\u2019s omission of that finding \u201cwhere the record is clear, and yields an obvious answer to the relevant question\u201d) (internal citations omitted). Here, the record is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">An action on an open account is \u201ca particularized type of contract claim.\u201d <em>Beco Const. Co., Inc. v. Harper Contracting, Inc., </em>130 Idaho 4, 8, 936 P.2d 202, 206 (Ct.App.1997). \u201cAn open account refers to a continuing series of transactions between the parties, where the balance is unascertained and future transactions between the parties are expected.\u201d <em>Seubert Excavators, Inc. v. Eucon Corp., </em>125 Idaho 409, 415, 871 P.2d 826, 832 (1994). \u201cWhere an open account exists the parties are deemed to intend that individual items on the account will not be viewed separately but that the account will be considered as a connected series of transactions.\u201d <em>Kugler, </em>108 Idaho at 887, 702 P.2d at 925. Indeed, \u201c[w]here materials are furnished for the same ... improvement in installments and at intervals, and the parties intend them to be included in one account in settlement, the entire account will be treated as a continuous and connected transaction, and the lien limitation begins to run from the last item of the contract.\u201d <em>Valley Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Driessel, </em>13 Idaho 662, 670, 93 P. 765, 768 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The agreement between Teufel and Tamarack does not constitute an open account. While future transactions between the parties may have been expected, any balances by definition could not have been \u201cunascertained,\u201d because it is undisputed that \u201cTamarack paid Teufel in full for all amounts billed in 2004, 2005, and 2006.\u201d Moreover, nothing in the 2004 agreement, or the other yearly agreements, indicates that an open account \u2014 rather than the plain, unambiguous words in the yearly agreements themselves \u2014 would govern the relationship between Teufel and Tamarack.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, when the language of a contract is unambiguous, \u201cthe meaning of the contract and intent of the parties must be determined from the plain meaning of the contract\u2019s own words.\u201d <em>City of Idaho Falls v. Home Indem. Co., </em>126 Idaho 604, 607, 888 P.2d 383, 386 (1995). Thus, whether Teufel and Tamarack actually intended for their relationship to be governed by an open account is irrelevant \u2014 not to mention doubtful based on the record\u2014 because the plain language within the yearly agreements does not express that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">3. Based on its factual findings, the district court did not err in concluding that Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages have priority over Teufel\u2019s claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Based on the district court\u2019s factual findings, its resulting legal conclusion \u2014 that Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages have priority over Teufel\u2019s claim of lien \u2014 was correct. Idaho Code \u00a7 45-506 governs the priority between a mechanics lien and a mortgage. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">The liens provided for in this chapter shall be on equal footing with those liens within the same class of liens, without reference to the date of the filing of the lien claim or claims and are preferred to any lien, mortgage or other encumbrance, which may have attached subsequent to the time when the building, improvement or structure was commenced, work done, equipment, materials or fixtures were rented or leased, or materials or professional services were commenced to be furnished; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>also to any lien, mortgage, or other encumbrance of which the lienholder had no notice, and which was unrecorded at the time the building, improvement or structure was commenced, work done, equipment, materials or fixtures were rented or leased, or materials or professional services were commenced to be furnished.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asl\">I.C. \u00a7 45-506. The Court has interpreted this provision to mean \u201cthat the lien claimant could be given priority when either the building, improvement or structure was commenced, some entity or individual began to work on the building, improvement or structure, or when the materials or professional services were first furnished.\u201d <em>Ultrawall, Inc. v. Washington Mut. Bank, FSB, </em>135 Idaho 832, 835, 25 P.3d 855, 858 (2001). In sum, \u201cwhichever of these events occurred first would determine the priority for all liens as against a mortgage lien holder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">A mechanic\u2019s lien generally \u201crelates back to the date of commencement of the work or improvement of the commencement to furnish the material.\u201d <em>White v. Const. Mining &amp; Mill. Co., </em>56 Idaho 403, 420, 55 P.2d 152, 160 (1936). However, this rule is not without exception. In <em>Terra-West, </em>this Court explained that \u201c[e]entral to our analysis [in <em>White </em>] was the fact that all of the work claimed under the mechanic\u2019s lien was completed pursuant to one continuous employment contract, and therefore, the lien attached at the time the work began and encompassed all work subsequently done under the contract.\u201d <em>Terra-West, </em>150 Idaho 393, 400, 247 P.3d 620, 627 (2010). This Court went on to hold: \u201cso long as a lien is filed within ninety days after the completion of the labor or services, the lien may encompass the entirety of the work performed under the contract.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Based on these rules, the district court was correct in holding that Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages had priority over Teufel\u2019s claim of lien. Teufel apparently had been paid for all of its work performed in 2004, 2005, and 2006<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Teufel\u2019s claim of lien was for work performed exclusively in 2007. Therefore, as the district court noted: \u201cFor the 2007 work to relate back to 2004, the work must have been such as to constitute a continuous single agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the district court found that Teufel and Tamarack\u2019s relationship was governed by four separate contracts, it found that Teufel\u2019s priority date could not relate back to 2004. Since we agree with the district court that four separate contracts controlled, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that Credit Suisse\u2019s mortgages were superior to Teufel\u2019s claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">C. The district court did not err in calculating Teufel\u2019s lien amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">The district court stated that \u201cTeufel\u2019s explanation about the amount of the lien claim was confusing and contradictory.\u201d Nonetheless, in its Substitute Omnibus Order, the district court found that Teufel met its burden in showing that the lien amount totaled $306,543.30. With regard to Teufel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>claim for additional amounts, the devil is in the details, which are rather murky.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">On appeal, Teufel argues that the district court \u201cimproperly reduced Teufel\u2019s lien amount after the trial.\u201d More specifically, Teufel contends that \u201c[g]iven the partial lien releases, the amount of Teufel\u2019s Claim of Lien should have been confirmed in the amount of $406,199.07, as set forth in Trial Exhibit 9:056.\u201d Essentially, Teufel argues that the district court improperly reduced the lien amount, because under I.C. \u00a7 45-508 it was not necessary to allocate precise amounts to specific parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Credit Suisse argues that Teufel, in certain instances, failed to meet its burden of proof because it was unable to match certain unpaid amounts to parcels that had been liened but not released. It is irrelevant that Teufel apportioned its lien claim, Credit Suisse argues, because \u201cwhat mattered ultimately was whether Teufel was able to identify whether its work had been performed on one of the parcels that had not been released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Teufel initially listed the amount owed in its claim of lien at $564,560.28. Credit Suisse disputed the lien amount and the district court ultimately opined that Teufel\u2019s evidence at trial \u201cwas, in many respects, confusing.\u201d It had good reason to characterize Teufel\u2019s evidence this way. As the district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">Teufel\u2019s lien was filed against all of the platted property identified in its lien claim. There is an attachment to the claim of lien that apportions the total amount among twenty four (24) described activities, areas or parcels described in the exhibit____ There is no information in the lien or the attachment [that] explains how the twenty four (24) activities, areas or parcels described in the exhibit relate to the property that is actually identified in the hen. In its Amended Complaint for Foreclosure filed February 10, 2009, Teufel ... did not seek to foreclose on the twenty four (24) activities, areas or parcels that were described in the attachment to the claim of lien. Rather Teufel alleged that it was seeking to foreclose upon forty four (44) distinct parcels which Teufel identified as parcels A-LL____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">Teufel apparently obtained these parcel descriptions from a litigation guarantee done by Stewart Title Guaranty Company. How Teufel, its counsel and/or Stewart Title determined that these forty four (44) parcels were the parcels that should be foreclosed upon is not fully understood and was not well explained at trial. In any event, in the foreclosure complaint, Teufel sought foreclosure of the parcels using the parcel description from Stewart Title, and not the property described in its claim of lien or the twenty four (24) items listed in the lien attachment____In the lien disclosure forms, Teufel allocated or apportioned its lien claim among the forty four (44) parcels listed in the foreclosure complaint. Teufel also disclosed in the lien disclosure forms that Teufel had recorded partial lien releases affecting twenty seven (27) of the forty four (44) parcels it sought to foreclose. However, the lien disclosures did not detail or explain what effect, if any, the releases would have on Teufel\u2019s foreclosure request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The testimony of Teufel\u2019s key witness was also less than clear. Rick Christensen, Teufel\u2019s project manager, initially testified that the lien amount was $529,556.47, that he was aware Teufel had released certain liens, but that he \u201chad not had the opportunity to calculate the effect of the releases on the amount claimed in the lien.\u201d However, when asked on cross-examination about one of Teufel\u2019s trial briefs, in which Teufel claimed that the amount of the lien was $359,244.71 after taking the released liens into account, Christensen testified that the lien amount should be reduced to $406,199.07, despite his earlier testimony that he had not yet calculated the effect of the released parcels. Further inconsistencies arose when, \u201con re-direct examination, Christensen produced a type-written summary that he had been referring to during his testimony.\u201d This summary indicated that, after taking the released liens into account, the lien amount should be $406,199.07. The discrepancy between the amount in the written summary and the amount in Teufel\u2019s trial brief was never explained. Nor was it ever explained why Christensen testified that he had not had a chance to calculate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>released parcels\u2019 effect on the lien amount while at the same time referring to a written summary that clearly had made those calculations. Moreover, Teufel had listed twenty-seven partial lien releases in its second amended lien disclosure. However, at trial Credit Suisse established that additional releases existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The district court\u2019s finding that Teufel\u2019s lien amount totaled $306,543.30 was supported by substantial evidence, especially in light of the fact that this Court is required to liberally construe a district court\u2019s findings of fact in view of its role as the trier of fact. <em>See Franklin Bldg. Supply Co., </em>139 Idaho at 849, 87 P.3d at 958. Teufel\u2019s argument that the district court erred in holding the way it did because Teufel\u2019s \u201cretention fees were not properly allocated to specific parcels of property\u201d misreads the district court\u2019s analysis. Teufel\u2019s problem was not an allocation issue; it was simply an issue of presenting conflicting and confusing evidence. As Credit Suisse points out, it was the dozens of partial lien releases that \u201cproved to be the rub.\u201d It remains unclear whether the amount that Teufel asserted to be owed\u2014$406,199.07\u2014 took into account the additional partial lien releases that Credit Suisse established at trial. Those partial lien releases\u2014in addition to the twenty-seven disclosed by Teufel\u2014were apparently set out in Trial Exhibit 1:304. However, the actual amounts of the releases are not listed in that exhibit, nor in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In sum, Teufel\u2019s claim of lien amount varied throughout this litigation, ranging from \u201c$529,556.47 (plus interest) in its lien notice, $429,647.15 and $392,035.38 in its disclosure forms, $359,244.71 in its trial brief, and finally $406,199.07\u201d in what ended up being marked as Trial Exhibit 9:056. In purporting to proffer evidence in support of its claim, Teufel identified the property it sought to foreclose on in different ways, first by description and then by alphabetized \u201cparcels.\u201d The effect of the partial lien releases, if any, was not explained, and in many cases Teufel did not show that the work done was for an unreleased parcel. Based on the confusing descriptions, conflicting testimony, and lack of evidence regarding the effect of the partial lien releases, the district court\u2019s calculation of Teufel\u2019s lien amount is affirmed based on the substantial evidence that Teufel did provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">D. The district court did not err in calculating interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Teufel argues on appeal that the district court incorrectly adopted Credit Suisse\u2019s interest calculation, which utilized a variable prime rate. The interest issue hinges on whether the Wells Fargo prime rate contemplated in the 2007 Agreement is variable or fixed. Section 6.4 of the 2007 Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">Payments due and unpaid under this Agreement shall bear interest from the date payment is due at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate published by Wells Fargo Bank in Boise, Idaho plus two percent (2%).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Teufel \u201cidentified the Wells Fargo Bank Prime Rate in effect on the date each of its unpaid invoices became due\u201d and then added two percent, per the terms of the contract, to that fixed rate. Credit Suisse posits that the use of a fixed prime rate would be improper because the prime rate is, by its very nature, a variable rate that \u201cchanged regularly over the calculation period.\u201d The district court agreed with Credit Suisse in its Order Re: Attorney Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AKT\">The district court, \u201cas an exercise of discretion,\u201d applied a variable prime rate in determining awards of prejudgment interest to Teufel and other lien claimants. The district court cited to www.fedprimerate.com in finding that a \u201cprime rate, by its very nature, is a variable rate, and changes regularly over time.\u201d The district court further noted that applying a variable rate \u201cmore closely correlates to the actual loss sustained by the party who is owed money[,]\u201d which in turn furthers the purpose of prejudgment interest awards: to compensate an injured party for the time value of money. <em>See Stueve v. N. Lights, Inc., </em>122 Idaho 720, 722-23, 838 P.2d 323, 325-26 (Ct.App.1992). Ultimately, the district court awarded Teufel prejudgment interest at the variable rates put forth by Credit Suisse in an affidavit in support of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>memorandum in opposition to Teufel\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The district court did not err in its calculation of prejudgment interest. The language of Section 6.4 does not contemplate a fixed prime rate but, rather, a variable rate. The 2007 Agreement does not specify that the prime rate to be used is the one published on the date that payment becomes due; rather it states that \u201c[pjayments due ... shall bear interest from the date payment is due at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate published by Wells Fargo Bank in Boise, Idaho plus two percent (2%).\u201d Had the parties intended to use the prime rate published on the date that payment became due, the 2007 Agreement could have easily reflected that intent by simply saying so. It did not. Indeed, the prime rate is, by its nature, a variable rate. This determination is consistent with existing precedent and, as the district court noted, fosters the underlying purpose of prejudgment interest awards. <em>See Chase Bank USA, N.A. v. McCoy, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 871, 883 n. 10, 178 L.Ed.2d 716 (2011) (\u201cCertainly, under a \u201cvariable-rate\u201d plan the interest rate fluctuates according to an external variable easily discernable by the cardholder (like the Federal Prime rate....\u201d)); <em>In re Yett, </em>306 B.R. 287, 289 (9th Cir. BAP 2004) (\u201cBoth notes require interest at the same variable rate, initially 8.5%, calculated at the bank\u2019s \u2018prime rate\u2019 plus 1.5% per annum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s use of a variable rate and its calculation of interest made upon that rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">E. The district court did not err in apportioning Teufel\u2019s costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">In its Order Re: Attorney Fees, the district court ultimately awarded Teufel attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 45-513 in the amount of $162,775.20. Teufel initially sought an attorney fee award in the amount of $270,942.00, consisting of fees incurred with three separate law firms. The district court found that Teufel had only partially prevailed \u201cbecause Teufel did not prevail on the most important issue: whether Teufel has priority over the bank.\u201d Because Teufel only partially prevailed, the district court reduced its requested fee award by 40%. The district court also awarded Teufel costs as a matter of right in the amount of $4,329.23, and discretionary costs in the amount of $4,865.56. In its analysis regarding discretionary costs, the district court disallowed Teufel\u2019s request for trial preparation supplies \u201cbecause such costs appear to be ordinary and usual, not exceptional\u201d and its request for legal research fees because those were included in the attorney fee award. The district court approved all other discretionary costs, and then reduced the award by 40%, just like it did the attorney fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Teufel argues that the district court should have awarded it at least 75% of what it requested for attorney fees and costs. Its rationale is as follows: because Teufel initially sought $406,199.07 as its claim of lien award, but was eventually awarded $306,543.30, it recovered or \u201cprevailed\u201d on seventy-five percent of its claim. And, Teufel asserts, \u201cthe prevailing party should recover attorney fees and costs in the same percentage it is determined to be the prevailing party.\u201d Using that calculation, Teufel alleges that the district court should have awarded Teufel \u2014 at the least \u2014 attorney fees in the amount of $203,206.50 and discretionary costs in the amount of $8,843.27. Credit Suisse admits that attorney fees are statutorily mandated in this instance, but argues that the district court acted well within the bounds of its discretion in finding that Teufel only partially prevailed, and in reducing Teufel\u2019s attorney fee requests and costs by 40%.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">\u201cIn any civil action the court may award reasonable attorney fees ... to the prevailing party ... when provided for by any statute or contract.\u201d I.R.C.P. 54(e)(1). Idaho Code \u00a7 45-513 is such a statute. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">Any number of persons claiming liens against the same property may join in the same action, and when separate actions are commenced the court may consolidate them. The court shall also allow as part of the costs the moneys paid for filing and recording the claim, and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>I.C. \u00a7 45-513. This Court has explained that \u201c[s]ince the costs of filing and recording, as well as the attorney fees, are incidental to the foreclosure of a lien pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 45-513, the award of attorney fees as part of the enforcement of the lien is a mandatory award.\u201d <em>Elec. Wholesale Supply Co., Inc. v. Nielson, </em>136 Idaho 814, 823-24, 41 P.3d 242, 251-52 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(B) is instructive when determining whether a party prevailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">(B) Prevailing Party. In determining which party to an action is a prevailing party and entitled to costs, the trial court shall in its sound discretion consider the final judgment or result of the action in relation to the relief sought by the respective parties. The trial court in its sound discretion may determine that a party to an action prevailed in part and did not prevail in part, and upon so finding may apportion the costs between and among the parties in a fair and equitable manner after considering all of the issues and claims involved in the action and the resultant judgment or judgments obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ax-\">I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B). \u201cThe determination of prevailing party status is committed to the sound discretion of the district court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Jorgensen v. Coppedge, </em>148 Idaho 536, 538, 224 P.3d 1125, 1127 (2010). Moreover, \u201cthe prevailing party question is examined and determined from an overall view, not a elaim-by-claim analysis.\u201d <em>Eighteen Mile Ranch, LLC., v. Nord Excavating &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>141 Idaho 716, 719, 117 P.3d 130, 133 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">With regard to costs, Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1)(D) allows a court to award discretionary costs. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">Additional items of cost not enumerated in, or in an amount in excess of that listed in subparagraph (C), may be allowed upon a showing that said costs were necessary and exceptional costs reasonably incurred, and should in the interest of justice be assessed against the adverse party. The trial court, in ruling upon objections to such discretionary costs contained in the memorandum of costs, shall make express findings as to why such specific item of discretionary cost should or should not be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in reducing Teufel\u2019s attorney fee and discretionary cost requests by 40%. First, the district court repeatedly and explicitly recognized this issue as one within its discretion. Second, the district court acted within the boundaries of its discretion. Its analysis regarding whether Teufel had prevailed was consistent with the guidance provided in I.R.C.P. 54(d)(1)(B), and it made the determination \u201cfrom an overall view\u201d of the case, as opposed to utilizing a \u201cclaim-by-claim analysis.\u201d Third, the district court reached its decision by an exercise of reason. It made its decision after considering both parties\u2019 arguments, examining relevant law, and \u201creview[ingj the detailed billing records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">We affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects. Costs on appeal to Credit Suisse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-17\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES, and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. Section 10.3 of the Master Agreement provided: \"This Master Agreement is the sole agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter herein and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations or agreements, either written or oral.\u201d Teufel subsequently abandoned the contention that the Master Agreement was the operative contract between the parties and we therefore do not consider it to have any bearing on the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>. </em>Had Teufel not insisted on discrete one-year contracts, its argument would have been more persuasive. But it was Teufel who insisted on one-year contracts from the outset.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\">. There was some confusion at oral argument of the appeal as to whether there may have been some retainage owing on some of the contracts but the record does not disclose whether or not retainage remained owing on any of the contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b231-11\">. Teufel also seeks to analogize the present case to that of <em>Hopkins Northwest Fund, LLC v. Landscapes Unlimited, LLC, </em>151 Idaho 740, 264 P.3d 379 (2011). <em>Hopkins, </em>though, can be easily distinguished. The <em>Hopkins </em>case revolved around the application of I.C. \u00a7 45-508, which allows a lien claimant to file \"a single lien covering multiple improvements under common ownership, but, in order to maintain priority, the lien claimant must designate the amount owing as to each improvement.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>151 Idaho at 744, 264 P.3d at 383. This Court held that the lien claimant\u2019s \"work did not constitute multiple improvements as required to trigger the designation requirement of section 508.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 264 P.3d at 385. Instead, the Court characterized the claimant's project \u2014 landscaping a golf course\u2014 as a \"single improvement\u201d because (1) the labor and materials provided benefited the entire golf course; and (2) \"the work was done pursuant to a single contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Teufel asserts that the landscaping of the Resort was, just like the landscaping of the golf course in <em>Hopkins, </em>a single improvement. However, this argument is inapposite because I.C. \u00a7 45-508 is not at issue in this case. Therefore, whether Teufel\u2019s work constituted a single \"improvement\u201d under the meaning of that statute is irrelevant. Even if that inquiry was germane to this appeal, in characterizing Landscapes Unlimited\u2019s work on the golf course as a single improvement, this Court weighed heavily on the fact that one single contract controlled. Again, that is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
