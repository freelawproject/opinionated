We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings that are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">In January 2007, the Bank of Idaho made two construction loans to developers who planned to construct a fourplex on each of two adjoining lots in the city of Idaho Falls. The bank loaned $227,041.30 to construct a fourplex on Lot 1 and $226,737.80 to construct a fourplex on Lot 2. Each loan was secured by a separate deed of trust granted in the lot for which the loan was made, but each deed of trust included a provision stating, \u201cIn addition to the Note, this Deed of Trust secures all obligations, debts and liabilities, plus interest thereon, of Grantor to Lender____\u201d On February 27, 2009, each deed of trust was amended to add the other lot as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">The bank secured a separate policy of title insurance for each lot that was issued by the predecessor of First American Title Insurance Company. Each policy included an endorsement that the parties understood would insure against loss or damage that the bank might sustain by reason of a multifamily residence not being constructed on the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">After discussion with representatives of the city, the developers changed their original plans and built both fourplexes on Lot 2 and built a parking lot with storm water retention and landscaping on Lot 1. The developers later defaulted on their loans, and the bank foreclosed on both deeds of trust. At the foreclosure sale, the bank acquired each lot by making a full credit bid on all amounts due and owing on the note secured by the deed of trust. On June 10, 2010, the bank submitted a claim under the title policy issue with respect to Lot 1 to recover under the endorsement. The insurance company rejected the claim and the bank commenced this action to recover under the policy. In November 2010, the bank sold both lots to a third party for the sum of $360,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-16\">On January 27, 2012, the bank filed this action seeking to recover under the title insurance policy for the developers\u2019 failure to construct a multifamily residence on Lot 1. It filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking a determination that it was entitled to recover under the policy, and the insurance company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the complaint. The district court granted the insurance company\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed this action. The bank then timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">Did the District Court Err in Granting the Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b651-19\">The district court held that the bank\u2019s full credit bid terminated any liability of the insurance company under the terms of the title insurance policy. In so holding, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-20\">The endorsement at issue provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-21\">The Company hereby insures the owner of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage against loss or damage which the insured shall sustain by reason of the failure of (i) a MULTI FAMILY RESIDENCE <em>(description of improvement e.g. \u201ca single </em>residence\u201d) known as 1354 E 16th Street, Idaho Falls, ID 83401 <em>(street </em>address), to be located on the land at Date of Policy, or (ii) the map attached to this policy to correctly show the location and dimensions of the land according to the public records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-22\">This endorsement is issued as part of the policy. Except as it expressly states, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>it does not (i) modify any of the terms and provisions of the policy, (ii) modify any prior endorsements, (iii) extend the Date of Policy, or (iv) increase the Amount of Insurance. To the extent a provision of the policy or a previous endorsement is inconsistent with an express provision of this endorsement, this endorsement controls. Otherwise, this endorsement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the policy and of any prior endorsements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The endorsement, by its terms, does not insure against the failure of the multifamily residence to be constructed upon Lot 1. The endorsement insures that a specific structure is located on the insured property \u201cat Date of Policy,\u201d which was January 8, 2007, at 3:40 p.m. On that date, construction had not begun. However, the parties agree that the intent was to insure that the fourplex would be built upon the insured property, and it is undisputed that a multifamily residence was not constructed on Lot 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Section 7(b). The determination of whether the bank is entitled to recover under the title insurance policy begins with Section 7(b) of the policy. It provides, \u201cIn the event the insured has acquired the estate or interest in the manner described in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations or has conveyed the title, then the liability of the Company shall continue as set forth in Section 7(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d This provision is applicable if \u201cthe insured has acquired the estate or interest in the manner described in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Section 2(a). Section 2(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">The coverage of this policy shall continue in force as of Date of Policy in favor of (i)an insured who acquires all or any part of the estate or interest in the land by foreclosure, trustee\u2019s sale, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, or other legal manner which discharges the lien of the insured mortgage;____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">In this ease, the bank (an insured) acquired all of the estate by a trustee\u2019s sale. Therefore, pursuant to Section 7(b), \u201cthen the liability of the Company shall continue as set forth in Section 7(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d Thus, the liability of the insurance company continues as provided in Section 7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Section 7(a). Section 7(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-12\">This policy is a contract of indemnity against actual monetary loss or damage sustained or incurred by the insured claimant who has suffered loss or damage by reason of matters insured against by this policy and only to the extent herein described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-13\">(a) The liability of the Company under this policy shall not exceed the least of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-14\">(i) the Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A, or, if applicable, the amount of insurance as defined in Section 2(c) of these Conditions and Stipulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-15\">(ii) the amount of the unpaid principal indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage as limited or provided under Section 8 of these Conditions and Stipulations or as reduced under Section 9 of these Conditions and Stipulations, at the time the loss or damage insured against by this policy occurs, together with interest thereon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-16\">(iii) the difference between the value of the insured estate or interest as insured and the value of the insured estate or interest subject to the defect, lien or encumbrance insured against by this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-17\">Under Section 7(a), the liability of the insurance company is the least of the alternatives in subsections (i) through (iii). Thus, the insurance company is liable for damages unless its liability is terminated by the provisions of one of those subsections.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\"><em>Subsection 7(a) (i). </em>Under subsection (i), the liability of the company shall not exceed \u201cthe Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A.\u201d The amount of insurance in Schedule A is $227,041.30. Under subsection (i), the liability of the insurance company also cannot exceed \u201cthe amount of insurance as defined in Section 2(c) of these Conditions and Stipulations,\u201d if applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">Section 2(c). Section 2(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-20\">(c) Amount of Insurance. The amount of insurance after the acquisition or after the conveyance shall in neither event exceed the least of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>(i) The Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">(ii) the amount of the principal of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage as of Date of Policy, interest thereon, expenses of foreclosure, amounts advanced pursuant to the insured mortgage to assure compliance with laws or to protect the lien of the insured mortgage prior to the time of acquisition of the estate or interest in the land and secured thereby and reasonable amounts expended to prevent deterioration of improvements, but reduced by the amount of all payments made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">(iii) the amount paid by any governmental agency or governmental instrumentality, if the agency or instrumentality is the insured claimant, in the acquisition of the estate or interest in satisfaction of its insurance contract or guaranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>Subsection 2(c)(i). </em>Under Section 2(c)(i), the amount of insurance after acquisition of title or the conveyance of title cannot exceed \u201c[t]he amount of insurance stated in Schedule A.\u201d That amount is $227,041.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"><em>Subsection 2(c)(ii). </em>Under Section 2(c)(ii), the amount of insurance after acquisition of title or the conveyance of title cannot exceed \u201cthe amount of the principal of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage as of Date of Policy [plus interest and other sums], but reduced by the amount of all payments made.\u201d Under the policy, the term \u201cmortgage\u201d is defined to include a deed of trust. The title insurance company contends that \u201call payments made\u201d includes the full credit bid made by the bank at the trustee\u2019s sale. According to the insurance company, its liability is now zero. Thus, the question is whether a full credit bid constitutes \u201cpayments made\u201d under this provision of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">\u201cWhether an insurance policy is ambiguous is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Farmers Ins. Co. of Idaho, </em>143 Idaho 135, 137, 139 P.3d 737, 739 (2006). \u201cUnless a contrary intent is shown, common, non-technical words are given the meaning applied by laymen in daily usage \u2014 as opposed to the meaning derived from legal usage \u2014 in order to effectuate the intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Howard v. Oregon Mut. Ins. Co., </em>137 Idaho 214, 218, 46 P.3d 510, 514 (2002). \u201cA provision in an insurance contract must be read within the context in which it occurs.\u201d <em>Dave\u2019s Inc. v. Linford, </em>153 Idaho 744, 751, 291 P.3d 427, 434 (2012). The provision at issue begins with the words \u201cthe amount of the principal of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage\u201d and ends with the words \u201cbut reduced by the amount of all payments made.\u201d In this context, the words \u201cpayments made\u201d would normally be construed by laymen to mean payments made by the obligor on the principal indebtedness secured by the deed of trust, not a credit bid made by a lender at a trustee\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">In addition to construing a provision in the context in which it occurs, \u201cthe Court must construe the policy \u2018as a whole, not by an isolated phrase.\u2019\u201d <em>Cascade Auto Glass, Inc. v. Idaho Farm Bureau Ins. Co., </em>141 Idaho 660, 663, 115 P.3d 751, 754 (2005). Construing \u201call payments made\u201d to include a credit bid would make Section 2(c)(ii) conflict with Section 9(c). The latter section provides, \u201cPayment in full by any person or the voluntary satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage shall terminate all liability of the Company except as provided in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d Section 2(a) refers to the acquisition of title by the insured by a trustee\u2019s sale. Thus, under Section 9(c), payment in full by any person does not terminate the liability of the insurance company if the person making payment in full was the insured who purchased the property at a trustee\u2019s sale. When the lender acquires property subject to a deed of trust at a trustee\u2019s sale, the lender typically makes a full credit bid to purchase the property. If \u201call payments made\u201d in Section 2(c)(ii) included a full credit bid, then it would provide that a full credit bid by the insured terminated the company\u2019s liability while Section 9(c) would provide that a full credit bid by the lender would not \u201cterminate all liability of the Company.\u201d The conflicting provisions create an ambiguity, which is to be construed strongly against the insurer. <em>Farmers Ins. Co. of Idaho v. Talbot, </em>133 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Idaho 428, 435, 987 P.2d 1043, 1050 (1999). We therefore hold that the words \u201call payments made\u201d under Section 2(e) (ii) do not include a full credit bid by the insured at a trustee\u2019s sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><em>Subsection 2(c)(iii). </em>Under Section 2(c)(iii), the amount of insurance after acquisition of title or the conveyance of title cannot exceed \u201cthe amount paid by any governmental agency or governmental instrumentality, if the agency or instrumentality is the insured claimant, in the acquisition of the estate or interest in satisfaction of its insurance contract or guaranty.\u201d There is no contention that this provision is applicable to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\"><em>Subsection 7(a)(ii). </em>Subsection (ii) provides that the insurance company\u2019s liability cannot exceed \u201cthe amount of the unpaid principal indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage as limited or provided under Section 8 of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d Section 8 has no application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section (ii) also provides that the company\u2019s liability cannot exceed \u201cthe amount of the unpaid principal indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage ... as reduced under Section 9 of these Conditions and Stipulations, at the time the loss or damage insured against by this policy occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Section 9. Section 9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">9. REDUCTION OF INSURANCE: REDUCTION OR TERMINATION OF LIABILITY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\">(a) All payments under this policy, except payments made for costs, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, shall reduce the amount of the insurance pro tanto. However, any payments made prior to the acquisition of title to the estate or interest as provided in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations shall not reduce pro tanto the amount of the insurance afforded under this policy except to the extent that the payments reduce the amount of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">(b) Payment in part by any person of the principal of the indebtedness, or any other obligation secured by the insured mortgage, or any voluntary partial satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage, to the extent of the payment, satisfaction or release, shall reduce the amount of insurance pro tanto. The amount of insurance may thereafter be increased by accruing interest and advances made to protect the lien of the insured mortgage and secured thereby, with interest thereon, provided in no event shall the amount of insurance be greater than the Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-14\">(c) Payment in full by any person or the voluntary satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage shall terminate all liability of the Company except as provided in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Subsection 9(a). </em>Subsection 9(a) does not apply in this case because it only reduces the amount of insurance if there are payments under the policy. The company has not made any payments under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\"><em>Subsection 9(b). </em>Subsection 9(b) may be applicable if the sale of the property by the bank constituted \u201c[p]ayment in part by any person of the principal of the indebtedness.\u201d The meaning of that provision was not addressed below, and so we do not address it on appeal. If it is applicable, it would only \u201creduce the amount of insurance pro tanto.\u201d The total amount secured by the deed of trust on Lot 1 was apparently $453,779.10, because it secured the amount of the loan applicable to Lot 1 ($227,041.30) plus all other obligation, debts, and liabilities owing by the developers to the bank, which would include the amount of the loan applicable to Lot 2 ($226,737.80).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>Subsection 9(c). </em>Subsection 9(c) is not applicable. It provides, \u201cPayment in full by any person or the voluntary satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage shall terminate all liability of the Company <em>except as provided in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 2(a) states that the coverage under the policy shall continue in force \u201cin favor of (i) an insured who acquires all or any part of the estate or interest in the land by foreclosure, trustee\u2019s sale, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure, or other legal manner which discharges the lien of the insured mortgage.\u201d The bank acquired all of the estate in the land by trustee\u2019s sale. Therefore, assuming that the bank\u2019s full credit bid constituted \u201c[pjayment in full by any person or the voluntary satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage,\u201d it would not terminate the insurance company\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The district court held: \u201cUnder Section 7(a)(ii), there was no unpaid principal indebtedness after the foreclosure sale. Under Section 9, the full credit bid constituted a \u2018voluntary satisfaction or release of the insured mortgage\u2019 which terminated Defendant\u2019s liability.\u201d The language quoted by the district court is in Section 9(e), but the court ignored the latter part of that subsection which states \u201cexcept as provided in Section 2(a) of these Conditions and Stipulations.\u201d As explained above, Section 2(a) refers to the lender obtaining title to the property in a trustee\u2019s sale. That exclusion makes Section 9(e) inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Section 2(b). Section 2(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">The coverage of this policy shall continue in force as of Date of Policy in favor of an insured only so long as the insured retains an estate or interest in the land, or holds an indebtedness secured by a purchase money mortgage given by a purchaser from the insured, or only so long as the insured shall have liability by reason of covenants of warranty made by the insured in any transfer or conveyance of the estate or interest____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Although the title insurance company quotes this provision in its brief, it does not provide any argument as to its applicability. Because the alleged breach of the policy occurred prior to the conveyance of the property by the bank, it does not appear applicable. If the insurance company was contending that this provision was applicable, that assertion was waived because it was not supported by argument and authority. <em>Bolognese v. Forte, </em>153 Idaho 857, 866, 292 P.3d 248, 257 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">For the above reasons, the district court erred in holding that the title insurance company had no liability under the policy. The endorsement provides that \u201c[t]he Company hereby insures the owner of the indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage against loss or damage which the insured shall sustain by reason of the failure of [a multifamily residence to be built on Lot 1].\u201d The endorsement insures against \u201closs or damage\u201d that the bank sustains by reason of the failure of the multifamily residence to be constructed on the lot. It does not purport to define what constitutes \u201closs or damage.\u201d The endorsement also provides: \u201cTo the extent a provision of the policy or a previous endorsement is inconsistent with an express provision of this endorsement, this endorsement controls. Otherwise, this endorsement is subject to all of the terms and provisions of the policy and of any prior endorsements.\u201d Therefore, loss or damage would be as otherwise provided in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Section 7(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">This policy is a contract of indemnity against actual monetary loss or damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>sustained or incurred by the insured claimant who has suffered loss or damage by reason of matters insured against by this policy and only to the extent herein described.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-4\">(a) The liability of the Company under this policy shall not exceed the least of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">(i) the Amount of Insurance stated in Schedule A, or, if applicable, the amount of insurance as defined in Section 2(c) of these Conditions and Stipulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">(ii) the amount of the unpaid principal indebtedness secured by the insured mortgage as limited or provided under Section 8 of these Conditions and Stipulations or as reduced under Section 9 of these Conditions and Stipulations, at the time the loss or damage insured against by this policy occurs, together with interest thereon; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">(iii) the difference between the value of the insured estate or interest as insured and the value of the insured estate or interest subject to the defect, lien or encumbrance insured against by this policy. Subsections (a)(i) \u2014 (iii) state limits on the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">insurance company\u2019s liability, but they do not define loss or damage. However, section 7 states that the title insurance policy is \u201ca contract of indemnity against actual monetary loss or damage sustained or incurred by the insured claimant who has suffered loss or damage by reason of matters insured against by this policy.\u201d Because the issue was not addressed below, we express no opinion as to what damages claimed by the bank are covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Is Either Party Entitled to an Award of Attorney Fees on Appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">The bank seeks an award of attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code section 41-1839(1). That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">Any insurer issuing any policy, certificate or contract of insurance, surety, guaranty or indemnity of any kind or nature whatsoever that fails to pay a person entitled thereto within thirty (30) days after proof of loss has been furnished as provided in such policy, certificate or contract, ... the amount that person is justly due under such policy, certificate or contract shall in any action thereafter commenced against the insurer in any court in this state, or in any arbitration for recovery under the terms of the policy, certificate or contract, pay such further amount as the court shall adjudge reasonable as attorney\u2019s fees in such action or arbitration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACcO\"><em>Id. </em>If the district court determines that the bank is entitled to attorney fees under this statute, then the district court must include reasonable attorney fees for this appeal in its award.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">The title insurance company seeks an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to Idaho Code sections 12-123 and 41-1839(4). Because it is not the prevailing party on appeal, it is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under either of those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-17\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings that are consistent with this opinion.
