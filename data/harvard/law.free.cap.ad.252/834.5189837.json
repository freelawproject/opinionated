Appeal from order denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissed as academic. Memorandum: The lease was terminated, and the relation of landlord and tenant ceased when defendant was ejected from the premises by summary proceedings. (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1434.) The lessee defendant still remained liable to the lessor plaintiff, but the liability was for damages, not for rent <em>(Hermitage Co. </em>v. <em>Lavine, </em>248 N. Y. 333), and the action was prematurely brought. <em>(Lenco, Inc., </em>v. <em>Hirschfeld, </em>247 N. Y. 44.) The case of <em>Kottler </em>v. <em>N. Y. Bargain House, Inc. </em>(242 N. Y. 29) is not in point, because in that case there was no eviction. The case of <em>McCready </em>v. <em>Lindenborn </em>(172 N. Y. 400) is not in point because, though there the action was for damages and not for rent, the lease clearly provided that damages should be ascertained and collected from month to month. Plaintiff in this case must wait until the end of the leasing period before suing for damages. All concur. (One order denies plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment; the other order denies defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, in an action to recover rentals due.) Present \u2014 Sears, P. J., Edgcomb, Crosby, Lewis and Cunningham, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
