Corporations'\u2014when directors may not alter salaries and duties of officers during term of employment. The provision in the by-laws of a corporation that the officers are under the direction and control of the directors and that their duties and salaries are to be fixed by the directors does not reserve to the latter the power to alter the salaries and duties during- the term of the employment without the consent of the officers, but only to fix them at the outset of the term.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b645-5\" pgmap=\"645\">4. Corporations\u2014when election of officer is contract for year. The election of one to the office of vice president of a corporation constitutes a contract for a year.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b645-6\" pgmap=\"645\">5. Corporations\u2014when relieving officer of duties constitutes breach of contract. Where one who has been continuously elected vice president of a corporation every year for 11 years has, for the same length of time, performed the duties of sales manager, his contract of employment contemplates the performance of such duties, and, by relieving him of them, there is a breach of his contract.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b645-7\" pgmap=\"645\">6.

Trial, \u00a7 292*\u2014when proposition of laio in action by officer of corporation to recover for breach of contract of employment inapplicable to facts. In an action to recover for the breach of a contract of employment as officer of a corporation, where it is shown that plaintiff\u2019s salary and duties were to continue the same as in his former terms, subject to a temporary reduction consented to by him, a proposition of law that where, upon the election of an officer, the directors fix his duties and salary for the present and afterwards relieve him of his duties and reduce his salary to a nominal amount, such action on their part is not a discharge of the officer and a breach of his contract, while possibly correct as an abstract proposition of law, is not applicable to the facts of the case.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b646-5\" pgmap=\"646\">10.
