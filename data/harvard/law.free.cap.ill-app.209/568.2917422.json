Ton, plaintiff, against Steven Nemeth, defendant, before a justice of the peace to recover possession of a tract of land. Summons was issued, trial and judgment rendered for the plaintiff. Defendant sought no appeal from that judgment before the justice and did not apply to the justice to fix the amount of an appeal bond, but presented to the clerk of the Superior Court his appeal bond, where it was filed. Subsequently there was filed with the clerk of the Superior Court the transcript of the justice of the peace, accompanied by the complaint filed and the summons. The certificate accompanying the transcript stated that it was a true and correct transcript of the judgment and that it and the papers accompanying it, two in number, contained a full and perfect statement of all the proceedings before the justice in the cause. Neither the transcript nor any of the papers accompanying it referred to any prayer for an appeal, nor to an application to fix or the fixing of the amount of the appeal bond by the justice of the peace. Subsequently plaintiff filed in the office of the clerk of the Superior Court a limited appearance for the purpose of making a motion to dismiss the appeal of the defendant. After several continuances the motion to dismiss was allowed. From the order dismissing the appeal, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b597-7\" pgmap=\"597\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b597-8\" pgmap=\"597\">1.
