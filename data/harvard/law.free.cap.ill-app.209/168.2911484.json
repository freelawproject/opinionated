From a judgment for plaintiff on a directed verdict, defendant appeals.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-9\" pgmap=\"196\">One of the makers of this note had an account with the plaintiff bank, which had extended him credit of $16,000, evidenced by notes and indorsements of the same makers. The credit was increased $4,000 by their additional note guaranteed by defendant, which was renewed from time to time until the note in question was given. Prior to the last renewal of this note the bank called for further security, and one of the other makers gave his individual note for $18,000, secured by a trust deed on certain property. Four days later notes evidencing the indebtedness were renewed, one for $13,097.95 as a collateral note with the $18,000 note pledged as collateral thereto, and one for $4,000 as a plain note of hand mailing no reference to collateral and bearing defendant\u2019s signature as guarantor. The amount of the former note was reduced by payments from sales of parts of the property released from the trust deed with plaintiff\u2019s consent.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-10\" pgmap=\"196\">Rot D.
