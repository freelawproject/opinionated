Appeal and error, \u00a7 1573*\u2014when consideration of counter-affidavits is not reversible error. The erroneous consideration by a court of counter-affidavits, filed in opposition to a motion to set aside and vacate a judgment or decree, so far as they relate to the merits of the case, is not alone reversible error.</headnotes><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\" pgmap=\"259\">Two issues of fact were ordered made and submitted to the jury: First, whether the writing purporting to be the last will and testament of the deceased was such last will and testament; and second, whether he was of sound mind and memory at the time of the execution of the instrument, to each of which the jury answered \u201cNo.\u201d The defendants offered no evidence and no appearance on their behalf was made at the trial. At the same term defendants presented a motion, supported by affidavits, asking that the verdict and decree be set aside and vacated, which after sev-eral continuances was overruled.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-5\" pgmap=\"259\">Melville B.

Judgment, \u00a7 144<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014how affidavits in support of applications to set aside judgment by default construed. In applications to set aside judgments by default or entered in ex parte proceedings, affidavits in support of such applications are to be construed most strongly against the party making the application.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b260-5\" pgmap=\"260\">4. Judgment, \u00a7 132*\u2014when by default should be set aside. When a judgment which is plainly unjust has been rendered against a party by default, if a reasonable excuse is shown, for not having made a defense, and the party against whom the judgment is rendered exercises reasonable and ordinary diligence in moving to set it aside, it is the duty of the court to exercise its discretion by granting the motion, especially if- it be made at the same term at which the judgment is rendered.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b260-6\" pgmap=\"260\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1380*\u2014when discretion in setting aside judgment by default not disturbed. A motion to set aside a judgment rendered by default is always addressed to the discretion of the trial judge, with which an Appellate Court will not interfere unless it has been abused.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b260-7\" pgmap=\"260\">6. Judgment, \u00a7 146*\u2014when affidavits in support of motion to set aside by default do not show due and proper diligence. Affidavits filed in support of defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the judgment rendered against him by default, held not to show due and proper diligence on behalf of their solicitor, where it appeared that he had been severely injured while absent from the place of trial but had returned 10 days before, and did not show he was unable to inquire in regard to the case or to secure some one to present to the court a motion to postpone it, and no affiant stated he was unaware of the case being on trial, and the solicitor\u2019s affidavit showed he had an office associate on whom he depended to try the case in his own absence whose affidavit was not procured, and who was not stated to have been uninformed of the trial, and motion was not filed until 9 days after the judgment.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
