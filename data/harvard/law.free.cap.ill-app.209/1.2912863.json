B. Fuller and Carl H. Yoder, defendants, to recover a balance due on certain promissory notes executed by the defendant Fuller as maker and the defendant Yoder as surety. From a judgment for plaintiff for $200.87, defendants appeal.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-13\" pgmap=\"29(65) 30(67)\">The defendant Fuller, being heavily in debt, made a composition agreement with his creditors, at which time the plaintiff held an unsatisfied judgment against him and his wife and refused to join in the agreement unless Fuller would secure the part of the judgment debt that would not in that way be paid. Accordingly at the same time and practically as part of the same transaction, Fuller procured defendant Yoder to sign as surety the notes in question for the estimated amount of the part not in that way to be paid. The notes were delivered, the agreement was signed, and satisfaction in full of the judgment entered. Plaintiff received his percentage under the agreement and also payments from time to time on the notes and renewal signed by both defendants.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b30-8\" pgmap=\"30\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b30-9\" pgmap=\"30\">1.
