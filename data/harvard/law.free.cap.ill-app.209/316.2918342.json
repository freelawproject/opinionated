Myers, plaintiff, against Katherene M!ay Andrews, defendant, to recover under a certain contract, whereby plaintiff was to render certain services, for his expenses incurred in rendering such services. From a judgment for plaintiff for $4,502.45, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-9\" pgmap=\"344(189) 345(185)\">The services to be rendered by plaintiff were in assisting defendant to recover on a certain claim under a so-called grubstake agreement made January 31, 1898, by defendant with her then husband, who died December 30, 1909, whereby in consideration of $400 paid him by her to make a trip to Alaska he agreed, among other things, that she should have 50 per cent, of whatever riches he should possess on his return. The contract between plaintiff and defendant was evidenced by three agreements, prepared at the instance of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, each reciting the grubstake agreement, and the first reciting an assignment to plaintiff by defendant of a one-half interest in such agreement and \u201cin and to said claim, and in and to all moneys, properties and securities to be recovered,\u201d a consideration of $10 paid by plaintiff to defendant, and further consideration in plaintiff\u2019s agreement to use his best efforts to realize upon the claim of defendant, by litigation or compromise, \u201cbut all the costs and expenses which the said Moses C. Myers shall incur in and about so doing shall be paid by the said Katherene May Elliott. If, However, any sum of money shall be realized as the result of the enforcement of the above-mentioned claim, then one-half of the expenses thereof shall be taken out of the one-half of the proceeds of enforcement coming to said Moses C. Myers, by virtue of his ownership of an undivided one-half interest therein\u201d; also reciting the delivery to plaintiff of a power of attorney from defendant authorizing him to represent her. The second agreement also appointed plaintiff attorney in fact for defendant in usual form. The third also assigned and transferred to plaintiff an undivided one-half of the claim of defendant and of any real or personal property recoverable thereunder, with authority to plaintiff \u201chis executors, administrators and assigns * * *, for his or their own use and benefit, but at his or their own cost, to take all legal measures which may be proper or necessary for the complete recovery of said assigned claim.\u201d These three agreements were dated the same and each recited a consideration of $10, but only one $10 was paid.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b345-8\" pgmap=\"345\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b345-9\" pgmap=\"345\">1.
