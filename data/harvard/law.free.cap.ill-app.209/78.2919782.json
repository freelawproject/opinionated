Municipal corporations, \u00a7 97<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is right of city as to revolting ordinance. A city council has no power to bind the city by an ordinance providing that any street railway franchise thereafter granted should be subject to the grantee paying to the city, for the use of contiguous property owners who had paid a special assessment for the paving of the street occupied by such grantee, a ratable proportion of the cost of the paving for the part of the street so occupied by the grantee, so as to deprive succeeding city councils of the power to repeal such ordinance, either expressly or by implication, or to depart from its terms.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b107-5\" pgmap=\"107\">Taxes for the pavement of the street in question were paid by plaintiff in 1896. At the time the ordinance providing for such paving was passed there was in force the ordinance in question, upon which this action was based, providing further that it should be a part of every franchise right thereafter granted by the city council to any person or corporation. In 1914 the council granted a franchise for the construction of an additional railway line on the street, and did not require a compliance with this ordinance, but permitted the grantee to take a part of the street upon paying into the city treasury a sum computed at 72% cents a square yard for such part, to be distributed to such property owners as were rightful claimants therefor. The declaration also alleged that this sum required to be paid did not represent 25 per cent, of the cost of the improvement.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b107-6\" pgmap=\"107\">I. 0.
