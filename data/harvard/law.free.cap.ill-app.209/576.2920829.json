In an action by a tenant against a landlord to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the giving way of a porch railing, thereby causing plaintiff to fall, evidence examined and held to show that the place at which the accident occurred was part of a common passageway for the use of the tenants, that he retained control over it, that the defect was not latent and that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b605-7\" pgmap=\"605\">2.

A tenant who, after stepping over a porch railing to a bench from an adjoining roof on which she had been standing to wash a window, takes hold of the railing in stepping down from the bench to the porch, was not guilty of making an improper use of the railing so as to prevent a recovery for injuries caused by a fall through the giving way of the railing as she was holding to it.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b605-8\" pgmap=\"605\">3.
