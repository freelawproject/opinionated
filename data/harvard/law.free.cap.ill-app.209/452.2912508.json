In an action against certain defendants, doing business as a society, to recover for breach of contract, the fact that the names of the defendants do not appear on the contract, and it is necessary to introduce evidence to identify them as the copartners who did business under the name of the society, does not constitute the contract an oral one.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\" pgmap=\"480\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

Limitation of actions, \u00a7 11<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is test in determining whether ten or five-year statute applies as to contract. In ascertaining whether the ten or five-year Statute of Limitations is applicable in an action on a contract, the test is whether the contract sued on was in writing or oral, and if the promise is in fact, oral, it is immaterial that it arose in the first instance out of a written contract.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b481-5\" pgmap=\"481\">3. Limitation of actions, \u00a7 12*\u2014when contract oral and governed by five-year statute. An action to recover purchase money paid under a contract which contains no specific promise to return the purchase money, rests upon an implied promise which, being oral, is governed by the five-year limitation.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b481-6\" pgmap=\"481\">4.

Where the statement of claim does not clearly state the breach of contract relied on, but does not purport to be for the return of purchase money paid thereunder, and defendant does not seek a better statement and no propositions of law are submitted, and the damages assessed, though equivalent to the amount paid in by plaintiff, are also the amount which, prima facie, he was entitled to recover as damages for the breach, it will not be held on appeal that the damages were assessed on the theory that the action was for the return of the purchase money.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
