Carriers, \u00a7 564*-\u2014what are questions for jury in action for damages for loss of ibaggage. In an action against a carrier to recover for the loss of baggage, where, on a motion to direct a verdict, the evidence did not disclose that plaintiff knew or assented to the limitation of liability contained in the receipt, but admitted that she had heard there was such a limitation, and defendant introduced evidence tending to support the inference that baggage containing articles which plaintiff claimed to have a value of $1,782 would not have been received for delivery at defendant\u2019s risk for the disproportionate fee of 50 cents paid therefor, and that plaintiff stated that the baggage contained glassware and did not mention that it contained valuable jewelry, and was informed that it would be taken at her risk, it is for the jury to determine whether there was fraud in concealing the real character and value of the contents, whether the baggage contained the articles claimed by plaintiff to have been in it and whether there was an express understanding or agreement that it was to be carried at her risk, and in such a case it was error to direct a verdict for plaintiff.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b456-7\" pgmap=\"456\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
