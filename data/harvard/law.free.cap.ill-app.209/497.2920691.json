Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 13b*\u2014when discretion in denying second continuance fairly exercised. The discretion of the trial court in denying a motion for a second continuance in the Municipal Court of Chicago is fairly exercised, where the amount involved was small, the case was twice on the trial call and continued once at the instance of defendant\u2019s counsel, and at the time the case was continued on the first motion the court admonished counsel to be ready to proceed with the trial at the time set for hearing and, if he could not be present himself, to have some other member of his firm look after the case, and the only ground for the second continuance was the absence of one of the counsel in the trial of another case.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b525-5\" pgmap=\"525\">Appeal from the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
