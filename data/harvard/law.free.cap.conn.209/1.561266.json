App. 540, 528 A.2d 846 (1987), is: \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in concluding from the transcript that the defendant\u2019s wife had consented to the officers\u2019 entry into his bedroom when the trial court had found that she had attempted to block their entry into that room?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress, as the fruit of an illegal arrest and an unlawful search, \u201cany and all tangible and intangible evidence . . . which may have been obtained either during or as a result of any such search and seizure. . . .\u201d The trial court, <em>Kline, J., </em>denied the motion to suppress and ruled that \u201c[bjased on the totality of the circumstances, I think there is probable cause for the police to make that very determination that there are exigent circumstances, that they were to go on the man\u2019s premises to make a warrantless arrest.\u201d On appeal, the Appellate Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ant\u2019s motion to suppress not on exigent circumstance grounds but because it found that the defendant\u2019s wife had consented to the entry of the police into the defendant\u2019 s house and bedroom. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>supra, 546-47. The Appellate Court also found that the plain view observations made by the police subsequent to their consensual entry were \u201cjustified.\u201d Id., 547. In light of these findings, the Appellate Court concluded that there was a valid consensual entry and refused to address the issues of whether the warrantless seizure of evidence was justified by either exigent circumstances or the inevitable discovery doctrine, calling them merely \u201calternate grounds presented.\u201d Id., 548. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We need not repeat the entire factual scenario set forth at length in the Appellate Court opinion. Id., 541-43. Briefly, the undisputed facts relevant to the issue certified for review are as follows: On May 24, 1985, based on information provided by a neighbor of the defendant, the Connecticut state police began a surveillance operation of the defendant\u2019s home located onPettee Street in Lakeville. The same day, two of the surveilling officers observed what they believed to be a drug deal occurring between the defendant and David Earl Jones.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As Jones departed the defendant\u2019s home, the officers radioed their superior, Sergeant Brian Acker, who was in an unmarked car at the corner of Pettee Street and Route 44,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and informed him of what they had just observed. Subsequently, Jones drove past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Acker and pulled into a gas station on Route 44 just opposite Pettee Street. Apprehensive that Jones would transfer what they then suspected to be narcotics to a person at the gas station or destroy them, Acker and Detective James Caputo arrested Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">On the basis of the items recovered and information received from Jones, and concerned that people who had observed Jones\u2019 arrest would tip off the defendant, Acker decided to return to the defendant\u2019s home and attempt to gain access.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In pursuit of this goal, Acker, accompanied by Detective John Merullo, knocked on the back door of the defendant\u2019s house. The defendant\u2019s wife answered the door and, without identifying themselves, the officers, who were in plainclothes, asked if \u201cEd\u201d was there. The defendant\u2019s wife \u201cresponded\u201d and Acker entered the house, went through four rooms and followed her up a stairway to a \u201cfoyer\u201d on the second floor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There the defendant\u2019s wife positioned herself in front of Acker, making it difficult for him to pass. At that point, Acker \u201ckind of pushed [his] way by gently and went into [the defendant\u2019s] bedroom.\u201d Upon entering, he found the defendant in the room and observed a white powdery substance in a bowl on a small table near the defendant. He then placed the defendant under arrest, seized a check drawn on the Jones Automotive account for $120 that was made payable to cash and transported the defendant to the state police barracks. Thereafter, the remaining occupants of the house were assembled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>in a room on the first floor and detained until the arrival of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized when he was arrested as the fruit of an illegal arrest and an unlawful search and seizure of his person, home and curtilage. During the suppression hearing, the state, as well as the defendant, focused their attention on \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d as the sole justification for the warrantless entry of the defendant\u2019s house, the arrest of the defendant, and the subsequent seizure of evidence. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court specifically found that \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d justified the warrantless entry. The trial court did not mention \u201cconsent\u201d in any context in summarizing the evidence or in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">After the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied, he entered conditional pleas of nolo contendere pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to violations of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-279 (a) and 21a-277 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>court accepted the defendant\u2019s pleas and subsequently-sentenced him to a five year term of imprisonment suspended after three years. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that appeal the defendant addressed the litigated issue of whether exigent circumstances justified his warrantless arrest in his home. Apparently anticipating claims by the state that consent and inevitable discovery were alternative grounds on which the decision of the trial court denying the suppression of the seized evidence could be upheld, he also briefed those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">In its opinion the Appellate Court found that the police had obtained a voluntary consent to enter the defendant\u2019s home from the defendant\u2019s wife; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reagan, </em>supra, 546; that the police had not exceeded the scope of the consent; id., 547; and there had not been a clear withdrawal of the consent. Id. In light of these findings, the Appellate Court refused to reach the issues of exigent circumstances and inevitable discovery. Id., 548. Thereupon, based not on exigent cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>cumstances but on the consent of the defendant\u2019s wife to the entry of the home and bedroom, the Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The defendant then petitioned this court for certification. As indicated earlier, certification was granted limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court err in concluding from the transcript that the defendant\u2019s wife had consented to the officers' entry into his bedroom when the trial court had found that she had attempted to block their entry into that room?\u201d In this court, the defendant argued that the Appellate Court erred in upholding the decision of the trial court on the basis of a consensual entry because the issue of consent had not been raised at the suppression hearing, the state had not established that consent to enter the home or bedroom had been voluntarily given, and the record was insufficient to support such a factual finding. We agree that the record is insufficient to support an appellate finding of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">It is axiomatic that \u201c[a] warrantless search [or entry into one\u2019s home] is not unreasonable under either the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States or article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut if a person with authority to do so has freely consented .... <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 248, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973); <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>175 Conn. 614, 618, 402 A.2d 790 (1978). The state bears the burden of proving that the consent was free and voluntary and that the person who purported to consent had the authority to do so. <em>Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 548, 88 S. Ct. 1788, 20 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1968) [on appeal after remand, 5 N.C. App. 528, 169 S.E.2d 65, aff'd, 275 N.C. 670, 170 S.E.2d 457 (1969)]; <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 618-19. . . . \u2018The question whether consent to a search has in fact been freely and voluntarily given, or was the product of coercion, express or implied, is \u201ca <em>question of fact </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>to be determined from the totality of all the circumstances.\u201d [Emphasis added.] <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>supra, 227. As a question of fact, it is normally to be decided by the trial court upon the evidence before that court together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence.\u2019 <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 619; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 238, 456 A.2d 288 (1983) [cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>193 Conn. 70, 78-79, 475 A.2d 1087 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>202 Conn. 615, 620-21, 522 A.2d 788 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>189 Conn. 461, 468-69, 456 A.2d 1191 (1983). \u201cAbsent consent or exigent circumstances, a private home may not be entered to conduct a search or effect an arrest without a warrant. <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 204 [101 S. Ct. 1642, 68 L. Ed. 2d 38] (1981); <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573 [100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639] (1980); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 10 [68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436] (1948).\u201d <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>452 U.S. 594, 598 n.6, 101 S. Ct. 2535, 69 L. Ed. 2d 262 (1981). After a careful review of the record before this court, we determine that the Appellate Court erred in coming to its own factual conclusion that the defendant\u2019s wife had consented to the entry by the police into the defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Ordinarily it is not the function of this court or the Appellate Court to make factual findings, but rather to decide whether the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>Leo </em>v. <em>Leo, </em>197 Conn. 1, 4-5, 495 A.2d 704 (1985); <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Gallo, </em>184 Conn. 36, 38, 440 A.2d 782 (1981); <em>Public Works Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Eveready Machinery Co., </em>11 Conn. App. 79, 79-80, 525 A.2d 988 (1987). Conclusions of fact may be drawn on appeal only where \u201cthe subordinate facts found [by the trial court] make such a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>elusion inevitable as a matter of law\u201d; <em>Papcun </em>v. <em>Papcun, </em>181 Conn. 618, 621, 436 A.2d 282 (1980), citing <em>Bozzi </em>v. <em>Bozzi, </em>177 Conn. 232, 240, 413 A.2d 834 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>150 Conn. 457, 471, 191 A.2d 124 (1963); or where the undisputed facts or uncontroverted evidence and testimony in the record make the factual conclusion so obvious as to be inherent in the trial court\u2019s decision. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 208 n.3, 530 A.2d 603 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>supra, 620. The limited record relevant to consent, which was before the Appellate Court and is before this court, is neither uncontroverted nor sufficiently clear to warrant a factual finding by a reviewing court that any consent to the initial entry<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> into the defendant\u2019s home encompassed Acker\u2019s passage through four rooms on the first floor, up a stairway, and his subsequent entry into the defendant\u2019s second floor bedroom, or a finding that actions of the defendant\u2019s wife at the top of the stairs did not constitute a withdrawal of any initial consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We note that the three interrelated issues concerning consent, i.e., the initial entry, the permissible scope thereof and the withdrawal, upon which the Appellate Court ruled were never in contention or argued during the two day suppression hearing, and were never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ruled upon by the trial court. It is clear from the trial court\u2019s ruling that its findings were limited to its ultimate conclusion that \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d justified the warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s home and the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest. In fact, in an articulation filed by the trial court subsequent to the release of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the trial court specifically stated that the conduct of the defendant\u2019s wife in the \u201cfoyer\u201d at the top of the stairs, was addressed only \u201cwith reference to the exigent circumstances as the officers were on their way to make an arrest based upon a speedy information and that there was a danger of the evidence being destroyed.\u201d Further, the state has acknowledged that the focus of the parties\u2019 attention during the suppression hearing was restricted to the issue of exigent circumstances, and that the consent issue was raised for the first time in the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">It is against this backdrop that we turn to a review of the record to determine whether the undisputed subordinate facts in the record made the factual conclusion of consent by the Appellate Court so obvious and inevitable that it may stand. We conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The only testimony potentially relevant to the issue of consent was that of Acker and that encompassed only two pages of the 241 page transcript of the sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>pression hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Acker testified that, when he and Merullo knocked on the back door of the defendant\u2019s home, the defendant\u2019s wife answered and merely \u201cresponded\u201d to his question of whether \u201cEd\u201d was there. He failed to testify as to the manner in which the defendant\u2019s wife responded or the content of her response. Acker then testified that, after the defendant\u2019s wife \u201cresponded,\u201d he entered the residence at her invitation, and proceeded to walk through a remodeled room, the kitchen, a dining room area, the living room, and then followed her up the stairs to a \u201cfoyer\u201d on the second floor. While it appears from Acker\u2019s testimony that the defendant\u2019s wife may have consented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>to Acker\u2019s entry into the residence, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that her invitation extended to the four rooms on the first floor that Acker traversed, let alone the stairway to the second floor and the defendant\u2019s bedroom. In fact, the record of Acker\u2019s testimony is totally silent with regard to the parameters of the initial consent. Further, although Merullo also testified at the suppression hearing, the state did not elicit any testimony from him regarding the circumstances surrounding Acker\u2019s entry into the defendant\u2019s home, thus failing to corroborate the existence or the extent of the alleged invitation to enter by the defendant\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On the present state of the record, we cannot find, nor could the Appellate Court have found, that, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>matter of law, the state affirmatively established that the defendant\u2019s wife consented to Acker\u2019s entry into and through the four first floor rooms, his ascension of the stairway to the second floor and his subsequent entry into the defendant\u2019s bedroom. An invitation to enter one\u2019s home does not necessarily imply an invitation or consent to enter all areas of that home. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>162 Ill. App. 3d 528, 538, 515 N.E.2d 1285, appeal denied, 119 Ill. 2d 561, 522 N.E.2d 1248 (1987); <em>Lance </em>v. <em>State, </em>425 N.E.2d 77, 80 (Ind. 1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Drouhard, </em>31 Or. App. 1083, 1086, 572 P.2d 331 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>76 Wis. 2d 387, 394, 251 N.W.2d 421 (1977). \u201cWhen the police are relying upon consent as the basis for their warrantless search, they have no more authority than they have been given by the consent. It is thus important to take account of any express or implied limitations or qualifications attending that consent which establish the permissible scope of the search in terms of such matters as time, duration, area, or intensity.\u201d 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 8.1 (c), p. 160. The state bears the burden affirmatively to establish that consent was voluntary; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 78; <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 619; and the consent shall not be lightly inferred. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Impink, </em>728 F.2d 1228, 1232 (9th Cir. 1984); 68 Am. Jur. 2d 699, Search and Seizures \u00a7 46. Accordingly, we conclude that the Appellate Court erred in making an affirmative factual finding that Acker did not exceed the scope of any initial consent when he reached and ascended the stairway to the second floor and entered the defendant\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The Appellate Court also found as a fact that the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s positioning herself at the top of the stairs and making it difficult for Acker to pass did not amount to a withdrawal of her consent. In light of Acker\u2019s testimony on this issue, which the state concedes could reasonably be construed in a variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ways, including a withdrawal of consent, we find that the Appellate Court erred in arriving at a factual conclusion that was not, as a matter of law, warranted by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">A consent to enter or to search, once given, can be withdrawn or limited at any time prior to the completion of the search; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>784 F.2d 812, 816 (7th Cir. 1986); <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Pulliam, </em>557 F.2d 426, 428-29 (5th Cir. 1977); 3 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 8.1 (c), pp. 172-73; by some verbal or physical act indicating that the consent has been withdrawn. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargih, </em>418 So. 2d 1261, 1263 (Fla. 1982). Acker testified that, upon reaching the \u201cfoyer\u201d at the top of the stairs, the defendant\u2019s wife \u201cpositioned herself where it would make it difficult for [him] to get by.\u201d He further testified that in order to enter the defendant\u2019s bedroom he had to \u201ckind of [push his] way by [the defendant\u2019s wife] gently . . . .\u201d Such testimony, at the very least, raises a factual issue as to whether the defendant\u2019s wife intentionally positioned herself in order to block<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Acker\u2019s way and thereby withdrew or limited any consent she may previously have given. Without additional evidence or additional findings of subordinate facts by the trial court, we conclude that the Appellate Court erred in arriving at the factual conclusion that the defendant\u2019s wife did not withdraw or limit any consent she may have given to the entry of the Reagan home.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">It is not particularly surprising that the subordinate facts relating to consent were never so definitively established as to allow a factual finding of consent by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the Appellate Court, because consent was never raised by either party at the suppression hearing and the trial court specifically limited its findings to the litigated issue of exigent circumstances. On the record before it, the Appellate Court \u201cshould not simply have made factual findings [concerning consent] on its own.\u201d <em>Icicle Seafoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>475 U.S. 709, 714, 106 S. Ct. 1527, 89 L. Ed. 2d 739 (1986). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and remand the case to that court for a determination of whether the trial court erred in finding the existence of exigent circumstances to justify the warrantless entry into the defendant\u2019s home and his subsequent arrest. In addition, should the Appellate Court find error on that issue on remand, we order that the case be remanded to the trial court with direction to conduct further evidentiary hearings to determine whether the defendant\u2019s wife consented to Acker\u2019s entry into the defendant\u2019s home and second floor bedroom, and if there was consent, whether it was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> Sergeant Benjamin Pagoni and Detective John Merullo observed David Earl Jones drive up to the defendant\u2019s house, get out of his car and enter the house. Approximately five to ten minutes later, the defendant and Jones exited the house. The officers then observed Jones hand the defendant a slip of paper which appeared to be a check and then the defendant handed Jones a small packet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> The only access to Pettee Street was from Route 44 because Pettee Street is a dead-end street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\"> In that interim, Acker sent Pagoni and Caputo to state police barracks B to book Jones and to obtain a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\"> The record is silent with regard to Merullo\u2019s actions after the defendant\u2019s wife answered the door.

Merullo gave no testimony regarding the circumstances surrounding the initial entry into the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides: \u201cconditional nolo contendere PLEA.

Upon the defendant\u2019s having entered nolo contendere pleas to the first two counts, the state nolled the conspiracy charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"> The trial court\u2019s discussion of the initial entry during its ruling on the motion to suppress indicates a degree of skepticism or uncertainty regarding the initial entry and the existence of an invitation. The trial court stated: \u201cMrs. Reagan evidently let them in.\u201d While the trial court goes on to quote the defendant\u2019s wife as saying \u201cCome on in,\u201d this quote is not found anywhere in the record. For the purposes of our discussion of the issue certified for review, we will assume that Acker\u2019s initial entry into the defendant\u2019s home was pursuant to the invitation of the defendant\u2019s wife and, therefore, based on a valid consent. It must be noted that this is not a finding by this court nor an acquiescence in the Appellate Court\u2019s finding on this issue. Should the matter ultimately be remanded to the trial court for further evidentiary hearings regarding the initial consent, our assumption shall not be deemed a finding on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\"> Subsequent to the publishing of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in this matter, the state filed a motion for articulation seeking to have the trial court articulate the following issues: \u201c(1) Was this court\u2019s statement that \u2018it wasn\u2019t until they got to the bedroom that [Mrs. Reagan] tried to block [the officers\u2019] entrance\u2019 a finding of a subordinate fact, a conclusion of fact\u2014 that is, one based on subordinate facts\u2014or a conclusion of law?\u201d; and (2) \u201cWas the statement made with reference to the issue of exigent circumstances or the issue of whether the initial consent to enter was withdrawn?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\"> The relevant portion of Sergeant Brian Acker\u2019s testimony encompassed the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cQ. Now, you said you went to the Reagan residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u201cA. I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u201cQ. And who was with you?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u201cA. Agent Merullo.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\u201cQ. What did you do when you got to the residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">\u201cA. We parked the car in front of the neighbor\u2019s house and we walked to what I would call a back door. I knocked on the back door. A woman inside came part way towards the door. WTien I saw her I asked her if Ed was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">\u201cQ. And did she respond?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-14\">\u201cA. She did.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-15\">\u201cQ. And what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-16\">\u201cA. I entered the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-17\">\u201cQ. Did she at any time ever deny you entrance to the residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-18\">\u201cA. She did not. In fact, she invited me in.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-19\">\u201cQ. Now, at this time when you entered the residence, did you have any weapons displayed?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">\u201cA. No.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-21\">\u201cQ. What did you do when you got inside the residence?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-22\">\u201cA. I walked through a room that appeared to be remodeled, walked through that room, through the kitchen into a dining room area. At this point I took a left through the living room. At a point in the living room I said to an elderly lady, I said, \u2018Hello.\u2019 I followed the woman who had first answered the door up the stairs to the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-23\">\u201cQ. Was she leading you or were you leading her?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-24\">\u201cA. No. She was leading me and we entered the second floor level and go into, I would describe it like a foyer, it was larger than a hallway and it had a number of bookshelves and books in that foyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-25\">\u201cQ. And what did you do at that point?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u201cA. At that particular time the woman who had invited me in initially positioned herself where it would make it difficult for me to get by. I had observed the woman in the bedroom which was at the end of this foyer. At that point I just worked, kind of pushed my way by gently and went into that bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u201cQ. Now, did you ever identify yourself as a police officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u201cA. No, I did not. Not prior to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u201cQ. As you were entering the house, did you ever advise anyone that you were a police officer?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">\u201cQ. Did you ever advise anyone that you were there to arrest the Defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-14\">\u201cQ. And why was that?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-15\">\u201cA. If you enter the door on the first floor and you are to identify yourself as a police officer, if you are there to say you are there to arrest an individual and that individual is on the second floor, all one would have to do is yell upstairs and warn him and evidence would be destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-16\">\u201cQ. Now, you stated that you pushed gently by the woman?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-17\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-18\">\u201cQ. And what did you do at that point?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-19\">\u201cA. Entered the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-20\">\u201cQ. And what did you do when you got in the bedroom?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-21\">\u201cA. When I entered the bedroom, I said, \u2018Mr. Reagan.\u2019 He had his back to me. I identified myself as a police officer, told him not to move and placed him under arrrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-22\">\u201cQ. And do you see that individual here in the Courtroom that you placed under arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b34-23\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> During its oral ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court initially stated that the defendant\u2019s wife \u201cblocked\u201d Acker\u2019s entrance into the defendant\u2019s bedroom upon reaching the top of the stairs. Subsequently, in its articulation dated March 15, 1988, the court indicates that the use of the term \u201cblocked\u201d was a misstatement of the facts and that the transcript indicates that the defendant\u2019s wife \u201cpositioned herself where it would make it difficult for [the officer] to get by.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
