Police responding to a call reporting the incident found a silver-colored aluminum cigarette case and cigarette lighter on the sidewalk near the victim. The victim\u2019s fiance, who later identified his body, testified that she did not recognize the lighter and cigarette case as belonging to the victim and had never seen them in his possession. The police officers at the scene collected the lighter and cigarette case and brought them to police headquarters for forensic examination. Police experts later determined that fingerprints on both of these items were the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The defendant\u2019s former girlfriend, Jeannette Berman, testified that in a conversation with her two days after the stabbing incident, the defendant admitted having stabbed the victim in self-defense in an altercation that, according to the defendant, had been initiated by the victim. She also identified the cigarette case and lighter that police had recovered from the crime scene as belonging to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Berman further testified that, a few days after the murder, she picked up the defendant in her car at a prearranged meeting place pursuant to his instructions. As they drove around Waterbury, the defendant ordered her to pull over to pick up a friend of his whom he saw walking nearby. She identified the passenger as Gregorio Hernandez, and testified that the defendant and Hernandez subsequently carried on a conversation in Spanish in the back seat of her car while she drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Hernandez testified at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing and again at the trial that, during this back seat conversation, the defendant confided in Hernandez that he had killed Chrisman during an attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The defendant first claims that his due process rights were violated by the state\u2019s failure to disclose the existence of criminal charges pending against the witness Hernandez at the time of his trial testimony. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\"><em>\u201cIn Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>[373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963)], the United States Supreme Court stated that \u2018suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 141, 531 A.2d 125 (1987). The state acknowledges that such a request was made, by virtue of the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure on May 7, 1986, requesting \u201call exculpatory information and material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Hernandez testified at the defendant\u2019s probable cause hearing on May 14,1986. At the time of his probable cause testimony, there were no charges pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>against Hernandez. On August 25, 1986, the state responded to the defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure and stated that it \u201cpossessed no obviously exculpatory information or material.\u201d The defendant\u2019s trial for felony murder began on January 28,1987, and Hernandez testified again as a witness for the state, essentially reiterating the testimony he had given at the May 14, 1986 probable cause hearing. Criminal charges against Hernandez had arisen during the interval between the probable cause hearing and the defendant\u2019s criminal trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, at the time of his trial testimony, Hernandez was a witness against whom nondisclosed criminal charges were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The determination of whether the defendant\u2019s due process rights were violated by the states\u2019s nondisclosure of the charges pending against Hernandez at the time of his trial testimony turns on whether that information was material. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985), the United States Supreme Court articulated the standard of materiality for disclosures mandated by <em>Brady: </em>\u201c \u2018The evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>supra, 142-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Applying this standard of materiality to the circumstances of this case, \u201cwe must determine whether there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Monteeth, </em>208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Conn. 202, 214-15, 544 A.2d 1199 (1988). We conclude that the nondisclosure of Hernandez\u2019 pending charges does not raise a reasonable probability that the outcome of the defendant\u2019s criminal trial would have been different. The crucial aspect of Hernandez\u2019 trial testimony, that the defendant had admitted the stabbing and attempted robbery of the victim, was a reiteration of the testimony Hernandez had presented at the probable cause hearing. The impeachment force of the evidence of the pending charges, i.e., that Hernandez might be induced to give testimony that would benefit his own interest in winning favor with the state, was undermined by the fact that he had presented entirely consistent testimony at the probable cause hearing when there were no such pending charges, and thus no potential inducements affecting the credibility of his statements. In our view, the trial testimony served largely to confirm and restate the evidence given at the probable cause hearing. Further, any perceived infirmities in the probative value of Hernandez\u2019 testimony because of the pending charges could easily have been cured by the rehabilitative effect of the introduction of the probable cause testimony as a prior consistent statement. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>178 Conn. 564, 571, 424 A.2d 266 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Had the pending charges against Hernandez been disclosed by the state, and had the defendant made use of the charges to discredit the witness, the jury could still reasonably have chosen to believe Hernandez on the basis of his earlier, consistent testimony given at the probable cause hearing. We deem the nondisclosure insufficient to have undermined confidence in the outcome of the proceedings, and therefore the information withheld was not \u201cmaterial\u201d according to the test articulated in <em>Bagley. </em>We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the nondisclosure of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>charges pending against the witness Hernandez at the time of his trial testimony did not deprive the defendant of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The defendant next claims that the state\u2019s nondisclosure of the charges against Hernandez violated Practice Book \u00a7 744, which provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter a witness called by the state has testified on direct examination, the prosecuting authority shall disclose . . . any record of felony or misdemeanor charges pending against the witness known to the prosecuting authority.\u201d The defendant contends that the state\u2019s violation of \u00a7 744 entitles him to a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">As we have just determined, Hernandez\u2019 pending charges did not constitute \u201cmaterial\u201d information within the meaning of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>supra, and did not, therefore, rise to the level of a constitutional violation. There is no dispute that the required disclosure was not made and that, therefore, a violation of \u00a7 744 did occur. This violation is reviewable as plain error. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. While we hasten to emphasize that we do not condone the withholding of exculpatory information, it was the defendant\u2019s burden in this case to show the harmfulness of this non-constitutional error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>197 Conn. 677, 681, 500 A.2d 1330 (1985). On the present record, we are not persuaded that the defendant has made the requisite showing of the harmfulness of this Practice Book violation. Consequently, he has failed to establish his entitlement to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The defendant next claims that the trial court\u2019s instructions on the charge of criminal attempt were erroneous in that they invited the jury to consider the<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ories of liability unsupported by the evidence. The charge of felony murder was based on a substitute information that claimed that the defendant had caused the death of the victim in the course of and in furtherance of the crime of attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In its instructions to the jury on the crime of attempt, the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> explained the statutory requirement that the defendant\u2019s conduct constitute a \u201csubstantial step\u201d in furtherance of the commission of a crime. The court continued: \u201cTo be a substantial step, the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. Examples are . . . .\u201d The court then read to the jury the seven examples set forth in \u00a7 53a-49 (b) as examples of conduct that may be corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The defendant challenges this instruction, claiming that by reading to the jury all seven examples of corroborative conduct contained in the statute when several of them lacked any basis in the evidence, the trial court impermissibly allowed the jury to consider statutory alternatives that were not supported by the evidence. The defendant also challenges this instruction on the ground that it deprived the jury of its factfinding role. The defendant contends that the statute requires the jury to determine whether, in the first instance, the conduct at issue was corroborative of the defendant\u2019s alleged criminal purpose. In this case, however, the trial court stated: \u201cTo be a substantial step, the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. Examples are . . . .\u201d The defendant claims that, by means of this language, the trial court directly and expressly instructed the jury that the examples that followed <em>were </em>instances of corroborative conduct, thus removing this issue from the jury\u2019s determination as to whether the acts of the defendant did, in fact, constitute corroborative conduct, and thus usurping the jury\u2019s role as factfinder. We disagree with both of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s claim that the reading of all seven examples of corroborative conduct contained in \u00a7 53a-49 permitted the jury to convict the defendant on the basis of statutory alternatives unsupported by the evidence, our review of the trial court\u2019s instructions convinces us that this claim is without merit. Preceding the challenged language, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[y]ou may not go outside the evidence to find the facts. This means that you may not resort to guesswork, conjecture or suspicion . . .\u201d and that \u201c[y]ou are to decide the case solely on the evidence received at trial.\u201d The court then continued its instructions by giving the statutory examples of conduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>may be corroborative of a criminal purpose; and that thereby may constitute the substantial step that is required as an element of the crime of attempt. Immediately following the reading of these examples, the court advised the jury: \u201cIt is for you to determine, <em>on the evidence, </em>whether the defendant intentionally did anything which constituted a substantial step in a course of conduct which he planned to culminate in the commission of robbery . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We agree with the state\u2019s position that the trial court offered these examples simply to illustrate types of conduct that may be legally sufficient to establish the requisite intent for the crime of attempt. The court followed these examples with an immediate reminder that the jury\u2019s determination must be based <em>\u201con the evidence. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) In our view, these instructions could not reasonably have misled the jury into assuming that they might properly convict the defendant on the basis of illustrative examples that were not grounded in the evidence. Reading the jury instructions as a whole; <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>205 Conn. 616, 620, 534 A.2d 1196 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 314-15, 533 A.2d 212 (1987); we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled into convicting the defendant of attempted robbery on the basis of facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The defendant\u2019s second challenge to the jury instructions is that the trial court\u2019s language regarding attempted robbery allowed the jury to dispense with the inquiry whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was corroborative of a criminal purpose under \u00a7 53a-49 (b). The state concedes that this portion of the charge was erroneous, but argues that the error was harmless. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Section 53a-49 sets forth examples of conduct which, <em>\u201cif strongly corroborative,\u201d </em>(emphasis added) may be legally sufficient to constitute the \u201csubstantial step\u201d in furtherance of the commission of a crime required for a conviction for criminal attempt. The statutory scheme contemplates a jury determination as to whether the conduct at issue is indeed corroborative, as a necessary predicate for a finding of a substantial step. The defendant attacks the court\u2019s language, \u201c[t]o be a substantial step, the conduct must be strongly corroborative of the defendant\u2019s criminal purpose. Examples are . . .\u2019\u2019as declaring that the examples that followed are, as a matter of law, strongly corroborative, thereby impermissibly removing this issue from the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In our recent review of similar jury instructions, we stated: \u201cAlthough the use of the questioned language was erroneous, the trial court clearly explained the corroboration principle of attempted robbery both before and after the misstatement.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Price, </em>supra, 621. Reviewing these instructions as a whole and in the context of the overall charge, we conclude that the jury was not reasonably misled. Id., 620-21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>supra, 314-15. The jury could reasonably have believed the testimony at trial that the defendant had himself described the stabbing as having occurred because of the victim\u2019s resistance to the robbery attempt. It is not reasonably possible that the jury would have, instead, speculated as to acts of the defendant never alleged nor proved by the evidence but merely presented as illustrative examples as part of the trial court\u2019s instruction, to find corroborative conduct to constitute the \u201csubstantial step\u201d necessary for a verdict of guilty on the charge of attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim involves a two-pronged challenge to the jury instructions regarding self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>defense. The defendant first points to the trial court\u2019s inaccurate rendition of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, which imposes a duty to retreat. The defendant also asserts that the self-defense instructions deprived him of his constitutional guarantee that the jury be unanimous in its verdict. We find no reversible error regarding the jury instructions on the issue of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 sets out the defense of self-defense and defines the circumstances that justify the use of physical force.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In pertinent part, the statute provides that a person may be justified in using physical force in his own defense if that person reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>believes that physical force is being used or will imminently be used against him. That justification is unavail: ing, however, if the person <em>\u201cknows </em>that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety (1) by retreating . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 (b). The trial court's instruction on this issue incorrectly stated that \u201cin most circumstances, a person must retreat from the perceived harm <em>if he is able to do so </em>with complete safety.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The defendant contends that in this portion of the charge, the trial court impermissibly replaced the subjective-objective standard contemplated by the statute with a simple objective standard. The statute requires <em>both </em>that a retreat in complete safety be available <em>and </em>that the defendant know of it. \u201cThe self-defense statute, i.e., General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19 . . . focuses on the person . . . claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances and presents a question of fact [as to whether a safe retreat was available and whether he knew of it]. . . . This statutory emphasis upon the defendant further demonstrates the function of the jury in their evaluation of the self-defense claim.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982). \u201c[Section] 53a-19 (b) requires recourse to retreat in lieu of the use of physical force only when the actor himself \u2018knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>199 Conn. 383, 387, 507 A.2d 467 (1986). The state concedes that the instruction as given obviated the statutory requirement that the defendant have actual knowledge of his ability to retreat and was therefore erroneous. Nevertheless, we agree with the state that, under the circumstances of this case, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201cIt is well established that individual jury instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 46, 536 A.2d 936 (1988). \u201cThe charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, 661; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 46; <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>205 Conn. 352, 356, 533 A.2d 857 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 906, 108 S. Ct. 1079, 99 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Read as a whole, the trial court\u2019s instruction on self-defense, while not in strict accordance with \u00a7 53a-19 (b), \u201cpresented the case to the jury in a manner so that no injustice . . . resulted].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 391, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The defendant, who did not testify at trial, presented the only evidence on the issue of self-defense through the testimony of Berman. She recited the defendant\u2019s version of the events, in which he had characterized the stabbing as an act of self-defense in response to an unprovoked attack by the victim. Hernandez, another witness, contradicted this evidence with his testimony that the defendant had admitted to him that he had stabbed the victim when he resisted the defendant\u2019s attempt to rob him. In this posture, then, the evidence presented to the jury can fairly be said to center on the credibility of Berman\u2019s self-defense version of the stabbing, measured against the credibility of Hernandez\u2019 testimony that an attempted robbery was the motivating force behind the stabbing. The jury\u2019s verdict can fairly be read to indicate a choice between these two inconsistent versions of the stabbing, a choice that accepted the version presented by Hernandez\u2019 testimony and rejected the self-defense version presented by Berman. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 358-59. \u201cThe principal factual issues, therefore, were not classically dependent upon [the subtleties of the law of self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>defense] for their proof, as is true in cases where the principal factual issue is the . . . [defendant's subjective knowledge of the availability of safe escape].'' (Citations ommitted.) Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, 208 </em>Conn. 52, 73, 544 A.2d 611 (1988). We conclude that the trial court's erroneous instruction on self-defense did not, therefore, constitute reversible error in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The defendant\u2019s final challenge to the jury instructions on self-defense is that the instructions as given violated his state constitutional right to be convicted by the unanimous verdict of the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant points to the self-defense statute, \u00a7 53a-19, and its provisions that specify the circumstances in which the use of physical force is <em>not </em>justified. The court paraphrased the statute and instructed the jury as follows: \u201cYou must find the defendant not guilty on grounds of justification [of self-defense] unless the State has proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the following elements: One, the defendant did not believe that he was in imminent danger of death, and that the use of force was not necessary to protect himself; or two, he did not have reasonable grounds for such belief; or, three, the force used was unreasonable; or, four, he was the initial provocateur or aggressor and did not attempt to withdraw; or, five, he was engaged in mutual combat not specifically authorized by law. That obviously does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cSo, the State must prove one of those four, as I gave them to you. And, if the State has proven <em>any one or more of these elements by evidence beyond a reasonable </em>doubt, <em>then the defendant was not justified. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The defendant contends that by these instructions, the trial court permitted the jury to find that the state had defeated the defense of justification, without imposing on the jury the requirement that they unanimously agree as to which of the four means served to defeat the self-defense claim. The defendant asserts that this instruction violated his right to a unanimous jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Despite the fact that the trial court\u2019s instructions may have been in error, our review of the record convinces us that the focal point of contention in the defendant\u2019s asserted self-defense claim was not the manner in which the defendant\u2019s use of force had been unjustified. Rather, the jury\u2019s determination of this issue involved, again, a question of credibility. The only evidence of self-defense came from Berman\u2019s testimony that the defendant had told her that he had been the target of an unprovoked attack by the victim. The state\u2019s witness, Hernandez, rebutted this position and claimed that the defendant had told him that he had \u201cneeded money to get high\u201d and had stabbed the victim when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>he refused to cooperate with the defendant\u2019s attempt to rob him. On the basis of this conflicting evidence, the jury was faced with the resolution of two inconsistent versions of the stabbing incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The court instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n order for you to find the defendant guilty of felony murder . . . [you must find] that the defendant . . . committed or attempted to commit the crime of robbery.\u201d Viewed in light of this instruction, the verdict can reasonably be interpreted as the result of the jury\u2019s having rejected the self-defense version and having credited the attempted robbery version of the event. As such, the verdict suggests that there <em>was </em>agreement among the jurors concerning the defendant\u2019s conduct, i.e., that the killing occurred in the course of the defendant\u2019s robbery attempt, and that there was also agreement that his self-defense claim was without merit. We consider it highly unlikely, within the context of these evidentiary circumstances, that the jury was engaged in splitting hairs over which precise events had rendered the use of force unjustified. Rather, the jury rejected the self-defense scenario entirely, in favor of a finding that the fatal injuries were inflicted in the course of an attempted robbery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In reviewing an error in jury instructions, our task is to determine whether the asserted error in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury affected the outcome of the trial and, consequently, deprived the defendant of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 212, 438 A.2d 418 (1980). Where the error is of constitutional dimension, the test is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torrence, </em>196 Conn. 430, 436, 493 A.2d 865 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u201cWe have often said that the charge should be read as a whole in determining whether it is reasonably possible that an erroneous instruction could have misled a jury .... \u2018It is well established . . . that individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The whole charge must be considered from the standpoint of its effect on the jury in guiding them to a proper verdict . . . and not critically dissected in a microscopic search for possible error. . . \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>supra, 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u201cHere, there is no reasonable possibility that the defendant\u2019s jurors were incorrectly led to believe that they could return a guilty verdict without all reaching unanimous agreement on the conduct the defendant had committed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>6 Conn. App. 667, 676-77, 507 A.2d 478 (1986). In the context of a charge of felony murder premised on the underlying crime of attempted robbery, the jury was free to reject the testimony regarding self-defense and to accept the testimony that related the defendant\u2019s admission that the stabbing had occurred during the commission of a robbery attempt. Further, the trial court expressly instructed the jury that its verdict must be unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Finally, \u201cthe defendant never asked that the jury be polled, when it returned its verdict, to clarify the basis on which the defendant was convicted .... See <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 611, 629, 458 A.2d 369 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Duhan, </em>194 Conn. 347, 354, 481 A.2d 48 (1984). The defendant cannot now be heard to complain about a claimed ambiguity in the verdict when he took no steps at trial to resolve that perceived ambiguity.
