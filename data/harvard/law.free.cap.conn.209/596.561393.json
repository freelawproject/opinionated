Her skeleton was later discovered in the Mill River in New Haven on April 5,1986. The defendant pled not guilty to the charge and was tried and convicted by a jury. The trial court subsequently sentenced the defendant to a term of imprisonment of sixty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The defendant, on appeal, has raised three claims of error. He claims that the trial court erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress tangible evidence; (2) limiting his cross-examination of two of the state\u2019s witnesses; and (3) permitting the state to elicit testimony of his postarrest silence. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress certain tangible evidence that was seized from the victim\u2019s 1979 Chrysler LeBaron automobile. The facts relative to the defendant\u2019s claim have their genesis on the morning of October 15,1985, two days after the victim\u2019s disappearance. At that time, the defendant was confronted at his residence at 240 Martin Street, Hartford, by two of his wife\u2019s sisters and her brother and questioned concerning the victim\u2019s whereabouts. The victim\u2019s siblings were unable to obtain either information or an expression of concern from the defendant. As a result, the victim\u2019s sister, Stella, called the Hartford police and reported Gloria missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Officer Elwood Horsey was dispatched to the defendant\u2019s residence to investigate. When he arrived, he found a hostile situation involving the defendant and his in-laws. The hostility was apparently generated because the members of the victim\u2019s family felt something was sinister about their sister\u2019s disappearance. Horsey also thought something was wrong because the defendant seemed unconcerned about his missing wife. After an initial discussion in the defendant\u2019s kitchen, the officer and the parties went outside to look at the victim\u2019s car. During the inspection of the car, the defendant was cooperative and opened the doors and the trunk to facilitate the policemen\u2019s check of the vehicle. During the course of his examination, Horsey did not observe anything out of the ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Thereafter, apparently intending to take the car to her home, the victim\u2019s sister Louise demanded the keys to the vehicle from the defendant. In response the defendant turned the keys over to Horsey. When he did so, he informed the officer that they were the only set he had in his possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Horsey, in turn, handed the keys over to Louise, who kept them until the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On the evening of October 15, the police were again called to the defendant\u2019s residence. This time the call emanated from the defendant with a complaint that his in-laws were trespassing. Upon their arrival, the patrol officers, who were dispatched to handle the defendant\u2019s complaint, found the defendant and members of his wife\u2019s family engaged in an altercation and called Sergeant Frank Campbell for assistance. When Campbell arrived, he spoke to the patrol officers, the defendant and the victim\u2019s relatives. As a result of those conver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>sations, Campbell thought further investigation was necessary and summoned Detectives Stephen Kumnick and Luis Vera. When the detectives responded, they learned that the victim was last seen in the Chrysler LeBaron with the defendant and that the victim was the owner of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">After obtaining that information, Kumnick, Vera and Campbell went to look at the victim\u2019s car. The vehicle at the time was locked and parked on neighboring property at 234 Martin Street, where it was clearly visible from the road. While viewing the car, the police observed a substance on the windshield that Kumnick and Campbell thought was a piece of flesh. The officers then secured the car and requested that a tow truck be called. The car was later removed to a local garage. On October 17, 1985, a search warrant was issued for the victim\u2019s car and on October 18,1985, that warrant was executed and the vehicle searched. During the course of the search, samples of the upholstery and other items were taken. The items taken yielded evidence damaging to the defendant that was later admitted at his trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The state claimed that the defendant did not have an expectation of privacy in the victim\u2019s car that would support a challenge to its seizure and subsequent search. The defendant claimed an expectation of privacy in the vehicle but admitted that it was registered in his wife\u2019s name and that he had not provided any of the funds for its purchase. He maintained, however, that he had operated the car frequently, going back and forth to work, and for shopping. The defendant did not possess a valid motor vehicle operator\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The trial court found that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the victim\u2019s automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>bile and therefore that he had no \u201cstanding\u201d to object to its seizure or to the admission of the evidence obtained when it was searched. See <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 104-105, 100 S. Ct. 2556, 65 L. Ed. 2d 633 (1980); <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 134, 99 S. Ct. 421, 58 L. Ed. 2d 387 (1978), reh. denied, 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S. Ct. 1035, 59 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>8 Conn. App. 290, 296, 513 A.2d 710 (1986). That finding will not be overturned unless it is legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or involves an erroneous rule of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>198 Conn. 348, 354-55, 503 A.2d 566 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 242, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984). Further, the burden is on the defendant to prove that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the victim\u2019s automobile. <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra; <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illnois, </em>supra, 130 n.1; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 356; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>10 Conn. App. 217, 223, 522 A.2d 323 (1987). In order to sustain that burden, the defendant must prove, first, that he had an actual subjective expectation of privacy in his wife\u2019s car and, second, that his expectation was one that society would recognize as reasonable. <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>T.L.O., </em>469 U.S. 325, 338, 105 S. Ct. 733, 83 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1985); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>207 Conn. 323, 331, 541 A.2d 1209 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>supra, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Whether the defendant has established that he possessed a reasonable expectation of privacy in the automobile requires a factual inquiry into all the relevant circumstances surrounding its seizure. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 177-78, 104 S. Ct. 1735, 80 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>635 F.2d 1207, 1211 (6th Cir. 1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>supra, 331; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra. Such an inquiry reveals that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>when the victim\u2019s automobile was seized, it was parked in plain view from the street on premises other than the defendant\u2019s, that it was not registered in the defendant\u2019s name, nor did he purchase it, that he had no operator\u2019s license, and that he had earlier assisted Officer Horsey in his examination of the vehicle without asserting a privacy right. More important, however, is the evidence that the defendant, in response to his sister-in-law\u2019s demand, surrendered what he professed to be the only set of keys to the automobile to Horsey to give to the victim\u2019s sister. Given the fact that there is a diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile to begin with; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 12, 97 S. Ct. 2476, 53 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1977); <em>Cardwell </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>417 U.S. 583, 590, 94 S. Ct. 2464, 41 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1974); <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 541-42, 498 A.2d 76 (1985); it is difficult to fathom how the defendant can claim any reasonable expectation of privacy in the victim\u2019s car after having given, without any apparent limitation, the means of assuming possession and control of it to his hostile sister-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Under all of the circumstances, we think that the trial court properly concluded that the defendant failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating a reasonable expectation of privacy, the necessary predicate to his claim of a violation of his fourth amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred when it limited his cross-examination of two of the state\u2019s witnesses. He argues that because of the limitation imposed on his cross-examination, he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">During the course of the trial the state announced its intention to call as witnesses Gregory Blue and Mitchell Henderson. Both Blue and Henderson had criminal records and both had cases pending against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>them at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. Before either witness testified, the trial court ruled that the defendant could cross-examine them concerning only prior felony convictions and pending felony cases because, in the court\u2019s view, the law did not permit cross-examination concerning pending misdemeanor charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Subsequently, Blue gave damaging testimony against the defendant. On direct examination, the state elicited from Blue that he previously had been convicted of forgery, escape and larceny in the second degree. Blue also testified on direct examination that he had felony charges of risk of injury to a child and of being a persistent larceny offender pending against him. Further, he admitted that he had talked to the authorities and come forward and testified against the defendant only because he was on trial in Manchester and he was looking for some help in his own case. The defendant cross-examined Blue concerning his felony convictions, his pending felony charges and his motivation for testifying. Because of the trial court\u2019s ruling, however, the defendant was prevented from questioning Blue about a pending misdemeanor larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The trial court erred in limiting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Blue concerning pending charges to pending felony charges. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vasilios, </em>598 F.2d 387, 389-90 (5th Cir. 1979), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 932, 100 S. Ct. 277, 62 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>198 Conn. 220, 223-24, 502 A.2d 400 (1985). The defendant on cross-examination, however, took full advantage of the opportunity afforded him \u201cto expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 39 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1974); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vasilios, </em>supra, 389; <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 525, 539 A.2d 80 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>195 Conn. 475, 483, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). The constitutional standard was, therefore, met. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 638, 669-72, 534 A.2d 1199 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 402, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 425, 493 A.2d 223 (1985). Because the trial court\u2019s error was not of constitutional dimension, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it was probably harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 403; <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 Conn. 328, 333, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>167 Conn. 228, 233, 355 A.2d 95 (1974). Given the latitude that the defendant was granted on cross-examination and in final argument to emphasize Blue\u2019s prior record, his pending felony charges, and his motivation for testifying, it is manifest that the defendant\u2019s inability to inquire about a single misdemeanor charge was harmless. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 404; <em>State </em>v. <em>George, </em>194 Conn. 361, 365-66, 481 A.2d 1068 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 963, 83 L. Ed. 2d 968 (1985). The defendant, therefore, did not sustain his burden of demonstrating that the ruling was probably harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Henderson also provided damaging testimony against the defendant. As to Henderson, however, the record is devoid of any evidence that there were misdemeanor charges pending against him at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. We are, therefore, unable to determine whether the trial court committed any error at all, let alone constitutional error, in restricting the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Henderson to an inquiry concerning pending felony charges. Because the defendant has failed to provide an adequate record for review, we are unable to consider his claim of error as it applies to Henderson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Barcomb, </em>197 Conn. 666, 676, 500 A.2d 1324 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1109, 106 S. Ct. 1518, 89 L. Ed. 2d 916 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>197 Conn. 67, 81, 495 A.2d 1054 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court erred by permitting the state to elicit testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s silence and \u201cno comment\u201d response when faced with custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">During the defendant\u2019s trial, over his objection, the trial court admitted the testimony of Kumnick concerning the defendant\u2019s lack of responsiveness to police questioning. The state at trial claimed that the evidence was an admission relevant to consciousness of guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 522, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). The defendant claimed that the evidence was inadmissible because it was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The defendant\u2019s constitutional argument is based on his contention that his silence or \u201cno comment\u201d response to police questioning was the result of police interrogation while he was in custody prior to receipt <em>o\u00ed Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). Any evidence obtained as a result of interrogation from a person in custody who has not been provided <em>Miranda </em>warnings is inadmissible in the state\u2019s case-in-chief. Id., 479; see also <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 429, 104 S. Ct. 3138, 82 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1984); <em>Harryman </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>616 F.2d 870, 874 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 860, 101 S. Ct. 161, 66 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>97 Conn. 258, 266, 116 A. 336 (1922). The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>has validity if he was, in fact, subjected to custodial interrogation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 136-38, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981). The trial court found that, although the police interrogated the defendant prior to the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the defendant was not in custody. It ruled consequently that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not mandated and that the defendant\u2019s response to police questions was admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 306, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra, 521-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The defendant had the initial burden of proving custodial interrogation. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>738 F.2d 686, 692 (5th Cir. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 647, 513 A.2d 58 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 409. The trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in custody is a finding of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>186 Conn. 287, 292, 440 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 459 U.S. 878, 103 S. Ct. 173, 74 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1982). That finding of fact by the trial court will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. Id.; see Practice Book \u00a7 4061; <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>191 Conn. 636, 652, 469 A.2d 1189 (1983). We will, however, carefully review the record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 580, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>197 Conn. 180, 185, 496 A.2d 486 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The record reveals that the following facts were before the trial court. On the evening of October 15, 1985, the defendant was transported to Hartford police headquarters in a police vehicle. This occurred after the police had responded to the defendant\u2019s complaint and had found the defendant and his in-laws engaged in an altercation in the defendant\u2019s driveway. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the defendant was a suspect in his wife\u2019s disappearance, the ostensible reason for the trip to police headquarters was to discuss the dispute at his home. When he arrived at police headquarters at approximately 9:30 p.m., the defendant was placed in an unlocked interview room. He was left alone and apparently unguarded in the interview room until approximately 11 p.m. During that time the defendant was not arrested or handcuffed nor has he claimed that he was booked, fingerprinted or photographed. Sometime around 11 p.m. Kumnick, having just returned from the defendant\u2019s premises at 240 Martin Street, entered the interview room and asked the defendant questions relating to his wife\u2019s possible whereabouts and what he thought may have happened to her. The defendant either made no response to Kumnick\u2019s questions or answered \u201cno comment.\u201d After approximately five minutes, the defendant asked for a lawyer, Kumnick read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, all questioning ceased, and the defendant called an attorney. Later, around midnight, the defendant left police headquarters with his attorney and was not arrested until March, 1986, some five months later. The record also indicates that the defendant had had previous experience with the criminal justice system; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>207 Conn. 1, 7, 540 A.2d 659 (1988); and that Kumnick testified that the defendant was free to leave police headquarters at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">There is no doubt that Kumnick asked questions of the defendant prior to advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Police officers, however, are not required to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings every time they ask questions at police headquarters even if the person interrogated is a suspect in a crime. <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S. Ct. 3517, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1275 (1983); <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S. Ct. 711, 50 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 159, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981). <em>Miranda </em>warnings are mandated only if the person interrogated is in custody. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 206, 530 A.2d 603 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>199 Conn. 417, 444, 513 A.2d 620 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra. A person is in custody only if, in view of all the surrounding circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 553-54, 100 S.

As stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>California </em>v. <em>Beheler, </em>supra, 1125, \u201c[although the circumstances of each case must certainly influence a determination of whether a suspect is \u2018in custody\u2019 for purposes of receiving Miranda protection, the ultimate inquiry is simply whether there is a \u2018formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\u2019 of the degree associated with a formal arrest. <em>Mathiason, </em>supra, at 495.\u201d See also <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 655, 104 S. Ct. 2626, 81 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1984); <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 430-31, 104 S. Ct. 1136, 79 L. Ed. 2d 409 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cadmus, </em>614 F. Sup. 367, 370 (S.D.N.Y. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The only testimony concerning indicia of custody apparently credited by the trial court was that the defendant was transported to headquarters in a police vehicle and that the questioning took place in an interview room after the defendant had been at headquarters for a substantial period of time. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 258, 496 A.2d 513 (1985). The trial court found that these circumstances did not add up to custody. We cannot say from our review of the record that the trial court\u2019s determination was clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Young, </em>supra, 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Moreover, after reading the transcript we are constrained to observe that even if the trial court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>in regard to custody, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22-24, 87 S.

Ed. 2d 459 (1975). The evidence against the defendant, including other displays of consciousness of guilt, was so overwhelming that the admission of his reaction to Kumnick\u2019s few questions pales by comparison.
