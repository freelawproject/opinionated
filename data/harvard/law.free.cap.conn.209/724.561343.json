Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjO\">In this case, the plaintiff appeals the dismissal of her case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction after it had been remanded by the Appellate Court for further proceedings in the trial court. The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in dismissing the case because it looked beyond the question of subject matter jurisdiction and decided the motion to dismiss on the merits of the case. The plaintiff claims further that the court\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cresident,\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 21-64, in its determination on the motion, violated her constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">On April 26,1984, the plaintiff initiated this action, seeking to gain possession of lot No. 10 in the Briar-wood Park mobile home facility in Montville. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was occupying lot No. 10 without \u201cright or privilege\u201d and that the plaintiff had served a notice to quit possession upon the defendant on April 12, 1984. The plaintiff sought possession of the property because the eight day time limit for the defendant to quit possession under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had expired and the defendant remained on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>On May 7, 1984, the defendant entered an appearance pro se and answered the complaint. The defendant claimed that he was a lawful resident of Briarwood Park and, therefore, could not be evicted. On June 26, 1984, present defense counsel filed an appearance on behalf of the defendant, and on July 11,1984, defense counsel filed a motion to dismiss alleging that the court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff\u2019s action because the notice to quit was defective. The defendant claimed that the eight day notice to quit was insufficient under the dictates of General Statutes \u00a7 21-80, which requires notice of sixty days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argued that \u00a7 21-80, rather than \u00a7 47a-23, applied because the defendant was a mobile home park resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In a memorandum of decision dated July 26, 1984, the trial court, <em>Walsh, J., </em>granted the motion to dismiss that was filed on July 11. From this dismissal for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, raising the same issues that are presented in this appeal. The Appellate Court, however, did not reach the substantive issues raised, but set aside the judgment and instructed the lower court to hear testimony and take evidence before making a finding on the court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Lampasona </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>7 Conn. App. 639, 642-43, 509 A.2d 1089 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">On remand, the defendant again raised his motion to dismiss. The court, <em>O\u2019Connell, J., </em>heard testimony and admitted exhibits of the parties and, on August 13, 1987, again granted the motion to dismiss. In response to a motion to articulate, the court made clear that it dismissed the case because the defendant was a resident of the mobile home park and thus the plaintiff\u2019s notice to quit was insufficient under \u00a7 21-80. The court ruled that the defective notice to quit deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over the claim. The plaintiff then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">At the center of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court is his attack on the Superior Court\u2019s finding that the defendant was a resident of the plaintiff\u2019s mobile home park. Because of this finding, the trial court concluded that the mobile home statute was applicable and summary process against the defendant was controlled by \u00a7 21-80 as opposed to the general summary process statute, \u00a7 47a-23. The plaintiff claims that in making its finding the trial court improperly examined the merits of the action and also that its ruling violated the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim is that the court erred by examining the merits of the case to determine whether the defendant was a resident of the mobile home park and thus whether he was protected by \u00a7 21-80. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>plaintiff suggests that this analysis by the court exceeded the usual scope of a determination of the court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In determining whether a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the inquiry usually does not extend to the merits of the case. <em>GHK Exploration Co. </em>v. <em>Tenneco Oil Co., </em>857 F.2d 1388, 1392 (10th Cir. 1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 301, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 92, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>3 Conn. App. 317, 320, 487 A.2d 1114 (1985). In order to establish subject matter jurisdiction, the court must determine that it has the power to hear the \u201cgeneral class [of cases] to which the proceedings in question belong.\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of New Haven, </em>184 Conn. 285, 288, 439 A.2d 997 (1981); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. In some cases, however, it is necessary to examine the facts of the case to determine whether it is within a general class that the court has power to hear. See <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>207 Conn. 420, 433-35, 541 A.2d 1216 (1988) (discussing subject matter jurisdiction of an agency). Such an examination was necessary in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">There is no doubt that the Superior Court is authorized to hear summary process cases; the Superior Court is authorized to hear all cases except those over which the probate courts have original jurisdiction. General Statutes \u00a7 51-164s. The jurisdiction of the Superior Court in summary process actions, however, is subject to a condition precedent. Before the court can entertain a summary process action and evict a tenant, the owner of the land must previously have served the tenant with notice to quit. <em>Sandrew </em>v. <em>Pequot Drug, Inc., </em>4 Conn. App. 627, 631, 495 A.2d 1127 (1985), citing <em>O\u2019Keefe </em>v. <em>Atlantic Refining Co., </em>132 Conn. 613, 622, 46 A.2d 343 (1946); <em>Abbenante </em>v. <em>Giampietro, </em>75 R.I. 349, 353, 66 A.2d 501 (1949); 50 Am. Jur. 2d, Land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>lord and Tenant \u00a7 1205. This is true under both the general summary process statute, General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a), and under the mobile home summary process provision, General Statutes \u00a7 21-80. As a condition precedent to a summary process action, proper notice to quit is a jurisdictional necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Although this court has not previously addressed the jurisdictional nature of the notice to quit provision in the mobile home statute, we have held other statutory time limitations and notice requirements to be conditions precedent to court actions and thus to be jurisdictional. See, e.g., <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>192 Conn. 460, 469, 472 A.2d 1261 (1984) (notice to all who could be affected by declaratory judgment is jurisdictional necessity); see <em>Connecticut Steel Co. </em>v. <em>National Amusements, Inc., </em>166 Conn. 255, 262-63, 348 A.2d 658 (1974) (action to foreclose mechanic\u2019s lien must be brought within statutory time limit or court lacks jurisdiction); see also <em>Glenn Chaffer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>37 Conn. Sup. 654, 658, 433 A.2d 1018 (1981) (notice of condominium conversion is jurisdictional necessity for eviction action).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Superior Court has held that the notice requirements of the general summary process statute; General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23; are jurisdictional. <em>Windsor Properties, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., </em>35 Conn. Sup. 297, 301, 408 A.2d 936 (1979). This is in accord with a number of other states. See, e.g., <em>Lichtentag </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>258 So. 2d 211, 212-13 (La. App.), cert. denied, 259 So. 2d 916 (1972); <em>Dickens </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>104 N.M. 173, 175, 718 P.2d 683 (1986); <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>99 Misc. 2d 1114, 1115, 418 N.Y.S.2d 258 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Therefore, because proper notice to quit is a jurisdictional necessity, in order to determine whether there was proper notice, in this case the court had to determine which summary process provision, \u00a7\u00a7 47a-23 or 21-80, controlled. The dispositive question in resolving which summary process scheme applied was whether the defendant was such a resident of the plaintiffs mobile home park. If he was such a resident, \u00a7 21-80 applied and the notice to quit had to be for a duration of sixty days, and if he was not a resident, the general summary process provision, \u00a7 47a-23, applied and an eight day notice to quit would have been sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The court, <em>O\u2019Connell, J., </em>on remand, found that the defendant was the owner of a mobile home in the plaintiff\u2019s park and, thus, under the definition contained in General Statutes \u00a7 21-64 (5), the defendant was a resident of the park. As a resident, the court applied the summary process procedure for mobile home park residents pursuant to \u00a7 21-80 and found that the plaintiff had not given the defendant the required sixty day notice to quit under subsection (b) (3) (B). Upon its finding, the court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and did not rule on the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 21-64 (5) and its finding that the defendant was a resident were correct. In our recent decision in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Merlino Enterprises, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 656, 661, 545 A.2d 1094 (1988), we construed the broad definition of resident in \u00a7 21-64 (5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>and stated that mere ownership of a mobile home in a mobile home park is sufficient to qualify one as a park resident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the plaintiff vigorously contends that such a definition of a resident is inequitable under the circumstances of this case, the language of the statute is clear and we are not inclined to depart from the recent construction of that statute in <em>Thompson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiff argues that the inequity in construing the defendant to be a resident of the plaintiffs park amounts to a violation of the plaintiffs constitutional rights. Specifically, the plaintiff suggests that to deem the defendant a resident of the park amounts to an unconstitutional taking of the plaintiffs land in violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The plaintiff contends that the statute as applied is unconstitutional because the defendant is occupying a mobile home in the park without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. The trial court, however, found that the plaintiff had an affirmative duty, presumably under General Statutes \u00a7 21-79,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to give the defendant an application to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>purchase the home in the plaintiff\u2019s park and, in acting on the application, the plaintiff had a duty to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>her reasons for granting or denying it. The plaintiff did not do this and therefore acquiesced to the defendant\u2019s residency in the park. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s finding. Thus, the plaintiff did not have her property unconstitutionally taken. Furthermore, our very recent holdings make it clear that the requirements of \u00a7 21-79 governing the resale of mobile homes do not violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights as a mobile home park owner. <em>Daddona </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobile Home Sales, Inc., </em>209 Conn. 243, 247, 550 A.2d 1061 (1988); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Merlino Enterprises, Inc., </em>supra, 662; <em>Eamiello </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobile Home Sales, Inc., </em>208 Conn. 620, 650, 546 A.2d 805 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In sum, despite the plaintiff\u2019s disagreement with our precedent, <em>Daddona, Thompson </em>and <em>Eamiello </em>are controlling on the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims in this case. The court did not err in its characterization of the defendant as a resident of the plaintiffs park and its application of the mobile home statute to the case. As stated previously, because we find the notice to quit requirement in General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 to be a jurisdictional necessity to a proper summary process action, the court properly dismissed the case upon finding a defect in the plaintiff\u2019s notice to quit. The court was without subject matter jurisdiction to hear the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a) provides: \u201cnotice to quit possession of premises, form, service, (a) When a rental agreement or lease of any land or building or of any apartment in any building, or of any dwelling unit, or of any trailer, or any land upon which a trailer is used or stands, whether in writing or by parol, terminates by lapse of time, or by reason of any expressed stipulation therein, or under the provisions of section 47a-15a, or as a result of a violation of section 47a-11, or where such premises, or any part thereof, is occupied by one who has no right or privilege to occupy such premises, or where one originally had the right or privilege to occupy such premises but such right or privilege has terminated, and the owner or lessor, or his legal representatives, or his attomey-at-law, or in-fact, desires to obtain possession or occupancy of the same, at the termination of the rental agreement or lease, if any, or at any subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>time, he or they shall give notice to the lessee or occupant to quit possession of such land, building, apartment or dwelling unit, at least eight days before the rental agreement or lease, if any, or before the time specified in the notice for the lessee or occupant to quit possession or occupancy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 (b) (3) (B) reads as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 47a-23, termination of any tenancy in a mobile manufactured home park shall be effective only if made in the following manner . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">\u201cBy the owner giving the resident at least sixty days\u2019 written notice, which shall state the reason or reasons for such termination, except that,, when termination is based upon subparagraph (A) of subdivision (1) of this subsection, the owner need give the resident only thirty days\u2019 written notice, which notice shall state the total arrearage due provided, the owner shall not maintain or proceed with a summary process action against a resident who tenders the total arrearage due to the owner within such thirty days and who has not so tendered an arrearage under this subparagraph during the preceding twelve months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">The motion to dismiss filed on July 11 actually was the defendant\u2019s second motion to dismiss. The first motion was filed on June 26, but only claimed that the plaintiffs notice to quit lacked sufficient notice under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23 (a). The court, <em>Hurley, J., </em>denied that motion on July 10, 1984. The defendant then filed the second motion, which made reference to General Statutes \u00a7 21-80 as well as \u00a7 47a-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-6\"> For administrative appeals, we have held that compliance with statutory requirements is essential to valid administrative jurisdiction. <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 324, 497 A.2d 48 (1985) (failure to include a proper citation and serve a party of record renders administrative appeal jurisdictionally defective); <em>Cavallaro </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>190 Conn. 746, 747, 462 A.2d 1042 (1983) (failure to give notice of zoning commission hearing is jurisdictional defect); <em>Brazo </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>177 Conn. 515, 518, 418 A.2d 883 (1979) (proper notice of administrative hearing is jurisdictional necessity); <em>Vegliante </em>v. <em>New Haven Clock Co., </em>143 Conn. 571, 580, 124 A.2d 526 (1956) (notice of workers\u2019 compensation claim must be served on commissioner within statutory time limit or commissioner lacks jurisdiction); see <em>Home National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Banking Commission, </em>26 Conn.

Failure of the owner to respond within twenty days shall be deemed to be an approval of the home\u2019s condition for resale.
