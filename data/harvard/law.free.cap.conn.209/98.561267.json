This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court violated the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in denying his motion to suppress certain evidence taken from his person and the motor vehicle that he was operating at the time of his arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In doing so, he argues that his Connecticut constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures was violated because the scope of the search that followed his being stopped on Interstate 95 for motor vehicle charges was improper. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The following circumstances serve as the factual backdrop for the search and seizure involved. At approximately 6:20 a.m. on June 17,1986, a Connecticut state police sergeant stopped a Buick automobile bearing New York license plates as it traveled north on the Connecticut Turnpike in Norwalk. He did so because he had clocked the Buick\u2019s speed at eighty-five miles per hour in a fifty-five mile per hour zone. When the officer pulled the Buick over and parked behind it, the defendant, who had been operating the Buick, got out of his car and started walking toward the officer\u2019s cruiser. The defendant was ordered to get back into his car and he complied. The officer exited his cruiser, walked up to the driver\u2019s side of the Buick and asked the defendant for his driver\u2019s license, registration and insurance identification card. He noted the presence of a passenger, later identified as John Antone, seated next to the defendant. From his vantage point, the officer saw two New York license plates on the floor behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>the driver\u2019s seat, which appeared \u201cunusual\u201d to him. He also saw a sticker \u201csimilar to a bumper sticker\u201d affixed to the dashboard in front of the passenger\u2019s seat, which related: \u201cThis car insured by Smith and Wesson.\u201d This indicated to him \u201ca strong possibility of the presence of a handgun\u201d because he knew that Smith and Wesson was a manufacturer of guns, \u201cparticularly handguns.\u201d In addition, he observed that \u201cduring the whole time\u201d the defendant and Antone were \u201cvery nervous, visibly shaking . . . [t]heir hands were shaking and [they] appeared to be in some panic of some sort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The officer, having obtained the documents that he had requested from the driver, went back to his vehicle and, using his radio, requested a wanted person and driver\u2019s license suspension check from the desk officer at the police barracks. Within moments, the desk officer reported that the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license in New York was then under suspension, as was his right to drive in Connecticut. Thereupon, the officer went to the driver\u2019s side of the defendant\u2019s car, opened the door, told the defendant that he was under arrest for driving under suspension and for speeding. He told the defendant to get out of his vehicle and the defendant did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Once the defendant was out of the Buick, the officer immediately conducted a search of his clothing, \u201cstarting with the outer clothing and working [his] way into the pockets,\u201d as he normally did in a custodial arrest. He \u201c[patted] the clothing down for anything that [was] bulky and obvious and [proceeded] further going into pockets and such\u201d; he felt nothing that was \u201cbulky and obvious.\u201d In the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket he found a small plastic vial that contained a form of cocaine called \u201ccrack,\u201d a burnt hand-rolled cigarette butt, a glassine package of white powder, an aluminum foil packet and two small straws with residue inside. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>was thereupon handcuffed, brought back to the officer\u2019s cruiser and secured inside it with the officer\u2019s belt. The officer requested a back-up trooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">When the back-up trooper arrived, the first officer asked the passenger Antone to exit the Buick. A pat-down search of Antone did not disclose any weapons or any of the items eventually seized. The \u201cpat-down\u201d search of Antone was not a \u201cpat-down\u201d search in the sense of the search of the defendant\u2019s person, which was a \u201cfull search of the [defendant\u2019s] pockets and his clothing . . . .\u201d The officer\u2019s distinction was that the defendant was in custody and Antone was not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The officer said that the intensity of his search \u201cdepends [on] whether there\u2019s a back-up there who can keep an eye on the person while [I\u2019m] doing something else. If [I\u2019m] the only one then it\u2019s going to be a very thorough pat-down and if he\u2019s got a lot bulkier clothing on [I\u2019m] going to go a little bit further.\u201d He felt that \u201cit\u2019s necessary to protect [himself] to do a pat-down search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">With Antone standing off to the side of the highway with the back-up officer there, the arresting officer proceeded to search \u201cthe passenger compartment of the [Buick] vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that he had seen the Smith and Wesson sticker on the dashboard, the fact that he had already found suspected narcotics on the defendant and the fact that he had observed a \u201cpocket pager type of instrument commonly used in drug trafficking nowadays\u201d on the console between the two seats on the transmission hump, when combined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the fact that he had found an empty holster under the front passenger seat, caused him to suspect that \u201cthere was a gun somewhere in [the] car.\u201d His \u201cprimary concern was not finding any other evidence, it was locating the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As he proceeded in his search, he also saw two credit cards that did not belong to the defendant or Antone. On the rear seat behind the driver\u2019s seat he located \u201ca plastic, heavy plastic security type box ... a small safe ... [it was] portable ... it had a handle on it and a key type lock.\u201d Having noticed a large ring of keys with \u201cperhaps over a dozen keys . . . on it\u201d on the front seat where the defendant had been sitting, he went back and asked the defendant which key would open the safe. The defendant proved uncooperative and, eventually, after trying some of the keys, the officer found the right key and opened the safe. Inside the safe, the officer discovered a .38 caliber loaded snub-nosed revolver in a leather purse type container, a bag containing ninety-one vials (similar to the red and clear plastic vial found in the defendant\u2019s pocket, that contained the crack) of crack, \u201ca few other containers of white powdered substance\u201d (eventually found to be heroin and some cocaine), a note pad containing various records (\u201ctelephone numbers and such\u201d), a watch and <em>\u201ca </em>few other things.\u201d Antone was then placed under arrest for possession of cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to sell and having weapons in a motor vehicle. A wrecker was called to tow the defendant\u2019s Buick to the Westport police barracks. The wrecker arrived within about fifteen minutes. It would have been normal police procedure to inventory the contents of the vehicle after it had been towed. Both the defendant and Antone were transported to police barracks and were subjected to full searches of their persons. No further evidence \u201cor anything\u201d was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Initially, the defendant recognizes that the United States Supreme Court has held that the fourth amendment to the federal constitution permits police, who have made a custodial arrest of a person apprehended while operating a motor vehicle while his license to do so is suspended, to search his person. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973); see <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>414 U.S. 260, 94 S. Ct. 488, 38 L. Ed. 2d 456 (1973). In like fashion, he acknowledges that the same court has construed the fourth amendment to permit police, after making a lawful arrest, to search the interior of the arrestee\u2019s motor vehicle, including any closed containers, for weapons and contraband. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981). He then concedes that anyone who is lawfully arrested, even for a minor traffic offense, has no complaint under federal law if police search his person and his motor vehicle, including its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Given this posture of the federal law, the defendant has invoked the Connecticut constitution, specifically article first, \u00a7 7, thereof, properly pointing out that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decisions do not limit the authority of state courts to interpret their state constitutions to give greater rights and protections than the federal constitution gives. In that context, that court has specifically recognized that each state has the \u201csovereign right to adopt in its own Constitution individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the Federal Constitution.\u201d <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>447 U.S. 74, 81, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980); see <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Hass, </em>420 U.S. 714, 718, 95 S. Ct. 1215, 43 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1975). Moreover, we note that that court has also stated that its holdings \u201c[do] not affect the State\u2019s power to impose higher standards on searches and seizures than required by the Federal Constitution if it chooses to do so.\u201d <em>Cooper </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 58, 62, 87 S. Ct. 788, 17 L. Ed. 2d 730, reh. and modification denied, 386 U.S. 988, 87 S. Ct. 1283, 18 L. Ed. 2d 243 (1967); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 235, 496 A.2d 498 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The defendant, accordingly, urges that this case is appropriately one to which the rights and protections of the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 7, apply not only because his individual privacy interest in his person was violated, but also because \u201cthe privacy rights of every [Connecticut] citizen will be endangered\u201d if the holding of <em>Robinson </em>is enshrined in article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution. He stresses that the principles that justify searches incident to arrest \u201care not generally present\u201d in the context of arrests for motor vehicle offenses, particularly motor vehicle arrests of the type present in this case. While realizing the need by the officer for a protective search against weapons, he claims that this need was satisfied when no weapons were found and that, therefore, there was no necessity, after feeling nothing \u201cbulky or obvious,\u201d to go into his pockets. The defendant asserts this although state police departmental regulations require a custodial arrest in every instance where a motorist is found driving while his license to do so is under suspension. Arguing that <em>Robinson </em>eliminates the requirement that police act reasonably in carrying out such warrantless searches and mechanistically applies its \u201cbright line\u201d test to cases and thus authorizes searches that derogate individual rights, he advocates rejecting <em>Robinson </em>by expanding the rights and protections of persons under article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution to make such searches \u201cunreasonable.\u201d He also urges that we evaluate \u201creasonableness\u201d on a case-by-case basis as is done in such cases as <em>State </em>v. <em>Kaluna, </em>55 Haw. 361, 366, 520 P.2d 51 (1974). It is clearly implicit throughout the defendant\u2019s Connecticut constitutional claim that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>sought to be suppressed must be suppressed if it was obtained in violation of article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. This claim must assume that <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>101 Conn. 224, 125 A. 636 (1924), is not controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The state, on the other hand, argues that the search of the defendant\u2019s person and his motor vehicle was reasonable and did not violate the search and seizure provision of the Connecticut constitution, article first, \u00a7 7. In doing so, after advancing its views and cautions to be considered in the application of principles of state constitutional interpretation, it posits that \u201cconferring greater rights always carries greater costs,\u201d including the diminution of the powers of the police, which are aimed at promoting the public good by the prevention of crime. Maintaining the \u201cvirtual identity\u201d of language in the United States<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Connecticut constitutional search and seizure provisions, it argues that the defendant\u2019s claim that the state constitutional standard for reasonableness is, or should be, different is without support. In any event, it urges that the search and seizure in this case was \u201creasonable.\u201d It goes on to contend that even if the search and seizure in this case was unlawful, suppression was not required because, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, Connecticut has no state constitutional exclusionary rule. The state insists vigorously that <em>Reynolds </em>controls the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. In the event, however, that a state exclusionary rule is \u201ccreated,\u201d the state argues, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677, reh. denied, 468 U.S. 1250, 105 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Ct. 52, 82 L. Ed. 2d 942 (1984), that a \u201cgood faith\u201d exception should be recognized and applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that we reject <em>Robinson </em>and interpret the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 7, so as to render the search and seizure in this case \u201cunreasonable\u201d and hence unconstitutional. Before we dispose of this precise issue, however, we encounter the state\u2019s argument that Connecticut does not have a state constitutional exclusionary rule and that, if we \u201ccreate\u201d such a rule, a good faith exception to it should be recognized and applied in this case. Not only has the state insisted that the rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, is a bar to the defendant\u2019s Connecticut constitutional claims, but also the defendant himself implicitly assumes, to the contrary, that <em>Reynolds </em>is no longer part of our law. Accordingly, we address first the viability of <em>Reynolds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The state, citing the 1924 case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, maintains that we have emphatically rejected an exclusionary rule in Connecticut for state constitutional violations. It argues, referring specifically to <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>195 Conn. 668, 674, 490 A.2d 984 (1985), that, although later decisions <em>\u201cappear to </em>have assumed the existence of such a rule,\u201d we have never overruled \u201c[our] prior holdings that are directly on point.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In <em>Reynolds </em>this court affirmed the admission into evidence of liquor seized in violation of the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In doing so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>it drew heavily upon its earlier decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>67 Conn. 290, 34 A. 1046 (1896), which likewise affirmed the admission of evidence seized in violation of the same sections of our constitution. In <em>Reynolds, </em>in construing our constitution, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, we declined to apply the limited exclusionary rule of <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U.S. 383, 34 S. Ct. 341, 58 L. Ed. 652 (1914), which held that evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment to the federal constitution was inadmissible in the government\u2019s case-in-chief in the federal courts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 237. For some years after <em>Reynolds, </em>we continued to follow that case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but <em>Reynolds </em>is now no longer the law in Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">In 1961, the United States Supreme Court, invoking the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, held in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, reh. denied, 368 U.S. 871, 82 S. Ct. 23, 7 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1961), that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the fourth amendment to the federal constitution was inadmissible in a state court criminal case. At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Connecticut was one of the states that did not favor an exclusionary rule as a part of its state constitutional law. We so indicated in our first post <em>-Mapp </em>decision when we said: \u201cIt has long been the law in this state that evidence, although obtained by unlawful search and seizure, is, nevertheless, admissible in a criminal prosecution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carol, </em>120 Conn. 573, 575, 181 A. 714 [1935]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>[supra, 231]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>97 Conn. 543, 546, 117 A. 550 [1922]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>supra, 306].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>149 Conn. 567, 572, 182 A.2d 402 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">After our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>DelVecchio, </em>supra, we decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>150 Conn. 488, 191 A.2d 253 (1963). In <em>Collins, </em>the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress certain evidence was assigned as error. On appeal, the state argued that a motion to suppress was unknown, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>supra, 547. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carol, </em>supra, 574-75; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 235. In <em>Collins, </em>Chief Justice King said (p. 489): \u201cOne reason why such a motion was not formally entertained was that prior to the decision in <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[supra], <em>any illegality in the search and seizure of evidence was irrelevant on the question of its admissibility. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Some years later, in 1985, this court decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra. In <em>Kimbro, </em>we concluded that article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut \u201caffords more substantive protection to citizens than does the fourth amendment to the federal constitution in the determination of probable cause.\u201d Id., 223. In doing so, we said (p. 234): \u201cWe clearly have the power to construe the Connecticut constitution in accordance with our particular analysis of the specific right in issue.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 442, 534 A.2d 219 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 707-708, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>195 Conn. 668, 674 n.11, 490 A.2d 984 (1985); <em>Griswold Inn, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>State, 183 Conn. 552, 559 n.3, 441 A.2d 16 (1981). <em>Kimbro </em>impliedly overruled <em>Reynolds </em>even though it did not expressly refer to that case. \u201cIt is an established rule of law that a later decision overrules prior decisions which conflict with it, whether such prior decisions are mentioned and commented upon or not.\u201d <em>In re Lane, </em>58 Cal. 2d 99, 105, 372 P.2d 897, 22 Cal. Rptr. 857 (1962); see <em>Soblan Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Government of the Territory of the Pacific Islands, </em>526 F. Sup. 135, 142 (D.C. Mariana Islands 1981). \u201cThe drift away from <em>[State </em>v. <em>Reynolds] </em>has been so great that it can no longer be deemed a controlling authority.\u201d <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>313 U.S. 236, 244, 61 S. Ct. 862, 85 L. Ed. 1305 (1941); see <em>Lehnhausen </em>v. <em>Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 361-65, 93 S. Ct. 1001, 35 L. Ed. 2d 351, reh. denied, 411 U.S. 910, 93 S. Ct. 1523, 36 L. Ed. 2d 200 (1973). Any \u201cauthority of an older case may be as effectively dissipated by a later trend of decision as by a statement expressly overruling it.\u201d <em>Sei Fujii </em>v. <em>California, </em>38 Cal. 2d 718, 728, 242 P.2d 617 (1952). <em>Kimbro </em>has, therefore, effectively overruled any vitality of <em>Reynolds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>Reynolds </em>is also no longer the law in Connecticut because, contrary to the prevailing view at the time <em>Reynolds </em>was decided in 1924, the exclusionary rule is now widely recognized as an effective remedy for enforcement of the constitutional protection against unconstitutional searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Preliminarily, we note that the <em>Reynolds </em>court adduced several reasons for its position which now have no justification today. We mention only one. In rejecting the claim that the evidence in question should have been excluded on the defendant\u2019s motion, the court said: \u201cTo stop the trial of a criminal cause upon an objection to the introduction of evidence, otherwise admissible, because illegally obtained, in order to determine whether the evidence was so obtained in viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tion of the accused\u2019s constitutional rights, delays the regular course of the trial <em>to try an issue foreign to the cause on trial, </em>and if the issue be found in favor of the accused the evidence excluded may be determinative of the guilt of the accused. Wigmore on Evidence (2d Ed.) Yol. 4, \u00a7 2183.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>supra, 235. With this, it is understandable why the state could argue before us, citing to <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Magnano, </em>that the motion to suppress \u201c[was] unknown to our trial procedure\u201d and that we acknowledged that <em>pre-Mapp </em>such a motion was not \u201centertained.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>supra, 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Although limiting its use on occasion, the United States Supreme Court has continued to recognize the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule. See <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service </em>v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1050, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1984); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 486-87, 96 S. Ct. 3037, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1067 (1976); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Janis, </em>428 U.S. 433, 446, 96 S.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 166, 537 A.2d 446 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scully, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 546 n.2, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S.

In doing so, we acknowledge the concern for interaction between this court and the United States Supreme Court. Yet, in evaluating federal constitutional claims by a litigant, we stand on a different footing than when evaluating claims under our state constitution. On such federal claims, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>roughly akin to an intermediate court, attempting to apply the \u201csupreme law of the land.\u201d See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Aaron, </em>358 U.S. 1, 17, 78 S. Ct. 1401, 3 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1958). The authority of the United States Supreme Court over such federal rulings is full and complete. But if our ruling is clearly based upon an adequate and independent state ground, federal review is limited to a determination of whether Connecticut law violates some provision of federal law. See, e.g., <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>supra, 79; <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 651-53, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L.

This is so whether a criminal or civil matter is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Although in interpreting the Connecticut constitution we have agreed with and followed the federal handling of consonant provisions of the federal constitution, this court has never considered itself bound to adopt the federal interpretation in interpreting the Connecticut constitution. Our system of federalism requires no less. But of even weightier concern is the authority of our state constitution, the fundamental charter of our state, and it is this court\u2019s duty to interpret and enforce our constitution. Here we note that the United States Supreme Court or its individual members have often called the attention of state courts to their independent responsibility for the constitutional laws of their states.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, in a proper case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cthe law of the land\u201d may not, in state constitutional context, also be \u201cthe law of the state of Connecticut.\u201d In recent years, many state supreme courts have interpreted their state constitutions to afford more expansive protection to fundamental rights of their citizens, particularly in the area of civil liberties including searches and seizures. See, e.g., <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>State, </em>599 P.2d 727 (Alaska 1979); <em>People </em>v. <em>Sporleder, </em>666 P.2d 135 (Colo. 1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kaluna, </em>supra; <em>Bierkamp </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>293 N.W.2d 577 (Iowa 1980); <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoshowski, </em>108 Mich.

This has been significantly so because of the ebb and flow in the federal case law in recent years as it impacts on the protections afforded fundamental constitutional rights of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Constitutional provisions must be interpreted within the context of the times. See, e.g., <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number><em>States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 30 S. Ct. 544, 54 L.

As one court said: \u201cWe must <em>interpret </em>the constitution in accordance with the demands of modern society or it will be in constant danger of becoming atrophied and, in fact, may even lose its original meaning.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Seattle School District </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra. It is this court\u2019s duty to assure that our constitution does not become \u201ca magnificent structure ... to look at, but totally unfit for use.\u201d <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 222, 6 L. Ed. 23 (1824). Moreover, a constitution is, in Chief Justice John Marshall\u2019s words, \u201cintended to endure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various <em>crises </em>of human affairs.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>M\u2019Culloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 415, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819). One court put it this way: \u201cIn short, the [Washington] constitution was not intended to be a static document incapable of coping with changing times. It was meant to be, and is, a living document with current effectiveness.\u201d <em>Seattle School District </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 517; see <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>252 U.S. 416, 433, 40 S. Ct. 382, 64 L. Ed. 641 (1920); <em>Humana of New Mexico, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of County Commissioners, </em>92 N.M. 34, 36, 582 P.2d 806 (1978). We agree. The Connecticut constitution is an instrument of progress, it is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally so that it fails to have contemporary effectiveness for all of our citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We now go on to address the defendant\u2019s claim that his rights against unreasonable searches and seizures under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>were violated by the scope of the search at the time of his highway arrest. We are required in this case for the first time to interpret our state constitution\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures in the context of a highway motor vehicle stop and arrest. Certain observations concerning <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, <em>and </em>the <em>motor </em>vehicle exception to the warrant requirement of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution are useful both as background and assistance in our resolution of the distinctive issue presented under our state constitution. In a case not involving a motor vehicle, the United States Supreme Court has said that when an arrest is made, \u201cit is reasonable for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the [arrestee] might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape\u201d as well as \u201cto search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee\u2019s person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction.\u201d <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969). Left unresolved in <em>Chimel </em>was the issue of whether the right to make such searches of the person followed automatically from the fact that a lawful arrest had been made or whether such searches could be made only when the circumstances of the individual case indicated some likelihood that either weapons or evidence would be found. This issue has reached lower courts with some frequency. 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 5.2, p. 437. Some courts have allowed no more than a pat-down when the only conceivable purpose was the protection of the arresting officer, while others have taken a broader view and have determined that a full search of the person incident to a lawful arrest was \u201cper se reasonable.\u201d In 1973, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, and its companion case of <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>supra, held that the latter was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>permissible under the fourth amendment. <em>Robinson </em>upheld the legality of a full body search of an individual conducted at the scene of his highway arrest incident to his lawful arrest for driving a motor vehicle without a valid operator\u2019s permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The significant background facts in <em>Robinson </em>were as follows: On April 23, 1968, at about 11 p.m., Officer Richard Jenks of the District of Columbia metropolitan police department saw the defendant Robinson operating a motor vehicle in which there were three passengers. From a check four days earlier of Robinson\u2019s operator\u2019s permit, Jenks had reason to believe that the defendant was operating a motor vehicle after the revocation of his operator\u2019s permit. This offense is defined by statute in the District of Columbia and carries a mandatory minimum jail term, a mandatory minimum fine or both. Robinson stopped his vehicle on Jenks\u2019 signal and he and all the passengers got out. At that point, Jenks told the defendant that he was under arrest for \u201coperating after revocation and obtaining a permit by misrepresentation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 220. Probable cause to make the arrest was conceded; Jenks made a \u201cfull custody\u201d arrest. Jenks proceeded to make a full \u201cfield type search\u201d of Robinson in accordance with procedures prescribed by police department instructions. During the pat-down, Jenks felt an object in the breast pocket of the defendant\u2019s heavy coat but he \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell what it was\u201d and he \u201ccouldn\u2019t actually tell the size of it.\u201d Id., 223. Jenks then reached into the pocket and pulled out the object which was a \u201ccrumpled up cigarette package.\u201d Even at this point, Jenks did not know what was in the package although he could feel \u201cobjects\u201d in that package. He opened the package and found fourteen gelatin capsules of white powder, which he thought to be, and which on later analysis proved to be, heroin. The lower court had decided that \u201ceven after a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>officer lawfully places a suspect under arrest for the purpose of taking him into custody, he may not ordinarily proceed to fully search the prisoner. He must, instead, conduct a limited frisk of the outer clothing and remove such weapons that he may, as a result of that limited frisk, reasonably believe and ascertain that the suspect has in his possession.\u201d Id., 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The <em>Robinson </em>majority, after referring to its prior decisions and \u201cearly authorities,\u201d entertained no view that they had placed that \u201csort of limitation\u201d that the lower court had on the \u201ctraditional and unqualified authority of the arresting officer to search the arrestee\u2019s person.\u201d Id., 229. The majority then went on to conclude that it was, therefore, not \u201cinclined ... to qualify the breadth of the general authority to search incident to a lawful custodial arrest on an assumption that persons arrested for the offense of driving while their licenses have been revoked are less likely to possess dangerous weapons than are those arrested for other crimes.\u201d Id., 234. <em>Robinson </em>not only said that a custodial search of a suspect based on probable cause constituted \u201ca reasonable intrusion\u201d under the fourth amendment, but that, \u201cthat intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d Id., 235. It was the fact of the lawful arrest which established the authority to search, said the <em>Robinson </em>court, but it also held that \u201cin the case of a lawful custodial arrest <em>a full search </em>of the person is <em>not only </em>an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment <em>but is also </em>a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Justice Rehnquist wrote for the majority that \u201c[i]t is scarcely open to doubt that the danger to an officer is far greater in the case of extended exposure which follows the taking of a suspect into custody and transporting him to the police station than in the case of the relatively fleeting contact resulting from the Terry-type <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>stop. <em>[Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra.] <em>This is an adequate basis for treating all custodial arrests alike for the purposes of search justification.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>Robinson, </em>however, had a \u201cmore fundamental disagreement\u201d with the lower court and that was concerning the \u201csuggestion\u201d that there had to be a case by case litigation of \u201cthe issue of whether or not there was present one of the reasons supporting the authority for a search of the person incident to a lawful arrest.\u201d Id., 235. Laying down what is arguably a bright line test, <em>Robinson </em>said: \u201cA police officer\u2019s determination as to how and where to search the person of a suspect whom he has arrested is necessarily a quick <em>ad hoc </em>judgment which the Fourth Amendment does not require to be broken down in each instance into an analysis of each step in the search. The authority to search the person incident to a lawful custodial arrest, while based upon the need to disarm and to discover evidence, does not depend on what a court may later decide was the probability in a particular arrest situation that weapons or evidence would in fact be found upon the person of the suspect. A custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification. It is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search, and we hold that in the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d Id. We particularly note the broad sweep of <em>Robinson </em>here as it is readily apparent from the passage just quoted that it explicitly rejected <em>any </em>evidentiary standard for a search incident to a lawful custodial arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On the other hand, the <em>Robinson </em>dissenters, speaking through Justice Marshall, interestingly acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>edged their approval of the lower court\u2019s opinion on the pat-down phase<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of Robinson\u2019s coat pocket, with Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion noting that the \u201c[District of Columbia] Court of Appeals<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> unanimously affirmed the right of a police officer to conduct a limited frisk for weapons when making an in-custody arrest, <em>regardless of the nature of the crime for which the arrest was made.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 250 (Marshall, J., dissenting.). In any event, the <em>Robinson </em>majority made it clear that no evidentiary standard or degree of probability of finding weapons or evidence was necessary to justify a search of a person incident to a custodial arrest, although the majority also indicated, in footnote 6, that it was not presently deciding what level of search was appropriate in the event of a \u201croutine traffic stop.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>we note, did not involve the search of a motor vehicle as does the matter on the appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Initially, we state that, to the extent that <em>Robinson </em>allows unlimited searches in contexts that extend beyond full custodial arrests, we disavow its holding concerning the level of protection to which individuals are entitled against unreasonable searches and seizures under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. It is sufficient for us in this case to note that our automobile exception permits a warrantless search of an automobile whenever the police have probable cause to do so. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 428, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 473, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). It is also correct that we have recognized that the police may make a search without a warrant incidental to a lawful custodial arrest. Id., 424; <em>see New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>186 Conn. 45, 48, 438 A.2d 872 (1982). This court recognizes the need for protection of the police, as the state urges upon us, in the matter of highway stops of motor vehicles. Custodial arrests not only serve to protect the police themselves, but also serve the state interest in protecting society itself from violent acts of those arrested. They also serve to assist in the investigation of crime. Custodial arrests, however, obviously implicate constitutional values that are significant both to society in general and to individuals in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">We need not decide in this case, in interpreting article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution, whether a full body search of an occupant of a motor vehicle is authorized when only a minor traffic violation is involved. Both the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut create a reasonableness standard; both proscribe only unreasonable searches and seizures. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 148, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981), we said that \u201c[tjhere is no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search or seize against the invasion which the search or seizure entails. <em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 536-37, 87 S. Ct. 1727, 18 L. Ed. 2d 930 (1967).\u201d \u201c[A] search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is <em>\u2018per se </em>unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S. Ct. 2041, 36 L. Ed. 2d 854 (1973), quoting <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 357, 88 S. Ct. 507, 19 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Ed. 2d 576 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zindros, </em>189 Conn. 228, 236-37, 456 A.2d 288 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1012, 104 S. Ct. 1014, 79 L. Ed. 2d 244 (1984). These exceptions, which \u201chave been jealously guarded and carefully drawn\u201d; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>357 U.S. 493, 499, 78 S. Ct. 1253, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1514 (1958); include: (1) where searches have been undertaken \u201cincident to a lawful custodial arrest\u201d; see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra; and (2) where there is probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle contained contraband or evidence pertaining to a crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>supra, 152-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">A police officer has the right to stop a motor vehicle operating on a Connecticut highway even if the reason for the stop is only an infraction under our traffic laws. Upon doing so, he \u201cprudently may prefer\u201d to ask that an occupant exit the vehicle; any intrusion upon an occupant\u2019s personal liberty in directing that action is de minimis because, on balance, it serves to protect the officer. See <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 110-11, 98 S. Ct. 330, 54 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1977). Even a reasonable direction to do so may be appropriate because \u201c[cjertainly it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 23. Where an operator is stopped by police for a traffic violation, the officer, in order to protect himself, has the right to go beyond a mere pat-down in conducting a search of the operator\u2019s person for weapons. Authorizing police under our constitution to go beyond a pat-down in searching a person for weapons means that the intensity of such a search is limited to that which, under the circumstances, is necessary to the discovery of weapons. Thus, it will depend upon what is reasonable to the officer at that time and permits the accomplishment of the purpose of neutralizing potentially available weapons without endorsing a broader purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>of searching for evidence. There can be, as there were in this case, circumstances reasonably apparent to the officer that permit a full search of the person, both for weapons and for evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We now address the specific circumstances of this case under the defendant\u2019s Connecticut constitutional claims. We cannot accept his claims in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We address first the search of the defendant\u2019s person. The officer legally stopped the defendant\u2019s Buick vehicle, which displayed New York plates and was exceeding the speed limit by thirty miles per hour. After the officer instructed the defendant to return to his vehicle, from which he had exited and approached the police car, the officer then approached the defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked the defendant for his license, registration and insurance card. From his standing position on the driver\u2019s side, the officer, who had twelve years experience as a state policeman, not only observed that both the defendant and his male passenger were very nervous and \u201cvisibly shaking,\u201d but he also noticed a sticker on the dashboard that read \u201cThis car insured by Smith and Wesson,\u201d which he later testified was a reference to a well known manufacturer of firearms. He could also see two New York license plates on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cActions and things observed by an experienced law enforcement officer may have more significance to him in determining whether the law is being violated at a given time and place than they would have to a layman . . .\u2019\u2019and such experience is entitled to \u201cat least some weight\u201d on the ultimate question of probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McClard, </em>333 F. Sup. 158, 164 (E.D. Ark. 1971); see also commentary, A.L.I., Model Code of PreArraignment Procedure \u00a7 120.1, pp. 297-98. While this did not constitute probable cause to arrest the defendant at that point for anything more than the motor vehicle violation, for which he had been stopped initially, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>i.e., speeding, it can, in this case, be factored into the ultimate arrest for possession of narcotics with intent to sell and possession of a dangerous weapon in a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a), 29-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">After verifying the Buick\u2019s license plate and vehicle identification number, the officer learned that the defendant\u2019s operator\u2019s license had been suspended in both New York and Connecticut. Returning to the Buick, the officer informed the defendant that he was under arrest for speeding and for driving while his right to operate was under suspension. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-215, 14-219. Operating a motor vehicle while under suspension is a misdemeanor. General Statutes \u00a7 14-215. The picture had changed. The police officer was now presented with a misdemeanant, who earlier had not only immediately exited his vehicle and approached the officer\u2019s vehicle when originally stopped, but who, upon returning to his vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>appeared with his passenger to be nervous, \u201cvisibly shaking\u201d as the officer observed the Smith and Wesson sticker on the dashboard and two New York license plates on the floor behind the driver\u2019s seat. Driving under suspension is not a routine traffic violation, it provides not only for a fine but also a term of imprisonment; it is thus a \u201ccrime\u201d that may be sanctioned by both a fine and imprisonment. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24. There is no claim and no evidence that the pat-down search of this defendant, whom the officer now had probable cause to believe was guilty of a \u201ccrime,\u201d was in any way pretextual. We believe this officer, alone at 6:30 a.m., on Interstate 95, with the defendant and his passenger, could then comport himself in the circumstances of a custodial arrest. We conclude therefore that the officer\u2019s search of the defendant\u2019s person was legal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">With reference to the legitimacy of the search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, we conclude that it was proper. There is no need for us in this case to decide what authority the officer would have had under our constitution to search the vehicle for contraband when the only provocation for that was a traffic violation. This is so because once the officer had searched the defendant incident to a lawful arrest and found contraband, he then had probable cause to search the vehicle as he had grounds of the probable guilt of the defendant of a \u201ccrime,\u201d as defined under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-24. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The discovery of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>traband in the defendant\u2019s pockets, coupled with all the officer knew at that point, including the fact that he was now presented with a misdemeanant and not a mere traffic violator, gave him probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201ccontraband\u201d as \u201cany property which is unlawful to produce or possess.\u201d See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>533 F. Sup. 448, 450 (E.D. Pa. 1982). We point out here that the officer\u2019s ability to search the vehicle is not to be justified as any continuation of his authority to conduct a pat-down search specifically for weapons in order to protect himself, but is justified on the ground that the escalation of the defendant\u2019s involvement had now risen from that of a mere traffic violation to probable guilt of a \u201ccrime\u201d as our statutes define that term. Despite the fact that one does not enjoy the same expectation of privacy as to the interior of his motor vehicle as one does in the interior of one\u2019s home, nevertheless, \u201c[t]he word \u2018automobile\u2019 is not a talisman in whose presence the Fourth Amendment fades away and disappears.\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 461, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564, reh. denied, 404 U.S. 874, 92 S. Ct. 26, 30 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1971). The same applies to an \u201cautomobile\u201d under article first, \u00a7 7, of the constitution of Connecticut. The exception to the warrant requirement in an automobile search demands that the searching officer have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 153-54, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 429. So does article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution. We believe that this officer had, as we have outlined, objective facts upon which could be based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>a finding of probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s vehicle for contraband.

Because he was unable at that time to demonstrate that he was a resident of a jurisdiction that was a member of the no-bail compact; see Practice Book \u00a7 1004; he was told by the arresting officer that \u201cit was necessary under Connecticut law to take him into <em>custody.\u2019\u2019 State </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>supra, 37-38. A search of his person disclosed \u201ca large wad of money\u201d and a paper bag containing foil packets the officer suspected contained narcotics.

Although I agree with the majority that the exclusionary rule should be applicable to evidence seized in violation of state as well as federal constitutional provisions, and that this court has authority to construe our state constitution to give greater protection against illegal seizures than that afforded by our federal constitution, I see no necessity in this case for such an elaborate treatise on that subject by way of obiter dictum. As the majority recognizes, the same conclusion, that the evidence found in the search of the defendant\u2019s person and also in the search of his automobile was not unlawfully seized, would be reached under both state and federal constitutional provisions. This court has previously held implicitly in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 496 A.2d 498 (1985), where our state constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches was construed to have been violated, although its federal counterpart had not been, that the exclusionary rule was applicable to a state constitutional violation, thus over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ruling sub silentio <em>State </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>101 Conn. 224, 125 A. 636 (1924). If we are ever to reexamine the position we took in <em>Kirnbro, </em>we should at least wait for a case where further consideration of the subject is relevant to the disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">As I understand the majority opinion, it approves as consistent with our state constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7; the holding in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973), that a search of those arrested for traffic violations of a kind for which custody is required,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as in this case, need not be limited to a frisk of the outer clothing for weapons, the kind of search approved in <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), for police encounters with suspicious persons on the street. Rather than endorse under our state constitution the broader holding of <em>Robinson </em>that \u201cin the case of a lawful custodial arrest a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 235; the majority would limit \u201cthe intensity of such a search ... to that which, under the circumstances, is necessary to the discovery of weapons. Thus, it will depend upon what is reasonable to the officer at that time and permits the accomplishment of the purpose of neutralizing potentially available weapons without endorsing a broader purpose of searching for evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>By attempting in this fashion to restrict the scope of searches made by arresting officers of those who are to be taken into custody, whether traffic offenders or others, the majority invites a great deal of litigation in defining precisely how far beyond a \u201cmere pat-down\u201d a police officer may go in protecting himself and makes the validity of a search depend largely upon the intentions of the officer in conducting it. The opinion provides little guidance to an officer, whose determination as to how extensively he may search a person he has arrested is necessarily a quick ad hoc judgment. By making the critical issue whether the purpose of the officer was to protect himself or to discover evidence of a crime, the opinion invites a new round of swearing contests involving constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The majority apparently agrees with <em>Robinson </em>that no distinction should be made in respect to the permissible scope of a search for weapons between traffic offenders and violators of the criminal law when a custodial arrest is required. The opinion recognizes that such a search may include any reasonable measure that, \u201cunder the circumstances, is necessary to the discovery of weapons.\u201d The majority, however, would bar the search of a traffic offender for evidence, presumably allowing such a search of a criminal offender. I see no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>constitutional basis for making such a distinction between those arrested for traffic offenses and for crimes when the violation of law is such that custody is required, as in the present case. In either event, \u201c[a] custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Although the safety of the officer is undoubtedly the paramount concern that justifies a search of a person to be taken into custody, there are other reasons significantly related to law enforcement that justify the rule we have followed heretofore permitting searches of those arrested for violating the criminal law for evidence as well as for weapons. <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 210-11, 530 A.2d 603 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>189 Conn. 35, 40-41, 454 A.2d 262 (1983). In the course of being transported to the police station a person may not only have an opportunity to conceal or dispose of evidence in his possession but may, also consume some substance on his person detrimental to himself. A full body search is commonly made at the police station of an arrested person who is to be held in custody for any substantial period to ensure that no contraband is introduced or made available to others similarly held. Where a station house search of an arrested person would have been made in any event and would have resulted in the discovery of the same items the arresting officer has found in a search contemporaneous with the arrest, it is difficult to perceive what purpose would be served by suppressing the evidence discovered by the officer on the ground that the \u201cfull\u201d search took place at the scene of the arrest rather than the police station. These considerations are sufficiently applicable to traffic offenders taken into cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tody to undermine any basis for distinguishing between them and others in respect to the scope of a permissible search by an arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Because the limitation placed by the majority opinion creates problems for law enforcement without affording as a practical matter any substantial additional protection to those who are taken into custody for a traffic offense, I would adopt the <em>Robinson </em>position that no distinction should be made between traffic offenders and others who are to be taken into custody in defining the scope of the search made at the scene by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">I also disagree with the view expressed by the majority that the lawfulness of a warrantless automobile search may not be justified by the need of an arresting officer to search not only the person but also the automobile of the traffic offender he has arrested in order to protect himself against weapons accessible to the offender. In <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969), the United States Supreme Court held that a lawful custodial arrest allows the police to make a contemporaneous search without a warrant not only of the person arrested but also of the immediately surrounding area. Justification for such searches was found in the need to remove weapons that the arrestee \u201cmight seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape\u201d and to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence. Id., 762-63. In <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981), this principle was applied to allow a police officer who has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, to search the passenger compartment of the automobile. The rationale for this extension of <em>Chimel </em>was that \u201carticles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>generally, even if not inevitably, within \u2018the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m].' \u201d Id., 460, quoting <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 763.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because an officer under a duty to make a custodial arrest of a traffic offender should be able to make as full a search of the offender as the officer believes his own safety warrants, he should also be able to search the passenger compartment of the automobile involved to be sure that it contains no weapon the offender might obtain while he remains in the vicinity of the automobile. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 426-28, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 Conn. 940, 107 S. Ct. 473, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). In the case before us, for example, until the .38 caliber revolver was found in the search of the car, a serious threat was posed to the safety of the two police officers involved during the course of their encounter with the defendant and his companion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">I would justify the search of the defendant\u2019s person on the ground that a full search should be permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of anyone whom a police officer is under a duty to take into his custody, regardless of whether the arrest is for a traffic offense or for some other crime. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra. The search of the defendant\u2019s automobile was also permissible, whether or not there was probable cause to believe that it contained contraband, as the majority assumes, because it was made while the defendant remained at the scene under circumstances where it was reasonable for the arresting officer to remove a suspected threat to his own safety. <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Accordingly, I agree with the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> The majority opinion declares: \u201cWhere an operator is stopped by police for a traffic violation, the officer, in order to protect himself, has the right to conduct a search of his person for weapons that goes beyond a mere pat-down.\u201d I assume that the \u201ctraffic violation\u201d referred to is one for which custody is justified and not one for which the officer is authorized only to issue a summons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>189 Conn. 35, 40-41, 454 A.2d 262 (1983), where the defendant was stopped for speeding under circumstances requiring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>he be taken into custody, this court approved the full search the defendant claimed the officer had made of his person that had resulted in the discovery of narcotics as follows: \u201cIf the search of the defendant\u2019s person was of the search-for-weapons variety sanctioned by <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), as a protective measure when a policeman stops a person who he reasonably suspects has committed an offense, no fourth amendment infraction would have occurred. If it exceeded the limits of such a search, it was in effect a seizure of the person amounting to an arrest. The existence of probable cause based upon the speeding violation, however, satisfies the fourth amendment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[414 U.S. 218, 232-35, 94 S. Ct. 467, 38 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1973)].\u201d Thus, we followed <em>Robinson </em>by sanctioning a full search of a traffic offender where custody was authorized by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\"> Although a search of an automobile incident to a lawful arrest has been deemed to permit the seizure of evidence as well as weapons found in the vehicle; <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460-61, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981); we need not in this case consider whether the possibility that a traffic offender might be able to reach into the passenger compartment of his car to destroy or conceal evidence of some crime would also justify its search. The arresting officer testified that his \u201cprimary concern\u201d in making the search was \u201clocating the gun.\u201d Furthermore, the officer had discovered evidence of unlawful drugs in searching the defendant outside the car justifying his arrest for the offense of drug possession as well as for operating while his license was suspended. The search of the car, therefore, was not subject to any special limitations that possibly might apply to the search of the automobile of a person arrested solely as a traffic offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> The available statistical evidence indicates that a traffic stop has often been the occasion for an assault upon a police officer.
