Corcoran, Jr., for a new trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 902.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a joint trial, Demers and Corcoran previously had been convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a), robbery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-135 (a), and unlawful restraint in the first degree in violation of General Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>utes \u00a7 53a-95 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In ruling on the petition, the trial court found that the state had failed to disclose to the petitioners, at or prior to their trial, the existence of exculpatory information concerning the victim\u2019s prior arrest for prostitution contained in a Waterbury police department report. The trial court determined that, upon reasonable inquiry, the state should have discovered the information in the report and should have disclosed it to the petitioners, and that the information would have had a \u201csignificant impact on the credibility of [the alleged victim] for it directly controverted her sworn testimony that she was not a \u2018hooker\u2019 and had never participated in sex for money.\u201d As a result of its findings, the trial court granted the petition for a new trial. Thereafter, the state filed the instant appeal in the Appellate Court. The appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The principal issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting the petition for a new trial. The state argues that it did because the trial court erred in basing its conclusion that the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion should be granted on the finding of a <em>Brady-Agurs </em>violation. The state claims that there was no <em>BradyAgurs </em>violation because: the information regarding the victim\u2019s prior arrest for prostitution was not suppressed, but rather was known to or should have been discovered by the petitioners themselves prior to trial; the information was not admissible evidence and was neither exculpatory nor material; and the information was also inadmissible as evidence of sexual assault in the first degree because it was barred by Connecticut\u2019s rape shield statute, General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Prior to addressing the substantive issues of this appeal, it is first necessary to summarize briefly the state\u2019s version and the petitioners\u2019 version of the events of March 13, 1982, which led to the arrest and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>viction of the petitioners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At trial, the victim of the petitioners\u2019 alleged criminal conduct testified to the following. At approximately 2:50 a.m. on March 13,1982, she was walking on North Main Street in Waterbury hitchhiking to the Berkeley Heights housing project to buy narcotics when a car containing the petitioners stopped next to her. The petitioners asked the victim if she knew where they could get marihuana and she indicated that they could probably get some up at Berkeley Heights. The petitioners then offered the victim a ride to her destination. Initially, she accepted but then reneged upon realizing that she would have to sit in the back seat of the two-door car or between the two men. When, however, Demers agreed to go to the back seat, the victim entered the car. After the victim entered the car, the petitioners, without informing the victim, deviated from her stated destination and drove to a parking lot next to a building known as the \u201cPonte Club.\u201d While en route, the petitioners told the victim that they wanted to party and requested that she perform oral sex for which they promised to pay her. The victim responded by informing the petitioners that she was forty years old and was not a \u201cparty girl\u201d or a \u201chooker.\u201d The petitioners, however, forced the victim to engage in oral sex with both of them and to engage in vaginal intercourse with Corcoran, after which she was punched in the face by Corcoran and robbed of her money. The victim subsequently managed to escape and hide in nearby woods until the petitioners drove away. She then ran to a house close by to seek help. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>she was admitted by the woman of the house who called the police after being told by the victim that she had just been raped.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In their testimony at trial, the petitioners recited a significantly different version of what had occurred on March 13, 1982. Both testified that while stopped at a traffic light at the comer of North Elm Street, Cherry Street and the North Square, the victim approached their car and propositioned them, soliciting $15 for oral sex and $20 for intercourse. In response to the victim\u2019s proposition, the petitioners claim that each gave her $15, that she got into their car and that she directed them to the parking area at the \u201cPonte Club.\u201d Upon arriving at the parking area, Demers exited the vehicle and the victim proceeded to engage in oral and vaginal intercourse with Corcoran. Thereafter Corcoran exited the car, Demers entered and the victim performed oral sex upon him. The victim then exited the car and engaged in an argument with Corcoran about giving her a ride back to North Main Street. Subsequently, the petitioners drove off, leaving the victim in the parking lot. As they drove away, Demers noticed the victim\u2019s pocketbook on the floor in the front of the automobile and threw it out the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">At the outset, we note that a petition for a new trial is addressed to the discretion of the trial court whose decision thereon will be set aside on appeal only if it reflects a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Wetzel </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>202 Conn. 561, 564-65, 522 A.2d 288 (1987); <em>Asherman </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987). In deciding upon a petition for a new trial, the function of the trial court is to determine whether the evidence presented at the hearing on the petition together with the evidence presented at the original trial warrants the granting of the petition. <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>190 Conn. 667, 669, 461 A.2d 1380 (1983). \u201c \u2018The basic question which the trial court has to decide is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>whether upon all the evidence an injustice had been done\u2019; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>146 Conn. 149, 163, 148 A.2d 334 (1959); and \u2018whether it is probable that on a new trial a different result would be reached.\u2019 <em>Taborsky </em>v. <em>State, </em>142 Conn. 619, 623, 116 A.2d 433 (1955).\u201d <em>Kubeck </em>v. <em>Foremost Foods Co., </em>supra; see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>172 Conn. 16, 17, 372 A.2d 138 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In the case at hand, the trial court granted the petition for a new trial on the ground that the state failed to disclose exculpatory material about which it should reasonably have known, and which it should have disclosed, and thereby violated the principles set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976). The material that the trial court found that the state failed to disclose was the contents of a May, 1981 arrest report of Sergeant Jeremiah Wallace of the Waterbury police department. The arrest report set forth the factual circumstances underlying the victim\u2019s arrest on a charge of prostitution on May 5, 1981, only ten months prior to the incident at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The state first claims that the principles <em>of Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, do not apply in this case because the information was known by the petitioners prior to trial and available to them during trial, and it further claims that the information was neither material nor exculpatory in nature. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">It is well established that \u201c \u2018 \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused . . . violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>[Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 87] . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Monteeth, </em>208 Conn. 202, 213, 544 A.2d 1199 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Doolittle, </em>189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Conn. 183, 196, 455 A.2d 843 (1983); see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>408 U.S. 786, 92 S. Ct. 2562, 33 L. Ed. 2d 706, reh. denied, 409 U.S. 897, 93 S. Ct. 87, 34 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 547 A.2d 534 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Conn. 258, 263, 480 A.2d 526 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 964, 83 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1985). To establish <em>&amp; Brady </em>violation the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating: \u201c(1) that the prosecution suppressed evidence; (2) that the evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) that it was material.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 539-40, 539 A.2d 80 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>201 Conn. 395, 405-406, 518 A.2d 35 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We must first determine whether there was a \u201csuppression\u201d of evidence, within the meaning of <em>Brady. </em>The state claims that the evidence was either available to or known by the petitioners prior to trial, and was also available to them during the trial and, therefore, was not suppressed. This claim involves two interrelated questions. First, did the state have a duty to disclose the arrest report of Sergeant Wallace dated May 5,1981? Second, was the information in the arrest report, although not disclosed, nevertheless, available to or known by the petitioners? To the first question, our answer is in the affirmative and to the second question, in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose applies to all material and exculpatory evidence that is within its possession or <em>available to it; Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 57, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>809 F.2d 702, 719 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1054, 107 S. Ct. 2192, 95 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1987); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>McKaskle, </em>724 F.2d 1153, 1156 (5th Cir. 1984), modified on appeal after remand, 764 F.2d 1142 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>(5th Cir. 1985); <em>Fulford </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>692 F.2d 354, 357 (5th Cir. 1982), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 462 U.S. 111, 103 S. Ct. 2261, 76 L. Ed. 2d 794, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1236, 104 S. Ct. 29, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1451 (1983); and that the prosecution knew or should have known was exculpatory. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bibby, </em>752 F.2d 1116, 1125 (6th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1010, 106 S. Ct. 1183, 89 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1986); see also General Statutes \u00a7 54-86c (a). \u201cIt is irrelevant whether the State [i.e., the prosecutor,] acted in good faith or bad faith in failing to disclose the evidence; negligent suppression may be sufficient.\u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>763 F.2d 942, 957 (8th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 478 U.S. 1020, 106 S. Ct. 3332, 92 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1986), citing <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra. Where \u201cevidence highly probative of [a defendant\u2019s] innocence is in [the prosecutor\u2019s] file, he should be presumed to recognize its significance even if he has actually overlooked it\u201d; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>supra, 110; and he is put on notice to disclose the evidence even in the absence of a request to do so. Id., 107; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 609 n.10, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Upon a careful review of the extensive record extant in this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the state had an obligation to recognize as exculpatory and to disclose the information contained in the police arrest report because the state \u201cshould have known\u201d of this information and its significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office in Waterbury was well aware of the fact that the petitioners\u2019 defense to the sexual assault charges against them, from the very inception of the case, was that the victim was a prostitute and had consented to the sexual acts alleged in return for payment. James Caulfield, counsel for the petitioners at the time of the criminal trial, repeatedly told various members of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>that he had received information from the Waterbury police department, residents of the Grove Street area, and an assistant state\u2019s attorney that the victim was a known drug user and a prostitute. Caulfield also continuously urged the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to contact the detective bureau or the vice squad of the Waterbury police department to verify this information. In addition, Caulfield informed the assistant state\u2019s attorney handling the case about an index card he had located in the records of the clerk\u2019s office at the Waterbury Superior Court, geographical area number four, which indicated that the victim had been arrested for prostitution in May, 1981, and that the state had filed a substitute information charging her with disorderly conduct. Caulfield also informed the state that he was unable to determine the circumstances of the victim\u2019s prostitution arrest or whether it ever had been disposed of and asked the assistant state\u2019s attorney to check on it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Despite Caulfield\u2019s claims that the victim was a known prostitute, and that there existed a record of her arrest for prostitution, and despite Caulfield\u2019s repeated requests that the assistant state\u2019s attorney handling the case call the Waterbury police department to verify this information, the state never placed a phone call. The state\u2019s only apparent response to the information they received from Caulfield was to ask the victim directly if she was a prostitute and to review its file for any prior <em>convictions </em>for prostitution. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>record clearly establishes that, had a cursory investigation been conducted, the arrest report in question was \u201ceasily available\u201d to the state and that a routine telephone call to the detective bureau or vice squad to check the victim\u2019s background would have revealed the report and the circumstances of the victim\u2019s prostitution arrest. The assistant state\u2019s attorney who tried the case, however, admitted that he did nothing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the victim\u2019s prior arrest. In fact, it appears that he never asked the victim about her May, 1981 arrest for prostitution when he inquired whether she had been a prostitute. Moreover, he subsequently acknowledged that the information in the arrest report in question was \u201cpotentially exculpatory\u201d and that, in retrospect, had he known of it, he would have turned it over to the petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">It should also be noted that the fact that the arrest report was in the possession of the Waterbury police department and not of the state\u2019s attorney does not detract from the state\u2019s duty to have disclosed it in this case. \u201cPolice are treated as an arm of the prosecution for <em>Brady </em>purposes, \u2018and the taint on the trial is no less if they, rather than the state\u2019s attorney, were guilty of the nondisclosure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>supra, 958; see also <em>Barbee </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>331 F.2d 842, 846 (4th Cir. 1964). \u201cThe State\u2019s duty of disclosure is imposed not only upon its prosecutor, but also on the State as a whole, including its investigative agencies. Therefore, if the [exculpatory materials] were held by the . . . police department we would be compelled to conclude that, constructively, the State\u2019s attorney had both access to and control over the documents. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>142 D.C. App. 132, 439 F.2d 642 [D.C. Cir.], on remand, 331 F. Supp. 927 [D.D.C.], aff\u2019d, 145 D.C. App. 259, 448 F.2d 1182 ([D.C. Cir.] 1971); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>608 F.2d 1349 (10th Cir. 1979).\u201d <em>Ful</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>ford </em>v. <em>Maggio, </em>supra, 358 n.2; see also <em>United States ex rel.

Ct. 1517, 47 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the state had access to the arrest report of Sergeant Wallace concerning the victim\u2019s prostitution arrest, and a duty to disclose it.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The state also argues that it had no duty to disclose the arrest report in question because the information contained in it was available to and in fact known by the petitioners. This court has previously held that \u201c \u2018[ejvidence known to the defendant or his counsel, or that is disclosed, even if during trial, is not considered suppressed as that term is used in <em>Brady. \u2019 State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>[195 Conn. 444, 455-56, 488 A.2d 812, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 833, 106 S. Ct. 103, 88 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 177, 448 A.2d 837 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>supra, 407. The record in this case, however, indicates that the petitioners had no knowledge of the existence of Wallace\u2019s arrest report until almost two and one-half years after the conclusion of their criminal trial. The record further reveals that, in the absence of specific knowledge of its existence, it is speculative at best to assume that Caulfield should or would have been able to discover the existence of the report and its contents on his own. Officer John Cavanaugh of the records division of the Waterbury police department testified at the posttrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>hearing on the petitioners\u2019 motion for a new trial<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that he was able to retrieve the arrest report from the microfilm records only after receiving the internally assigned file and complaint numbers which enabled him to cross reference the report to the name of the arrested person. There is no dispute that the petitioners\u2019 trial counsel never received the internally assigned file and complaint numbers on any of the documents provided him by the state, nor did he come across them during his investigation. In addition, Wallace testified that had Caulfield inquired of him regarding the victim\u2019s arrest, he would not have given him any information or discussed the matter but would have referred him to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. He further stated that even if the case arising from the victim\u2019s arrest had not still been pending, \u2018T don\u2019t think I would have said anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Caulfield further testified that none of the Waterbury police officers from whom he had obtained his initial information would come forward to testify and that each of them had indicated that they would deny ever having spoken with Caulfield regarding the victim. Caulfield also testified that he was unable to determine whether the victim\u2019s arrest for prostitution had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>been disposed of and that, from his past experiences, the Waterbury police department would not discuss a pending matter. Under such circumstances, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the information contained within Wallace\u2019s arrest report was neither known to nor reasonably available to the petitioners before or during trial simply because Caulfield was aware of the victim\u2019s prior arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The state next claims that circumstances underlying the victim\u2019s arrest for prostitution are neither exculpatory nor material because the information is \u201cinadmissible and collateral [to] any of the three separate counts of which the [petitioners] were convicted.\u201d Specifically, the state argues that the alleged acts of prostitution set forth in the police report were not relevant to the credibility of the victim and, therefore, were not admissible in this case. In addition, the state argues that evidence of the prior sexual history of the victim is inadmissible under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f, Connecticut\u2019s rape shield statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u201cIt is beyond dispute that a witness may be impeached by evidence of specific acts of misconduct which relate to veracity, but not by those that merely illustrate general bad behavior. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>201 Conn. 74, 85-86, 513 A.2d 116 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roma, </em>199 Conn. 110, 116-17, 505 A.2d 717 (1986); <em>Martyn </em>v. <em>Donlin, </em>151 Conn. 402, 408, 198 A.2d 700 (1964); <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>148 Conn. 666, 675, 174 A.2d 122 (1961); C.

It is also generally held that a witness\u2019 reputation for being unchaste or a prostitute, or her prior acts of sexual misconduct are not, in and of themselves, relevant to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>credibility or veracity as a witness. <em>State </em>v.

Thus, if on cross-examination a witness denies having engaged in such prior acts of misconduct, the examiner must accept the answer and is prohibited from offering extrinsic evidence to prove such acts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 86; <em>State </em>v. <em>Guthridge, </em>164 Conn. 145, 157, 318 A.2d 87 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 988, 93 S.

Where, however, as here, the prior acts of misconduct are relevant to a substantive or material issue in the case, the prior acts can be proven by extrinsic evidence, despite the fact that admission of that evidence directly contradicts the testimony of the state\u2019s witness, thereby also raising questions as to his or her credibility.

McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 47, pp. 110-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">There can be no doubt that while the factual circumstances underlying the victim\u2019s prior arrest for prostitution would have had, as the trial court indicated, a \u201csignificant impact on the credibility of [the victim] for it directly controverted her sworn testimony that she was not a \u2018hooker\u2019 and had never participated in sex for money,\u201d they were also clearly relevant under the circumstances of this case to the substantive issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>consent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that the information contained in the police report was admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The report of Sergeant Wallace indicated that at 11:25 in the evening of May 5, 1981, while in plainclothes and in an unmarked car, he was approached by a black male at the intersection of Central Avenue and Grove Street in Waterbury. The black male knocked on Wallace\u2019s car window, asked him if he wanted a woman and told him it would cost $20 for a \u201cblow job.\u201d When Wallace agreed, the black male called to a woman standing on the sidewalk and indicated that Wallace had agreed to the price. The woman walked over to the car and opened the door. As she entered the automobile, she looked at and apparently recognized Wallace, yelled that he was \u201ca cop,\u201d and ran up Grove Street. She was thereafter apprehended and placed under arrest. The report reveals the name of the woman arrested to be the same as that of the victim and also reveals that she was arrested for prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Since the time of their arrest on the criminal charges, the petitioners have asserted that the victim approached them at the corner of North Elm Street and Cherry Street in Waterbury while they were in an automobile and offered to engage in sex with them for a fee. At trial, they both testified that when they agreed to her price, she got into their car and directed them to the Ponte Club parking lot where she rendered sexual services for the prices agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Contrary to the repeated claims of the petitioners that the victim had consented to the sexual acts in ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tion in return for payment, the victim, herself, repeatedly asserted at trial that she was \u201cnot a hooker\u201d or a \u201cparty girl.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, during cross-examination by the petitioners\u2019 counsel, she unequivocally testified that, prior to March 13,1982, she \u201cnever\u201d engaged in sexual activity with anyone in exchange for money. The jury also heard the victim\u2019s claim that she was not a \u201chooker\u201d when the woman to whose home the victim ran after the incident on March 13,1982, testified that the victim \u201ckept repeating: I am forty years old and I am not a hooker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Accordingly, the factual circumstances of the victim\u2019s arrest for prostitution on May 5, 1981, could lead to a reasonable conclusion that the victim had agreed on at least one occasion in the past to perform sexual acts for money and that under the circumstances that conclusion would have been relevant to the issue of consent in the petitioners\u2019 criminal trial. While this court has yet to face the issue, numerous courts of other jurisdictions have recognized the relevancy and admissibility of evidence tending to establish that the alleged victim of a sexual assault was a prostitute in cases where, as here, consent was a defense to the sexual acts. See <em>State ex rel. Pope </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>113 Ariz. 22, 29, 545 P.2d 946 (1976); <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State, </em>510 So. 2d 885, 893 (Fla. 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 943, 108 S. Ct. 1123, 99 L.

The Arizona Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>sitting en banc, specifically stated that \u201c[wjhere, for instance, the defendant alleges the prosecutrix actually consented to an act of prostitution, the accused should be permitted to present evidence of her reputation as a prostitute and her prior acts of prostitution to support such a defense.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pope </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The state argues that evidence of the victim\u2019s past acts of prostitution are inadmissible under Connecticut\u2019s rape shield statute. We disagree. General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f specifically provides for the following exceptions to the inadmissibility of evidence of the prior sexual conduct of a sexual assault victim where such evidence is \u201c(1) offered by the defendant on the issue of whether the defendant was, with respect to the victim, the source of semen, disease, pregnancy or injury, or (2) offered by the defendant on the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as to his or her sexual conduct, or (3) any evidence of sexual conduct with the defendant offered by the defendant on the issue of consent by the victim, when consent is raised as a defense by the defendant, or (4) otherwise so relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d In light of our previous discussion, such evidence, at the very least, would be admissible under subsection four of the rape shield statute. To have deprived the petitioners of the ability to present such evidence which was so highly probative, relevant and material to an element of the crime charged would have violated their sixth amendment rights under the United States constitution to confront the witnesses against them. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 490. Accordingly, we need not address the potential applicability of the other exceptions set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Having determined that the circumstances of the victim\u2019s arrest for prostitution were admissible in the petitioners\u2019 criminal trial, we must decide whether the trial court erred in concluding that the evidence was \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of determining whether a violation of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>supra, occurred. Under the <em>Brady </em>doctrine, \u201cevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would ha/ve been different. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1985); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Polizzi, </em>801 F.2d 1543, 1553 (9th Cir. 1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Quintana, </em>209 Conn. 34, 38, 547 A.2d 534 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 539 n.13, 539 A.2d 80 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In granting the petition for a new trial, the trial court found that the suppressed evidence would have had a significant impact on the victim\u2019s credibility because it would directly have controverted her testimony that she was not a prostitute and had not consented to the sexual activity in question. In addition, the court noted that \u201c[t]he triers of fact were entitled to have the opportunity to adjudge [the victim\u2019s] credibility . . . by having [Wallace\u2019s] testimony placed before them.\u201d \u201cImpeachment evidence as well as exculpatory evidence falls within <em>Brady\u2019s </em>definition of evidence favorable to an accused. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>[supra, 676]; <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 87; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Polizzi, </em>[supra, 1553].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Monteeth, </em>208 Conn. 202, 213, 544 A.2d 1199 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 132, 142, 531 A.2d 125 (1987). In the past, we have held that where, as here, \u201c \u2018a conviction depends entirely upon the testimony of certain witnesses . . . information affecting their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>credibility is material in the constitutional sense [i.e., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>supra,] since if they are not believed a reasonable doubt of guilt would be created.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Grasso, </em>172 Conn. 298, 302, 374 A.2d 239 (1977).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 462, 464 A.2d 829 (1983); see also <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Monteeth, </em>supra. There can be no question that the victim\u2019s testimony was crucial to the petitioners\u2019 convictions and that the suppressed evidence, if disclosed and admitted, would directly have contradicted her testimony on a material element of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree, i.e., consent. Therefore, we determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found that a reasonable probability existed that, if the suppressed evidence had been disclosed and admitted, the result of the criminal trial would have been different. Clearly, such evidence undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Consequently, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the joint petition for a new trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the suppressed evidence related directly only to an element of one of the charged crimes, i.e., sexual assault in the first degree, a new trial is required on all counts of the respective informations against the petitioners given the nature of such evidence and its profound relevancy to the victim\u2019s credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-270 (a) provides: \u201ccauses for which new trials may be granted, (a) The superior court may grant a new trial of any action that may come before it, for mispleading, the discovery of new evidence or want of actual notice of the action to any defendant or of a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend, when a just defense in whole or part existed, or the want of actual notice to any plaintiff of the entry of a non-suit for failure to appear at trial or dismissal for failure to prosecute with reasonable diligence, or for other reasonable cause, according to the usual rules in such cases.
