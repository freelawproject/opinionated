After having been admitted to her apartment, he produced a knife and forced her to disrobe. He then gagged his victim, bound her to her bed and unsuccessfully attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, he searched the victim\u2019s apartment and took several hundred dollars from a desk drawer. After leaving his victim\u2019s apartment, the defendant fled, first to Chicago, and then to California where he voluntarily entered a hospital. He was later arrested and returned to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">At his trial the defendant admitted the elements of the crimes charged. In his defense he produced evidence of, and relied upon, the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect provided by General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>\u00a7 53a-13.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A jury, however, convicted the defendant on all counts of the substitute information. The trial court subsequently imposed an effective sentence of forty-one years, suspended after twenty-nine years, to be followed by a period of probation of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In his appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred when it allowed the state, during cross-examination of the defendant and during final argument to the jury, to substitute what he denominates as the \u201cpoliceman at the elbow\u201d test of insanity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the statutory test of insanity provided by \u00a7 53a-13. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The principal issue at the defendant\u2019s trial was the volitional aspect of the insanity defense, that is, whether the defendant lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, to control his conduct within the requirements of the law. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. During cross-examination of the defendant, the state, in pursuing the issue of the defendant\u2019s alleged inability to control his conduct, asked him the question, \u201cIf there were six police officers sitting at the kitchen table playing poker, you think you would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>have gone into that bedroom and tied [the victim] to the bed?\u201d The defendant objected to the question as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and the state repeated essentially the same question. In response, the' defendant initially replied that he was unable to answer such a hypothetical inquiry. After prodding by the state, however, the defendant observed that he \u201cwanted to be arrested anyway,\u201d that he had \u201cturned himself in\u201d and that \u201c[i]t didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Thereafter, during summation, the defendant took exception to a portion of the state\u2019s final argument wherein the state apparently reflected on whether the defendant would have been able to control his conduct if there had been \u201csix police officers sitting in the room when he entered [the victim\u2019s] apartment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court \u201coverruled\u201d the defendant\u2019s exception stating that \u201c[i]t was part of the evidence. It\u2019s proper argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The defendant argues that \u00a7 53a-13, which provides in pertinent part that \u201cit shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked <em>substantial </em>capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct <em>or to control his conduct within the requirements of </em>the law\u201d (emphasis added), is the exclusive test for the affirmative defense of insanity. He contends that the \u201cpoliceman at the elbow\u201d test, which he claims was suggested by the state in its hypothetical question and in its closing comments, and sanctioned by the court, differs from the exclusive statutory test set forth in \u00a7 53a-13 because that test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>requires the jury to find that the defendant <em>totally </em>lacked the capacity to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The defendant is correct that the statutory test is exclusive. <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>178 Conn. 626, 633, 424 A.2d 293 (1979). The record, however, fails to disclose how the hypothetical query by the state or the reference thereto in its final argument could possibly have been interpreted by the jury as delineating the test to be applied to its determination of whether the defendant had proved the affirmative defense of insanity. The transcript reveals that, after the defendant testified in support of the insanity defense, the state, on cross-examination, concentrated its attack on the claimed inability of the defendant to control his conduct. During the course of the state\u2019s questioning, the defendant acknowledged that on occasions in the past he had been able to suppress his sexual urges due to his concern for the consequences of his contemplated actions or out of fear of retribution. In allowing the hypothetical question complained of, the trial court, in keeping with that line of questioning, was obviously permitting the state to plumb the depths of the defendant\u2019s capacity to restrain himself under various circumstances. Such an inquiry was at least of some relevance to the defendant\u2019s ability to control his conduct within the requirements of the law, which is an integral facet of the statutory defense of insanity and was the central issue in the case. It would take a tortured reading of the record to construe the state\u2019s cross-examination as creating the \u201ctest\u201d for insanity. Although the state, in its effort to make a point, hypothesized a rather extreme situation, the allowance of the hypothetical question posed by the state lay within the broad discretion afforded the trial court to determine the permissible scope of cross-examination. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Guillette, </em>547 F.2d 743, 755 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Briggs, </em>179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Conn. 328, 333-34, 426 A.2d 298 (1979), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 912, 100 S. Ct. 3000, 64 L. Ed. 2d 862 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Amaral, </em>179 Conn. 239, 244, 425 A.2d 1293 (1979); <em>Gurecki </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>175 Conn. 297, 298, 398 A.2d 311 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 636, 362 A.2d 813 (1975); 81 Am. Jur. 2d, Witness \u00a7 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Further, any danger that the jury might employ a test other than the statutory test when assessing the defendant\u2019s insanity defense was eliminated by the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. The trial court, in giving those instructions, never mentioned the hypothetical question propounded by the state nor did it allude to any test for insanity other than the statutory test. In addition, after it had specifically told the jurors that they were required to follow the court\u2019s instructions on the law, the trial court proceeded to instruct them on the correct statutory standard for insanity on at least eight occasions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the absence of some indication to the contrary, other than conjecture by the defendant, we are constrained to presume that the jurors followed the trial court\u2019s instructions in that regard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 364, 521 A.2d 150 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 156, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-101. burglary in the first degree: CLASS B felony, (a) A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree when he enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein and: (1) He is armed with explosives or a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, or (2) in the course of committing the offense, he intentionally, knowingly or recklessly inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-92. kidnapping in the first degree, (a) A person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when . . .
