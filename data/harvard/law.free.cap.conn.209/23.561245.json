The petition alleged an illegal confinement in that the respondent commissioner of correction had erroneously calculated the effective release date on the petitioner\u2019s two concurrent sentences of two and one-half years each. Specifically, the petitioner claimed that he was entitled, under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to a sentence reduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>113 days for the time he had spent in presentence confinement (jail time) awaiting the disposition of his cases. Further, he claimed that the respondent\u2019s construction of \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b), crediting him with only seventy-six days of jail time, denied him his constitutional rights of due process and equal protection of the laws as guaranteed him by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 20, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>The habeas court concluded that the respondent had misconstrued \u00a7 18-98d, and granted the petition. It rendered judgment ordering the respondent to recalculate the petitioner\u2019s sentence to award him 113 days of jail time credit. The respondent\u2019s petition for permission to appeal to the Appellate Court was thereafter granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court then transferred the matter to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On appeal, the respondent claims: (1) that the trial court erred in concluding that \u00a7 18-98d entitled the petitioner to 113 days of jail time credit for the time he was incarcerated while unable to make bail; and (2) that the denial of such credit to the petitioner does not deny him due process or equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We conclude that the respondent correctly construed \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b), and that the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights have not been violated. Therefore, we remand the matter to the trial court with direction to deny the petition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Examination of the record discloses the following: Docket No. CR 6-262088</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Robbery Third Degree, Assault Third Degree, Larceny Second Degree, Criminal Impersonation</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">On July 22, 1986, the petitioner was arrested and charged with the crimes of robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-136, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 and criminal impersonation in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-130. These offenses allegedly occurred on July 21,1986. The petitioner remained in pretrial confinement for these offenses until he posted bail on November 12,1986,113 days after his arrest. On January 16, 1987, the petitioner pleaded guilty to a single count of robbery in the third degree and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Docket No. CR 6-263741 Possession of Cocaine</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On August 28,1986, the petitioner was charged with the crime of possession of cocaine in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), the offense allegedly having occurred on June 11,1986. He remained in pretrial confinement on this charge until he posted bail on November 12, 1986, seventy-six days after his arrest for possession of cocaine. On January 16,1987, the petitioner pleaded guilty as charged and was sentenced to a second term of imprisonment of two and one-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The sentencing court ordered that both two and one-half year sentences were to run concurrently. In determining the petitioner\u2019s effective release date, the respondent examined the pretrial confinement time in each case. In Docket No. CR 6-262088, the respondent calculated that 113 days of jail time plus a correspond<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>ing reduction of thirty-eight days for good conduct (good time)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> advanced the petitioner\u2019s release date in that case from July 15,1989, to February 14,1989. In Docket No. CR 6-263741, the respondent calculated that seventy-six days of jail time plus a corresponding twenty-six days of good time advanced the release date from July 15, 1989, to April 4, 1989. Having merged the two sentences and on the basis of the sentence which had the longest to run, the respondent, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-38 (b), determined that the actual release date would be April 4, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The petitioner argues that he should receive jail time credit for all presentence confinement regardless of which offense caused his pretrial confinement and regardless of which sentence caused his subsequent imprisonment. In effect, he seeks to credit the 113 days of jail time accrued in Docket No. CR 6-262088 to the sentence imposed in Docket No. CR 6-263741. We disagree that such a credit is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 18-98d (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who is confined to a . . . correctional institution .... because such person is unable to obtain bail . . . shall, if subsequently imprisoned, earn a reduction of his sentence equal to the number of days which he spent in such facility from the time he was placed in presentence confinement to the time he began serving the term of imprisonment imposed; provided (1) each day of presentence confinement shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>be counted only once for the purpose of reducing all sentences imposed after such presentence confinement <em>f f</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">In <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>173 Conn. 312, 377 A.2d 335 (1977), and <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 247, 363 A.2d 121 (1975), we examined this statute\u2019s predecessors, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In these cases we addressed the specific issue of whether jail time credit accruing under one offense can be transferred to a term of imprisonment following sentencing on a different offense. Although neither statute clearly addressed the issue, we concluded in both instances that such transfers of jail time credit were not permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cAs our decision in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>[supra], makes clear, in order for an inmate to be entitled to presentence time-served credit pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 18-97 of the General Statutes, <em>it must appear that he was being confined untier a </em>mittimus<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>which resulted from the offense for which the sentence was imposed. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Sections 18-97 and 18-98 were subsequently merged and reenacted in 1980 as \u00a7 18-98d. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-442. The issue then arises whether the language of this new enactment should cause us to modify our earlier rulings that jail time credits may not be transferred. We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Section 18-98d differs from its predecessors in that it merged \u00a7 18-97, which dealt with the presentence confinement of those held under a mittimus, and \u00a7 18-98, which dealt with the presentence confinement of those unable to obtain bail. Further, \u00a7 18-98d added the provision that \u201ceach day of presentence confinement shall be counted only once for the purpose of reducing all sentences imposed after such presentence confinement.\u201d As with its predecessors, there is no specific language in \u00a7 18-98d dealing with the transferability of jail time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Section 18-98d was enacted after our ruling in <em>Mancinone </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>162 Conn. 430, 294 A.2d 564 (1972), which concluded that the credits authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 were not mutually exclusive and could be earned simultaneously. The effect of <em>Mancinone </em>was that an alleged parole violator held under a mittimus could earn jail time credit under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00a7 18-97 and also accrue jail time credit under \u00a7 18-98 for other charges pending for which he had been unable to obtain bail. Thus, in <em>Mancinone </em>the defendant received two days jail time credit against his sentence for each calendar day spent in presentence confinement as the result of the simultaneous application of the credits authorized under both \u00a7 18-97 and \u00a7 18-98. See also <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981) (five days credit for each calendar day of pretrial confinement.) The holding in <em>Mancinone, </em>however, did not deal with the issue in <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, or <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, i.e., whether jail time credits accrued while in pretrial confinement for one offense could be transferred to a sentence imposed for another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There is nothing in the scanty legislative history of \u00a7 18-98d that indicates that its enactment was a specific legislative response to our holding in <em>Mancinone </em>v. <em>Warden. </em>It is evident, however, that with the merger of the two statutes, there is now only a single jail time credit applicable to presentence confinements. The availability of but a single jail time credit, together with the new language specifically limiting sentence reductions to a single day for each calendar day of pretrial confinement, effectively deals with the arguably inequitable result that flowed from the concurrent application of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">With respect to the present issue, however, we observe nothing in the language of \u00a7 18-98d, or in its legislative history, that suggests that its enactment was in response to our earlier holdings in <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, and <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, as to the nontransferability of jail time credits between sentences. This being the case, we do not modify our earlier position that our legislature has not intended to authorize the transfer of jail time credits accrued while in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>pretrial confinement under one offense to the sentence thereafter imposed upon conviction for another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">While \u00a7 18-98d deals with the calculation of sentences in general, it does not specifically take up the matter of concurrent sentences. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b) does. It provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the sentences run concurrently, the terms merge in and are <em>satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run . \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">In the present case, the respondent determined that the two and one-half year term imposed in Docket No. CR 6-262088, when adjusted for its authorized credits, would be satisfied on February 14, 1989. The two and one-half year term imposed in Docket No. CR 6-263741, when adjusted for its authorized credits, would be satisfied on April 4, 1989. The two sentences having been ordered to run concurrently, \u00a7 53a-38 (b) directed that their merged terms were satisfied by the \u201cdischarge of the term which has the longest term to run.\u201d In this instance, the respondent determined that the longer term was the sentence in Docket No. CR 6-263741, i.e., until April 4,1989, and therefore he declared that date as the proposed discharge date since \u00a7 53a-38 (b) required him to do so. We conclude that the determination of the discharge date by this method reflects a correct construction of the two applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The respondent further claims that the correct application of \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b) to the sentencing circumstances of this case does not deny the petitioner his right to equal protection of the laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u201c \u2018When a question of constitutionality is raised, courts must approach it with caution, examine it with care, and sustain the legislation unless its invalidity is clear . . . <em>Liistro v. Robinson, </em>170 Conn. 116, 127, 365 A.2d 109 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u201cEqual protection analysis must commence with a determination of whether a legislative classification is invidious, or \u2018inherently suspect,\u2019 or whether the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right. Where the legislation impinges upon a fundamental right . . . then it must be struck down unless justified by a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>Laden </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>169 Conn. 540, 542, 363 A.2d 1063 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">\u201cThe refusal to credit the [petitioner] with jail time affects the period of his confinement and directly impinges on his fundamental right of liberty. . . . Hence his lengthened confinement must be justified by a compelling state interest.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The compelling state interest in upholding the respondent\u2019s calculation here lies in the unacceptable ramifications of transferring jail time credit between different offenses. In order for the petitioner to be eligible for release on February 14,1989, as he claims, the jail time accrued in Docket No. CR 6-262088 would have to be transferred to Docket No. CR 6-263741. The petitioner in effect would have begun serving the sentence in Docket No. CR 6-263741 before he was even charged with the offense in that information. Implicit in the adoption of his construction of \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b) is the notion that the petitioner may \u201cbank\u201d jail time credits, thereby reducing criminal sentences that are subsequently imposed. This he may not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">A petitioner should not, upon posting bail, leave a correctional center with the perception that there is jail time accrued in his name which may be applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>subsequent sentences that may follow criminal activity occurring after his release on bail but before the disposition of the original charges. \u201cThe principle that extra time served on a criminal sentence may not be \u2018banked\u2019 is strongly rooted in the public policy that individuals should not be encouraged to commit crimes knowing they have a \u2018line of credit\u2019 that can be applied against future sentences. <em>[McGinnis </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Pollack, </em>452 F.2d 833, 836 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 905, 92 S. Ct. 1606, 31 L. Ed. 2d 815 (1972)]; see also <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>693 F.2d 104, 105 (10th Cir. 1982); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>443 F.2d 1019, 1021-22 (4th Cir. 1971).\u201d <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>776 F.2d 394, 396 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1023, 106 S. Ct. 1216, 89 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We conclude that the public policy considerations inherent in discouraging criminal activity rise to the level of a compelling state interest. In our view, therefore, \u00a7\u00a7 18-98d and 53a-38 (b) as interpreted and applied in this instance withstand the constitutional challenge raised by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the matter is remanded with direction to deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-14\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 18-98d. presentence confinement credit FOR CONFINEMENT RESULTING FROM AN OFFENSE COMMITTED ON OR AFTER <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>July 1,1981.
