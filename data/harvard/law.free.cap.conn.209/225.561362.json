In <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 394-96, 542 A.2d 306 (1988) <em>(Daniels I), </em>this court determined that such disagreement authorized the trial court to declare a mistrial. Because we were, however, unclear about the reasoning underlying the trial court\u2019s action, we requested an articulation. We now affirm the trial court\u2019s decision and, after considering one other issue relating to sentencing that remained undecided in <em>Daniels I, </em>find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">For the purposes of the present appeals, we need only reiterate the following facts, which are more fully reported in <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 378-81. After a trial to a three judge court, the defendant, Jerry D. Daniels, was convicted of one count of murder in the death of Christine Whipple pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of capital felony in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>deaths of Christine Whipple and her daughter Amy Russell pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-54b (8),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of second degree sexual assault concerning Christine Whipple pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-71.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecution sought the death penalty for the capital felony conviction and the defendant elected a trial by jury at the penalty stage. The jury found the existence of an aggravating factor, but despite extensive deliberations and receiving a \u201cChip Smith\u201d charge, could not reach a unanimous decision on the existence of a mitigating factor. The trial court then dismissed the jury and sentenced the defendant to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment, one each for the murder and capital felony convictions, and to a consecutive term of ten years imprisonment for the sexual assault conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On the prior appeal, in which both the state and the defendant took issue with various trial court rulings, we determined that the trial court had correctly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>strued the death penalty statute to impose upon the state the burden of proving one of the statutorily defined aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, and thereafter to impose upon the defendant the burden of proving a statutorily defined mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 383-86. We concluded, furthermore, that neither of these burdens can be met without a unanimous finding by the trier of fact. Id., 386-94. Finally, we held that, if the jury cannot agree on the existence of a mitigating factor, the trial court has discretion to declare a mistrial. Id., 394-96. In such circumstances, we determined that the trial court may pursue one of three courses of action: it may declare a mistrial; it may make factual findings \u201cacquitting\u201d the defendant of the death penalty; or it may exercise its discretion, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to dismiss the death penalty proceeding. Id., 396-97. We were, however, unsure whether the trial court was aware of its authority to declare a mistrial and, if it were aware, what underlay its decision of fact and law leading to its imposition of a life sentence on the defendant for the capital felony conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we remanded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>case to the trial court for a further articulation of its reasons for dismissing the death penalty phase of the proceeding and imposing the life sentence. Id., 400-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The trial court responded with an articulation on June 13,1988, which made it clear that the court understood that it had the authority to declare a mistrial, but had elected not to do so. The court then went on to describe why it had decided to dismiss the death penalty proceeding and to impose a life sentence upon the defendant. It stated that it \u201cwas determined to resolve the case with finality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">On this record, there are two issues before us. On the state\u2019s appeal, the question is whether a death penalty proceeding must be reinstated because the trial court either lacked the discretion to impose a life sentence or abused its discretion in its exercise. The defendant maintains, to the contrary, that principles of double jeopardy preclude appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision. On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the question is one we did not reach in <em>Daniels I: </em>whether the trial court violated the principles of double jeopardy in imposing two life sentences upon the defendant, one for the murder of Christine Whipple and the other for the capital felony of killing Christine Whipple and Amy Russell. We find no error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Turning to the state\u2019s appeal, we must address two issues in order to ascertain whether the trial court erroneously imposed a life sentence. First, is the court\u2019s decision, as the defendant maintains, barred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>appellate review by applicable principles of double jeopardy? Second, did the court, as the state maintains, have authority or justification for its exercise of discretion to impose a life sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">The defendant\u2019s double jeopardy argument comes to us in two versions. The defendant maintains that, if the trial court exercised discretion in imposing a life sentence, its action is not further reviewable after the beginning of the execution of his life sentence. He further maintains that, if the trial court\u2019s action amounted to a fact-based \u2018 \u2018acquittal, \u2019 \u2019 then, as we held in <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 397-99, such an \u201cacquittal\u201d bars a second capital sentencing hearing. We find neither of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In <em>Daniels I, </em>we considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the beginning of the execution of his life sentence foreclosed any proceedings to impose a penalty that would be more severe. Id., 387. We noted that double jeopardy does not preclude the correction of a sentence that is illegal. Id. The defendant now renews this claim, arguing that any sentence that the trial court has discretion to impose is not illegal. While that argument might have force under other circumstances, such as when a trial court is selecting one among a range of permissible statutory sanctions, it is inappropriate in this case where the consequence of the trial court\u2019s decision is the dismissal of the penalty phase of a capital felony proceeding. Were such an exercise of discretion improper, the court would have acted illegally in imposing a life sentence. \u201cCorrection of this illegality, were it to be shown, would not violate double jeopardy. <em>United Sates </em>v. <em>Fogel, </em>829 F.2d 77, 83 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 116, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>185 Conn. 473, 479, 440 A.2d 962 (1981); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 101 S. Ct. 426, 66 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1980).\u201d <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The defendant\u2019s alternative double jeopardy argument rests on the proposition that the trial court\u2019s articulation amounted to an \u201cacquittal on the merits\u201d of the death penalty. We posited in <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 397, that, if the trial court were to reach such a fact-bound determination, double jeopardy would bar further review because another capital sentencing hearing would be foreclosed. We held that the test was \u201c \u2018whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 571, 97 S. Ct. 1349, 51 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1977).\u201d <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 399. Applying that test to the trial court\u2019s original oral memorandum and its subsequent articulation, we conclude that the trial court was not exercising the power conferred upon it, by Practice Book \u00a7 883,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to find as a matter of fact that \u201cthe evidence would not reasonably permit a finding of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Examination of the court\u2019s remarks at trial and in its articulation<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> discloses nothing that either expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>or impliedly can be construed as the equivalent of a factual finding that the evidence produced at the hearing on mitigating factors reasonably required a finding that the existence of a mitigating factor had been proven. The statements that come closest to such a finding were the following. At the trial, the court remarked that \u201c T feel that the State had its best shot at this trial; and, with all of that, there was a division of six and six. I see no further reason to prolong the Daniels sentencing phase of the trial any further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 400. In its articulation, the court merely reiterated that a jury could reasonably have found the existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>mitigating factor: \u201cIn the context of the statutory definition of mitigating factors, there was sufficient evidence for jurors to come to a reasonable conclusion that there were one or more mitigating factors. In fact, six jurors did.\u201d Indeed the court expressly articulated its intent to exercise its discretion, and emphasized its concern for the futility and expense of another trial, and its adverse impact upon the defendant, the victims\u2019 family, and society. We believe these statements indicate an exercise of discretion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56, rather than an acquittal of the death penalty. In the light of these circumstances, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">We turn, then, to the state\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion was unwarranted as a matter of law. That claim, too, comes to us in two versions: a lack of authority to exercise discretion to dismiss the death penalty phase of a capital felony proceeding, and a misuse of such authority if it existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The state raises a serious question about the applicability of \u00a7 54-56 to the penalty phase of any capital felony prosecution, and particularly about its applicability in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We decline to address this question at this juncture. In <em>Daniels I, </em>our remand for articulation specifically instructed the trial court, that \u201c[i]f the trial court intended to exercise its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to dismiss the death penalty phase of the proceeding and refused to grant a mistrial for this reason, it should say so explicity to provide a basis for review by this court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>[200 Conn. 453, 458-59, 512 A.2d 183 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>(1986)].\u201d <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 402-403. The applicability of \u00a7 54-56 thus impliedly became the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">This court follows the \u201cwell-recognized principle of law that the opinion of an appellate court, so far as it is applicable, establishes the law of the case upon a retrial, and is equally obligatory upon the parties to the action and upon the trial court.\u201d <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>184 Conn. 21, 23, 441 A.2d 49 (1981); see also <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Mossman, </em>91 Conn. 430, 434, 99 A. 1062 (1917). \u201cThe rule is that a determination once made will be treated as correct throughout all subsequent stages of the proceeding except when the question comes before a higher court\u201d; F. James &amp; G. Hazard, Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 1985) \u00a7 11.5, p. 593; and applies both to remands for new trial; <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>supra; <em>Laurel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>173 Conn. 220, 222, 377 A.2d 296 (1977); <em>New Haven Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>83 Conn. 360, 368-69, 76 A. 1100 (1910); and to remands for articulation. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>186 Conn. 8, 9 n.1, 438 A.2d 846 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In accordance with the law of the case doctrine, the trial court\u2019s articulation did not reopen any matters previously decided in our opinion in <em>Daniels I. </em>The trial court\u2019s clarification that it had indeed intended to exercise its discretion in accordance with \u00a7 54-56 therefore does not require us to reconsider its authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We consider finally the question that we did reserve in <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 402-403, whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing a life sentence rather than declaring a mistrial and ordering another death penalty proceeding. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">We announced the applicable test for abuse of the discretion conferred by \u00a7 54-56 in <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>supra, where we held that a trial court\u2019s power to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>miss criminal proceedings \u201cshould be sparingly exercised and then only with great caution and awareness of the probable consequences.\u201d Id., 464. We noted that a proper exercise of discretion involved a balancing process \u201cwhich weighs the interests of the state and society in having the defendant again stand trial against the interest of the defendant ... in not being subjected to a new trial.\u201d Id., 458. \u201c[T]he discretion to be exercised must be informed and guided by considerations of fundamental fairness that are ingrained in the concept of due process of law.\u201d Id., 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The trial court\u2019s comments both at the sentencing stage and in its articulation reveal just such a balancing as <em>Corchado </em>requires. The court\u2019s comments about the unworkability of the statute and the futility of pursuing a second penalty phase, along with its statements about the victims\u2019 family, the inhabitants of the area and the resources of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and the public defender\u2019s office, evidenced its concern for the interests of the state and society. The court manifested its concern for fairness to the defendant in its observation that \u201c[i]n the context of the statutory definition of mitigating factors, there was sufficient evidence for jurors to come to a reasonable conclusion that there were one or more mitigating factors. In fact, six jurors did.\u201d On this record, we are persuaded that \u201cconsiderations of fundamental fairness\u201d guided the trial court and that it weighed properly the separate interests in this case, as mandated by <em>Corchado. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under \u00a7 54-56 in declining to declare a mistrial and in sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendant\u2019s life sentence on the capital felony count was added by the trial court to another term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>life imprisonment on the murder count, and ten years\u2019 imprisonment on the sexual assault count. The defendant\u2019s appeal challenges the dual terms of life imprisonment as a violation of his right against double jeopardy. This issue is one we did not reach in <em>Daniels I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim focuses on the fact that his capital felony conviction was based upon the \u201cmurder of two or more persons [Christine Whipple and Amy Russell] at the same time or in the course of a single transaction.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-54b (8). He maintains that a life sentence for that crime, because it already encompasses the murder of Christine Whipple, cannot constitutionally be combined with another life sentence for his conviction on another count separately charging him with the murder of Christine Whipple. General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-54a. We have recently held, \u201c[i]t is a violation of the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to impose punishment for both the capital felony and the murders that constitute the lesser included offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 145, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, U.S. , 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry, </em>205 Conn. 298, 318, 533 A.2d 212 (1987). Accordingly, the defendant urges us to hold that both convictions cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The defendant\u2019s capital felony conviction necessarily included an underlying finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had committed two murders in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a. The defendant conceded as much in oral argument in this court. Although the double jeopardy principle precludes double punishment for either of the underlying murders, it does not, in our view, preclude the imposition of one life sentence for each of them, when the state has joined a separate count of murder to a count of capital felony. In this case, the murder of Amy Russell was a lesser included offense encompassed within the capital felony conviction. For pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ishment purposes, it was not unconstitutionally duplicitous to join this conviction with the defendant\u2019s separate conviction for the murder of Christine Whipple.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">It is of no moment that the trial court did not expressly explain its imposition of two life sentences as an exercise of its power with respect to lesser included crimes. Once the court concluded that the capital felony conviction should result in a life sentence, it clearly had the authority to reduce the capital felony conviction to that of the lesser included offense of murder, because the defendant was at all times fully aware of his potential liability for that offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 205, 460 A.2d 951 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 421, 423 A.2d 102 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>177 Conn. 140, 147-49, 411 A.2d 917 (1979). We therefore conclude that the court did not err in imposing two life sentences upon the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In this opinion Healey, Glass and Hull, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 53a-46a provides: \u201chearing on imposition OF DEATH PENALTY.

The Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s explanations were ambiguous as to (1) whether it was exercising its discretion to impose a life sentence or (2) believed that it was required to do so as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">\u201cThe trial court was exercising its discretion to impose a life sentence and did not believe it was required to do so as a matter of law. In fact, the trial court had concern as to whether it was in its discretion to impose a life sentence, rather than declare a mistrial. The court had no doubt that it could declare a mistrial. When a jury is hung, it generally follows that the court mandatorily orders a mistrial. The trial court was determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>to resolve the case with finality. This was only the second jury in the penalty phase that was split on the verdict. The other was <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry </em>[205 Conn. 298, 553 A.2d 212 (1987)]. The court merely cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Usry </em>for whatever value that case had as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u201cThe determination by the court to put an end to the Daniels case was based on several considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\u201cFirst and foremost, it was the court\u2019s firm conviction that the death penalty statute was unworkable, particularly based on the evidence adduced at the penalty phase of the trial. In the context of the statutory definition of mitigating factors, there was sufficient evidence for jurors to come to a reasonable conclusion that there were one or more mitigating factors. In fact, six jurors did.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u201cIn addition, a presiding judge at a jury trial does not conduct the trial in an ivory tower. The court was aware that a retrial of the penalty phase would be enormously expensive\u2014and to no avail. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and the public defender\u2019s office spared no expense on the penalty phase hearing, even to the point where the public defender\u2019s office spent money on a lie detector test of the defendant. The court was aware of the fact that family and friends of victims of a serial killer in eastern Connecticut had formed an organization that demanded that state\u2019s attorneys prosecute to the limit in death penalty cases. The court determined that, if it declared a mistrial, the state\u2019s attorney would have to make a choice of retrying the penalty phase (which would have been a quixotic enterprise), or he would be forced to take action to have a life sentence imposed. To have taken the latter action, because of strong feelings generated by the serial killer, he would have been accused of \u2018plea bargaining.\u2019 The awareness of these undercurrents prompted the trial court to comment about the death penalty statute, which comments it later characterized as \u2018gratuitous remarks.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the trial court imposed a life sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b258-7\"> The state argues that General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 does not confer upon a trial court the discretionary power to dismiss the penalty phase of a capital felony prosecution and that such an application of the statute would pose constitutional problems. The state, therefore, urges us to set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment and to remand the case for a new penalty phase hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b262-8\">Shea, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFQ\">concurring. Although I agree with the majority in other respects, I disagree with its failure to address the issue of the applicability of General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to the death penalty phase of a capital felony proceeding. The majority opinion justifies its refusal to resolve this issue upon the doctrine of the law of the case as applied to our remand in <em>Daniels I, </em>which ordered that \u201c[i]f the trial court intended to exercise its authority under General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to dismiss the death penalty phase of the proceeding and refused to grant a mistrial for this reason, it should say so explicitly to provide a basis for review by this court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 402-403, 542 A.2d 306 (1988) <em>(Daniels I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cThe rule of the law of the case is a rule of practice, based upon sound policy that when an issue is once litigated and decided, that should be the end of the matter.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>U. S. Smelting Co., </em>339 U.S. 186, 198, 70 S. Ct. 537, 94 L. Ed. 750, reh. denied, 339 U.S. 972, 70 S. Ct. 994, 94 L. Ed. 1379 (1950). An essential prerequisite to the application of the rule is that the issue must have been decided in the prior litigation. The most meticulous scrutiny of <em>Daniels I </em>does not even intimate that this court has decided whether \u00a7 54-56 was applicable to the death penalty phase of this case. The issue was never raised by counsel in <em>Daniels I </em>and, accordingly, was never briefed. The <em>Daniels I </em>opinion quite properly contains no discussion of its applicability, because it could not be determined from the record before us whether the trial court had intended to dismiss the proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 54-56. At that stage we could not have decided whether \u00a7 54-56 authorized such a dismissal because we could not ascertain whether the trial court had relied on that statute. Our purpose in ordering the remand was to obtain a record for the purpose of reviewing the trial court\u2019s action. For this reason we directed the trial court, if it had relied upon the statute, to \u201csay so explicitly to provide a <em>basis for review </em>by this court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Daniels I, </em>supra, 403. Nowhere in <em>Daniels I </em>is it suggested that our review of the action of the trial court after the remand would be restricted to whether there had been an abuse of discretion in exercising the authority conferred by the statute without consideration of its applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">I agree, nevertheless, with the result reached by the majority, because \u00a7 54-56 expressly declares that the criminal courts of this state \u201cshall at all times have jurisdiction and control over . . . criminal cases pending therein. . . .\u201d In <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>200 Conn. 453, 512 A.2d 183 (1986), this court gave an expansive inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>pretation to the further provision of the statute authorizing the court to \u201cdismiss any information . . . if, in the opinion of the court, there is not sufficient . . . cause to justify ... the placing of the person accused therein on trial.\u201d We held that the trial court had properly concluded that there was a lack of sufficient cause to retry a defendant, following a remand of this court for a new trial, when, by the time the second trial was to begin, the defendant had fully served the sentence originally imposed. Id., 460-61. We concluded that the term \u201ccause\u201d gave the court authority to dismiss where the legitimate interest of the state did not outbalance the \u201cdefendant\u2019s protestations that justice required no more from him than had been exacted.\u201d Id., 463-64. We analogized the authority of a court to dismiss a case under \u00a7 54-56 to the power of a court in New York to dismiss an information \u201c \u2018in the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d Id., 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In my view, \u00a7 54-56 as it previously has been construed by the court and applied by the trial courts is applicable to the penalty phase of a capital felony prosecution. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>13 Conn. Sup. 112 (1944). Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Callahan, J., with whom Covello, J., joins, concurring. I concur in Part I of the majority opinion because of the posture of our remand in <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>207 Conn. 374, 542 A.2d 306 (1988) <em>(Daniels I). </em>Since joining the opinion in <em>Daniels I, </em>however, I have been beset by serious doubts concerning the applicability of General Statutes \u00a7 54-56 to the penalty phase of a capital felony trial. I would, therefore, confine our present holding concerning \u00a7 54-56 to the present case. I agree with Part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
