Kerin, claimed that he was entitled to a decree against Frank J. Stangle, the administrator of the estate of Charles H. Miller, ordering specific performance of an agreement to sell certain of Miller\u2019s real estate located in the town of Bloomfield. The matter was tried to the court, <em>Goldberg, J., </em>which rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the plaintiffs arguments and refused to order specific performance or grant the plaintiff other equitable relief. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The real estate holdings of Charles H. Miller have had a tortuous history of litigation involving not only the property concerned in this action but other properties as well.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts gleaned from the record, however, that are pertinent to a resolution of this appeal, although unusual, are not particularly complex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On November 8,1979, the plaintiff entered into a contract with Harry H. Kleinman,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the duly appointed conservator of the estate of Charles H. Miller, an incapable person. The contract called for the plaintiff to purchase for $62,000, certain land, belonging to Miller, located off Old Windsor Road in the town of Bloomfield. The contract contained a provision that the seller was not obligated thereunder until ten days after the requisite probate approval became final and the probate approval was no longer subject to further proceedings. On November 21,1979, the Probate Court for the district of Hartford approved the sale to the plaintiff for the agreed amount. Subsequently, Beverly Marshall, Miller\u2019s daughter, and Tillie Miller, his wife, appealed the order of the Hartford Probate Court to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 6,1980, after a trial de novo, the Superior Court, <em>Kelly, J., </em>determined that it was in the best interest of the incapable\u2019s estate to sell the property in question for $62,000, and approved the sale at that price. The Superior Court, however, modified the Probate Court decree by ordering that Marshall or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>her designee have until February 29,1980, to purchase the property at the approved figure. Marshall appealed the Superior Court judgment to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On January 19, 1982, in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>186 Conn. 67, 72, 438 A.2d 1199 (1982), we held that the evidence presented at the trial de novo in the Superior Court did not reasonably support the \u201clow valuation\u201d accepted and approved by the Superior Court. Consequently, we set aside the judgment of the Superior Court and ordered a new trial. Id., 73. On February 4,1982, Charles H. Miller died. On September 28, 1982, Frank J. Stangle, the named defendant in this action, was appointed administrator c.t.a., d.b.n. of his estate by the Probate Court for the district of Hartford. On February 15,1983, Marshall and Tillie Miller withdrew the case remanded by this court without a new trial having been held.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On the basis of those facts the plaintiff postulates that the Superior Court judgment that modified the probate decree was \u201cerased\u201d but the probate decree was not. He reasons, therefore, that the original decree of the Probate Court, approving the sale of Miller\u2019s property to him for $62,000, remains in full force and effect. He contends that this decree establishes the necessary probate approval that makes the agreement with Miller\u2019s conservator a binding contract that inures to his benefit against the administrator of Miller\u2019s estate. He claims, therefore, that he is entitled to specific performance of the contract with Miller\u2019s conservator against Miller\u2019s administrator. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">An appeal from a Probate Court to the Superior Court is not an ordinary civil action. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Woodin, </em>90 Conn. 48, 50-51, 96 A. 178 (1915); <em>Silverstein\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>13 Conn. App. 45, 52-53, 534 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>A.2d 1223 (1987). When entertaining an appeal from an order or decree of a Probate Court, the Superior Court takes the place of and sits as the court of probate. <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Rago, </em>186 Conn. 360, 365, 441 A.2d 615 (1982); <em>Stevens\u2019 Appeal, </em>157 Conn. 576, 581, 255 A.2d 632 (1969); <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>97 Conn. 440, 443, 117 A. 504 (1922); <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Woodin, </em>supra, 51; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>84 Conn. 560, 564, 80 A. 718 (1911); <em>Hewitt\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>53 Conn. 24, 35, 1 A. 815 (1885); <em>Davis\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>39 Conn. 395, 400 (1872). In ruling on a probate appeal, the Superior Court exercises the powers, not of a constitutional court of general or common law jurisdiction, but of a Probate Court. <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Woodin, </em>supra; <em>Tolles\u2019s Appeal from Commissioners, </em>54 Conn. 521, 524, 9 A. 403 (1886); <em>Silverstein\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The function of the Superior Court in appeals from a Probate Court is to take jurisdiction of the order or decree appealed from and to try that issue de novo. <em>Baskin\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>194 Conn. 635, 641, 484 A.2d 934 (1984); <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Rago, </em>supra, 364-65; <em>Stevens\u2019 Appeal, </em>supra, 580-81; <em>Hotchkiss\u2019 Appeal, </em>89 Conn. 420, 432, 95 A. 26 (1915); <em>Silverstein\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>supra, 54. Thereafter, upon \u201cconsideration of all evidence presented on the appeal which would have been admissible in the probate court, the superior court should exercise the same power of judgment which the probate court possessed and decide the appeal as an original proposition unfettered by, and ignoring, the result reached in the probate court.\u201d <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Sheffield, </em>158 Conn. 286, 298, 259 A.2d 621 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Despite these accepted principles concerning the role of the Superior Court vis-a-vis a probate appeal, the plaintiff would have us afford a probate decree some continued vitality after the entry of a judgment in the Superior Court. He opts for a result which would leave the original probate decree standing in the wings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the event that something goes awry with the Superior Court judgment. We believe that in espousing that position the plaintiff misreads the cases dealing with probate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It is true that the mere taking of an appeal from a probate decree does not in and of itself vacate or suspend the decree. <em>Silverstone </em>v. <em>Lillie, </em>141 Conn. 104, 107, 103 A.2d 915 (1954); <em>White </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>75 Conn. 308, 312, 53 A. 654 (1902). As noted in <em>Livingston\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>63 Conn. 68, 75, 26 A. 470 (1893), \u201c[i]f the appeal had been withdrawn or dismissed in the Superior Court . . . the [probate] decree would have remained valid . . . .\u201d See also <em>Silverstone </em>v. <em>Lillie, </em>supra, 107; <em>Merrells </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>34 Conn. 109, 112 (1867). That is, the probate decree appealed from continues \u201cin full force\u201d until the appellate tribunal otherwise determines. <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co., </em>105 Conn. 595, 603, 136 A. 111 (1927); <em>Dickinson\u2019s Appeal from Probate, </em>54 Conn. 224, 231, 6 A. 422 (1886). But once the appellate tribunal, i.e., the Superior Court, otherwise determines and either modifies or sets aside the decree of the Probate Court, the probate decree is superseded. <em>Satti </em>v. <em>Rago, </em>supra, 365; <em>Stevens\u2019 Appeal, </em>supra, 581; <em>Hirsch </em>v. <em>Braceland, </em>144 Conn. 464, 469, 133 A.2d 898 (1957); <em>Silverstone </em>v. <em>Lillie, supra; Avery\u2019s Appeal, </em>117 Conn. 201, 205, 167 A. 544 (1933); <em>White </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Sans a withdrawal or a dismissal, we think logic requires that conclusion. We hold, therefore, that once a probate appeal is heard and a judgment rendered in the Superior Court, the Superior Court judgment supplants the probate decree or order. Otherwise, there would arise the incongruous situation of the simultaneous existence of two valid judgments on the same issue, emanating from, what is in effect, the same court exercising the same powers, with one of the judgments held in reserve awaiting developments on the other. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>refuse to countenance such a result. The finding of error and the remand by this court in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>supra, and the subsequent withdrawal of that action prior to a new trial in the Superior Court did not reinstate the decree of the Hartford Probate Court authorizing the sale of Miller\u2019s land to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The reversal of the Superior Court in that case did, however, vitiate the judgment of the Superior Court from which Marshall appealed. \u201cWhere this court finds error upon the appeal and remands the case to be proceeded with according to law, the efficacy of the judgment rendered upon the original trial is <em>destroyed </em>and a new trial of all the issues in the case is required.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Wendland </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Construction Services, Inc., </em>190 Conn. 791, 796-97, 462 A.2d 1043 (1983); see also <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>v. <em>Police Commission, </em>4 Conn. App. 196, 197-98, 493 A.2d 270 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Unfortunately, however, shortly after the publication of our opinion in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>supra, and before a new trial could be conducted, the incapable, Miller, departed this vale of tears. Miller\u2019s death left his conservator, against whom the remanded appeal was pending, without a ward. That unique state of affairs rendered the remanded probate appeal moot. That conclusion is inevitable since Miller\u2019s death terminated the conservatorship; General Statutes \u00a7 45-77;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>Kleinman </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>192 Conn. 479, 483, 472 A.2d 772 (1984); and title to the real estate in question passed to Miller\u2019s heirs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was, therefore, no conservator against whom the appeal could proceed and no real estate for the conservator to sell even if the appeal could somehow have continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The upshot of the events that have transpired since the plaintiff first negotiated a contract with Miller\u2019s conservator is that there exists no probate approval for the sale of the real estate to him by the conservator. Nor is it possible at this time to obtain such an approval. Since probate approval is an express precondition of a binding obligation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the trial court did not err in denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for specific performance or other equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> See <em>Kleinman </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>192 Conn. 479, 472 A.2d 772 (1984); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>186 Conn. 67, 438 A.2d 1199 (1982); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Kleinman, </em>186 Conn. 63, 438 A.2d 1196 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> The facts were stipulated.
