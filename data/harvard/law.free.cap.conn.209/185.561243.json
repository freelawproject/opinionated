The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in refusing to consider their claim, first articulated during final argument, that the mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid because the underlying home improvement agreement was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>in writing as required by the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-429.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On June 2,1987, the defendant filed a mechanic\u2019s lien on the plaintiffs\u2019 property located on Linwold Drive in West Hartford. On June 9,1987, the plaintiffs filed an application to discharge the mechanic\u2019s lien with the trial court. The application conformed to the format set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not refer to the Home Improvement Act in their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">From June 22 through June 25,1987, the trial court held a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application to discharge the lien. During the hearing, brief testimony was elicited from one witness that the parties\u2019 home improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ment agreement was not in writing. The plaintiffs, however, did not refer to the Home Improvement Act during the evidentiary phase of the hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, during final argument, the plaintiffs raised the claim that the lien was invalid under the Home Improvement Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that the act was not in issue and declined to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. On the basis of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-35a and 49-35b,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court reduced but did not discharge the mechanic\u2019s lien. On October 21,1987, the court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reargue. The plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and the appeal was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The dispositive issue in this case is whether the plaintiffs sufficiently raised the Home Improvement Act to place it in issue at the hearing. The plaintiffs argue that they could not refer to the act in their application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>because \u00a7 49-35a (b) prescribes a \u201cboiler plate\u201d form for lien discharge applications, which cannot be varied by different or additional terms. As a consequence, they contend that the trial court erred when it declined to consider their claim when raised during final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Even assuming that \u00a7 49-35a (b) precluded the plaintiffs from raising the Home Improvement Act in their application, Practice Book \u00a7 285A nevertheless required the plaintiffs to state the claim distinctly. The plaintiffs do not suggest that \u00a7 49-35a (b) overrides the requirement that a claim be distinctly stated to the trial court. Because we conclude that the plaintiffs failed distinctly to raise the act as required by Practice Book \u00a7 285A, we do not address their contention that the statutory form of \u00a7 49-35a (b) excused them from raising the claim in their pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 285A provides that \u201c[i]f a party intends to raise any claim of law which may be the subject of an appeal, he must either state the same distinctly to the court before his argument is closed or state it in a written trial brief. If this is not done, it will not be the duty of either the trial court or the appellate court to decide the claim.\u201d See also Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (supreme court not bound to consider claim unless it was distinctly raised at trial or arose subsequent to trial). A claim is \u201cdistinctly\u201d raised if it is \u201c \u2018 \u201cso stated as to bring to the attention of the court the precise matter on which its decision is being asked.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Utz, </em>201 Conn. 190, 207, 513 A.2d 1191 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>198 Conn. 386, 396, 503 A.2d 576 (1986); <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>75 Conn. 679, 682, 55 A. 167 (1903). A claim \u201cbriefly suggested\u201d is not \u201cdistinctly raised.\u201d <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Caldor, Inc., </em>183 Conn. 164, 166, 438 A.2d 865 (1981); <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>168 Conn. 160, 177, 363 A.2d 22 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>It is well established that the trial court is entitled to decide a case on the theory on which it was tried. <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra, 176-77; <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Pezenik, </em>137 Conn. 442, 448, 78 A.2d 546 (1951); see also <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>197 Conn. 189, 196, 496 A.2d 491 (1985) (cases reviewed on appeal on theory on which they were tried and decided at trial); <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>137 Conn. 616, 618, 79 A.2d 819 (1951) (party cannot try case on one theory and appeal on other); <em>Fischer Co. </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>137 Conn. 399, 404, 78 A.2d 242 (1951). The purpose of the Practice Book rules requiring claims to be raised distinctly is to enable the trial court to give meaningful consideration to the legal issues in the case. See, e.g., <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505 n.14, 442 A.2d 911 (1982) (trial court\u2019s failure to consider claim vaguely alluded to in complaint but not made in trial briefs or in argument not subject to review); <em>Tragakiss </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>183 Conn. 72, 75-76, 438 A.2d 818 (1981) (no error where trial court refused to rule on defenses where evidence to show defenses raised consisted of draft finding and assignment of errors); cf. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 101, 444 A.2d 907 (1982) (where complaint drafted without setting forth facts that would call trial court\u2019s attention to search for other grounds of relief, this court will not consider such grounds on appeal); <em>Rybinski </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>173 Conn. 462, 465, 378 A.2d 547 (1977) (claim not reviewed on appeal where trial court had no opportunity to consider it). The requirement that claims be raised timely and distinctly also recognizes that counsel should not have the opportunity to surprise an opponent by interjecting a claim when opposing counsel is no longer in a position to present evidence against such a claim. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 566, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982) (per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>mitting claims of error that could have been raised at trial to be raised first time on appeal encourages trials by ambuscade).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The plaintiffs in the present case did not distinctly raise their claim that the mechanic\u2019s lien was invalid under the Home Improvement Act. Practice Book \u00a7 285A; see <em>Frigon </em>v. <em>Enfield Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>195 Conn. 82, 89, 486 A.2d 630 (1985) (plaintiff did not distinctly raise claim at trial where he failed to explore factual ambiguity despite chance to do so); <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 505 n.14; <em>Tragakiss </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>supra, 75-76. The plaintiffs concede that they did not refer to the act at any time prior to final argument. As the plaintiffs acknowledge, regardless of whether the language of \u00a7 49-35a (b) excused them from specifically pleading the act\u2019s applicability, nothing prevented them from asserting the act during the evidentiary phase of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We are not persuaded that the reference to the Home Improvement Act during the plaintiffs\u2019 final argument following incidental testimony pertaining to the nonexistence of a written contract \u201cdistinctly raised\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Cf. <em>Frigon </em>v. <em>Enfield Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>supra, 89. A review of the transcripts of the hearing indicates that the plaintiffs challenged the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien on a breach of contract theory with evidence that the defendant performed unsatisfactory work, did not follow instructions, grossly exceeded its estimate for the cost of the job, and charged the plaintiffs for redoing improperly completed work. The trial court was entitled to decide the case on the theory upon which it had been tried. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Pezenik, </em>supra, 448. The court was not obligated at the trial\u2019s conclusion to reverse gears and reevaluate the case in light of a claim that bore only a tenuous relationship to the legal claims and evidence presented during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Further, we note that the plaintiffs stated during final argument that they became aware of the Home Improvement Act in April, 1987, several weeks before the hearing. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs proceeded to trial and never mentioned the act until final argument. Even assuming, arguendo, that the trial court otherwise should have considered the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, we find particularly appropriate to this case the principle that an appellant should not be allowed to claim as error that which his own action has induced. <em>Valley </em>v. <em>Fazzina, </em>187 Conn. 423, 428, 446 A.2d 1068 (1982); <em>Busko </em>v. <em>DeFilippo, </em>162 Conn. 462, 469, 294 A.2d 510 (1972); <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>Zion Baptist Church, Inc., </em>143 Conn. 90, 97-98, 119 A.2d 736 (1956); <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Popilowski, </em>139 Conn. 84, 87-88, 90 A.2d 167 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\"> See generally the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq. The particular section relied on by the plaintiffs, General Statutes \u00a7 20-429, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) No home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and unless it contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"> The relevant part of General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">\u201c(b) The application, order and summons shall be substantially in the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">APPLICATION FOE DISCHAEGE OE EEDUCTION OF MECHANIC\u2019S LIEN</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">To the . . .
