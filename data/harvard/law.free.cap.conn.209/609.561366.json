App. 400, 536 A.2d 995 (1988). We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed. On July 15, 1986, the plaintiff, Nancy Burton, appealed to the Superior Court from a decision of the named defendant, the planning commission of the town of Redding, approving the application of the codefendant, James E. McMurray, to subdivide his property. The plaintiff, who was not a party in the proceeding before the planning commission, claimed to be aggrieved by its decision and sought to intervene pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>On July 21,1986, McMurray filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs action, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 143,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> accompanied by an affidavit and memorandum of law in support of his motion. In his motion, McMurray claimed that the plaintiff was not aggrieved and, therefore, lacked standing to appeal the commmission\u2019s decision and to intervene. General Statutes \u00a7 8-28 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The motion to dismiss was originally scheduled to be heard at short calendar on Monday, September 22,1986. The plaintiff<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and counsel for McMurray agreed to postpone the matter due to a scheduling conflict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The matter was then reassigned to be heard on Monday, September 29, 1986. On Thursday, September 25, 1986, four days before the scheduled hearing on the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">At the September 29, 1986 hearing, McMurray informed the trial court, <em>William J. Sullivan, J., </em>that the plaintiffs memorandum of law in opposition to the motion to dismiss was filed four days, rather than five days, prior to the hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court thereafter rendered judgment dismissing the case, observing that the plaintiff was one day late in filing the memorandum of law as required by Practice Book \u00a7 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 143 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an adverse party objects to this motion [to dismiss] he shall, <em>at least five days before </em>the motion is to be considered on the short calendar, file and serve in accordance with [Practice Book] Sec. 120 a memorandum of law .... An adverse party who fails timely to file such a memorandum pursuant to this section shall be deemed by the court to have consented to the granting of the motion.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In order to determine the correctness of the Appellate Court\u2019s decision we address two questions. First, was the plaintiff\u2019s memorandum of law timely filed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 143? If the answer to that question is \u201cno\u201d we must then determine if the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case was required under \u00a7 143. The Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s memorandum was not filed in a timely manner and that \u00a7 143 requires the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The plaintiff concedes that her memorandum of law was filed in court one day late. She argues, however, that she substantially complied with the requirements of \u00a7 143 by filing the memorandum within four days of the hearing, mailing copies to opposing counsel, and hand delivering additional copies to opposing counsel\u2019s office on Friday, September, 26,1986. We are not persuaded. The question presented is not whether the plaintiff <em>substantially </em>complied with \u00a7 143 but rather whether she <em>in fact </em>complied with its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">It is clear that the plaintiff did not timely file her memorandum of law as required by \u00a7 143. Had the plaintiff moved for, and been granted a continuance pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 209, however, her memorandum of law, filed on Thursday, September 25, would have been filed \u201cat least five days before the motion is to be considered on the short calendar.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 143. Although the plaintiff had used Practice Book \u00a7 209 to her advantage the previous week, when she and McMurray\u2019s counsel agreed to have the hearing continued, it is important to note that she did not seek a continuance on Monday, September 29, 1986. See Practice Book \u00a7 209. Under the factual circumstances presented here our conclusion is inescapable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Thursday, September 25, 1986, is four days before Monday, September 29,1986, and, therefore, the plaintiff did not file her memorandum of law in a timely manner as required by \u00a7 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The plaintiff argues that, nevertheless, the trial court erred in granting McMurray\u2019s motion to dismiss the case. We disagree and conclude that the Appellate Court correctly determined that the trial court\u2019s action was required by \u00a7 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>200 Conn. 400, 510 A.2d 992 (1986), we analyzed Practice Book \u00a7 155 which, like \u00a7 143, contains a provision that provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an adverse party objects to this motion he shall, at least five days before the date the motion is to be considered on the short calendar, file ... a memorandum of law. An adverse party who fails timely to file such a memorandum pursuant to this section shall be deemed by the court to have consented to the granting of the motion.\u201d We interpreted this language and concluded that \u201c[t]he memorandum must be filed, or the motion . . . shall be granted.\u201d <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em>supra, 402-403. The plaintiff urges us to find that <em>Hughes </em>is not controlling in this situation despite the fact that the language in \u00a7 155 is identical to the language in \u00a7 143. We see no reason why our analysis in <em>Hughes </em>is not equally applicable in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The plaintiff points to <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 287, 524 A.2d 629 (1987), in support of her claim that dismissal under \u00a7 143 is not required. In <em>Pepe </em>we examined Practice Book \u00a7 380, which states in relevant part: \u201cThe adverse party prior to the day the case is set down for short calendar <em>shall </em>file opposing affidavits and other available documentary evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We \u201cdecline[d] to construe such language as a jurisdictional barrier that the parties cannot waive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>or the court may not excuse under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britian, </em>supra, 288. There is, however, a critical factor that distinguishes <em>Pepe </em>from the case at hand. Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 143 and 155, \u00a7 380 does not contain language which provides a sanction for failure to file timely the necessary documents. In <em>Pepe </em>we concluded that \u201c[although \u00a7 380 declares that materials in opposition to a motion for summary judgment \u2018shall\u2019 be filed the day before the hearing, it does not contain any provision corresponding to the dictate of \u00a7 155 that the consequence of noncompliance with the rule is that the delinquent party \u2018shall be deemed by the court to have consented to the granting of the motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>supra, 287. Therefore, the dismissal of this case was appropriate not simply because the language in \u00a7 143 dictates that a memorandum must be filed but because, along with that dictate, the rule contains a sanction for failure to comply with that provison.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 143 requires a \u201cdraconian\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> application of the rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. Practice Book \u00a7 6 provides: \u201cThe design of these rules being to facilitate business and advance justice, they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict adherence to them will work surprise or injustice.\u201d This provision, along with \u00a7 209, make it clear that the \u201cdraconian\u201d application to which the plaintiff refers is not the necessary outcome of the application of \u00a7 143. In circumstances similar to these, the trial court, upon request, may grant the parties a continuance for good cause shown pursuant to \u00a7 209. Therefore, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>tiffs claim that the result will be universally harsh is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We are acutely aware that this case presents the tension that exists between the deprivation of an individual\u2019s right to defend a motion to dismiss and the overriding concern that the great number of cases before our courts be kept moving efficiently through the judicial system. \u201cOvercrowded dockets have become a major problem challenging the ability of the courts of this state and elsewhere to dispense justice. . . . In order to fulfill our responsibility of dispensing justice we in the judiciary must adopt an effective system of caseflow management. Caseflow management is based upon the premise that it is the responsibility of the court to establish standards for the processing of cases and also, when necesssary, to enforce compliance with such standards.\u201d <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 690-91, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983). It is an inherent power of the court \u201c \u2018to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions to compel the observance of its rules.\u2019 \u201d Id., 690. Not only was the sanction used in this case reasonable, it was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">We affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

The needlessly unjust outcome of this appeal, in which the plaintiff has been deprived of a resolution of her claim on its merits because she was one day late in filing a memorandum of law in opposition to a motion to dismiss, is another episode in the draconian enforcement of the \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to the granting of the motion\u201d provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 143 with regard to motions to dismiss and Practice Book \u00a7 155 with regard to motions to strike. We began this saga with <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Bemer, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>200 Conn. 400, 510 A.2d 992 (1986), in which the failure of the plaintiff to file a memorandum in opposition to a motion to strike pursuant to \u00a7 155 was held to preclude consideration of the substantive issue of the viability of the complaint on its merits, despite the fact that noncompliance with the rule had never been raised in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">In the present appeal it cannot be said that noncompliance with the time limit for filing a memorandum opposing the motion to dismiss pursuant to \u00a7 143 has been waived, since it was clearly raised at the hearing on the motion. The trial court, however, construed the applicable precedent of <em>Hughes </em>to afford no room for the exercise of reasonable discretion. Under this pettifogging view of our procedural rules, such circumstances as the lack of any prejudice to the defendants, who apparently received hand delivered copies of the memorandum no later than if they had been mailed five days before the hearing, as \u00a7 143 requires, must be disregarded for the sake of \u201ccaseflow management.\u201d The majority opinion attempts to justify this approach as advancing that goal of judicial administration without explaining how the delay of one day in filing the plaintiff\u2019s memorandum in the clerk\u2019s office in any manner has or could have affected the expeditious disposition of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The opinion also overlooks the fact that such dismissals are likely to generate additional litigation in the form of malpractice suits, though not in this case where the plaintiff in the trial court acted as her own counsel. Furthermore, its suggestion of a continuance as the remedy to alleviate the harshness of the rule is hardly consistent with the \u201ccaseflow management\u201d objective of reducing unnecessary delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u201cThe design of these rules being to facilitate business and advance justice, they will be interpreted liberally in any case where it shall be manifest that a strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>adherence to them will work surprise or <em>injustice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 6, 4187.1 cannot reconcile this guiding principle for the application of our rules of practice with affirmance by the majority of the dismissal of this complaint without consideration of its merits for a minimal lack of timeliness resulting in neither prejudice nor actual delay. It is the entire judicial system, not just the plaintiff, that suffers when a case fails to be resolved upon substantive grounds because of a procedural deficiency so trivial and inconsequential as in this case. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Berner, </em>supra, 405 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We merely invite legislative intervention in the rule making process when our rules of practice are applied in such a manner that litigants are needlessly thwarted in obtaining a determination of their claims on the merits. See <em>Andrew Ansaldi Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>207 Conn. 67, 75-76, 570 A.2d 59 (1988) <em>(Shea, J., </em>concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
