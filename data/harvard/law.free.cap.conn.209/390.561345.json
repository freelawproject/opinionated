J.</author>\n<p id=\"AD3\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether income \u201cavailable\u201d to an institutionalized incompetent for medicaid eligibility purposes includes an amount a Probate Court has ordered the incompetent to pay his at-home spouse. The plaintiff, Louise Clark, conservatrix for her husband Wilbur Clark, brought an adminstrative appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming that the defendant, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>missioner of income maintenance, had awarded Wilbur Clark insufficient medicaid support by not excluding from his \u201cavailable\u201d income the amount that the Probate Court had ordered him to pay her in spousal support. The Fair Hearing Officer (FHO) upheld the defendant\u2019s ruling. The trial court, however, sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal holding that the defendant should have excluded the amount of the spousal support award from Wilbur Clark\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the case to ourselves pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. Wilbur Clark is an elderly, incompetent, nursing home resident for whom his wife, the plaintiff, serves as conservatrix. On May 29,1984, the plaintiff, as spouse, applied to the Probate Court for a $340 per month allowance from her husband\u2019s estate. The plaintiff, as conservatrix, did not object to her own application and the Probate Court, on June 22, 1984, granted her a $460 per month allowance from the estate principal, an amount $120 more per month than she had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>On October 4, 1984, the plaintiff, on her husband\u2019s behalf, applied to the defendant for Title XIX medicaid assistance, which the defendant granted effective retroactively to July 1, 1984. In determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility, the defendant found that he received $629.60 per month from social security and $698 per month from a Teamster\u2019s pension, for a monthly income of $1327.60, a figure that neither party disputes. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382a (a) (2) (B); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1121 (a). The defendant wrote to the plaintiff several times asking for her own asset information to determine whether any of Wilbur Clark\u2019s income should be diverted to her to meet her maintenance needs. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 (c). The plaintiff never responded, believing she had no such obligation as she had not applied for medicaid herself. The defendant therefore awarded benefits to Wilbur Clark based on $1327.60 per month of \u201cavailable\u201d income.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The plaintiff disputed the defendant\u2019s award to the incompetent and requested a fair hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a. The FHO upheld the defendant\u2019s award, also finding $1327.60 per month \u201cavailable\u201d to Wilbur Clark and ruling that the defendant need not consider the Probate Court award in determining his \u201cavailable\u201d income.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The trial court then sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the FHO\u2019s decision. It held that no state statute or regulation mandated that the defendant, in calculating an applicant\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income, must disregard court orders requiring the applicant to pay sums to a third party and that the defendant had, therefore, acted illegally in calculating Wilbur Clark\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>income. The court remanded the case to the defendant to redetermine the applicant\u2019s eligibility. The defendant appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The federal medicaid program, established by Congress in 1965, \u201cprovid[es] federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.\u201d <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.

Although states participate voluntarily, a state electing to participate must develop a plan, approved by the secretary of health and human services, containing \u201creasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance . . . . \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All participating states must provide coverage to \u201cthe categorically needy\u201d: dependent children, the aged, the blind and the disabled who qualify for welfare assistance under the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381 through 1383; or, upon the election of the state, under a more restrictive standard in place before 1972. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (f).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> States are also afforded the option of cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>ing the \u201coptionally categorically needy\u201d: individuals who are financially ineligible for SSI, but eligible for, or a recipient of, optional state supplementation to SSI. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) (A). Finally, states may also, at their option, provide assistance to the \u201cmedically needy\u201d: those whose resources are sufficient to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>their ordinary living expenses, but not their medical care. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) (C); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.300 through 435.340.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Connecticut has elected to cover the \u201coptionally categorically needy\u201d and the \u201cmedically needy,\u201d as well as the \u201ccategorically needy.\u201d The plaintiff has applied for benefits on her husband\u2019s behalf under the \u201cmedically needy\u201d option. Applicants qualify for assistance as \u201cmedically needy\u201d if they incur medical expenses to an extent that reduces their income to the established eligibility level. These persons must first \u201cspenddown\u201d their \u201cavailable\u201d income on their medical care expenses to the eligibility level, with the medicaid program covering the unpaid balance. Thus, the lower the amount of income an applicant is deemed to have \u201cavailable,\u201d the less he must \u201cspenddown\u201d to qualify for assistance. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.301; <em>see Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 154, 158, 106 S. Ct. 2456, 91 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1986).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The legislature, by General Statutes \u00a7 17-134a,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has authorized the commissioner of income maintenance to administer Connecticut\u2019s medicaid program. Our statutes further provide that \u201c[a]ll of the provisions of this chapter are extended to the medical assistance program except such provisions as are inconsistent with federal law and regulations governing Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 and this part.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17-134e. \u201cThus, the legislature recognized the primacy of the applicable federal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>visions and, this court must be guided by those provisions. Stated in another way, the federal statutes and regulations set a limit Upon the authority of the commissioner as well as furnishing a guide to his administration of the program.\u201d <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 336, 343-44, 362 A.2d 505 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for medicaid benefits, the commissioner may take \u201cinto account only such income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary [of health and human services], <em>available </em>to the applicant or recipient . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B). The plaintiff contends that the Probate Court order for her to pay herself $460 of Wilbur Clark\u2019s monthly income compels the defendant to exclude that amount from Wilbur Clark\u2019s total income in determining his medicaid eligibility. She suggests that such an exclusion is required in order to give proper legal effect to a valid Probate Court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In our view, the plaintiff misconstrues the issue in this case. The Probate Court undoubtedly has the authority to enter an enforceable spousal support order. General Statutes \u00a7 45-75 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case, however, concerns whether the defendant must consider that court order in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for the federally funded medicaid program. We hold that he need not, indeed that he cannot.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>\u201cCongress explicitly delegated to the Secretary broad authority to promulgate regulations defining eligibility requirements for Medicaid.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 35, 43, 101 S. Ct. 2633, 69 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1981). \u201cIn view of this explicit delegation of substantive authority, the Secretary\u2019s definition of the term \u2018available\u2019 is \u2018entitled to more than mere deference or weight.\u2019 . . . Rather, the Secretary\u2019s definition is entitled to \u2018legislative effect\u2019 because, \u2018[i]n a situation of this kind, Congress entrusts to the Secretary, rather than to the courts, the primary responsibility for interpreting the statutory term.\u2019 \u201d Id., 44, quoting <em>Batterton </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425-26, 97 S.

Paragraph (c) specifically lists only four amounts an agency may deduct from a \u201cmedically needy\u201d applicant\u2019s total income: (1) a personal needs allowance; (2) an at-home spousal allowance; (3) an at-home family allowance; and (4) medical or remedial expenses not paid by third parties. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 (c);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see <em>Mattingly by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>Mattingly </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>784 F.2d 258, 266 (7th Cir. 1986); <em>Florence Nightingale Nursing Home </em>v. <em>Perales, </em>782 F.2d 26, 29 (2d Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 815, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>107 S.

We agree with the defendant. The principle of availability<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201chas served primarily to prevent the States from conjuring fictional sources of income and resources by imputing financial support from persons who have no obligation to furnish it or by overvaluing assets in a manner that attributes nonexistent resources to recipients.\u201d <em>Heckler </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>470 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>184, 200, 105 S. Ct. 1138, 84 L. Ed. 2d 138 (1985) (holding that mandatory tax withholdings are \u201cavailable\u201d for social security purposes); see also <em>Wilczynski </em>v. <em>Harder, </em>323 F. Sup. 509, 517 (D. Conn. 1971) (the cash value, not the face value, of an insurance policy is \u201cavailable\u201d for SSI). Thus, just as under SSI an agency includes, as \u201cavailable,\u201d amounts garnished from an applicant\u2019s wages or withheld for other obligations; see 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1123 (b) (2);<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> so the concept of \u201cavailable\u201d income excludes imputed income that an applicant has not actually received, but does not require a state to exclude the amount of an applicant\u2019s other obligations. Under SSI the individual\u2019s needs come first, followed by those of his dependents and creditors. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2040. Because the secretary\u2019s regulations, to which courts must accord \u201c \u2018legislative effect\u2019 \u201d; <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>supra, 44; already provide for an agency determined spousal support exclusion, but do not provide for court ordered exclusions, the defendant correctly calculated Wilbur Clark\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d monthly income as $1327.60, and the trial court erred in directing the defendant to exclude $460 per month from his \u201cavailable\u201d income.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The Georgia Court of Appeals, in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>179 Ga. App. 708, 347 S.E.2d 643, cert. granted, 354 S.E.2d 156 (1986),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> reached a similar conclusion with regard to court awarded alimony. In that case a court had ordered a medicaid applicant, whose sole income was a social security check, to pay alimony to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>his ex-wife. In determining his \u201cavailable\u201d income, the state medicaid agency did not deduct his alimony obligation from his total income. On appeal the court upheld the agency\u2019s construction of the statute, holding that it could only deduct the items listed in the federal regulations, here 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.725 (c). Id., 710.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The policy underlying today\u2019s decision reflects the legislative concern that the medicaid program would be at fiscal risk if applicants were permitted to divert income in ways not sanctioned by law. Our recent Title XIX cases have recognized the importance of this policy; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>204 Conn. 672, 529 A.2d 188 (1987) (assets from a transfer made in order to qualify for medicaid are \u201cavailable\u201d to the transferor); <em>Marcus\u2019 Appeal from Probate, </em>supra (unauthorized gifts by a conservator of an estate are \u201cavailable\u201d to the ward); and the present case illustrates the reasonableness of the legislative restrictions on \u201cavailable\u201d income. Federal regulations provide for an exclusion from \u201cavailable\u201d income for at-home spousal support \u201cbased on a reasonable assessment of need but <em>must not exceed </em>the highest of\u201d three standards. (Emphasis added.) 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 (c) (2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>resents, and the plaintiff has not disputed, that Connecticut has adopted the most generous of the three standards. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 (c) (2) (iii). That exclusion is, nonetheless, limited because \u201cCongress chose to direct those limited funds to persons who were most impoverished . . . . \u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>457 U.S. 569, 590, 102 S. Ct. 2597, 73 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1982). Because the plaintiff elected not to provide relevant income information, the defendant was unable to determine the extent, as limited by federal law, to which he could exclude an amount for spousal support from Wilbur Clark\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u201cWe are not without sympathy for those with minimal resources for medical care. But our \u2018sympathy is an insufficient basis for approving a recovery\u2019 based on a theory inconsistent with law.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>supra, 48-49, quoting <em>Potomac Electric Power Co. </em>v. <em>Director, OWCP, </em>449 U.S. 268, 284, 101 S. Ct. 509, 66 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1980). A reviewing court \u201cmay not ignore federal regulations simply because it interprets \u00a7 1902 (a) (17) [of the Social Security Act] in a manner it considers preferable to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>Herweg </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>supra, 277. Our appellate review in this case is limited to determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>whether the defendant correctly applied the regulations promulgated by the secretary.

In States which do not provide medical assistance to indviduals pursuant to clause (10) (C) of that subsection, an individual who is eligible for medical assistance by reason of the requirements of this section concerning the deduction of incurred medical expenses from income shall be considered an individual eligible for medical assistance under clause (10) (A) of that subsection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Congress enacted this section, called the \u201c209 (b) option,\u201d in order to encourage states to continue participating in the program.

She notes that the defendant is apparently inconsistent in adopting some Probate Court orders and rejecting others. In <em>Marcus\u2019Appeal from Probate </em>the department of income maintenance sought to rely on a Probate Court order disallowing certain gifts made by the conservatrices for a medicaid applicant. We agreed with the department that the amount of the gifts, because they had been disallowed, were \u201cavailable\u201d to the applicant. In <em>Zeoli </em>we interpreted the terms of a spendthrift trust to exclude certain assets from being \u201cavailable\u201d for medicaid eligibility purposes. The issue in this case is different, however, because no Probate Court order can supersede federal law, which requires that an \u201cagency <em>must </em>reduce its payment to an institution\u201d to a certain level.

Nothing before us indicates that the state has chosen to do so and, further, given the mandate of \u00a7 435.832 (a), we doubt whether the state has an option to broaden permissible exclusions from an applicant\u2019s income.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b425-7\"> This court and others, in addressing \u201cavailable\u201d income, have referred to the concept of \u201cactual\u201d availability.

Indeed, the defendant admits that this is the only case decided contrary to his position, but submits that the court decided the case erroneously. Without passing on whether the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals correctly decided the case, we note that it is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In that case, the state of California submitted to the secretary a plan, California Plan Amendment 84-24, that proposed to treat court-ordered spousal and child support payments as \u201cunavailable\u201d to a medicaid recipient. Id., 326. The secretary disapproved the plan but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the secretary\u2019s position, that the court-ordered funds were \u201cavailable,\u201d was arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion. Nowhere in the case, however, did the Court of Appeals refer to 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832, the regulation upon which we decide this case. Apparently either the secretary did not raise the issue, or the court did not consider it. In any case, we are convinced that 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\"> See footnote 9, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> The defendant represents that he was perfectly willing to allow a spousal support exclusion, but that $460 per month was more than he would, indeed could, allow under federal law. The plaintiff has not argued to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The plaintiff does argue that the defendant could have intervened as an interested party, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45-75 (c), to protect its interests. At the time of the proceedings, however, the defendant had no reason to intervene as Wilbur Clark had not yet applied for medicaid. Arguably the defendant could have moved to modify the probate court order if, after Wilbur Clark applied for medicaid, he thought the probate court\u2019s support order too high. Yet, by such a modification the defendant could not retrieve the amount he had paid out in the interim. Further we question the need to force the defendant to collaterally attack such court orders, especially when the defendant has his own federally mandated mechanism for determining at-home spousal support. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.832 (c) (2); see footnote 17, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
