We find error in the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Examination of the record discloses that the plaintiff, Robert V. DuBaldo, is a principal in the firm of DuBaldo Electric Company, Inc., a non-union electrical contractor. The plaintiff has held an unlimited electrical contractor\u2019s license since 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">On June 20,1983, a representative of the department of consumer protection (DCP) inspected the plaintiff\u2019s job site in Plainfield, and found that electrical work was being done by four men, one with an E-2 electrical license and three who were registered with the labor department as apprentices. On December 16,1983, the DCP issued a complaint alleging that the plaintiff had permitted apprentices to perform electrical work without the direct supervision of the required number of licensed electrical contractors or journeymen as required by the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies that deal with the licensing of electrical contractors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff denied these allegations and a hearing was held before the state electrical work examining board.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">On April 24,1984, the board found that the plaintiff had violated \u00a7 20-332-15 of the agency regulations and ordered that the plaintiff\u2019s license be suspended for ninety days. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Superior Court. On March 25,1988, the trial court rendered judgment dismissing the appeal. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Appellate Court and on August 3, 1988, this court transferred the appeal to itself pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred by failing to conclude: (1) that the board was improperly constituted as required by its enabling legislation, General Statutes \u00a7 20-331; (2) that the statutory penalties provisions, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-9 (c) and 21a-7 (7), and the participation of union officials as board members violated federal and state due process standards; (3) that the penalty which the board imposed was arbitrary and capricious and its application of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-9 (c) and 21a-7 (7) was unconstitutional; (4) that the board\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous; (5) that the board\u2019s chairman improperly participated in the decision; and (6) that the board\u2019s actions were invalid because a quorum was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the board, as constituted, did not comply with the requirements of \u00a7 20-331, and therefore its decision was invalid.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">At the time of the hearing, \u00a7 20-331 required that \u201c[ejach such board . . . shall consist of seven members who shall be residents of this state, two of whom shall be unlimited contractors, two of whom shall be unlimited journeymen, <em>engaged in and licensed for such occupation </em>under this chapter, and three of whom shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>be public members.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff claims that the two board members who were the unlimited journeymen were not engaged in the occupation of electrical contracting and therefore the board failed to meet the statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 20-331.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The phrase \u201cengaged in\u201d is not defined in the applicable statutes. In the absence of an express definition words of a statute are to be given the commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 393, 362 A.2d 971 (1975); <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 522, 134 A.2d 351 (1957). \u201cEngaged\u201d is defined as \u201cemployed; occupied; busy.\u201d Webster\u2019s American Heritage Dictionary. The members in question, Richard Panagrossi and Frank J. Carroll, were both licensed unlimited journeymen at the time of the hearing. They were not, however, engaged in the occupation of electrical work.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Examination of the record discloses that neither man considered his occupation to be that of an electrician. Both men were employees of the Local 488 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union. Carroll last worked as an electrician in 1978. As he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>stated: \u201cI differentiate between . . . being an electrician and a member of [local] 488 and working as a\u2014as an officer or business agent or manager of [local] 488.\u201d Panagrossi had not been employed as an electrician since 1972. As he stated: \u201cMy current title is a general representative to the International president.\u201d \u201cIt is a full-time position for me.\u201d \u201cBut I do continue to do things for people that are friends of mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-330 (2) specifically defines \u201celectrical work\u201d as \u201cthe installation, erection, maintenance, alteration or repair of any . . . apparatus, fixture or equipment which . . . uses electrical energy for light, heat, power or other purposes . . . .\u201d It is evident that Carroll and Panagrossi considered themselves to be full-time union employees. They were not \u201cengaged in [the] occupation\u201d of electrical work as required by \u00a7 20-331 and defined by \u00a7 20-330 (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u201cIn the absence of evidence to the contrary, we may assume that the [board] was properly constituted.\u201d <em>Furtney </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>159 Conn. 585, 596, 271 A.2d 319 (1970); <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>150 Conn. 539, 545, 192 A.2d 206 (1963). Under the circumstances presented here, however, it is clear that the board was not properly constituted. Since neither man was \u201cengaged in\u201d the occupation of electrical work the board\u2019s decision to suspend the plaintiff\u2019s license was without statutory authority. <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 546, 244 A.2d 391 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to return it to the board to be proceeded with according to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> Section 20-332-15 (a) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201cNothing in chapter 393 of the general statutes shall be construed to prohibit the employment of one apprentice by a licensed electrical contractor and an additional apprentice for a licensed electrical journeyman employed by a contractor. An electrical contractor employing more than one journeyman may employ an additional apprentice for each additional three journeymen employed by him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 20-331 provides in part: \u201cexamining boards. . . . Each such board, except the elevator installation, repair and maintenance board, shall consist of seven members who shall be residents of this state, two of whom shall be unlimited contractors, two of whom shall be unlimited journeymen, engaged in and licensed for such occupation under this chapter, and three of whom shall be public members.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> Subsequent to the hearing, Public Acts 1985, No. 85-352, revised General Statutes \u00a7 20-331 to include a general contractor among its members, thereby increasing the membership from seven to eight. Section 20-331 now provides in relevant part: \u201cexamining boards. There shall be in the department of consumer protection separate examining boards for each of the following occupations: (a) Electrical work; (b) plumbing and piping work; (c) heating, piping and cooling work; (d) elevator installation, repair and maintenance work .... The electrical board shall consist of eight members who shall be residents of this state one of whom shall be a general contractor, two of whom shall be unlimited contractors, two of whom shall be unlimited journeymen, engaged in and licensed for such occupation under this chapter, and three of whom shall be public members.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
