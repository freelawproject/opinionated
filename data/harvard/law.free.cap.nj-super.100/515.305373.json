A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AhK\">Involved herein are two separate personal injury motor vehicle accident cases which were instituted by plaintiff against separate defendants and consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">On April 4, 1961, at or about 3:30 p.m., plaintiff, a salesman for Feldman Food Products, was operating a truck leased from defendant Ava Truck Leasing, Inc. (Ava) in a southerly direction on Park Avenue in Hoboken when he collided with a parked tractor-trailer from which merchandise was being delivered to the plant of defendant Sweets Co. of America, Inc. (Sweets).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Plaintiff testified that immediately before the accident he had traversed the crest of the Park Avenue Bridge. As he was descending the bridge at or about 20 to 25 miles per hour, he allegedly noticed the tractor-trailer parked across the sidewalk fronting Sweets\u2019 warehouse. The tractor-trailer was blocking both lanes of southbound traffic on Park Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Plaintiff further testified that he attempted to apply his foot brake, but that the brake went down \u201cflat against board.\u201d Purportedly, he then started pumping his brake, but \u201cnothing resulted from that.\u201d Plaintiff stated that he attempted to shift into a lower gear, but was unable to do so. He asserted that he tried to apply his hand emergency brake, but could not slow his truck by such a procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Plaintiff related that he had noticed that several cars were stopped behind the parked tractor-trailer. These cars, according to plaintiff, could not go around the tractor-trailer because of heavy northbound traffic on Park Avenue. Plaintiff testified that he could not move his truck into the left lane because such a maneuver would have produced a head-on collision with an automobile in the northbound traffic. Had plaintiff proceeded straight, he allegedly would have hit the rear of one of the cars stopped on account of the trailer. This, according to plaintiff, would have set up a \u201cchain reaction of several cars.\u201d Therefore, plaintiff chose to pull to the right into the slow lane and crash into the center of the side of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Originally, plaintiff instituted an action against Ava, Yen-tre Trucking Company (Yentre), Pan Atlantic Steamship Corporation (Pan Atlantic) and Kelly Mitchell (Mitchell). Yentre and Pan Atlantic allegedly had proprietary interests in the tractor-trailer. Mitchell was the operator of the parked vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Plaintiff dismissed his action against Pan Atlantic. The jury returned a verdict of $9000 in favor of plaintiff against Ava and verdicts of no cause of action in favor of defendants Yentre and Mitchell. However, the trial court granted Ava a new trial, a decision which we affirmed. Plaintiff has never appealed from the judgments in favor of defendants Yentre and Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Plaintiff also brought an independent action against Sweets, alleging that Sweets \u201cdirected and participated in the improper and illegal [negligent] parking\u201d of the tractor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>trailer at its plant, and that Sweets, in so doing, created and maintained a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The suit against Sweets was consolidated with the retrial of plaintiff\u2019s action aaginst Ava. At the close of the trial of the consolidated actions, the jury returned a verdict for $17,000 in favor of plaintiff and against both Ava and Sweets. Both defendants moved before the trial court for judgments <em>n.o.v. </em>or, in the alternative, for a new trial. Ava at this time also moved to amend its answer to assert a cross-claim for contribution against Sweets. It had not previously asserted such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The trial judge granted Sweets\u2019 motion for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>on the ground of collateral estoppel but denied its motions for a new trial and judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>to the extent that they were based on the alleged failure of plaintiff to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence against Sweets and on purported trial errors. All of Ava\u2019s motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Ava appeals from the judgment of the trial court against it, and from the denial of its motions for a new trial, and from the denial of its motion for permission to amend its answer to assert a cross-claim against Sweets. Ava also appeals from the judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>entered in favor of Sweets and against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Sweets, \u201cin order to protect its rights and interests\u201d in the event of a reversal of its judgment <em>n.o.v., </em>cross-appeals from the judgment rendered against it based upon the jury verdict for plaintiff and from the partial denial of its motions for judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Plaintiff, \u201cfor protective purposes\u201d, cross-appeals from the judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>entered in favor of Sweets.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">We consider first Ava\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favor of plaintiff and from the trial court\u2019s denial of Ava\u2019s post-trial motions with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Initially, Ava contends that the trial court erred in striking the issue of contributory negligence as a defense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the breach of warranty claim against it, refusing to charge the jury on contributory negligence as a possible defense for Ava, and depriving Ava of the right to be heard on that defense in summation to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint and the pretrial order charged Ava with both negligence and breach of warranty. Ava in its answer and in the pretrial order asserted that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. In the openings plaintiff made reference to both theories of liability against Ava, and the latter raised the issue of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">However, after the close of the evidence and prior to summations and charge, plaintiff moved to abandon his negligence claim against Ava and stated that he would proceed against Ava solely upon the theory of breach of implied warranty. Upon the court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence count against Ava, plaintiff moved for a dismissal of Ava\u2019s contributory negligence defense. This motion was granted, the court being of the opinion that the only form of contributory negligence that could be a defense to a breach of warranty claim was that comparable to assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The trial court erred in striking the defense of contributory negligence from plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty action against Ava. See <em>Maiorino v. Weco Products Co., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>570, 573-575 (1965). Contributory negligence in its broad sense is a defense to a strict liability claim. <em>Maiorino, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>574. See also <em>Tanga v. Tanga, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>5, 11 <em>(App. Div. </em>1967). Therefore, the portion of the lower court\u2019s charge which specifically stated that contributory negligence was not a defense to plaintiff\u2019s action against Ava was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">However, despite this we hold that Ava is not entitled to overturn the judgment below. Under the unique circumstances here present the affirmance of the judgment is not a denial of substantial justice to Ava. See <em>R. R. </em>1:5-3 (5); <em>R. R. </em>2:5.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>The issue of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence was submitted to the jury in the consolidated action of plaintiff against Sweets, and an appropriate charge on behalf of Sweets was given regarding that defense. The jury, by rendering a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against Sweets, necessarily made a determination that plaintiff was not contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">As previously noted, the contributory negligence defense was not stricken from Ava\u2019s answer until all the testimony had been adduced. Counsel for both Ava and Sweets each thoroughly cross-examined plaintiff as to his driving and as to whether plaintiff knew or should have known that the brakes of his truck were defective. Ava does not contend that there could be any way, under the evidence submitted, that plaintiff could have been contributorily negligent as to it and not as to Sweets. Thus we have no Teason to doubt that if the issue of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence had been properly submitted in Ava\u2019s ease, the jury\u2019s verdict would have been the same, <em>i. e., </em>that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Ava\u2019s argument that it was prejudiced by the denial of an opportunity to address the jury in summation as to this issue is without merit. Its counsel was not deprived of a closing. Therefore <em>Aladdin Oil Burner Corp. v. Morton, 117 N. J. L. </em>260 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1936), on which it relies, is inapposite. In his summation Ava\u2019s counsel spent considerable time discussing the manner in which plaintiff operated his truck, commented upon the evidence regarding when plaintiff first saw the parked tractor-trailer, and referred to plaintiff\u2019s inconsistent testimony concerning this factual issue. Likewise, Sweets\u2019 attorney, in his closing, specifically mentioned plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence as an issue in the case and also discussed in detail the evidence pertaining to plaintiff\u2019s operation of his truck. Sweets\u2019 counsel raised the questions of when plaintiff first saw the tractor-trailer, why plaintiff failed to turn right at the bottom of the hill and use an open lane, whether plaintiff had been speeding and whether plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>had failed to properly control his vehicle. The attorney for Sweets also referred to the alleged inconsistencies in plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The true issue here present is whether the lower court\u2019s striking the defense of contributory negligence was prejudicial to Ava. Ava\u2019s charge that it was precluded from a summation on this issue is purely a theoretical one. Since, as above noted, the jury found plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, we conclude that on this point Ava has not demonstrated any prejudice mandating a reversal. Cf. <em>Panko v. Grimes, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>588, 599 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). It is fanciful to assume that Ava\u2019s counsel, by summation on this issue, could have swayed the minds of the jurors under the facts here present. Ava had nothing to advance on this issue beyond that which was already placed before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\"> Ava next contends that the trial court improperly and erroneously limited the scope of its cross-examination of plaintiff on the factual issue of how far plaintiff was from the tractor-trailer when he first saw that vehicle. We deem this point to be of no merit. The extent of cross-examination lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge. See, <em>e. g., Graf v. Folarno, </em>99 <em>N. J. Super. </em>173, 176 <em>(App. Div. </em>1968); <em>State v. Steele, </em>93 <em>N. J. Super. </em>498, 503-504 <em>(App. Div. </em>1966). The discrepancy between plaintiff\u2019s 1962 pretrial depositions and his trial testimony had been fully explored by Ava\u2019s counsel on more than one occasion. The judge, in ruling as he did, noted that there had been sufficient evidence adduced on the issue that Ava wished to pursue. We agree and find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Ava further contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to strike the evidence regarding prior brake servicing and adjustments of the Ava vehicle, in permitting plaintiff\u2019s counsel to comment thereon, and in instructing the jury that such evidence could be considered in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>whether the brakes were defective at the time of the accident. Ava\u2019s motion to strike was made after plaintiff had abandoned the negligence theory of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"> Ava argues that although this evidence might have been admissible on the abandoned negligence aspect of plaintiff\u2019s case, it was not relevant to plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty claim, since the only pertinent inquiry on that count was whether the brakes were defective at the time of the accident. We agree with Ava\u2019s statement as to the pertinent factual issue. <em>Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing, etc., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>434, 451-452 (1965). However, we disagree with its argument that the controverted evidence was not relevant to that issue, for it could support a reasonable inference as to the condition of the brakes at the critical time. See <em>Pabon v. Hackensack Auto Sales, Inc., </em>63 <em>N. J. Super. </em>476 <em>(App. Div. </em>1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The court instructed the jury that in order to hold Ava liable it had to find that there was a defect at the time of the accident and that the evidence as to prior service could be considered only insofar as it bore on that specific issue. This limiting charge cured any alleged improprieties in plaintiff\u2019s summation. We therefore hold Ava\u2019s contention to be without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Finally, Ava argues that the denial of its motion for mistrial, following improper comments of plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening to the jury as to injuries suffered by plaintiff in accidents subsequent to the one here involved, constituted error. Although the reference by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, technically, may have exceeded the proper bounds of an opening, it does not rise to the heights of being prejudicial. The court carefully pointed out, in its charge, that plaintiff could recover only for the damages caused by the accident of April 4, 1961 and not for damages connected with any other accident. Additionally, even though plaintiff on direct did not testify as to these subsequent injuries, he was extensively cross-examined about them by Ava\u2019s counsel as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Sweets\u2019. Upon the record, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">In sum, we conclude that plaintiff\u2019s judgment against Ava should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We next give consideration to Ava\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in granting judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>in favor of Sweets and against plaintiff on the ground of collateral estop-pel.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Preliminarily, we hold that Ava has standing to appeal from this judgment. Ava moved to amend its answer to include a cross-claim for contribution against Sweets under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law. Although this motion took place after the jury verdict against Ava and Sweets, it was made before the entry of the judgment n.o.v. in favor of Sweets. Thus, <em>Donofrio v. Farr Lincoln Mercury, Inc., </em>54 <em>N. J. Super. </em>500 <em>(App. Div. </em>1959), relied upon by Sweets, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Examining the merits of the substantive question, we conclude upon the entire record that the trial court correctly determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel was applicable to prevent a relitigation against Sweets of the same issues that had been determined adversely to plaintiff in the latter\u2019s prior suit against Ava, Ventre, Pan Atlantic and Mitchell. In that action plaintiff attempted to hold Mitchell and Ventre liable for Mitchell\u2019s negligent parking of the tractor-trailer, which plaintiff asserted to be the proximate cause of the accident. The causation issue was fully litigated therein and the jury resolved it by rendering a verdict of no cause of action in favor of Mitchell and Ventre.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Ava contends that the question considered in the earlier case is different from the one presently involved. It concedes that the relevant issue in the first action was whether the parking of the tractor-trailer constituted actionable negligence. However, Ava argues that the present case involves a different inquiry \u2014 whether Sweets should be liable for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>negligence in directing the manner in which the vehicle was parked.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The distinction that Ava attempts to draw lacks substance. Whether Sweets was negligent in giving the claimed instructions is immaterial unless it can be established that there was a causal relationship between its actions and the accident. This causal nexus could not be demonstrated without a determination being made that the parking of the tractor-trailer was a liability-imposing proximate cause of the event. This question was resolved adversely to plaintiff in the first suit and cannot be retried.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The fact that Sweets was not a party to the earlier litigation does not prevent it from now asserting the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel against plaintiff. The question to be decided is whether a party has had his day in court <em>on an issue, not </em>whether he has had his day in court on that issue <em>against a particular litigant. McAndrew v. Mularchuk, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>156, 161 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The criteria for determining who may assert a plea of collateral estoppel differ fundamentally from the criteria for determining against whom such a plea may be asserted. The doctrine cannot be raised against a litigant unless the latter was a party to the earlier litigation or in privity with a party thereto. However, one raising the plea of collateral estoppel need not have been a party, or in privity with a party, to the earlier proceeding. <em>Coca-Cola Co. v. Pepsi-Cola Co., </em>6 <em>W. W. Harr. </em>124, 36 <em>Del. </em>124, 173 <em>A. </em>360, 261-262 <em>(Super. Ct. </em>1945). See also <em>McAndrew, supra, </em>38 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>160.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Since Ettin was a party in the first suit, Sweets was entitled to utilize the doctrine of collateral estoppel to prevent the relitigation of issues already determined against plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Our conclusion disposes not only of Ava\u2019s appeal from the judgment <em>n.o.v. in </em>favor of Sweets, but also renders plaintiff\u2019s cross-appeal from that judgment without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">In view of the above determination, Sweets\u2019 cross-appeal is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b546-6\">Sullivan, S. J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A6p\">(concurring).  I concur in the foregoing opinion except that I do not agree that the trial court erred in striking the defense of contributory negligence from plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty, action against Ava. I think the trial court correctly held that there was insufficient evidence in the case to present a jury question as to plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence in the breach of warranty action. See <em>Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing etc., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>434 (1965); <em>Maiorino v. Weco Products Co., </em>45 <em>N. J. 570 </em>(1965).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b546-7\">Foley, J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AZ3\">(concurring)  Judge Leonard concludes that the trial court erred in striking the defense of contributory negligence from plaintiff\u2019s breach of warranty action, citing <em>Maiorino v. Weco Products Co., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>570 (1965). Judge Sullivan concludes that the proofs did not raise a jury issue of contributory negligence under the rule of <em>Maiorino </em>(which was a restatement of the rule first enunciated in <em>Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing etc., </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>434 (1965) as applied to the proofs in the <em>Maiorino </em>case). I concur with the latter view and agree that the judgment should be affirmed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Both of my colleagues hold that, assuming the trial court erred in withdrawing Ava\u2019s defense of contributory negligence from jury consideration, such error was not prejudicial. With this I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">I am of the opinion that if Ava was entitled to have the issue submitted to the jury the court\u2019s refusal to do so was prejudical <em>per se. </em>Furthermore, I feel strongly that the resulting curtailment of Ava\u2019s attorney\u2019s summation was of substantial detriment. We cannot know what Ava\u2019s approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>would have been had the issue of contributory negligence remained in its case, nor can we know whether a summation by Ava\u2019s counsel on that issue would have emphasized its importance, or whether counsel\u2019s presentation would have been more convincing or persuasive than the remarks of Sweets\u2019 attorney. I feel that the deprivation of advocacy in relation to a critical issue in a case should not be glossed over because a reviewing court concludes that the result would have been the same had the error not been committed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
