A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab5\">Plaintiff appeals from the judgment for defendants entered on a jury verdict of \u201cno cause for action\u201d in an automobile negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Three of the four points argued by plaintiff charge error in the admission of evidence. We agree that the challenged evidential rulings were erroneous and find that the impact thereof was so prejudicial as to mandate, in the interest of substantial justice, <em>cf. R. R. </em>1:5-3(6), a reversal and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The case was tried before the effective date of the pertinent Rules of \u201cThe Evidence Act, 1960\u201d (hereinafter referred to by Eule number). However, in the respects here involved, the Eules effected no change in the preexisting law.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The collision between plaintiff\u2019s northbound Volkswagen automobile and the southbound fiat-bed lumber truck owned by defendant Plymouth Homes, Inc. and driven by its employee, defendant Smith, occurred on H. S. 206, a two-lane highway in Stanhope, Sussex County. The basic factual dispute related to the point of impact, whether on the northbound or southbound half of the road. Plaintiff and Smith each testified that the other came over onto the wrong side of the center lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Only two other witnesses testified on the issue of liability. A Mr. Walters, who had been driving northerly some 200 feet behind plaintiff\u2019s auto, did not see the actual impact but testified that prior thereto plaintiff \u201cwas in his own' lane\u201d and that defendant\u2019s truck, when some 500 to 700 feet from Walter\u2019s vehicle, was on the white line and appeared thereafter to be \u201cgoing over the white line\u201d into the northbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The other witness was the police chief of Stanhope. He had learned of the collision by \u201cpolice radio from Morris County\u201d and had proceeded to the scene some five or six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>blocks away. It was during the Chief\u2019s testimony that all the criticized evidential rulings were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The first of those rulings permitted the Chief to relate, in response to a question of defendants\u2019 attorney, that defendant Smith, when questioned at the scene after plaintiff had been removed to the hospital, had told the Chief</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">\u201cthat he was proceeding south on 206 and this Volkswagen was proceeding north and seemed to slowly edge its way over into the left-hand lane. He pulled to the right to avoid a head-on automobile accident and the Volkswagen just seemed to continue on to the truck and he said that when the Volkswagen sideswiped the truck that he immediately pulled off the edge of the road and parked his vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The court overruled plaintiff\u2019s objection to the recital of defendant\u2019s self-serving statement, holding it admissible as part of the <em>res gestae. </em>The court erred. The statement was not admissible under the \u201cspontaneous declaration\u201d or <em>\"res gestae\u201d </em>exception to the hearsay evidence rule. See <em>Riley v. Weigand, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>66, 73 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>Lieberman v. Saley, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>156, 161 <em>(App. Div. </em>1967); <em>Anastasio v. </em>Rust, 128 <em>N. J. L. </em>426, 428 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); <em>cf. Rule </em>63(4), <em>Rules of Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Defendant Smith\u2019s statement was a mere narration of past events; a response to the police officer\u2019s questioning. The record would not support a finding that the statement was made</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201c(a) while the declarant was perceiving an event or condition which the statement narrates, describes or explains, or (b) while the de-clarant was under the stress of a nervous excitement caused by such perception, in reasonable proximity to the event, and without opportunity to deliberate or fabricate.\u201d <em>Rule </em>63(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">See also cases cited <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">It was also error to permit the police chief to express his opinion as to the \u201capproximate point of impact.\u201d He based his opinion not only on the physical evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>he had observed \u2014 including debris and tire marks \u2014 but also on what defendant Smith had told him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We do not reach the question of whether the opinion of a qualified expert is admissible to prove the point of collision between two automobiles, see generally Annotation, Opinion Evidence \u2014 Point of Collision, 66 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1048 (1959), because defendants acknowledge, as they did in the trial court, that the police chief did not qualify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Defendants contend, however, that the Chief\u2019s testimony as to the probable point of impact was admissible \u2018day. opinion\u201d testimony under the evidence rule codified in <em>Rule </em>56 (1). Not so. <em>Priest v. Poleschuk, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>557, 562 (1954); <em>Brindley v. Firemen's Ins. Co. of Newark, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 8 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955); <em>Annotation, </em>66 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">As the Court said in <em>Priest v. Poleschuk, supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>562-63:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cKnowledge is requisite to testimonial qualification. In assaying opinion evidence, for competency, the distinction is generally between the expert and the nonexpert' \u2014 \u2022 the witness who is skilled and specially experienced in the particular field, and the witness who has only the common knowledge and experience of mankind. Prom the latter, only facts perceived by the use of their senses, and not mere opinion, inferences, or conclusions based upon the facts supposedly within their knowledge, are adducible in evidence, for the assessment of the facts involving common knowledge and experience is the exclusive province of the jury or other fact-finding authority. The witness in the latter category cannot offer his opinion of the probative worth of the facts. But he has more leeway where the facts are incapable of reproduction and comprehension by mere description. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">* * * The * <em>* </em>* conclusion * * * [of] a lay witness who has no greater skill than the jury in drawing inferences, * * * [is] inadmissible when the jury can be put into a position \u2018of equal vantage for drawing them.\u2019 <em>Wigmore, sections </em>1918, 1924.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">This is not a case where \u201cthe facts are incapable of reproduction and comprehension by mere description.\u201d On the contrary, the Chief detailed to the jury all the facts on which he relied for his opinion as to the point of impact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>including the statement he had obtained from defendant Smith. His testimony as to the probable point of impact was nothing more nor less than expert testimony, given by one who concededly is not an expert. The inference as to the point of impact to be drawn from the properly admitted evidence, including the Chief\u2019s testimony as to what he saw, was for the jury, not for a lay witness. Further, even if the Chief had qualified as an expert, his opinion as to the point of impact would have been inadmissible since it was based, in essential part, on what defendant Smith had told him. Annotation, 66 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1048, 1063; <em>cf. Rule </em>56(2). Plaintiff\u2019s objection to the Chief\u2019s opinion testimony should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">So, too, should have plaintiff\u2019s objection to the admission into evidence of the writing prepared by the Chief captioned \u201cPolice Report of Motor Yehicle Accident.\u201d The report contained much of what the Chief had testified to, including matters we. have held to be inadmissible \u2014 Smith\u2019s statement to the Chief and a diagram depicting the Chief\u2019s opinion as to the point of impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The report was not admissible as \u201cpast recollection recorded\u201d under what is now Rule 63(1) <em>(b). </em>The Chief had sufficient recollection to testify and did testify fully as to everything in the report. The report itself should therefore not have been admitted on defendants\u2019 motion. <em>Springer v. Labow, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>68, 71 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1931); <em>Wigmore on </em>Evidence, \u00a7 763, <em>p. </em>111 <em>(3d ed. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"> In view of what the report contained and the fact that the Chief had testified to what was set forth therein, there is no substance in defendants\u2019 argument that the report was admissible as a business record under either <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:82-34, <em>et seq. </em>or present <em>Rule </em>63 (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Our determination that there must be a reversal because of the prejudicial evidential rulings makes it unnecessary to determine the validity of appellant\u2019s criticism of the supplemental instruction given in response to the jury\u2019s question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and whether, if there was error, it was prejudicial. The problem is not likely to arise on the retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
