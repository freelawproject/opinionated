S. C.</author>\n<p id=\"ASk\">(temporarily assigned) dissenting: The case comes up on a stipulation of facts. 94 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>pp. </em>229-230. Plaintiff, Prances Magrine, was injured by a hypodermic needle which defendant, a dentist, had injected into her gum. In the course of the injection the needle broke. Defendant believes \u201cthere must have been some sort of a defect in the needle.\u201d At oral argument we were told that an operation was required to extract the broken portion of the needle. Plaintiff does not charge defendant with negligence, but asserts strict liability in tort, relying on <em>Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>358 (1960); <em>Santor v. A &amp; M Karagheusian, Inc., </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>52 (1965); <em>Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing &amp; Rental Service, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>434 (1965) and <em>Schipper v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>70 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The trial court denied recovery. Strict liability was refused because the dentist was engaged in a profession, not a large-scale business; he was not a manufacturer or supplier ,of the needle, but a user of it; he could not discover a latent defect in the needle; and precedent in this state has not yet applied the doctrine beyond manufacturers <em>(Henningsen </em>and <em>Santor, supra), </em>retailers <em>(Henningsen, supra), </em>suppliers such as rental companies <em>(Cintrone, supra) </em>and mass producers of homes <em>(Schipper, supra). </em>The majority of this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">I disagree with the views of my colleagues. As between an innocent patient and a dentist who causes injury by using a defective instrument the law should require the loss to be borne by the dentist, even if he is not-negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The issue posed is as old as jurisprudence: when an innocent person is injured through the inadvertent conduct of another, who should bear the loss? The answer has varied with the epoch and environment. Prom ancient times until the 19th century the answer given generally was in favor of strict liability. Thereafter, with some exceptions, the basic rule has been to deny recovery against a defendant who is free of negligence. In the 20th century no liability without fault has been the basic premise, but it has been replaced through legislation by strict liability for industrial accidents (workmen\u2019s compensation) and for other specific activities such as ground damage by airplanes <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>6:2-7) and dog bites <em>(R. S. </em>4:19-16). In addition, the courts have restored strict liability in a broad area where a defective product or device has caused injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We may ask ourselves what objectives did the law seek in fashioning these rules of liability? In primitive cultures vengeance against the offending thing or person, not compensation, was a primary objective. <em>Holmes, The Common Law, p. </em>34 (1881). If \u00e1 man fell from a tree and died the tree was delivered to his relatives or was chopped to pieces. <em>Id., pp. </em>11, 19, 24. Liability was visited upon the offending source, animate or inanimate, as well as persons connected with it, as if evil inhered in the instrument of harm. Wigmore, \u201cResponsibility for Tortious Acts: Its History,\u201d 7 <em>Harv. L. Rev. </em>315, 319 (1891) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cWigmore-I\u201d). The reason may have been revenge or superstition or fear of an instrument of evil. It may have seemed just that \u201cthe damage which we have inflicted on others must be made good.\u201d <em>Ehrenzweig, Negligence Without Fault, pp. </em>13-14 (1951).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">This sweeping rule caught all harm-doers; but the difference between intentional and accidental harm was recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>at an early age in criminal law for the purpose of punishment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and in civil wrongs for the purpose of mitigating damages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If a man\u2019s ox was killed by an ox whose owner was ignorant of its propensity \u201cto push in time past,\u201d then \u201cThey shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.\u201d <em>Exodus </em>21:35, 36. This is one solution where both parties are blameless: have them share the loss. This approach has some parallel to workmen\u2019s compensation laws of the 1900\u2019s and to various suggestions made since the 1920\u2019s to compensate victims of motor vehicle accidents by a strict liability plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the 19th century fault \u2014 the failure to act as an ordinary prudent man \u2014 became the central condition of liability for unintentional harm. <em>Brown v. </em>Kendall, 6 <em>Cush. </em>292 <em>(Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1850). The purpose that was championed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>was the right of individuals and corporations to act freely and unburdened unless harm is done through their negligence. Some areas of strict liability continued at common law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the spirit of laissez faire and the momentum of the industrial revolution prevailed. \u201cWe must have factories, machinery, dams, canals and railroads,\u201d the court said in <em>Losee v. Buchanan, </em>51 <em>N. Y. </em>476, 484-485 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1873), denying recovery without proof of negligence for damage to property caused by an exploding boiler. \u201cBy becoming a member of civilized society,\u201d the court said, \u201cnatural rights\u201d must be surrendered, but a benefit is gained through the surrender by others of the same rights. \u201cI hold my property subject to the risk that it may be unavoidably or accidentally injured by those who live near me; and as I move about upon the public highways and in all places where other persons may lawfully be, I take the risk of being accidentally injured in my person by them without fault on their part.\u201d In 1881 Holmes shared these views; however, he also suggested that deterrence of harmful behavior was a product of the rule that makes fault a condition of liability. <em>Holmes, op. cit. supra, pp. </em>95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In those days the problem was considered \u201con the assumption that plaintiff and defendant were alone involved and that what happened between them was the real <em>issue </em>\u2014 that tort liability was paid for out of the defendant\u2019s own pocketbook.\u201d 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, op. cit. supra, p. </em>762. The irony is that the fault rule, which was partly inspired by the desire to protect the growth of industry, was undone by the results of that very growth, namely, an increase in the harmful capacity of mechanized facilities, the inevitability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of accidents in their use and the consequent toll of human life and losses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The expansion of the economy, the broadening' of distribution of goods, and services and the new pervasiveness of liability insurance are all part of the environment for the tort law of the 20th century. In this environment new views have taken shape about the objectives of the law. \"What has become dominant in our time is the need to compensate victims of normal conditions of daily life. \u201cThere is a tendency to revive the idea of liability without fault not only in the frame of wide responsibility for agencies employed, but in placing upon an enterprise the burden of repairing injuries, without fault of him who conducts it, which are an incident to the undertaking. * * * There is a strong and growing tendency, where there is no blame on either side, to ask in view of the exigencies of social justice, who can best bear the loss.\u201d <em>Pound, The Spirit of the Common Law, pp. </em>188-189 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Assuring compensation for victims of accidents is a matter of public policy which legislatures have promoted in various ways.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Very recently the courts have come to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>this purpose by expanding liability without proof of negligence in the area of \u201cproduct liability.\u201d This result followed naturally the change in economic and social organization. So long as direct sales brought goods from a manufacturer to a consumer the law had little difficulty in affording relief in contract or in tort. When the process of manufacturing and distribution became extended and diversified, determining liability seemed more complicated. In contract the requirement of privity insulated the obligor on the belief that business transactions would become treacherous if liability were extended to persons beyond the immediate parties; and in tort, arising from contractual relations, the same fear of creating uncertain burdens was used to limit the scope of the duty of care to the immediate parties in the transaction. <em>Winterbottom, v. Wright, </em>10 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>109, 152 <em>Eng. Rep. </em>402 (Ex. 1842), denying recovery to a coachman for injuries due to the collapse of a coach which defendant had a contractual duty to keep in good repair; see generally Kessler, \u201cProducts Liability,\u201d 76 <em>Yale L. J. </em>887 (1967). Before <em>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., </em>217 <em>N. Y. </em>382, 111 <em>N. E. </em>1050 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1916), absent privity, a manufacturer was not liable to an ultimate consumer even though his injury was caused by negligence in the manufacture of the product.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">With changes in production and marketing methods the courts looked for techniques to extend liability in favor of the ultimate consumer. The courts came to realize that the public interest required protection against defects in products which consumers must buy or use and against which they are helpless to protect themselves. Prosser, \u201cThe Assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Upon the Citadel (Strict Liability to the Consumer),\u201d 69 <em>Yale L. J. </em>1099, 1122 (1960) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cThe Assault\u201d). Bepresentations of quality, express or implied, were held to run in favor of the consumer. The courts used various devices to overcome lack of privity, such as implied agency, third-party beneficiary and the like. <em>Id. </em>at <em>p. </em>1124. Intricacies in the law of sales involving privity, warranties and disclaimer rights forced the courts to turn to the law of torts for a solution. Kessler, <em>supra, </em>76 <em>Yale L. J. </em>at <em>p. </em>895.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Through the <em>Henningsen, Santor, Cintrone, </em>and <em>Schipper </em>cases, <em>supra, </em>our Supreme Court has expressed the principles on which the doctrine of strict liability in tort is based. \u201cThe demands of social justice,\u201d the court said in <em>Henningsen, supra, </em>32 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>384, require a rule of law that holds manufacturers and dealers liable for a defect in an automobile which causes injury to a consumer who, \u201chas neither the opportunity nor the capacity to inspect or to determine the fitness of an automobile for use * * *.\u201d In <em>Santor, supra, </em>44 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>pp. </em>65-66 the court pointed out that the obligation is \u201can enterprise liability\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that does not depend upon \u201cthe intricacies of the law of sales\u201d and that this \u201cstrict liability in tort is not conditioned upon advertising to promote sales.\u201d <em>Cintrone, supra, </em>makes it clear that there is no reason to restrict the rule to sales transactions. The obligation is implied in law, \u201cas an incident of a transaction because one party to the relationship is in a better position than the other to know and control the condition of the chattel * * * <em>and to distribute the losses </em>which may occur because of a dangerous condition the chattel possesses.\u201d (Emphasis added). 45 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>446.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The trial court agreed with defendant\u2019s contention that strict liability should not apply to one who is not a manufacturer or large-scale supplier of goods but who merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>uses instruments acquired from others.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Obviously we cannot determine the rule of liability on'the basis of the size or resources of one of b the parties. Strict liability applies to all manufacturers, big and small, and in most states where the doctrine prevails it applies to retailers as well,\u2019 big and small. In <em>Henningsen, supra, </em>the court held the dealer-retailer to strict liability. See also Prosser, \u201cThe Fall,\u201d: <em>supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>815. Moreover, in 'this situation the dentist is not a \u201cconsumer\u201d of the hypodermic needle. The patient must be viewed as the \u201cultimate consumer.\u201d The dentist purchased the needle for use on his patients; it is they who are exposed to the risk of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u2019 The injured patient should have the option of suing the dentist directly. It is the dentist with whom plaintiff has dealt and in whose hands and confidence the patient has put herself. It may be more difficult to sue a manufacturer or supplier located in a distant state or a foreign country. The dentist chose the instrument. The dentist is in a better position to know and prove the identity of the manufacturer or distributor. If he cannot, the patient should not be denied recovery on that account. The dentist should also know the quality of the instrument and the reliability of his source of supply. This rule may encourage greater caution in purchasing equipment and examining for defects.</p>\n<p id=\"A2S\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>'If an alleged manufacturer were sued 'other issues may arise. Here the needle - was' used eight times in a three week period. The dentist, not the patient, knows' its history. The1 manufacturer may deny the existence of a latent defect and may assert that .the instrument was. used .or cared for negligently. The parties best suited to litigate' this issue \u00a1are the dentist and' the supplier. Prosser, \u201cThe Pall,\u201d <em>supr$', </em>at <em>p. </em>816. Often the real dispute will be .between the insurance company for the dentist dnd the insurance company for the manufacturer, particularly where the source is in doubt or negligence in \u00fase is asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The benefit that a patient receives in damages is not offset by an unfair burden placed on the dentist. The dentist does have a claim over against the supplier and manufacturer, of the defective needle. He should know who they are in most cases. If strict liability would create higher insurance costs these costs may be mitigated through the claim over. Even without the claim over the loss may be distributed through fees for dental services or by insurance, the cost of which may he reflected in such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Shifting the loss from A to B may not produce a net gain for society as a whole, but distribution of the loss does. Grad, \u201cRecent Developments in Automobile Accident Compensation,\u201d 50 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>300, 326-327 (1950); <em>Cintrone, supra, </em>45 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>446; Prosser, \u201cThe Assault,\u201d <em>supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>1120. Liability insurance is recognized as a means of distributing losses among the group involved in risk-producing activity. Prosser, \u201cThe Assault,\u201d <em>supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>1120; see also concurring opinion of Justice Traynor in <em>Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co., </em>24 <em>Cal. 2d </em>453, 462, 150 <em>P. </em>2d 436, 441 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1944). But the trial judge agreed with Dean Prosser\u2019s view that insurance cannot and should not be used \u201cto determine whether the group shall bear them (losses) in the first instance \u2014 and whether, for example, consumers shall he compelled to accept substantial price increases on everything they buy in order to compensate others for their misfortunes.\u201d Prosser, \u201cThe Assault,\u201d <em>supra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>at <em>p. </em>1121.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The argument is unrealistic and unpersuasive. Prof. James has replied that, \u201cToday practically everybody worth suing is insured.\u201d James, \u201cAn Evaluation of the Fault Concept,\u201d 32 <em>Term. L. Rev. </em>394, 397 (1965). <em>Conard, supra, </em>at <em>pp. </em>45-50, note 54, shows that 98.8% of all payments for motor vehicle injury claims are received from insured sources. It is pointless to say that those who purchase goods should not be compelled to pay an item of cost for insurance to protect others. The protection is for the whole group. No one knows which consumer will he injured. The cost paid by each consumer assures his own satisfaction of a judgment if he gets one. The fact is that through the cost of goods and services consumers today do pay indirectly for insurance covering losses caused by the negligent activities of their suppliers. If this is just, granting consumer protection against defective products cannot be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The total compensation awarded for accidental loss by reason of tort liability and workmen\u2019s compensation is $3,178,000,000 annually. <em>Conard, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>45. These losses would be devastating without loss distribution. Corporations (such as some public utilities) which are large enough to insure themselves distribute the loss to the public through the price of goods and services. Business men, professionals and individuals, who have sufficient assets to protect, are likely to carry insurance under existing law. It must be remembered that even with strict liability the exposure to liability for negligence continues as before. The extension of strict liability for defective goods and utensils <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>merely expands the concept of tort liability. It has been called \u201cnegligence without fault.\u201d See note 8 above. Those who do not carry insurance and are judgment proof will probably be unaffected by this rule of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Insurance plays another role in the formulation of a desirable rule. It interferes with the achievement of the objectives sought by the fault principle. An injuror was to pay damages because he was negligent. With insurance, however, the negligent man pays no damages, although he pays for his insurance. The loss is shared by all who insure with the same company, or by its stockholders or by those who are participants in the activity. It was also believed that the threat of liability for negligence would encourage prudent conduct. The existence of insurance diminishes this threat. Moreover, the strict liability rule does not discourage prudence but may actually encourage examination for defects which are not obvious. See <em>Booth Steamship Co. v. Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co., infra. </em>Workmen\u2019s compensation laws have spurred safety consciousness by employers whose insurance Tates depend upon loss experience. 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, op. cit. supra, </em>\u00a7 13.5, <em>pp. </em>771-777. Insurance companies themselves have applied some of their resources to safety goals. <em>Ibid. </em>In any case, the threat of liability for fault continues where strict liability applies. Lastly, the fear that lawful activities and growing industry would be unduly burdened by liahility without fault is minimized by the loss-spreading effect of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>-Occasionally we are told that it violates a natural sense of justice .to require a defendant. to pay damages when he is; pot at fault. Spangenberg, editorial, Trial, vol. 3 no. 6 (1967), answering current proposals for completely abolishing fault as a basis for liability in motor vehicle accident cases. See note 4 above. In my view our sense of justice is better served by the principle that holds a dentist accountable for. injuries caused by a defective instrument which he has selected and used. The risk of harm to which ah innocent patient is expqsed by a defective instrument far exceeds the risk or burden which the dentist is asked to bear. The point may be made by reference to the automobile. Rollins, in \u201cA Proposal to Extend the Compensation Principle to Accidents in the Streets,\u201d 4 <em>Mass. L. Q. </em>392, 294 (1919) observed that in an impact between an automobile and a pedestrian the automobile can injure the pedestrian but the pedestrian cannot injure the automobile. The chances, he said, were all one way; and it is the automobile that gets the pleasure or profit but suffers none of the disadvantages. In such a case, he asks, who would say that it is unjust to have the motorist indemnify the pedestrian where both are blameless. It seems more unjust to leave the. loss with the victim of an accident caused by a defective instrumentality which has the potential for harm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It does.not offend our sense of justice to place the loss on the one responsible for the instrument. The law has done this very thing throughout its history. Justice requires only that we apply the rule in appropriate cases. A retailer who sells a can of beans containing a latent defect is no more culpable than a dentist who uses an instrument with a latent defect. The patient probably places more reliance upon the dentist than he does on the retailer. Yet in the case of a sale the legislature has expressed the public policy of our state to compensate the victim by holding the seller to a warranty of fitness for use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>despite his blamelessness. <em>R. S. </em>46:30-21 (Uniform Sales Act), superseded by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:2-314(1) (Uniform Commercial Code); <em>Griffin v. James Butler Grocery </em>Co. 108 <em>N. J. L. </em>92 <em>(E. </em>&amp; <em>A. </em>1931). It is not unjust to hold a dentist to the same responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Most of the cases of strict liability involve a manufacturer, distributor, retailer or lessor of goods. There are some cases which involve a defective commodity used or furnished by one rendering a service. Originally, serving food in a restaxxrant was considered a service, not a sale <em>(Nisky v. Childs Co., </em>103 <em>N. J. L. </em>464 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1927)), except by those who found it necessary to find a sale in order to allow recovery on an implied warranty basis. <em>Sofman v. Denham Food Service, Inc., </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>304 (1962); Farnsworth, \u201cImplied Warranties of Quality in Non-Sales Cases,\u201d 57 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>653, 660-662 (1957). The blood transfusion cases are in a similar category, since blood is furnished as part of medical or hospital service. Belief has been denied in a number of such cases. <em>Perlmutter v. Beth David Hospital, </em>308 <em>N. Y. </em>100; 123 <em>N. E. 2d </em>792 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1954); <em>Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hospital, </em>96 <em>N. J. Super. </em>314 <em>(Law Div. </em>1967). Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>57 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>at <em>p. </em>672 recommends that strict liability should apply to blood transfusion cases. He points out that the recipient\u2019s reliance upon the supplier is great, the supplier is better able to bear the loss and distribute the risk, and the inability to detect or prevent contamination would not have prevented recovery in implied warranty if there had been a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In <em>Cintrone, supra, </em>45 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>p. </em>454, the court relied upon <em>Booth Steamship Co. v. Meier &amp; Oelhaf Co., </em>262 <em>F. 2d </em>310 (2 <em>Cir. </em>1958). There, defendant contracted to overhaul the engine of a vessel. In the course of the work a wire strap was used to suspend a heavy object. A workman was injured when the strap parted because of a defect xvhich could xxot have been detected by visual examination in the exercise of ordinary care. There was a dispute as to who supplied or had the duty of supplying the wire strap. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>court held that if the defendant contractor supplied the wire strap which failed to serve the purpose for which it was used then the contractor was liable for the resultant personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Although the court spoke in terms of a bailment or lease of the contractor\u2019s equipment, the facts indicate that the strap was used as part of the job being performed by the contractor. If the contractor furnished the strap he probably did not do so as a separate lease or bailment of his equipment, but rather to facilitate the work he had undertaken to perform. In this respect he is like the dentist in the case at hand. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\u201cAlthough he is unable to prevent defects arising in the course of manufacture, his expert knowledge of the characteristics of the equipment in use should enable him to detect them more readily than the user. It is therefore not less reasonable as an incident of his contract to charge him with the duty of making tests, the omission of which would not constitute negligence, than it is to charge the manufacturer or retailer with a similar responsibility. We think that this is particularly true when the chattel is supplied, as it presumably was here, in the partial fulfillment of a general undertaking to make repairs. In such circumstances the hirer defers to the special qualifications of the contractor in both the selection and use of the equipment. Relying on the supplier\u2019s control of the work and with confidence in the supplier\u2019s expert knowledge and competence, he makes at most only a routine inspection of the equipment employed. To say that the supplier warrants the equipment merely confirms the customary reliance which flows from such a relationship and which affords an appropriate remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201cApplying general principles to the facts of this case, we find that the defect which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury was not detectable by the ordinary visual inspection which the vessel\u2019s officers on the scene may be expected to make. Such latent defects in wire as are undetectable on visual inspection may result from improper manufacture or from fatigue resulting from use over a period of time. They may perhaps be discovered by subjecting the equipment to appropriate tests with safety factors in excess of the contemplated undertaking. Furthermore, it is the supplier and not the shipowner who knows the actual history of prior use of the equipment. He alone is in the position to establish such retirement schedules or periodic retests as will best prevent the development of visually undetectable flaws.\u201d 262 <em>F. 2d </em>at <em>p. </em>31-1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>See also <em>Butter v.

Both cases hold that an implied warranty of suitability arises in non-sales cases, in one instance where a hospital furnished a defective metal clip for use by a special nurse in treating a patient who was hospitalized, and in another instance where economic loss resulted from the installation of defective heating tubes under a contract for labor and materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">In Prance liability would attach in a case of this kind. Under Art. 1384 of the Civil Code an individual is liable for damage caused by the act of things in his charge, and this is interpreted to apply absolute liability for accidental injury due to a defect in the thing, such as a fracture of a metal part. Esmein, \u201cLiability in French Law for Damages Caused by Motor Vehicle Accidents,\u201d 2 Am. <em>J. Comp. L. </em>156, 158 (1953); <em>Conard, supra, </em>at <em>p. </em>467. In England there are several cases in which recovery has been allowed for defective material furnished as part of service contracts. In <em>G. H. Myers &amp; Co. v. Brent Cross Service Co., </em>(1934) 1 <em>K. B. </em>46, 150 <em>L. T. R. </em>96 (1933) the court held that if an automobile repairman selects the supplier of a connecting rod he is liable for damage caused by a defect in the rod which he installed in a motor. In <em>Watson v. Buckley, </em>(1940) 1 <em>All E. R. </em>174 <em>(K. B. </em>1939) plaintiff was allowed recovery against Mrs. Buckley, a hairdresser, for dermatitis resulting from a defective hair dye. The court held that there was an implied warranty from Mrs. Buckley that the dye was \u00f1t for use on plaintiff\u2019s hair, although she is not held to have warranted that the dye would work well or produce a given shade of color. In <em>Dodd v. Wilson </em>(1946) 2 <em>All E. R. </em>691 <em>(K. B.) </em>a veterinary surgeon was held liable for injury caused by defective serum which defendant had purchased and injected into plaintiff\u2019s cattle. The court held that it was an implied \u201ccondition\u201d in the contract between the parties that defendant would furnish a substance reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>fit for the required purpose. The court reasoned that if the serum had been sold to plaintiff .'and plaintiff had used:.it himself recovery would have been allowed under the Sale of Goods Act. Accordingly, the court saw no reason why the same obligation should not apply when the materials were furnished as part of a service.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Prof. Earnsworth suggests that courts should abandon the search for the qualities of a sale in a. transaction and should apply strict liability in non-sales cases by analogous reasoning. Farnsworth, <em>supra, 57 Colum. L. Rev. </em>at <em>p. </em>667. It is clear that he would recommend strict liability in the case at hand just as he declared in 1957 that it would soon be applied to the sale of housing (analogizing the mass producer of housing to the mass producer of goods) and to lessors of automobiles and other devices. 57 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>at <em>p. </em>660.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Defendant\u2019s brief states that there is a \u2018fiack of scholarly comment\u201d supporting the cause of action. It is true that few writers have focused on the specific area of service transactions as distinguished from sales, leases and bailments. However, I know of no academic comment opposing the application of strict liability to this type of case. As noted above, Prof. Earnsworth favors strict liability here. Significantly, however, most current scholarly comment urges the total abolition of the negligence-fault principle in accidental injury cases. See authorities cited in notes 4, 5., 8 and 12 above. The scholars, therefore, go far beyond the needs of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The law of torts should seek to compensate the injured, to encourage safety practices and to distribute losses justly. 2 <em>Harper &amp; James, op. cit. supra, pp. </em>742-743; Calabresi, \u201cFault, Accidents and the Wonderful World of Blum and Kalven,\u201d 75 <em>Yale L. J. </em>216, 238 (1965). These objectives may 'be taken to express the needs of justice. Tn my view these objectives are advanced by granting plaintiff an award in this case. Dentistry as an enterprise should pay its own way. Denying compensation is .to require an injured person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>who hears the loss alone to subsidize the risk-creating activities by which others profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Eor the foregoing reasons strict liability in tort should apply to a dentist who injures his patient by a latently defective instrument.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-6\"> Prof. Ehrenzweig states that the principles of natural law have equally supported a theory of fault liability as well as absolute liability for harm done by the actor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> Misadventure and self-defense were grounds for mercy or pardon in a criminal case.

The remainder of that paragraph is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aif\">\u201cThe housewife who sells a jar of jam to her neighbor, or the man who trades in a used car on the purchase of a new one, will obviously stand on a very different footing so far as the justifiable reliance of third persons is concerned. It is also very probable that the rule will not apply to sales outside of the usual course of business, such as execution sales, or the bulk sale of an entire stock of goods for what they will bring after bankruptcy or a fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbrI\">Clearly, Prosser was merely distinguishing types of sales in which a purchaser is not in \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d upon the seller. Dean Prosser was not addressing himself to the issue of applying strict liability to the user of a defective instrument as distingushed from suppliers of goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> Similarly, in 1881, Holmes said it was no more justifiable for a man to indemnify a neighbor against injury from his faultless acts than it would be to require\u2019 him to insure Ms neighbor against lightning. <em>Holmes, op. cit. supra, p. </em>96. . Holmes derided the idea that the state might insure its citizens against accidents and distribute the burden amongst all citizens as well as provide \u201ca pension for paralytics, and state aid for those who suffered in person or estate from tempest or wild beasts.\u201d But the state has come to do these very things in the form of medicare, disaster aid and unsatisfied judgment funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> The trial court said that the defendant may not be covered by his malpractice insurance because implied warranty claims require coverage for contract liability. The dentist\u2019s insurance policy is not before the court and I do not intend to decide that issue. The rare contractual warranty of a professional to effect a cure or to provide a certain result is different from the obligation which is termed strict liability in tort.
