Under Act No. 75 of the Puerto Rican Legislature approved May 6, 1930, by which the salary of the petitioner was fixed at $5,500, the period for which it was fixed was limited to June 30, 1931. Section 1 of the Act provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u201cSection 1. That the following sums, or so much thereof as may be respectively necessary, are hereby appropriated out of any funds in the Treasury, not otherwise appropriated, in full compensation for the services of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1931, for the objects hereinafter expressly named.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Section 1 of the Budget Act for the year 1932 provided in the same terms the salary of the petitioner for the year ending June 30, 1932. Act No. 40 approved May 13, 1932, in which year the first reduction in the petitioner\u2019s salary was made, provided that the salary for the year ending June 30, 1933, shall be $5,120; and under Act No. 73 of the year 1934 providing for the expenses of government his salary for the year ending June 30, 1935, was $4,864.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It therefore appears that the salary for the District Judge of Humacao was never fixed except from year to year. Budget acts by their nature fix appropriations and salaries from year to year. It is clear, we think, that section 50 of the Jones Act applies to the salary of this petitioner, since the amount was never established for his term of office by any general act, and his office is not one of those filled by the President.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">It is likewise contended by the government that no controversial question is raised by the petition as a basis for a declaratory judgment, the allegations of the petition being that there has arisen merely a difference of opinion between the petitioner and the officials as to which section of the Organic Act applies to his salary. Mere differences of opinion, it is claimed by the government, raise no controversial question forming a basis for a declaratory judgment. United States v. West Virginia et al., 295 U.S. 463, 473, 474, 55 S.Ct. 789, 79 L.Ed. 1546. In any event, the judgment of the Supreme Court must be affirmed on the grounds stated in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
