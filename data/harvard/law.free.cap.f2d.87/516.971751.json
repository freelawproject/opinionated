As shown by the application, the letters are shown in black block form. Between the syllables \u201cDry\u201d and \u201cpaC,\u201d in the drawing, are representations of two filled bags, one erect and one reclining.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">The Examiner required a disclaimer of the representation of the goods and the words \u201cDry-paC,\u201d \u201cConduit Filler,\u201d \u201cCleveland, Ohio,\u201d and \u201cDry-paC,\u201d apart from the mark shown, and also an amendment to show that the crosshatching was for shading and not to indicate color. The applicant disclaimed all except the word \u201cDry-paC\u201d and also amended as suggested. The Examiner refused registration on the ground that the name' desired to be registered was descriptive, and the Commissioner, on appeal, affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">The material upon which the appellant uses the mark in question is treated asbestos in a loose or fibrous state, and is used as a packing for pipes to insulate against the transfer of heat. Appellant states that it is called \u201cDry-paC\u201d because, being made of asbestos, it is \u201csomething more than waterproof, having a property of readily shedding water which may be described as being \u2018water repellant.\u2019 \u201d Appellant contends that the material will not keep water away from the pipe with which it is used, but will readily drain it off after the water does reach the pipe. Hence it is argued that the name may be suggestive, but is not descriptive. The applicant cites a large number of marks registered by the office recently, which are claimed to be more descriptive than the one here involved. Even if this be true, it constitutes no reason why the registration of appellant\u2019s mark should be allowed, if it be descriptive. Administrative errors cannot change the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-21\">The Examiner called attention to the fact that it was well known in the art that asbestos materials used as a packing are commonly applied in either a dry form, or in a cementitious form capable of adhering to the surface covered. He also stated that a prime requisite of heat packing material was dryness and intervening air spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-22\">The Commissioner agreed with these suggestions of the Examiner, and further stated that such covering of pipes was commonly referred to in the trade as \u201cpacking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-23\"> We are of opinion that the Commissioner did not err in holding that the appellant\u2019s mark \u201cDry-PaC\u201d is descriptive. It seems quite obvious that the syllable \u201cDry\u201d would be associated in the mind of even the casual observer with its character as a dry material. It is equally obvious that the syllable \u201cpaC\u201d would be associated in the mind with a material which is packed about something. Appellant\u2019s counsel insist that to \u201cpack\u201d means to compress some substance tightly about another. The word \u201cpack,\u201d however, cannot be so limited in its meaning. It is a matter of which the court may take judicial notice that objects are \u201cpacked\u201d in cotton, or sawdust, or excelsior, or oats. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>To misspell the word \u201cpack\u201d adds nothing to its registrability. California Canneries Co. v. Lush\u2019us Products Co., 49 F.(2d) 1044, 18 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 1480.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">This court has, on several occasions, had before it marks presenting substantially the same question of descriptiveness here involved. Some of these are: \u201cHoled-Tite,\u201d for egg-flats, In re Holed-Tite Packing, Inc., 70 F.(2d) 109, 21 C.C. P.A.(Patents) 1039; \u201cFeatherweight,\u201d for concrete slabs, In re Federal Cement Tile Co., 58 F.(2d) 457, 19 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 1205; \u201cPeaudouce,\u201d for skin cream, Walgreen Co. v. Godefroy Mfg. Co., 74 F.(2d) 127, 22 C.C.P.A. (Patents) 818; \u201cCopper-weld,\u201d for electric wire, cable, etc., In re Copperweld Steel Co., 62 F.(2d) 363, 20 C.C.P.A.(Patents) 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
