While the testimony in the last-mentioned hearing is not in full, appellant asserts the testimony of three witnesses taken in that proceeding \u201cso far as material\u201d is in this record. This application was heard by the four District Judges who suspended appellant and another recent appointee to the District Court, and they said there was \u201cno reason for a vacation or modification of the original order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">The order of suspension was appealable. Thatcher v. United States, 212 F. 801 (C.C.A.6). The Circuit Courts have repeatedly entertained appeals from such orders, and their jurisdiction to do so has been assumed without discussion. Costigan v. Adkins, 57 App.D.C. 153, 18 F.(2d) 803; Thomas v. Ogilby, 59 App.D.C. 282, 44 F. (2d) 890 (C.C.A.D.Col.); Bartos v. U. S. District Court, 19 F.(2d) 722 (C.C.A.8); United States v. Hicks, 37 F.(2d) 289 (C. C.A.9). Contrary holdings by the Supreme Court establishing mandamus as the proper remedy (Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 19 L.Ed. 214; Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. (86 U.S.) 513, note, 22 L.Ed. 205; Thatcher v. United States, 241 U.S. 644, 36 S.Ct. 450, 60 L.Ed. 1218) are explainable by differences in appellate jurisdiction, Thatcher v. United States, 212 F. 801 (C.C.A.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">, Alleged contradictions or repudiation of testimony are pointed out between the testimony given by the same witnesses called against the appellant in the federal and state court disbarment proceedings. Appellant insists that the testimony in the state court proceedings disproved the charges made against the appellant, but we are not required to review the weight of this argument. Upon this record the suspension was within the power of the District Court and the application for its vacation rested within its discretionary power. We have the power to review an abuse of discretion in this, as in analogous matters. United States v. Mulligan, 48 F.(2d) 93 (C.C.A.2) certiorari denied 292 U.S. 654, 54 S.Ct. 865, 78 L.Ed. 1503; Central Trust Co. of New York v. U. S. Light &amp; Heating Co., 233 F. 420 (C.C.A.2). Having found cause for appellant\u2019s suspension for five years, upon the showing made, there was no reason for vacation of that order. It is not within the scope of our review to re-examine the testimony, for there is no abuse of discretion shown in the action of the District Court. There is no justification for nullifying the measure of restraint and justifiable discipline exhibited in the original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
