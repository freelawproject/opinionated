Greschner, 59 F. (2d) 512 (C.C.A.6); Wabash Ry. Co. v. Walczkak, 49 F.(2d) 763, 765 (C.C.A.6), there was substantial evidence tending to show that the sudden appearance of the truck driver as an obstruction in the path of the car created an emergency and whether such emergency existed, and, if so, whether the driver of the car acted with due care under the circumstances, presented factual questions to- be considered and determined by the jury,</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">It is therefore ordered and adjudged that this case be and is reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
