The two other cases are In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Incorporated, 86 F.(2d) 830, 24 C.C.P.A. (Patents) -, decided December 21, 1936, and In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Incorporated, 87 F.(2d) 736, 24 C.C.P.A. (Patents) -, decided concurrently herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">Certain of the reasoning' in the first of the above-named cases is applicable here and, in the last of the cases the issue of this case is in effect determined. It is, therefore, unnecessary to enter upon any elaborate discussion here. The mark involved in this case comprises the words \u201cCanada Dry\u201d without their being associated with any map or other symbol or words. As recited in the case last named, supra, these words were disclaimed by appellant\u2019s predecessor in registration No. 155,002. Upon the authority of the last-named case, supra, and the cases therein cited, it is here held that appellant, by reason of the disclaimer, is now estopped from securing registration of \u201cCanada Dry,\u201d and the decision of the Commissioner of Patents, so adjudging, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
