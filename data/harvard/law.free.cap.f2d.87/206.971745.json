Kristeller, Esq., solicitor for and of counsel with the appellees, and Jacob Lipman, Esq., solicitor for and od counsel with the appellants, and the appellants approving the following order as to form,</p>\n<p id=\"b259-15\">\u201cNow, therefore, it is on this 9th day of January, Nineteen Hundred and Thirty-five,</p>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">\u201cOrdered, that the application to dismiss the appeal in the above entitled cause for lack of prosecution be and the same hereby is granted with costs unless on or before February 3, 1935, the appellants print the record in this cause and bring on the argument of this appeal at the March, 1935 term of this Court, in which event the application is denied without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-17\">' \u201cPer Curiam</p>\n<p id=\"b259-18\">\u201cBuffington, Presiding Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">This is therefore a motion to reopen an appeal in which a final order was entered in the October, 1934, term. During the term when it is rendered or entered of record, a judgment or an order is under the control of the court pronouncing it and may then be set aside, vacated, or modified. After that term, however, unless steps be taken for its continuance, errors in a final order or judgment can only be corrected by the court having appellate jurisdiction over the proceeding in which the order or judgment was entered. Bronson v. Schulten, 104 U.S. 410, 26 L. Ed. <em>797. </em>In this circuit our rules provide that a judgment or a final decree shall remain within the control of the court for thirty days after entry thereof even though the term shall have terminated sooner. This allows the losing party time within which to file a petition for rehearing. In the instant case, however, not only the term but the additional thirty days have long since expired. The petitioner\u2019s motion made in the October, 1936, term to set aside an order made in the October, 1934, term is obviously too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-23\">The motion to reinstate the appeal is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
