From completion of the first well, September 25, 1931, said lease had a potential natural production capacity of more than 200 barrels per day, but pro-ration orders of the state of Texas, which became effective prior to completion of the first well, have at all times restricted the aggregate production of the lease to less than 200 barrels per day. If relieved of said proration orders, the wells would have at all times exceeded 200 barrels per day, natural flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-39\">Notwithstanding the effect of said pro-ration orders, the assignee Gibson Oil Corporation through the pipe line purchaser of the oil, Magnolia Petroleum Company, \u2022to whom a division order had been given, paid appellee, Laub, on a basis of of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>production from September 29, 1931, to and including August, 1935. On October 8, 1935, the then receiver of Gibson Oil Corporation, because the proration orders restricted total production to less than 200 barrels per day, declined to permit further payments on a basis of <em>Vi, </em>hut insisted that settlement should be on a basis of <em>Va, </em>which attitude was adopted by appellants when appointed trustees of said assignee, Gibson Oil Corporation, in reorganization proceedings under section <em>7TB </em>of the Bankruptcy Act (11 \u00dc.S.C.\u00c1. \u00a7 207). Since October 8, 1935, the disputed <em>V8 </em>has been impounded, and Laub, the assignor, brought this suit to recover it and to compel future payments on a basis of</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The District Judge found for plaintiff below, Laub, holding that \u201cso long as the oil well's on said la\u00fad produced, or are capable of producing, oil by natural flow in excess of 200 barrels per day,\u201d the assignor was entitled to %.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We agree with the District Judge that the phrase \u201cin event the total production * * * shall decline to a point below 200 barrels per day\u201d has reference to the natural producing ability of the wells, and not to an artificial restriction upon production imposed by state regulations in the exercise of its police power. \u201cDecline,\u201d as here used, denotes a failing process; a tendency to a worse state; to become gradually impaired; a falling off or downward tendency.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Where a contract is clear and unambiguous, rules of construction should not be resorted to; the courts will enforce it according to its terms. We find no real ambiguity in the language here used. If the phrase in question be regarded as ambiguous, however, or susceptible of more than one shade of meaning, that interpretation will be adopted which the context in which it is found, the business to which it relates, and the \u25a0 circumstances in which it is-used, disclose that the parties intend\u2022ed it to have, giving due weight to the purpose to be attained. Cocke v. Vacuum Oil Co. (C.C.A.) 63 F.(2d) 406; Dublin Electric &amp; Gas Co. v. Thompson (Tex.Civ. App.) 166 S.W. 113; Ryan v. Kent (Tex. Com.App.) 36 S.W.(2d) 1007; 13 C.J. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">It is common knowledge that when pumping must be resorted to, the operator\u2019s overhead cost is substantially increased, and that when a well declines below 200 barrels per day natural flow, the operator\u2019s overhead is proportionately greater than when the well has a larger flow. It is customary in the Texas oil industry to require the royalty owner in these circumstances to reduce his royalty and thus share with the operator the bui'den of the decline. It is such a contingency\u2014 a decline inherent in the wells themselves \u2014 \u25a0 that is contemplated by the language of this assignment. The contract is the usual one for diminishing royalties where natural production declines. If reduction by pro-ration had been in the minds of the parties, more apt language could, and no doubt would, have been used. Proration has the effect of \u201climiting\u201d production, but such an artificially imposed limitation is not the equivalent of a \u201cdecline\u201d in production if regard be had for the ordinary usage of this language in the oil industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">.The construction urged by appellants would require the assignor, solely because of proration, to accept for his oil % of what he bargained for, though there is no \u201cdecline\u201d in the natural flow of the wells. Such a construction is not only illogical but inharmonious with ordinary experience and practice in the industry. Proration may greatly extend the period of time the operator must wait to receive the full return upon its <em>investment in </em>this venture. \u2022 It will correspondingly increase the period of time the assignor must wait to receive the consideration for which he parted with his lease. The burden thus imposed by proration is mutual. If proratioxr ultimately results in greater recovery, this advantage will be shared mutually by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">We are fortified in our construction of the assignment by another cardinal principle that when a contract is ambiguous the construction adopted by the parties will be given great, sometimes controlling, weight by the courts. Uinta Tunnel Min. &amp; Transp. Co. v. Ajax Gold Mining Co. (C.C.A.) 141 F. 563; Christenson v. Gorton-Pew Fisheries Co. (C.C.A.) 8 F.(2d) 689; 10 Texas Jur. \u00a7 171; 13 C.J. 546. The assignee, Gibson Oil Corporation, paid the assignor on a basis of <em>Vi </em>for four years, never questioning- its liability on that basis, although proration was in force during the entire time. It was the receiver of the Gibson Oil Corporation who first questioned the terms of the lease about October, 1935, after it had received a settled con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>struction by the parties thereto for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Appellants rely largely upon Butler v. Jenkins Oil Corporation (Tex.Civ.App.) 68 S.W.(2d) 248, affirmed (Tex.Com.App.) 97 S.W.(2d) 466. We regard that case as inapposite here. The language of that lease was \u201cin the event said well or wells \u2018produce\u2019 less than 190 barrels per day,\u201d the royalty should be reduced. The'Texas courts held that the word \u201cproduce\u201d was not ambiguous, and that the parties contracted with respect to actual production, that is, the number of barrels actually brought to the surface, in the absence of some hindering cause for which the assignee was responsible. That is quite a different situation from one where, as here, an assignor contracted to accept a lesser royalty in event the production \u201cdeclined\u201d below a certain number of barrels per day. We are convinced that it was the purpose of the parties to this assignment to give the assignor full royalty until the wells \u201cdeclined,\u201d i. e., fell off, in natural production.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
