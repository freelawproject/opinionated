The claim was that the agreement for security was ultra vires, and the sale of the collateral ,p.nd payment of the proceeds to the receivers unauthorized in law. Upon allegations that the receivers had thereby received payment in full of their deposit when other depositors had received only 37% per cent., the prayer was for recov-' ery of the excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-30\">The defenses were contestation of the charges of ultra vires and illegality, and that the suit was barred by the Florida statute of three years\u2019 limitation (Comp. Gen.Laws Fla.1927, \u00a7 4663, subd. 5) and by laches measured by that statute. Upon final hearing on bill and answer, the court found that the suit had been instituted more than three years after the accrual of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>alleged cause of action, and that, under the application of the three years\u2019 statute of limitation of Florida, plaintiffs\u2019 laches had barred the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Appellant\u2019s brief argues the invalidity of the pledge agreement, the right of the bank\u2019s receiver to recover the money paid under it, and whether he had lost that right by limitation and laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Appellees, in effect conceding that the agreement was ultra vires the bank, and that in an action timely brought the bank\u2019s receiver could have recovered the moneys, argue only the defenses of limitation and laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-6\">Appellant\u2019s position on these defenses is, as to limitation, that the suit being in equity, the running of time alone as prescribed in state statutes of limitation could not bar it, but only laches could; as to laches, that \u201claches is of the nature of estoppel. Courts apply it to suits in equity by analogy to the statute of limitations to protect innocent parties, and to avoid inequitable results;\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that laches in short, is compounded of time and of circumstances, making it inequitable to assert the claim; that here there is only time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">As to the time element in both limitation and laches, he insists that the suit is, under Florida statutes of limitation, one founded on an instrument of writing, and therefore for the application of its five-year statute (Comp.Gen.Laws Fla. 1927, \u00a7 4663, subd. 3), and not, as appellees contend it is, one not so founded, and therefore for the three years\u2019 statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Appellees in reply urge that the suit is really one cognizable not in equity, but at law, in its general nature an action for money had and received, which maintains that defendant has obtained money which, ex aequo et bono, he ought to return. They argue further that if the suit is maintainable in equity, it is in the exercise of a jurisdiction concurrent with that of law, and in such suits the statute of limitation is applicable in equity, not by analogy, but absolutely, just as it is at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">As to appellant\u2019s contention that the statute of five, rather than of three years, applies, appellees argue that plaintiff\u2019s suit is not at all upon the pledge agreement, to enforce it, but personally against them for moneys of the bank they have received, the action for which accrued at the time of the paying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">We think appellant\u2019s claim that the suit is founded on the pledge agreement results from a misconception, both of the nature and the effect of the statute he relies on, and of the suit he has brought. The five-year statute looks to, it embraces, actions in which the instrument of writing is relied on as the basis of the right to sue, not actions like the one at bar, where, though the relations of the parties may be at some point affected by an instrument of writing, that instrument is not declared on as the basis of the right, but is only an incident in its accrual. The right asserted here is not founded on the agreement which is alleged to be \u201cillegal and void,\u201d it springs from the duty of restitution, raised by facts which show that the money was obtained under circumstances constituting it an unjust enrichment.
