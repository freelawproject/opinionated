The three cases were based on fire loss to certain premises covered by fire insurance policies issued by the appellees. By consent, they were tried together. The legal plaintiff, Kennedy, was owner of a first mortgage on the premises covered by the insurance policies in suit. The Com Exchange National Bank, hereinafter referred to as Corn Exchange, owner of a second mortgage on the same premises, commenced foreclosure proceedings. It applied for and paid the premiums on the three fire insurance policies in suit. Each policy contained, inter alia, the following three clauses:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-29\">\u201cLoss or damage, if any, under this Policy, shall be payable to John M. Kennedy, 3rd, as mortgagee, (or trustee) a* interest may appear, and this insurance, as to the interest of the mortgagee (or trustee) only therein, shall not be invalidated by any act or neglect of the mortgagor- or owner of the within described property. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-30\">\u201cIt is understood that the buildings insured hereunder are now under foreclosure proceedings by the Com Exchange National Bank &amp; Trust Co. The premium being paid by the Corn Exchange National Bank &amp; Trust Co. it is agreed that in event of loss, same will be adjusted with the Corn Exchange National Bank &amp; Trust Co. and paid to them and John M. Kennedy, 3rd, Mortgagee, as interest may appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-31\">\u201cThis Company reserves the right to cancel this Policy at any time as provided by its terms, but in such case this Policy shall continue in force for the benefit only of the mortgagee (or trustee) for ten days after notice to the mortgagee (or trustee) of such cancellation and shall then cease, and this Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>snail have the right, on like notice, to cancel this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">After the hid at the sheriff\u2019s sale following judgment in the foreclosure suit, Winnet, attorney for the second mortgagee, Corn Exchange, orally advised Kennedy of the intention of Corn Exchange to abandon the property and cancel the policies. Corn Exchange returned the policies to the appellees. Prior to the expiration date of the policies, the premises were destroyed by fire. Thereafter Kennedy assigned his interest to Anna L. Bogash, the use plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The issue is whether the policies were in force at the time of the fire or whether Kennedy had acquiesced in their cancellation. At the trial sufficient emphasis was placed upon the question whether the conversation between Kennedy and Winnet amounted to a consent by Kennedy to a cancellation of the policies. This issue was presented to the jury which, by its verdict, must have decided it in the affirmative. Another equally important question \u2014 -that of notice \u2014 was overlooked. The appellant contends that by reason of the hereinbefore quoted covenant regarding notice, Kennedy was entitled to notice by the appellees of cancellation, that the failure of the insurance companies to notify Kennedy of the cancellation of the policies prevented the cancellations from being effective as to him, and that, therefore, as to Kennedy, they were in full force and effect at the time of the fire. This court has ruled that a mortgagee clause in a fire insurance policy results in an entirely separate insurance of the mortgagee\u2019s interest, which is not affected by acts of the owner. Queen Ins. Co. v. People\u2019s Union Sav. Bank (C.C.A.) SO F.(2d) 63. Applying this principle to the instant case, the act of the second mortgagee in tendering the policies for cancellation does \u2022not affect the rights of the first mortgagee to notice of cancellation expressly guaranteed him by the above-quoted clause of the insurance policies. We think that the question whether Kennedy\u2019s conversation with Winnet amounted to a waiver of his right to notice of cancellation was one of the fact issues which should have been presented to the jury and that-the refusal of the trial court to charge on points involving the question of notice amounted to reversible error. The \u2022judgments are reversed and new trials ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">On Petitions for Rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b736-7\">DAVIS,' Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">These cases are here on petitions for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">In our former opinion we said:</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">\u201cEach policy contained, inter alia, the following three clauses:</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">\u201c \u2018Loss or damage, if any, under this Policy, shall be payable to John M.

After this property had been sold at Sheriff\u2019s sale, did you discuss with Mr. Kennedy any question of the surrendering of these policies for cancellation? A. Yes; I did. I tried to get him to buy the policies. We determined that there was no equity, and we were not getting the title on the sheriff\u2019s sale \u2014 we just decided to abandon our bid, and I asked him if he wanted the policies, and he said how much would they cost, and I told him, and he said he wasn\u2019t going to spend another cent on the property, and I said I was going to cancel them. He says, \u2018You do what you think best. I am not going to spend another cent on them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cQ. Following that did you surrender the policies through the Corn Exchange? A. I sent them to Mr. Gottlieb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cQ. Did you advise Mr. Kennedy? A. I advised Mr. Kennedy sometime after that, telling him I was going to cancel the policies again. Our previous meeting was oral \u2014I mean, we talked this over; I don\u2019t think it was over the telephone, as Mr. Kennedy said; although it may have been. I think it was in my office and then, later on, I wrote a letter, and I received no reply to that letr ter, as far as my recollection goes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201cQ. At the time of the oral conversation what did Mr. Kennedy say when you ad^ vised him that you were going to surrender these policies or intended to surrender them? A. He said, \u2018You do whatever you think \u25a0is necessary for your client,\u2019 \u2014 the substance of it: he said, \u2018you do whatever you think is necessary for your client.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">\u201cQ. Do you have a copy of the letter ton the subject of this conversation? A. I believe I handed it to you, Mr. Schell. I .believe it has been identified already, if I am not mistaken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">\u201cQ. Is that it (indicating)? A. Yes; that\u2019s a copy of the letter that I wrote to Mr. Kennedy on February 6th. Do you .want me to read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">\u201cQ. Yes; read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">\u201cMr. Shapiro: I object. There has been no proof that this letter was received. He couldn\u2019t answer the question whether he received it or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-14\">\u201cThe Court: He said that he could not say one way or the other or he could not recall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-15\">\u201cMr. Shapiro: That is right, your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">\u201cMr. Schell: Are you objecting to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-17\">\u201cMr. Shapiro: No; I am not objecting to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-18\">\u201cBy Mr. Schell:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-19\">\u201cQ. Do you have a copy of a letter \u2014 is this the only copy of the letter which you have, following your conversation with Kennedy? A. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-20\">\u201cQ. Was there any other correspondence relative to these policies? A. I think this is the only one, Mr. Schell, after our oral conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-21\">\u201cQ. And then, following this communication, what did you do with the policies ? A'. I don\u2019t know how soon, but some time after that I sent them to Mr. Gottlieb; to the bank directly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-22\">\u201cMr. Schell: I offer in evidence this</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-23\">letter heretofore marked Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 1 for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-24\">\u201c(The said exhibit reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-25\">\u201c \u2018February 6, 1932.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-26\">\u201c \u2018Mr. John M.

Isn\u2019t it true that at no time in any of your discussions with Mr. Kennedy did he give you his consent, so far as he was concerned, to cancel the policies? Isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201cMr. Schell: That is obj ected to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">\u201cThe Court: The trouble is you are</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-9\">usurping the functions of the jury. Now, ask him what Mr. Kennedy did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-10\">\u201cBy Mr. Shapiro: Q. Is it not true that Mr. Kennedy said, when you told him that you were thinking of cancelling these policies, that so far as he was concerned he would not pay any more money and in so far as he was concerned, you could do what you thought best for the interests of your client? A. That\u2019s the substance of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-11\">\u201cQ. Did he ever at any time tell you that you could cancel all these policies ? A. He never did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">As we before said, the issue in this case was whether or not the policies were in force as to Kennedy at the date of their expiration. They were admittedly not in force as to the Corn Exchange Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">The evidence will not sustain the contention that Kennedy acquiesced in the cancellation of the policies. He told Winnet, attorney of the Corn Exchange Bank, that he was not \u201cgoing to spend another cent on the property,\u201d covered by the policies and he could do what he thought best for his client which admittedly might have involved cancellation. This was in substance all that he said. There was not a word in this conversation about acquiescence on the part of Kennedy in the sense that he was consenting to anything Winnet did as relieving the companies of their contract obligation to give Kennedy notice if they decided to cancel the policies. Neither is there in the letter later written by Winnet to Kennedy. In the letter he said to Kennedy: \u201cI am handing the various policies which were in my possession back to the bank.\u201d Winnet was not the agent of the insurance companies, and any conversation or correspondence between him and Kennedy did not and could not release the insurance companies from their written obligation to Kennedy. And, besides, what took place between Win-net and Kennedy was never brought to the knowledge of the companies. The evidence was not sufficient for the jury .to spell out of it acquiescence on the part of Kennedy to cancellation so as to relieve the companies of the necessity of giving him notice. It was, therefore, error to submit the question of acquiescence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">If Kennedy did not acquiesce in the cancellation of the policies, they were in force as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-16\">These policies protected not only the Corn Exchange Bank, but also Kennedy. They constituted a contract between him and the companies, and whatever the Corn Exchange Bank did, Kennedy had the contractual right to notice of cancellation by the companies and the policies continued in force for the benefit of him for ten days after notice. No notice to Kennedy was ever given by the companies and without such ^notice the policies could not be canceled. They expressly provide that \u201cthen,\u201d when the notice of cancellation has been given, \u201cthis company shall have the right * * * to cancel this agreement,\u201d but not until then. Kennedy had the right to rely upon this provision in the policies and the record is devoid of anything which took it away from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-17\">There were no factual contradictions in the evidence. This was assumed to be true by the parties. The plaintiff requested him to instruct the jury, \u201cthat under the evidence and the pleadings, your verdict must be for the plaintiff\u201d\u2019 and the defendant requested him to instruct the jury that, \u201cunder the pleadings and the evidence, the verdict must be for the defendants.\u201d The rule of law is well established that \u201cwhere both parties request a peremptory instruction and do nothing more they thereby assume the facts to be undisputed and, in effect, submit to the trial judge the determination of the inferences proper to be drawn therefrom.\u201d Williams v. Vreeland, 250 U.S. 295, 298, 39 S.Ct. 438, 439, 63 L.Ed. 989, 3 A.L.R. 1038. The action of the parties took the case from the jury and there was nothing for it to pass upon. In any event, the evidence will not sustain the verdict for the defendant. We did not go quite far enough when the case was here before.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-18\">Under the authority of Baltimore &amp; Carolina Line, Inc., v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654, 55 S.Ct. 890, 79 L.Ed. 1636, and Kaeppel v. Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York (C.C.A.) 78 F.(2d) 899, the petition for rehearing is denied, and the case remanded to the District Court, with direc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tions to enter judgment for the plaintiff for $11,000, with interest thereon from March 25, 1932, the amount counsel agreed to be due the plaintiff if she is entitled to a judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
