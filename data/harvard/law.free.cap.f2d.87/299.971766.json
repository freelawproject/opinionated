The defendants admitted the execution of the note, but pleaded their privilege to set off a bank deposit of the maker, the Mamaroneck Individual Laundry Inc. The facts are not in dispute. The laundry had had a deposit account in a predecessor of the plaintiff\u2019s bank, \u201cThe First National Bank and Trust Company of Mamaroneck\u201d \u2014 the \u201cOld Bank\u201d \u2014 to which it had given a demand note, dated October 31, 1930, endorsed by the defendants\u2019 testator. The plaintiff\u2019s bank, \u201cThe First National Bank in Mamaroneck\u201d \u2014 the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d \u2014 took over the \u201cOld Bank\u2019s\u201d business fourteen months later, on January IS, 1932, by assuming its debts and moving into its quarters. In consideration of that undertaking the \u201cOld Bank\u201d gave it a note in the amount of all the \u201cOld Bank\u2019s\u201d debts, and as security assigned to it its assets, among them the note in suit; the agreement between the banks providing that when any pledged note became due, the pledgee \u2014 the \u201cNew Bank\u2019.\u2019 \u2014 might renew it in its own name without change in the interests of the pledgor or pledgee. After the assignment the laundry company continued its account, now with the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d which \u201cheld itself out\u201d to both maker and endorser \u201cas sole owner\u201d of the note and of a renewal to be mentioned in a moment; both therefore knew that they were dealing with another bank. On October 27, 1932, the laundry took up the demand note by giving a renewal, payable January 27, 1933, in which the \u201cNew Bank\u201d was payee, and which the defendants\u2019 testator again endorsed. The defendants paid by far the greater part of this renewal and the case turns upon whether they may set off against the unpaid balance the laundry\u2019s deposit account in the \u201cNew Bank\u201d at the time when it closed its doors. It does not appear how much, if any, of that account was made up of deposits carried over from the \u201cOld Bank\u201d; nor does it appear whether the pledged assets of the \u201cOld Bank\u201d .were more than enough to meet its note to the \u201cNew Bank.\u201d The judge, to whom the case was tried without a jury, gave judgment for the defendants, because the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d by holding itself out to both maker and endorser as the owner of both notes, and crediting payments of interest upon them by charging the account of the laundry, had \u201cestopped\u201d itself to deny that it was in fact the owner and must therefore concede the set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">We can see no ground for an estoppel, which must rest upon some reliance by the maker or the endorser upon the putative representations of the \u201cNew Bank.\u201d The laundry might indeed have kept its deposit in that bank because the note was in effect a security for it, but there is no evidence that it did so, and the defendants had to prove it. Estoppel being eliminated, the findings do not enable us finally to dispose of the case. Whether the laundry\u2019s account was in whole or in part made up of deposits carried over from the \u201cOld Bank,\u201d or by fresh deposits in the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d can be determined by allocating first withdrawals against first deposits, according to the usual doctrine. Clayton\u2019s Case, 1 Mer. 606; United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, 737, 6 L.Ed. 199. Cf. First National Bank v. National Surety Co., 130 F. 401, 66 L.R.A. 777 (C.C.A. 6). So far as it shall then appear that the balance represented a debt of the \u201cOld Bank,\u201d the set-off was good. The \u201cNew Bank\u2019s\u201d assumption of the old debts did not release the \u201cOld Bank,\u201d whose depositors kept their privilege of using their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>deposits as a set-off against any overdue notes pledged to the \u201cNew Bank.\u201d Section 267(2) of the N.Y. Civil Practice Act. The demand note had been held for more than a year before the \u201cOld Bank\u201d pledged it \u2014 an unreasonable time \u2014 and the \u201cNew Bank\u201d was not a holder in due course. Negotiable Instruments Act (Consol.Laws N.Y. c. 38) \u00a7 92. Herrick v. Woolverton, 41 N.Y. 581, 1 Am.Rep. 461. On the other hand, so far as the laundry\u2019s account may turn out to be made up in whole or in part of deposits in the \u201cNew Bank\u201d after it began business, the privilege to set it off will depend upon whether that bank is entitled to the entire proceeds of the note; that is to say, whether the note in suit was necessary to pay the \u201cOld Bank\u2019s\u201d note. If it was, the \u201cOld Bank\u201d had no equity in it, and the claims were mutual in interest. Bailey v. Finch, L.R. 7 Q.B. 34; Becker v. Seymour, 71 Minn. 394, 73 N.W. 1096; Schaeffer v. Ruden, 61 S.D. 64, 246 N.W. 105; Aab v. French (Mo.App.) 279 S.W. 435. Cf. Wheeler v. Newbould, 16 N.Y. 392, 398. If the \u201cOld Bank\u201d had an equity, the question might still theoretically arise whether the \u201cNew Bank\u201d \u2014 the pledgee \u2014 might not elect to marshal the proceeds of the note in suit against the note of the \u201cOld Bank\u201d; but, since it is contesting the set-off, we are to assume that it will not do so, but allocate them against the equity so far as it can. Hence so far as the laundry\u2019s account turns out to have been made up of deposits in the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d its privilege of set-off will depend upon whether the pledged assets were too small to pay the \u201cOld Bank\u2019s\u201d note. It follows that the set-off should be allowed except in so far as the deposit was a debt only of the \u201cNew Bank,\u201d and then only in case the pledged assets were not enough to pay the \u201cOld Bank\u2019s\u201d note. These facts can be ascertained upon a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"> We have throughout assumed that the defendants have the same privilege as the laundry of pleading the set-off. The general rule as between principal and surety is otherwise; for the principal may prefer to reserve his claim against the creditor for prosecution on another occasion. Gillespie v. Torrance, 25 N.Y. 306, 82 Am.Dec. 355; Elliott v. Brady, 192 N. Y. 221, 85 N.E. 69, 18 L.R.A.(N.S.) 600, 127 Am.St.Rep. 898; Ettlinger v. National Surety Co., 221 N.Y. 467, 117 N.E. 945, 3 A.L.R. 865; United States v. Morley Construction Co. (D.C.) 11 F.Supp. 841. If however the principal has shown that he means to set off the claim, no injustice is done the creditor if the surety does the same. Balsley v. Hoffman, 13 Pa. 603, 611; Winston v. Metcalf, 7 Ala. 837; National Surety Co. v. Breece Lumber Co., 60 F.(2d) 847, 851 (C.C.A.10) (semble). It would seem that this should be a fortiori true when as here the creditor is insolvent, and he and the principal have but one claim against each other. Set-off is then the only way by which the principal can secure full payment, which it is safe to assume he will exact. There is however no decision on the point, though there are several dicta. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Duke, 293 F. 661, 665 (C.C.A.9) ; National Surety Co. v. Breece Lumber Co., supra; Coffin v. McLean, 80 N.Y. 560, 564; Smith\u2019s Adm\u2019rs v. Wainwright\u2019s Adm\u2019rs, 24 Vt. 97, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">The plaintiff makes a final point based upon a tender made by the laundry and kept good, sufficient to pay the unpaid balance of the note if combined with \u201cthe deposit. His theory is that although this may be a good payment, qua the maker\u2014 the laundry \u2014 it is not good, qua the endorser \u2014 the defendants. For this he relies upon Madison Square Bank v. Pierce, 137 N.Y. 444, 33 N.E. 557, 20 L.R.A. 335, 33 Am.St.Rep. 751, where it was held that the creditor may collect the debt from the principal though the surety has already paid it; a doctrine which must stand on the theory that the creditor may constitute himself a trustee of the proceeds for the surety. It would be a perversion of such a doctrine to allow the creditor to collect from the surety after the principal had paid; he could neither recover the same debt twice for himself, nor make himself a trustee for the principal of proceeds collected from the surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">We need not upset the findings of the judge in order to reverse the judgment, as the defendants seem to suppose. They rely upon an estoppel in support of which the judge made no adequate finding of fact; and while, even though he did not, we might look to the evidence for a substitute, it does not exist. Furthermore, the findings do not answer the other question on which the case turns; nor does the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Judgment reversed; new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
