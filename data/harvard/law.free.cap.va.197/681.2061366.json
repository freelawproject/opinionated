The decree was based upon alleged wilful desertion and abandonment for a period of one year. (Virginia Code, 1950, \u00a7 20-91, as amended by Acts of Assembly, 1952, ch. 100, p. 110). We granted respondent an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The first assignment of error charges: \u201cThe court erred in entering the final decree of divorce because the record showed that no notice had been given to the defendant or her attorney that the depositions would be taken.\u201d This assignment is closely alan to the second, which reads: \u201cThe court erred in entering the decree based on the depositions taken November 29, 1954, because the taking of the said depositions was contrary to both Sections 20-104 and 8-74, Code.\u201d These assignments will be treated together.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Respondent was a non-resident of Virginia, living in New York. A copy of the bill for divorce, accompanied by \u201cproof of service\u201d was served upon her there on November 3, 1954. Such service under our statute (Va. Code, 1950, \u00a7 8-74) has the effect of an order of publication \u201cduly executed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">There is no merit in respondent\u2019s contention that she was not notified of the date on which depositions were to be taken. When a respondent has been duly summoned by publication and has not appeared in person or by counsel within the period allowed, no notice of the taking of the depositions is required unless ordered by the court. Va. Code, 1950, \u00a7\u00a7 8-73, 8-74, modified by Rule of Court 2:21; Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice (Meade), \u00a7 248, p. 142; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Va. 284, 290, 72 S. E. (2d) 632, 635. As will be seen, respondent did not appear within the period allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Respondent next complains that the taking of the depositions was premature and contrary to Code, \u00a7\u00a7 20-104 and 8-74. With this we. do not agree. As aforesaid, respondent was served with a copy of the bill and \u201cproof of service\u201d in New York on November 3, 1954, and the depositions were not taken until November 29th.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">Section 20-104, which deals with the taking of depositions against non-residents, and which provides for service by an order of publication, further provides that the taking of depositions cannot be commenced until \u201cat least ten days shall have elapsed after the order of publication shall have been duly published as required by law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>This provision has not been violated in taking the depositions in this case. Personal service, such as was had in this instance, has the effect of an order of publication \u201cduly executed\u201d. (Code, \u00a7 8-74) The effect of the Rules (2:6(c) and 2:21) is to make the time after which no notice is required twenty-one days instead of ten days as provided in Code, \u00a7\u00a7 8-73 and 20-104. Rule 2:21 provides: \u201cNo notice of the taking of depositions * * * shall be required to be given to any defendant <em>* * * </em>proceeded against by order of publication <em>who has not appeared, </em>unless specially ordered by the court.\u201d (Italics supplied). And Rule 2:6(c) gives a defendant personally served outside the State twenty-one days in which to appear before the cause can be set for hearing and docketed. Therefore, in this instance, the respondent, under Rule 2:21, is a defendant \u201cwho has not appeared\u201d; and under Rule 2:6(c) the twenty-one-day provision applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It was proper to take depositions at any time after at least twenty-one days had elapsed from the time of service. Therefore, the depositions were properly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The record discloses no appearance by respondent or her attorney prior to the taking of the depositions. No answer was filed within twenty-one days as prescribed by Rule 2:7, and the case was duly \u201cset for hearing and docketed\u201d as provided by Rule 2:8, although the bill <em>for divorce </em>could not be \u201ctaken for confessed\u201d under the provisions of this Rule. See also Rule 2:11; Code, \u00a7 20-99; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, supra, </em>194 Va., at p. 290, 72 S. E. (2d), at p. 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">After a cause has been set for hearing and docketed, (where no further notice is required), the complainant may proceed to take depositions. Lile\u2019s Equity Pleading and Practice (Meade), \u00a7 251, p. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\"> The third assignment of error challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, and in our view is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">The proof establishes the fact that these parties were married in New York on April 4, 1952, and \u201ccohabited as husband and wife\u201d until April 5, 1952, at which time complainant returned to the Army. His home was in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Complainant testified that he and his wife had not lived together since the day after their marriage; that he was discharged from the Army in June, 1953, \u201cand she said she was not going to come to Richmond to live with me and told me that she didn\u2019t want to leave her people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">In an effort to corroborate the testimony of complainant, one Alvin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Bassfield testified that \u201c* * * in June, 1953, he [complainant] was in Richmond and I saw him and he said that he had gotten out of Service and I also saw a letter from Nannie to Charles stating that she was not coming to Richmond because she liked New York better than living with him. * * *\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The testimony of complainant and Bassfield comprises the evidence in the case. It will be observed that complainant nowhere mentions, the letter testified to by Bassfield; the date of the letter is not given, and there is no proof that Bassfield had any means of knowing respondent\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Complainant was in the Army from April 5, 1952 to June, 1953. During this period he was not at his home in Virginia. While the bill for divorce was filed October 28, 1954, there is no evidence in the record to show when the alleged desertion occurred. Neither is there credible evidence, aside from complainant\u2019s own testimony, to show that respondent wilfully deserted and abandoned complainant. It can hardly be said that Bassfield\u2019s testimony in any way corroborates complainant. The letter itself was the best evidence but it was not introduced, and no excuse was given for not producing it. There are too many \u201cgaps\u201d in the testimony which would, of necessity, have to be filled by surmise and conjecture in order to grant a divorce on the meagre evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Full and satisfactory proof of desertion should be required in order for the court to determine the legal question involved. A decree of absolute divorce should not be granted unless the evidence relied upon proves wilful desertion without justification or excuse, and the burden of establishing this rests on the complainant. We have no such proof in the case under consideration. <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>120 Va. 410, 412, 91 S. E. 180; <em>Grim </em>v. <em>Grim, </em>126 Va. 245, 247, 101 S.

(2d) 888, 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">For the foregoing reasons the decree is reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
