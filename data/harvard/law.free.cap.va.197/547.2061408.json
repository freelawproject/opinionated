B. Mills, an employee of defendant, Virginia Electric and Power Company, was seriously injured when he came in contact with an energized primary wire installed and maintained by the company. In his claim for compensation filed before the Industrial Commission of Virginia, he asserted that he had suffered an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The company filed a plea and defense under \u00a7 65-35,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code of 1950, in which it asserted that claimant\u2019s injury was proximately caused by his wilful misconduct and violation of safety rules promulgated by the company and known to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">As a result of complainant\u2019s injury, he suffered a retrograde amnesia, which produced a loss of memory of events immediately prior to and incident to his injury, and that prevented him from testifying as to how he was injured. On evidence offered by other witnesses, the hearing commissioner, W. F. Robinson, entered an award for compensation. In his written opinion he stated that claimant knew of and violated defendant\u2019s safety rules adopted for his benefit, but defendant had failed to prove that claimant\u2019s violation of the safety rules proximately caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Upon review the Commission concluded that claimant\u2019s wilful misconduct and violation of the safety rules were the proximate cause of the injury. The award of the hearing commissioner was vacated and compensation denied. From that finding and order, Commissioner Robinson dissented, and we granted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Claimant earnestly insists that the evidence does not support the finding of wilful misconduct and that if he were guilty of wilful misconduct, the evidence is insufficient to establish that his misconduct proximately caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The rule promulgated by the Industrial Commission under authority of \u00a7 65-35 bearing upon the defense of wilful misconduct of an employee follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201cWilful Misconduct. \u2014 If the employer or insurance carrier intends to rely upon the defense of \u2018wilful misconduct\u2019 under Section 14 [now \u00a7 65-35] of the act, it shall file with the Commission, previous to the hearing, furnishing a copy of the same to the employee or his attorney, a statement of its intent to make such defense, together with a statement of the particular act or acts relied upon as showing wilful misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\u201cIn the absence of such plea the employer may introduce evidence of wilful misconduct upon the provisions of Section 65-35, as a defense to liability on the issue there was no accident arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The defense filed by the company complies with the Commission\u2019s rule and is amply sufficient to meet the requirements of \u00a7 65-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The company\u2019s rules promulgated for the protection of its employees and contained in its safety manual required claimant to wear rubber gloves when working upon equipment carrying \u201cvoltage from 0 to 3500 phase to ground.\u201d Parts of sections 7 and 9 of the safety manual<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> embodying these rules were introduced in evidence. It was also shown that claimant was aware of these reasonable rules and requirements, and that they were rigidly enforced by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">On the day of the mishap a six-man crew of defendant\u2019s employees, under the supervision and direction of foreman L. S. Painter, was engaged in the repair of defendant\u2019s electric lines in the city of Newport News, Virginia. The undertaking required that the linemen work upon three or more poles, upon which an energized electric line was suspended. The crew, exclusive of Painter, consisted of one first class lineman, four second class linemen (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>claimant), and B. J. Walker, a less experienced employee, classified as a \u201csecond class lineman learner.\u201d Claimant had been in the employ of defendant for several years and was classified as a second class lineman. He had acquired considerable experience in work of this character, and the testimony of his foreman discloses that he was competent to undertake and perform the work assigned to him at the time he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Shortly prior to his injury Mills came down from a pole where he had been working, removed his rubber gloves and sleeves and placed them in the pocket on his belt. Foreman Painter then directed him to go up another pole where Walker was working \u201cto show him and tell him\u201d how to make a tie, which was termed by Painter as \u201cquite a simple job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">To make a tie a short wire is placed around an insulator on the pole arm, and by it the energized wire is secured to the insulator. In this instance the tie wire was in place on the insulator, and the work required of claimant \u201cwas just a matter of tightening it up\u201d to hold the energized wire more securely to the insulator.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The primary wire on which this tie was to be made carried a 3450 unit delta voltage, and when claimant was directed to make the tie he knew that this was a live wire and he had been warned by his foreman about working on an energized circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">After telling claimant to make the tie, Painter\u2019s attention was directed elsewhere and he did not see Mills go up the pole. How he became apprised of the mishap and what he saw is disclosed by the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">\u201cQ. What called your attention to the accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\">\u201cA. I heard an arc and heard somebody groan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201cQ. An electric arc?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">\u201cQ. What did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-13\">\u201cA. I looked up the pole and Mills was in contact with his right hand and I said, \u2018Good God, somebody get down here quick.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">In response to Painter\u2019s exclamation and request, Guy C. Higgins, the lineman first class among the crew, rescued Mills. He accomplished this by going up the pole, putting his own safety belt around Mills and then knocking Mills\u2019 hook loose and releasing his foot from where it was held by a guy wire. By freeing Mills\u2019 hook and foot, he was caused to fall away from the wire and break the contact. Higgins then applied resuscitation and carried Mills to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ground. Both Higgins and another witness, J. H. Dawson, Jr., stated that when they heard Painter\u2019s exclamation, they looked and saw Mills and that his contact with the wire at that time was along the side of his face and ear. His hands were then hanging down and smoke was coming from his feet. When he was freed from his contact and brought to the ground, his rubber gloves were in his glove pocket and he had on his canvas-sleeved, leather-palmed gloves. Upon examination of the gloves that he was wearing, it was found that there was a burned hole through the inner leather surface over the middle finger of the right-hand glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">In the attending physician\u2019s report, his injuries were described as \u201cpoint bums on right hand and both feet and face. Third degree bums on both feet, left calf, right hand and right ear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Upon evaluation of the evidence, all three of the commissioners concluded that claimant had violated reasonable safety rales promulgated for his protection and of which he was aware. In the majority opinion written by Commissioner Nuckols, there is the additional finding of fact that claimant\u2019s wilful misconduct in failing to wear his rubber gloves was the proximate cause of the accident. This finding is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cThe leather glove which Mills was wearing at the time showed evidence of a burn at the middle finger. When first observed, following his contact with the energized line, Mills\u2019 hand was in contact with the wire. The only reasonable conclusion to be deduced from this fact is that his failure to observe the rule requiring him to wear rubber gloves while working on such lines was the proximate cause of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The questions of whether or not a claimant has been guilty of wilful misconduct and whether such misconduct was a proximate cause of the employee\u2019s accident are issues of fact. 58 Am. Jur., Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 201, p. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Section 65-94 provides that the decision of the Commission \u201cshall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact * * and we have no right to disturb the Commission\u2019s finding of fact if it be supported by credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">\u201cIn applying this section [65-94], we have repeatedly held that the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding of fact which is sustained by credible evidence is binding upon this court.\u201d <em>Rust Engineering Co. </em>v. Ramsey, 194 Va. 975, 978, 76 S. E. (2d) 195. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Nolde Brothers, </em>189 Va. 932, 55 S. E. (2d) 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The facts in <em>Riverside </em>&amp; <em>Dan River Cotton Mills, et al. </em>v. <em>Thaxton, etc., </em>161 Va. 863, 172 S. E. 261, show that the employee was instantly killed when he came in contact with an energized wire. There, as here, the company relied upon the defense of wilful misconduct, and it was proved that the safety rule was known to Thaxton. It required the employee to cut off the circuits to both the power line and the street light line before climbing any concrete pole carrying these circuits. Before climbing the concrete pole, Thaxton cut off the street light circuit but failed to cut the power line circuit and when he came in contact with the latter circuit, he was killed. Upon these facts compensation was denied Thaxton\u2019s dependent by the Commission on the ground of his wilful misconduct, and upon appeal we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">If the safety rule is reasonable and is known to the employee and for his benefit, and yet he intentionally does the forbidden act, then he is guilty of wilful misconduct within the meaning of \u00a7 65-35. The employer is not required to prove that the employee, with the rule in mind, purposely determined to break it.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201cIf an employee with years of experience <em>* </em>* * is to be allowed to recover compensation on account of an injury due directly to his disregard of an absolutely fundamental measure of safety, which he admits he well knew, then there would be no case in which the provisions of Section 14 [now \u00a7 65-35] of the act would apply.\u201d <em>Tate </em>v. <em>Blackwood Coal &amp; Coke Co., </em>11 O. I. C. 38, 41 (1929). <em>King </em>v. <em>Empire Collieries Co., </em>148 Va. 585, 139 S. E. 478; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>71 Ga. App. 464, 31 S. E. (2d) 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Foreman Painter was the first one to see what part of claimant\u2019s body was in contact with the energized wire. When the noise made by the flashing arc caused him to look, Mills\u2019 right hand was upon the fine. Higgins and Dawson did not look until they heard Painter\u2019s exclamation, and it was then that Mills\u2019 face was against the wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The evidence clearly proves that claimant knew of and violated the reasonable rule that required him to wear rubber gloves for his own safety when he undertook to make the tie. The Commission was warranted in concluding that defendant proved that claimant\u2019s right hand first came in contact with the energized wire. It was also justified in concluding that defendant had carried the burden of proof and established that claimant\u2019s violation of the reasonable rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>requiring him to wear rubber gloves when in close proximity to an energized wire was the proximate cause of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We find no error in the record and the order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\"> No compensation shall be allowed for an injury or death:</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">(1) due to the employee\u2019s wilful misconduct, including intentional self-inflicted injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">* * * #</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">(4) due to wilful failure or refusal to use a safety appliance or perform a duty required by statute or the wilful breach of any rule or regulation adopted by the employer and approved by the Industrial Commission and brought prior to the accident to the knowledge of the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-14\">The burden of proof shall be upon him who claims an exemption or forfeiture under this section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> \u201cSection VII, Subsection D, 2, b and c, on page 34 of the Virginia Electric and Power Company Safety Manual. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">\u201c(b) Employees working on overhead poles, ladders, or structures shall wear rubber gloves when working on energized conductors and equipment with voltage from 0 to 3,500 phase to ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">\u201c(c) Employees shall stop when the top of their heads are three feet or more below the lowest conductors or electrical equipment and put on their rubber gloves before going higher.
