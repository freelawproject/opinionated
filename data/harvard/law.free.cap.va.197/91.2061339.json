The present appellants, who were petitioners in the court below, challenged the ruling, and on November'5, 1953, filed their petition with the clerk of the Circuit Court seeking a writ of certiorari and a restraining order. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>following day a copy of the petition, together with a subpoena in chancery, was served on all parties named as defendants except one, as to whom the return was made \u201cnot found\u201d. No question is raised as to the propriety of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On January 29, 1954, an order was entered transferring the cause to the law side of the docket, and on February 15, 1954, the court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">On March 26, 1954, the attorney for the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the petition had not been \u201cpresented to the court\u201d within thirty days, within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 15-873 and 15-874, Code of Virginia, 1950. On May 7, 1954, the court sustained the motion to dismiss, from which decision we granted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The assignments of error dealing with the propriety of the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals permitting the variance were not passed upon by the lower court and therefore cannot be considered by us. <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>Kress Box Co., </em>154 Va. 421, 153 S. E. 649; <em>Yukon Pocahontas Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Ratliff, </em>175 Va. 366, 8 S. E. (2d) 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The sole question for our consideration is whether or not the petition was \u201cpresented to the court\u201d within the meaning of the applicable Code sections (15-873 and 15-874).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">It is conceded by appellees that the petition was filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the Circuit Court of Arlington County within the thirty-day period. They contend, however, that the filing in the clerk\u2019s office did not meet the statutory requirement that the petition shall be \u201cpresented to the court\u201d, and argue that methods of appeal, where prescribed by statute, are jurisdictional and must be strictly complied with. Citing <em>Braswell </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>194 Va. 39, 72 S. E. (2d) 336; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>County Board, </em>192 Va. 329, 64 S. E. (2d) 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The applicable portion of \u00a7 15-873, Virginia Code, 1950, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">\u201cAny person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, or bureau of the county, may present to the circuit court of such county a petition, duly verified, and specifying the grounds on which he or they are aggrieved' * * *. Such petition shall be <em>presented to the court </em>within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.\u201d (Italics supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Section 15-874 of the Virginia Code provides that upon presenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>tion of such petition the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of zoning appeals, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">There appears to be no Virginia decision construing these sections or the meaning of the phrase \u201cpresented to the court\u201d. However, comparing the Virginia Code section (15-873) with section 179-b of the Consolidated Laws of New York, Chapter 64, we find that the New York statute provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">\u201cAny person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of the board of appeals, or any officer, department, board or bureau of the village, may present to a court of record a petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality. Such petition must be <em>presented to the court </em>within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\u201cUpon the presentation of such petition, the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of appeals to review such decision <em>* '* </em>(Italics supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The wording of the Virginia and New York statutes is for all practical purposes identical. Both were evidently taken from the model \u201cStandard State Zoning Enabling Act\u201d, which contains the provision \u201cshall be presented to the court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The New York statute was construed in <em>Barns </em>v. <em>Osborne, et al., 286 </em>N. Y. 403, 36 N. E. (2d) 638, 639. The court there had under consideration that part of \u00a7 179-b which provides: \u201cSuch petition must be presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board.\u201d The decision sought to be reviewed was dated July 27, 1940. The petition for review was filed on August 14, 1940, and was made returnable at the special term to be held on September 7, 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">On the return day of the petition a motion was made to dismiss on the ground that it had not been \u201cpresented to the court\u201d within thirty days after the filing of the decision, as required by the provisions of \u00a7 179-b. The motion to dismiss was sustained and the decision was affirmed by the Appellate Division. The New York Court of Appeals, reversing the holding, said: \u201cWe think the petition was \u2018presented to the court\u2019 in the fair sense of section 179-b when (within the time limitation prescribed by that section) the jurisdiction of the court was invoked in accordance with the statutory provisions which regulate the practice respecting motions and orders,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The above ruling is in accord with our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Appellees cite the case of <em>Ballman </em>v. <em>Duffecy, </em>230 Ind. 220, 102 N. E. (2d) 646, as authority to sustain their position. It will be seen from reading the opinion in that case that the Indiana court had under consideration section 53-785 of Burns\u2019 1951 Replacement which involved a provision requiring the board of zoning appeals within twenty days from the date of citation to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not issue. Thus the ruling in the Indiana case is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, Vol. 33, p. 450, dealing with the phrase \u201cpresented to the court\u201d, cites the case of <em>Rassieur </em>v. <em>Zimmer, </em>249 Mo. 175, 155 S. W. 24, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\u201cA demand against a decedent\u2019s estate, otherwise sufficient, which, after proper notice to the administrator, was lodged with the clerk of the probate court and filed by him before the statutory two years had elapsed, was \u2018presented to the court\u2019 in the sense of the statute, from the date of the filing as required by Rev. St. 1909, sec. 195, Mo. St. Ann. sec. 187, p. 117, and is not barred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-8\"><em>Barns </em>v. <em>Osborne, et al., supra, </em>is the only other case cited in Words and Phrases dealing with the subject, and it is referred to in the cumulative supplement to 'Volume 33. See also definition of \u201cCourt\u201d, 21 C. J. S., Courts, \u00a7 15(a), p. 29; 14 Am. Jur., Courts, \u00a7 2, pp. 247, 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">Appellees argue that to interpret the phrase \u201cpresented to the court\u201d as synonymous with \u201cpresented to the clerk\u201d would impose \u201can unsurmountable burden\u201d in their path \u201cin that a petition for certiorari could conceivably lie in the clerk\u2019s office for many months before the applicant for the variance would be aware of it. Thus, he may have completed the proposed improvements under the assumption that no appeal from the board\u2019s decision has been taken <em>* * </em>Such an argument could apply to any proceeding required to be filed in a clerk\u2019s office, if we assume that the clerk will not do his duty and issue process thereon. In the instant case the party who secured the variance would be required to secure a budding permit before proceeding with \u201cthe proposed improvements\u201d, and such a permit would hardly be issued in the face of a petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">We think a more logical argument is on the side of the appellants. Many Virginia judges have four or five counties in their circuits, and if a judge happened to be away from a county for more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>thirty days, as is often the case, the right would be denied a petitioner seeking the review of a zoning board\u2019s decision. However, the clerk\u2019s office, an integral adjunct of the court, is constantly available for the filing of such petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We are of the opinion that the trial court erred in dismissing the appellants\u2019 petition as it was \u201cpresented to the court\u201d in the fair sense of \u00a7 15-873 of the Virginia Code, 1950, within the thirty day limitation prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
