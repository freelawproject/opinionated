The processor paid the proceeds to its secured lender to reduce its loan balance. Unpaid almond growers that sold their crops to the processor on credit sued the secured lender to recover the proceeds. The growers claimed California\u2019s producer\u2019s lien statute gave them rights to the proceeds that were superior to the lender\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">The trial court ruled in favor of the secured lender by (1) sustaining a demurrer to the growers\u2019 claims of conversion and unfair business practices and (2) granting summary judgment on the growers\u2019 remaining claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>intentional interference with contractual relations, unjust enrichment, and money had and received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">The growers appeal and ask this court to resolve a question of law that has not been addressed by a California appellate court\u2014to wit, whether California\u2019s producer\u2019s lien statute grants a producer rights to the proceeds from a processor\u2019s sale of farm products that have priority over the rights of other claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">We conclude that the provision in Food and Agricultural Code section 55638<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that imposes a legal obligation on processors to use the proceeds of sales of farm products to pay producers necessarily creates a correlative right in producers to be paid from the proceeds generated by such sales. The producer\u2019s right to be paid from the proceeds meets the ordinary definition of \u201clien.\u201d As a lien granted to producers, the right to be paid from the proceeds constitutes a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d for purposes of the priority provisions contained in section 55633. As a result, the growers\u2019 claims to the proceeds from the processor\u2019s sale of almonds are prior in dignity to the lender\u2019s claim based on its security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">Therefore, the judgment will be reversed. The growers may pursue theories of recovery for money had and received, conversion, unjust enrichment (quasi-contract), and unfair business practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Each of the numerous plaintiffs in this case is an almond grower (collectively, Growers). Central Valley Processing, Inc. (Processor), a California corporation, was a processor of almonds with facilities located in Merced, California. Defendant American Ag Credit (Secured Lender) is a production credit association<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that acts as an agricultural lender and has an office in Merced, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">Growers delivered almonds from the 2002-2003 harvest to Processor. Each Grower delivered its almonds pursuant to a contract with Processor and in return received a promise of payment by Processor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>On April 5, 2000, Processor began a lending relationship with Secured Lender\u2019s predecessor in interest, Central Valley Production Credit Association, which extended a $4 million revolving line of credit to Processor. The initial disbursement under the line of credit was approximately $2.3 million used by Processor to pay off a preexisting loan from California Federal Bank. In November 2000, Processor paid the balance on its line of credit with Central Valley Production Credit Association to zero and maintained that zero balance until another draw was taken on January 4, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">On June 25, 2001, Processor executed documents reflecting a $4,001,000 line of credit with Secured Lender. Processor paid the line of credit balance to zero in late November 2001, and drew against the line of credit on January 22, 2002. When the line of credit matured on April 1, 2002, the balance Processor owed was $4 million. Secured Lender renewed the line of credit on July 9, 2002, and established a new maturity date of November 1, 2002. The principal sum of the renewed line of credit was $4 million. The collateral securing Secured Lender\u2019s line of credit included Processor\u2019s inventory, accounts receivable, and the equipment at the facility Processor operated in Merced, California.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">The line of credit also was secured by the personal guarantees of five of Processor\u2019s shareholders. The five persons were the general partners of Merced Almond Venture, a California general partnership, which held title to the real estate where Processor\u2019s facility was located.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Processor did not pay the line of credit to zero by the November 1, 2002, maturity date. As a result, the loan officer sent Processor a letter dated December 11, 2002, that (1) described an earlier discussion between the loan officer and Processor about sources of funds for the repayment of the line of credit and (2) stated \u201c[i]t is imperative that this loan pay to $0 as agreed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>On February 21, 2003, Processor filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California. Processor\u2019s bankruptcy case was converted to a chapter 7 proceeding on November 26, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Between the July 2002 renewal of Processor\u2019s line of credit and its filing for bankruptcy, Processor paid Secured Lender (1) $94,448.21 on July 26, 2002, (2) $300 on August 20, 2002, (3) $51,550.68 on October 1, 2002, and (4) $243,024.64 on December 12, 2002.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Secured Lender asserts that the only payment of principal it received under the line of credit was in the amount of $200,000, thus implying that the other amounts received were for interest and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court dated June 2003, additional funds were paid to Secured Lender subject to any claims that Growers might have had to those funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Two groups of Growers filed complaints against Secured Lender. The cases were consolidated. All Growers assert claims against Secured Lender based on the same five legal theories\u2014(1) intentional interference with economic relations, (2) money had and received, (3) conversion, (4) unjust enrichment, and (5) unfair business practice in violation of section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">Secured Lender filed a demurrer contending that the five legal theories asserted by Growers all failed to state a claim. The superior court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the third cause of action, for conversion, and the fifth cause of action, for violation of the unfair competition law, and otherwise overruled it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">In December 2004, Secured Lender moved for summary judgment or, in the alternative, for summary adjudication as to the remaining claims asserted by Growers. Secured Lender contended that Growers could not show (1) that it engaged in any conduct that induced Processor to breach its contracts with Growers, (2) that Secured Lender received any money to which Growers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>were entitled, or (3) that Secured Lender was enriched at the expense of Growers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The superior court granted Secured Lender\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the grounds that (1) Secured Lender\u2019s mere acquiescence in Processor\u2019s decision not to pay Growers was insufficient to create a triable issue of fact whether Secured Lender intentionally interfered with the contractual relationships between Processor and Growers and, (2) Growers\u2019 statutory lien did not extend to the accounts receivable or sale proceeds arising out of the sale of the 2002 crop by Processor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Judgment in favor of Secured Lender was filed on March 28, 2005. Growers filed a notice of appeal on April 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">The fundamental dispute between Growers and Secured Lender concerns Growers\u2019 claims to the proceeds generated by Processor\u2019s sale of almonds to third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">Growers contend they are entitled \u201cto recover the wrongfully diverted proceeds of the sale of their almonds.\u201d First, they contend, they had clear contractual rights to those proceeds; second, they had rights under those provisions of the producer\u2019s lien statute that address proceeds from the sale of processed farm products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">In contrast, Secured Lender contends that all of Growers\u2019 legal theories fail because Growers had no lien or other right, at any time, in the almond sale proceeds. Secured Lender also contends that its rights as the holder of a security interest in Processor\u2019s inventory, accounts receivable, and proceeds lawfully entitled it to collect the proceeds from the almond sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-10\">These contentions can be reduced to two specific issues. First, did Growers have any rights to the proceeds from the almond sales? Second, if Growers had rights to the proceeds, are those rights superior to a security interest?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\">I. <em>Growers Held Rights to the Proceeds</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">A. <em>Background on Statutory Producer\u2019s Lien</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">Producer\u2019s liens in farm products held by processors are the subject of division 20 (Processors, Storers, Dealers, and Distributors of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>Agricultural Products), chapter 6 (Processors of Farm Products), article 9 (\u00a7\u00a7 55631-55653) of the Food and Agricultural Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">The producer\u2019s lien improves the position of a farmer who sells his or her farm products to a processor under an express or implied contract that provides for the processor to pay the producer later. (\u00a7 55631; Note, <em>The California Agricultural Producer\u2019s Lien, Processing Company Insolvencies, and Federal Bankruptcy Law: An Evaluation and Alternative Methods of Protecting Farmers </em>(1985) 36 Hastings L.J. 609, 612 <em>(Agricultural Producer\u2019s Lien).) </em>The lien covers the full amount owed to the producer or, if a price or method of determining it was not set by the contract, the value of the farm product on the date of delivery. (\u00a7 55631.) The lien attaches and is given priority upon the delivery to the processor<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of farm product grown by the producer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No further steps are required. (\u00a7\u00a7 55632, 55633, 55635.) The lien attaches to all raw and processed forms of the farm product that have not been segregated from the producer\u2019s farm product, and it remains attached to such product while the product is in the processor\u2019s possession. (\u00a7 55634.) The lien does not reach, and a processor may sell, product in excess of the amount owed to producers. (\u00a7\u00a7 55631, 55638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">B. <em>Statutory Provision Concerning Proceeds of Farm Products </em>1. <em>Statutory language</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The only statutory reference to proceeds that is relevant to this case<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is contained in the last sentence of section 55638. That section provides in full: \u201cIt is unlawful for any processor to remove, from this state or beyond his ownership or control, any farm product which is delivered to him, or any processed form of the farm product, to which any of the liens provided for in this chapter has attached, except for any of such product or processed product as may be in excess of a quantity on hand which is of a value that is sufficient to satisfy all existing liens. Furthermore, this section shall not prohibit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>sale of any farm product or processed form of the product to which such a lien has attached, so long as the <em>total proceeds of the sale </em>are used to satisfy obligations to producers which are secured by a lien established pursuant to this chapter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Thus, the question whether Growers have any rights in the proceeds from the almond sales depends on the meaning given to the last sentence of section 55638.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">2. <em>Legislative history</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">The last sentence of section 55638 was added to the producer\u2019s lien statute as part of amendments adopted in 1979. (Stats. 1979, ch. 969, \u00a7 5, p. 3322.) In addition to allowing processors to sell farm product or its processed form so long as the total proceeds of the sale are used to satisfy obligations to producers secured by statutory liens, the 1979 amendments to the producer\u2019s lien statute eliminated a provision that limited the lien\u2019s duration to 60 days and repealed procedures that allowed a lender to obtain priority over the holder of a producer\u2019s lien by providing new value to a processor. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Assem. Bill No. 774, 4 Stats. 1979 (Reg. Sess.) Summary Dig., p. 293.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">A California Senate Committee on the Judiciary report stated the purpose of the proposed amendments was \u201cto insure that growers can maintain an enforceable lien on farm products delivered to canners.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 774 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 20, 1979, p. I.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The report also described the inadequacy of the existing structure of the producer\u2019s lien as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1074-8\">\u201cProponents assert that a 60-day lien period is inadequate given the untimeliness of payments which have historically plagued the agricultural industry. Often, a grower may not know that the processor is in financial straits until long past the 60 day period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>\u201cProponents also maintain the elimination of the procedure whereby lenders can preclude the producer\u2019s lien recognizes that a product yet unpaid for by the processor is not his to pledge away to the bank. Growers stand more or less defenseless when the processor pledges away the grower\u2019s pack, since the only thing of value that they possess to insure getting paid is their product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">\u201cLenders, on the other hand, can seek security interests in other assets held by the processor, i.e., real property, machinery and equipment, furniture and other fixtures. Should a processor default on a bank loan, the bank does not face financial ruin, as the grower might.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 774 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 20, 1979, pp. 2-3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Next, the report describes how opposition to the original version of the bill led to a compromise that resulted in the sentence at issue in this appeal being added to section 55638:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">\u201cWhen this bill was originally heard in this Committee in July, it was opposed by basically two groups: lending institutions and food processors. Opponents feared that AB 774 would eliminate inventory financing, thus seriously jeopardizing the smaller canners\u2019 ability to operate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-8\">\u201cHowever, on August 1 a meeting was held among proponents and opponents which resulted in amendments to AB 774 which removed the opposition of canners and bankers. The latest version of the bill would give growers a priority lien on their product, although any of such product in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the total amount owed to growers under contract would be free and clear of the lien. Thus, bankers would still be able to lend to canners on their inventory when the value of the inventory exceeded the total amount of liens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-9\">\u201cIn addition, existing . . . Sec. 55638 prohibits a processor from removing or selling any farm product delivered to him upon which a lien attaches, except any of that product as may be in excess of inventory on hand which has a value sufficient to satisfy all existing liens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-10\">\u201cFor example, if processor X has an inventory of farm products worth $100,000, but growers A, B and C have farm product liens totalling $75,000, X is prohibited from reducing his inventory on hand below $75,000 worth of goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>\u201cThis bill would amend Sec. 55638 to allow X to sell below the $75,000 figure, so long as the total proceeds from such sale are used to satisfy obligations to growers which are secured by lien.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 774 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 20, 1979, pp. 3-4.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Based on this legislative history, we conclude that the main objective of the 1979 amendments was to see that producers would be paid for their product. Consistent with this objective, the legislative history identifies only one use for proceeds generated by the sale of farm product subject to a producer\u2019s lien\u2014the payment of producers who hold the lien. In contrast, Secured Lender has cited and we have located no legislative materials that state or imply that proceeds (such as cash or accounts receivable) generated by the sale of farm products subject to a producer\u2019s lien are part of the collateral available to lenders with security interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">C. <em>Processor\u2019s Payment Obligation and Producer\u2019s Correlative Right</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">We recognize that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of California has addressed the same issue of statutory construction that we address here and has held that California\u2019s statutory producer\u2019s lien does not extend to proceeds of the sale of the farm product. <em>(In re Sargent Walnut Ranches, Inc. </em>(Bankr. E.D.Cal. 1998) 219 B.R. 880 <em>{Sargent).) </em>The bankruptcy court addressed section 55638, but its discussion was based mainly on statements made by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>In re Loretto Winery, Ltd. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 898 F.2d 715 <em>{Loretto) </em>and inferences drawn from those statements. <em>{Sargent, supra, </em>at pp. 884-885.) The <em>Loretto </em>decision may have caused the bankruptcy court not to analyze what legal obligations were created by section 55638 and the correlative rights associated with those obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Our analysis of section 55638, however, is not constrained by the holding or analysis used in <em>Loretto.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Instead, we will examine (1) the language used and (2) the consequences of the competing interpretations advocated by the parties to determine if those interpretations promote or frustrate the legislative purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>What did the Legislature mean when it stated that a processor\u2019s sale of raw or processed farm product is not prohibited \u201cso long as the total proceeds of the sale are used to satisfy obligations to producers\u201d? (\u00a7 55638.) Despite the awkwardness created by phrasing this provision as a condition subsequent,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the \u201cplain and commonsense meaning\u201d <em>{Garcia v. McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 476 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906]) of this language is clear\u2014processors are obligated by law to use the sale proceeds to pay producers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">A duty is defined as \u201can obligation for which somebody else has a corresponding right.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (7th ed. 1999) p. 521.) Thus, the language in section 55638 that imposes a duty on processors simultaneously creates a right in the producer of farm product to be paid by the processor from the proceeds generated by the processor\u2019s sale of the product. (See Hohfeld, Fundamental Legal Conceptions, <em>supra, </em>at p. 36 [duty and right are correlatives].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">The bankruptcy court in <em>Sargent </em>rejected the existence of such a right by stating it would \u201cnot \u2018imply\u2019 a lien on proceeds or any other right or remedy not provided by the statute.\u201d <em>{Sargent, supra, </em>219 B.R. at p. 884.) Our recognition of the producer\u2019s right to be paid from proceeds, however, is not \u201cimplied\u201d from the statutory provisions. We merely describe the legal relationship expressly created by section 55638 from a different perspective\u2014a perspective that uses the jural correlative of the legal obligation expressed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Under this analysis, the producer-processor relationship concerning the proceeds can be described either (1) as the duty of the processor to apply the proceeds from the sale of farm product to pay the producer or, correlatively, (2) as the right of a producer to be paid by the processor from the proceeds generated by the processor\u2019s sale of farm product. Language that creates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>duty necessarily creates the right. Conversely, if the statute had been expressed in terms of a right to proceeds,, it would necessarily have created a duty with respect to the proceeds. Because the duty is expressed plainly in section 55638 and the concept of jural correlatives is a fundamental, well-established principle of jurisprudence, recognition of the duty\u2019s jural correlative is nothing more than an application of the rule that statutory language must be given its \u201cplain and commonsense meaning.\u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Secured Lender\u2019s arguments suggest that section 55638 does not impose an enforceable legal duty on processors with respect to use of the proceeds, but instead allows processors the choice of (1) paying the producers with the proceeds or (2) using the proceeds for other purposes and risking the civil and criminal penalties set forth in the statute. One implication of this argument is that the courts and various, creditors involved must defer to the processor\u2019s choice. In other words, once the processor has implemented its decision whether or not to comply with the conditional language in section 55638, a court\u2019s power does not extend to redirecting the proceeds to the appropriate recipient but is limited to penalizing the processor in accordance with the statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Assuming for purposes of argument that the producer\u2019s lien statute is ambiguous regarding whether a producer may bring an action to enforce the duty and correlative rights created by the last sentence of section 55638, we evaluate the merits of Secured Lender\u2019s proposed interpretation based on whether it promotes or frustrates the statutory purpose. We reject Secured Lender\u2019s statutory construction of section 55638 because it would undermine the legislative purpose of protecting producers. Allowing processors to irreversibly choose who to pay would create situations in which the optimal choice for the financially troubled processor (or those who control its actions) is to pay a particular creditor over a producer when the benefits of paying that creditor outweigh the risk of the criminal and civil penalties that might be imposed for violations of section 55638. Where, as here for example, a particular creditor has personal guarantees from the principals and officers of the processor, the benefits of reducing the personal liability under the guarantees could be greater than the potential penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>In summary, the meaning of the last sentence of section 55638 is clear. Processors have a legal duty to use the proceeds from the sale of farm product subject to a producer\u2019s lien to pay the producer, and the producer has the right to be paid with those proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">II. <em>Priority of Producer\u2019s Rights to the Proceeds from Farm Product</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The next question is whether Growers\u2019 rights to be paid from the proceeds of almond sales are superior to the security interest held by Secured Lender. Existing precedent does not provide a direct answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">A. <em>Producer\u2019s Rights in Proceeds Meet the Definition of a Lien</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">The first step in our analysis of priority is to determine whether a producer\u2019s right to be paid by the processor from proceeds generated by the sale of raw or processed farm product should be characterized as a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">The producer\u2019s lien statute does not itself define the terms \u201clien\u201d or \u201cproducer\u2019s lien.\u201d Generally, the term \u201clien\u201d is defined as a \u201clegal right or interest that a creditor has in another\u2019s property, lasting usu. until a debt or duty that it secures is satisfied.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict., <em>supra, </em>p. 933; cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 3439.01, subd. (f) [\u201clien\u201d defined in Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">Applying this definition of lien to the facts of this case, we conclude that the legal right of Growers to be paid by Processor from the sales proceeds can be characterized as a lien. Growers are creditors of Processor, Processor holds property interests in the proceeds, and nothing in the statute terminates Growers\u2019 right to be paid from the proceeds (or its correlative, Processor\u2019s legal obligation to pay) before the debt Processor owes Growers is satisfied. Therefore, we conclude a producer\u2019s right to be paid from the proceeds constitutes a lien on the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-11\">B. <em>Producer\u2019s Rights in Proceeds Have Priority Under Section 55633</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">The second step in our analysis concerns whether the producer\u2019s right to be paid by the processor from proceeds generated by the sale of raw or processed farm products, which we have characterized as a lien, is a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d for purposes of the priority provisions set forth in section 55633. \u201cThe producer\u2019s lien is a preferred lien prior in dignity to all other liens, claims, or encumbrances except\u201d for certain wage and salary claims for labor provided to the processor and certain liens of warehousemen. (\u00a7 55633.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>There are three ways the producer\u2019s lien statute could have dealt with the question whether the right of a producer to be paid from sale proceeds is part of the \u201cproducer\u2019s lien.\u201d The statute could have expressly included the right in the producer\u2019s lien or expressly excluded it; or, as is actually the case, it could have failed to address the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The question is answered, however, by a straightforward application of the terms. The rights are a lien on the proceeds; those rights are held by producers; therefore, the rights are literally a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">This construction of the statute must be examined to confirm that it promotes rather than frustrates legislative purpose and that it does not produce absurd consequences. <em>(Coburn v. Sievert, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.4th at p. 1495.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">The Legislature has stated that the purposes of the Food and Agricultural Code are \u201cpromoting and protecting the agricultural industry of the state\u201d and \u201cprotecting] the public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d (\u00a7 3.) To accomplish these purposes, its provisions \u201cshall be liberally construed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Based on these general statements of purpose and, as well, on the enforcement and punitive measures provided in the Food and Agricultural Code, this court previously has stated that the Legislature clearly intended that \u201c \u2018producers shall be assured full payment for their farm products.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McKee v. Bell-Carter Olive Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1230, 1237 [231 Cal.Rptr. 304].) Furthermore, as we concluded earlier, the purpose of the 1979 amendments was to see that producers would be paid for their product. (See pt. I.B.2, <em>ante.) </em>Stated otherwise, the 1979 amendments to the producer\u2019s lien statute enacted changes \u201cto strengthen the position of farmers as against lenders to the processor.\u201d <em>(Agricultural Producer\u2019s Lien, supra, </em>36 Hastings L.J. at p. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">We conclude that a construction that treats a producer\u2019s claim to the proceeds as a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d entitled to priority under section 55633 promotes the general purposes of the producer\u2019s lien statute as well as the 1979 amendment\u2019s specific purpose of seeing that producers would be paid for their product. In contrast, adopting Secured Lender\u2019s statutory constructions would frustrate the statutory purpose of the 1979 amendments and create an anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">To illustrate the drawbacks of the alternative statutory constructions suggested by Secured Lender, we begin by applying those constructions to the factual situation in which the processor has complied with the directive in section 55638 and paid the proceeds to the producer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>The first statutory construction recognizes that a producer may have rights to sale proceeds but concludes that those rights are never given priority by the producer\u2019s lien statute. Therefore, a secured creditor\u2019s security interest, which attaches to the proceeds the moment the processor acquires rights in the proceeds, always is superior to any producer\u2019s claim to the proceeds. Consequently, if a processor obeys the directive in section 55638 and uses sale proceeds to pay producers, the secured creditor could recover those proceeds from the producers in a lawsuit enforcing its security interest. (See <em>Imperial NH3 v. Central Valley Feed Yards, Inc. </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 513 [139 Cal.Rptr. 8] [creditor\u2019s refusal to honor superior claim of secured creditor to proceeds of hay crop constituted conversion].) Under this statutory construction, the directive of section 55638 would be anomalous, for it would make little sense to require that the processor pay the proceeds to the party with the inferior rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">To avoid this anomaly, Secured Lender suggests an alternative construction that, when the processor obeys the directive in section 55638 and pays sale proceeds to a producer, a secured party could not undo that payment by enforcing its security interest in the proceeds. Two problems arise from this statutory construction. First, counsel for Secured Lender has offered no conceptual basis for why a security interest that has attached to proceeds is no longer enforceable when the proceeds are delivered to producers. Second, the practical effect of this construction is that it gives the processor the power to irreversibly choose who gets to keep the proceeds. As discussed earlier, such an irreversible choice promotes no statutory purpose. Rather, it undermines the statutory purpose of promoting the agricultural industry because it increases the uncertainty for both the producer and the lender due to the difficulty in predicting which one the processor will choose to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">In addition to the foregoing, the drawbacks of the alternative statutory constructions suggested by Secured Lender can be illustrated by the factual situation in which the processor has violated the directive in section 55638 and paid the proceeds to a secured creditor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because neither construction gives <em>priority </em>to a producer\u2019s claim to the proceeds, they eviscerate much of the protection given to producers by the directive of section 55638 that proceeds be used to pay producers. Under the view that a producer\u2019s claim to the proceeds is not a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d given priority by section 55633, producers could not successfully sue and recover the proceeds from a secured lender that has received them. Consequently, (1) producers would receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>no protection from the last sentence of section 55638 in the situation where they are most at risk\u2014where the processor is having financial difficulties and is unable to pay a creditor with a security interest in proceeds\u2014and, (2) producers would receive the greatest protection in a situation where it is unlikely to be needed\u2014where the processor does not owe money to a creditor with a security interest that covers proceeds from the sale of inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">In summary, a statutory construction that grants priority to a producer\u2019s claim to sale proceeds (1) promotes the purpose of the producer\u2019s lien statute by reducing the risk that producers will not be paid for product that they sell to processors on credit and (2) does not produce an absurd result. Accordingly, the producer\u2019s right to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of raw or processed farm product is a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d for purposes of the priority provisions of section 55633. Therefore, we conclude Growers\u2019 claims to the proceeds have priority over Secured Lender\u2019s security interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">C. <em>Other Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Secured Lender argues the Legislature did not intend to give producers a lien on proceeds because it did not use language similar to that used in other statutes that have created liens on proceeds. In 1979, for example, the Legislature defined a livestock producer\u2019s lien by stating that \u201cany person who sells . . . livestock to a meatpacker, shall have a lien . . . upon the identifiable proceeds ... for the unpaid part of the purchase price ...\u201d (\u00a7 55702, subd. (a); see \u00a7 57510 [liens upon the proceeds of sale of eggs, poultry, and fish].) Secured Lender supports this argument by citing <em>Sargent. </em>(See <em>Sargent, supra, </em>219 B.R. at p. 884 [comparing the language of \u00a7 55638 to that of \u00a7 55702].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">Secured Lender\u2019s argument is not convincing because it fails to recognize that the Legislature might express a lien right to proceeds in terms of its jural correlative. Furthermore, the difference in language used in the two lien statutes is explained in part by the process that led to their enactment. Article 10.5 of chapter 6, division 20 of the Food and Agricultural Code, which contains the provisions concerning the producer\u2019s lien on livestock sold to a meatpacker, was enacted as a single, integrated piece of legislation in 1979. In contrast, the sentence in section 55638 that addresses proceeds was added as part of a revision of a bill that proposed amending the producer\u2019s lien statute. That sentence reflected a political compromise rather than the work of a single drafter writing an entire article on a blank slate. Thus, it is an unrealistic view of the legislative process to expect (much less, to require) the use of parallel language to define the relationship between the producer and processor as it concerns sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>Secured Party argues that treating a producer\u2019s right to the proceeds as a \u201cproducer\u2019s lien\u201d for purposes of the statute will send the system of agricultural lending into disarray by making it difficult for banks to assess the risk of lending to processors. The prediction of disarray is not convincing because it is based on an assumption that many financial institutions rely on product inventory (or at least the proceeds generated by that inventory) that is subject to producers\u2019 liens when lending to processors. Secured Lender has not shown that this assumption is justified. Thus, as far as we know, it is just as\u2014or more\u2014common that lenders insist processors obtain lien releases from producers where lenders want to rely on a processor\u2019s product inventory as collateral before making their loans. (See <em>Agricultural Producer\u2019s Lien, supra, </em>36 Hastings LJ. at pp. 614\u2014615 [describing the prevalent use of such lien releases after the 1979 amendments to the producer\u2019s lien statute and an unsuccessful legislative attempt by farming interests to repeal the provision that authorizes the use of lien releases]; see <em>In re T.H. Richards Processing Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 910 F.2d 639 [interpreting language in \u00a7 55637 governing releases].) Therefore, we cannot accept Secured Lender\u2019s assumption that many loans have been made to processors in reliance on the proceeds to be generated from product inventory that is subject to producer\u2019s liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">In addition, to the extent that some financial institutions may have lent to processors in reliance on the theory that inventory subject to a producer\u2019s lien would generate proceeds and that those proceeds would be subject to their prior security interests, they chose a risky course. First, this course is not one contemplated in the legislative history that discussed the collateral available to banks that lend to processors. The prudent banker should rely on product in a processor\u2019s inventory only to the extent that product is \u201cfree and clear of such lien.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (\u00a7 55631.) Second, a bank that relies on <em>proceeds </em>from inventory subject to a producer\u2019s lien is betting that (1) the producers will not enforce their lien on the product itself before it is sold and generates proceeds and (2) the processor will violate the directive in section 55638 that the proceeds are to be used to pay producers.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">In short, our decision not to follow <em>Sargent </em>and to hold that the producer\u2019s lien covers proceeds from the sale of farm product adds merely a slight increment to the risk taken by lenders that chose the already risky course of relying on proceeds generated by product inventory that was subject to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>producer\u2019s lien. Thus, we reject Secured Lender\u2019s contention that this decision profoundly alters the risk of lending to processors and the ability of lenders to assess that risk and are unconvinced by the related prediction that it will throw agricultural lending into disarray.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">III. <em>Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">\n<em>A. Conversion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Based on the conclusion that Growers held a prior lien on the almond sale proceeds, we conclude that Growers have pled facts sufficient to state a cause of action for conversion of proceeds from almond sales. California recognizes conversion as a cause of action that a creditor with a superior claim to collateral may state against another creditor that has possession of the collateral. (See <em>Imperial NH3 v. Central Valley Feed Yards, Inc., supra, </em>70 Cal.App.3d 513 [creditor\u2019s refusal to honor superior claim of another creditor to proceeds of hay crop constituted conversion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">B. <em>Unfair Competition Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">1. <em>Sufficiency of allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">Growers also have pled facts sufficient to state a cause of action for an unfair business practice in violation of the unfair competition law insofar as that legal theory seeks the restitution of almond sale proceeds in which Growers\u2019 claims have priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">2. <em>Secured Lender is not a public entity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">Secured Lender contends that public entities are not subject to suit under the unfair competition law and that, as a federal instrumentality, it should be regarded as a public entity for purposes of that statute. We have assumed that Secured Lender is a production credit association and thus is a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-12\">When the Farm Credit Administration<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> approves a production credit association\u2019s articles of association and issues a charter, the production credit association becomes \u201ca federally chartered body corporate and an instrumentality of the United States.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071(b)(7).) Each production credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>association is a \u201cbody corporate,\u201d and its general corporate powers include the power to \u201csue and be sued.\u201d (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">Secured Lender has cited no opinion from California or any other jurisdiction that treats a production credit association as a public entity under state law. In other contexts, production credit associations are not treated as public entities. For instance, the Supreme Court of Kansas has held that production credit associations are subject to state income tax even though they are chartered, organized, and operated under federal law as part of the Farm Credit System. <em>(In re Farm Credit Services of Central Kan. </em>(2001) 271 Kan. 805 [26 P.3d 695].) For jurisdictional purposes, federally chartered bodies corporate are \u201cconsidered corporations of the state in which they conduct ordinary business.\u201d <em>(CFSC Consortium, LLC v. Ferreras-Goitia </em>(D.P.R. 2002) 198 F.Supp.2d 116, 120, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Secured Lender has pointed to nothing in the statutory text or extrinsic legislative materials to indicate the California Legislature intended to treat production credit associations in particular, or federally chartered corporations or associations in general, as public entities for purposes of the unfair competition law. Rather, corporations and associations are included in the statutory definition of \u201cpersons\u201d contained in Business and Professions Code section 17201.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">According to the declaration of the loan officer of Secured Lender who handled Processor\u2019s line of credit, the first disbursement under the line of credit was used to pay off Processor\u2019s preexisting operating loan from California Federal Bank. Consequently, in some ways, Secured Lender is competing with other lenders in the business of agricultural lending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">We conclude that Secured Lender is a \u201cperson\u201d and not a public entity for purposes of the unfair competition law. As a result, Secured Lender is subject to suit under Business and Professions Code section 17200. Imposing liability on Secured Lender is not the same as imposing liability on an entity of the federal government functioning in a nonbusiness, noncompetitive role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">IV. <em>Summary </em>Judgment<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The judgment is reversed. The matter is remanded to the superior court with directions (1) to vacate its May 10, 2004, order sustaining the demurrer as to the third and fifth causes of action and enter an order overruling the demurrer in its entirety; (2) to vacate its March 17, 2005, order granting summary judgment and enter an order denying that motion; and (3) to enter an order granting summary adjudication as to the first cause of action, which was labeled \u201cintentional interference with economic relations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">Plaintiffs are awarded costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Vartabedian, Acting P.

(See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 2071(a) [production credit association is an instrumentality of the United States].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1070-7\"> Pursuant to California Uniform Commercial Code section 9315, subdivision (a)(2), Secured Lender\u2019s security interest automatically attached also to \u201cidentifiable proceeds of collateral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">The record created below does not indicate that the security interest was perfected. (See Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 9315, subds. (c) &amp; (d) [perfection of a security interest in proceeds].) To show on appeal that its security interest was perfected, Secured Lender requested judicial notice be taken of a financing statement and two form UCC-2\u2019s filed with the California Secretary of State. Because this request for judicial notice is, in effect, an inappropriate request to amend Secured Lender\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts and because perfection is not material to the outcome of this appeal, the request is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1070-9\"> The guarantees, among other things, create an economic incentive for the guarantors to see that the debt they have guaranteed is paid before debt they have not guaranteed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1071-11\"> The payment on December 12, 2002, may have been in response to the loan officer\u2019s letter dated December 11, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1071-12\"> In <em>Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v.

Thus, read literally, one cannot tell at the time of the sale if the sale is authorized or prohibited because of uncertainty over whether the condition will be satisfied sometime later. Also, we need not address the interplay between the generality of the condition subsequent language, which does not expressly limit the obligation to deliver sale proceeds to the processor, and the prevalent use within the industry of deferred payment contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1077-9\"> Indeed, failure to perform this duty is penalized under other provisions of division 20, chapter 6 of the Food and Agricultural Code (Processors of Farm Products).
