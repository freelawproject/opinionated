Kenyon died, a resident of the county of Los Angeles, leaving a document entitled Last Will and Testament, signed by said decedent, dated August 15, 1933, subscribed to by two witnesses, which purported to be the last will and testament of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Respondent, Edith M. Kenyon, offered the following document as the last will and testament of decedent, and it was admitted to probate as such:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cEl Monte Calif</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">March 4-38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">\u201cMr. Frank Givens Amarillo Tex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">Dear Frank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">I reed your check and it was a life saver to me.

She is good friend to me, I fainted away in her house her and her husband took good care of me bath my face and hands and they put me on the sofa until I could go home and her neares neighbor brought horn .

I am getting enough to eat Hopeing this will find you all right\u2014everthing is satisfactory with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">Yours Truly Harvey F. Kenyon. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">In addition to the above documents there was received in evidence testimony of a Mrs. Salisbury to the effect that decedent had told her on numerous occasions that he had a will deeding his property to his two granddaughters Marjorie and Grace and that he wanted them to have all of his property, and that he asked her on one occasion if she would be the executrix of his estate if he made a new will.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The trial court found \u201cthat it [the letter dated March 4, 1938, supra] was of testamentary character and intended to bequeath his [decedent\u2019s] entire estate to said granddaughters, and that said letter constituted an olographic will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">This is the question for us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">\n<em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the finding of the trial court, supraf</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">This question must be answered in the negative. The law is established in California by a long line of decisions that before a document may be admitted to probate as the last will and testament of decedent, in addition to meeting all other legal requirements, there must be substantial evidence that the decedent intended the very document which is offered as his last will and testament to be such and to make disposition by it of his property in favor of the party claiming thereunder (Estate <em>of Button, </em>209 Cal. 325, 331 [287 Pac. 964]; <em>Estate of Dotta, </em>18 Cal. App. (2d) 763, 764 [64 Pac. (2d) 741]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The law is also established that, where from the evidence either of two inferences reasonably may be drawn, the one accepted by the trial court to support a finding of fact will not be disturbed by an appellate court <em>(Estate of Hathway, </em>38 Cal. App. (2d) 526 [101 Pac. (2d) 741]). However, this rule presupposes that the inference drawn from the evidence finds reasonable support therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Applying the test as stated in this rule to the facts of the instant case, we are of the opinion that neither from the document which has been admitted to probate as the last will and testament of decedent nor from any facts received in evidence could the conclusion reasonably be drawn that the decedent intended it to be of testamentary character. The letter of decedent offered as a will, discussing divers and sundry topics from blooming peach trees to \u201cOld Age Recovery \u2019 \u2019, has none of the earmarks of an holographic will. Only incidentally does he mention the relatives who desire, by his letter, to acquire his estate. The testimony of witness Salisbury, who related a conversation with decedent in which the latter is said to have stated that he had willed his estate to certain relatives, is insufficient evidence of <em>animus testandi </em>to create a will out of a gossipy letter to a frequent correspondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The cases cited by respondent, such as <em>Estate of Spitzer, </em>196 Cal. 301 [237 Pac. 739], are all factually distinguishable from the ease which we are now considering.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Therefore, the finding here questioned is unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">For the foregoing reasons the order is reversed, appellant to recover his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Moore, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
