From the ensuing judgment that plaintiff take nothing by his complaint, this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-20\">The plaintiff sustained his injuries on November 19, 1936. On or about December 31, 1936, more than one month, but less than ninety days after the date of the injuries, there was presented and filed with defendants a verified claim for damages in words and figures as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-21\">\u201cGlendale Unified School District and Board of Education of the City of Glendale,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-22\">\u201c411 East Wilson Street,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-23\">\u201cGlendale, California \u2018 \u2018 Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-24\">\u201cOn the 19th day of November, 1936, at about 3:15 P. M., my son, Earl C. Kelso, a student at Wilson Junior High School in Glendale, while leaving school, fell against a century plant which was planted on the side of the pathway leading from the said school to the street. His right eye was punctured and was subsequently removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u25a0 \u201cMy son resides with me at 130 North Cedar Street, Glendale, California.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">\u201cClaim is hereby made for Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) as damages for the loss of an eye by said Earl C. Kelso.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cDated this 31st day of December, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">(Signed) Claude Kelso.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">By the general laws in effect at the time of the accident and when the claim was filed (Stats. 1931, p. 2475, sec. 1, Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, [1937], Act 5149; see, also, Stats. 1931, p. 2476), it was provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cWhenever it is claimed that any person has been injured or any property damaged as a result of the dangerous or defective condition of any public street, highway, building, park, grounds, works or property, a verified claim for damages shall be presented in writing and filed with the clerk or secretary of the legislative body of the municipality, county, city and county, or school district, as the case may be, within ninety days after such accident has occurred. Such claim shall specify the name and address of the claimant, the date and place of the accident and the extent of the injuries or damages received.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">There was also in force at all times herein pertinent Ordinance No. 1664 of the City of Glendale, providing in section 1 thereof in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">\u201cNo action shall be brought against the City of Glendale, or against any board, commission, officer or employee thereof because of any act omitted or committed by it or him within the scope of its or his employment by the City of Glendale, on any claim or demand for money or damages whether founded in contract or in tort, unless a verified claim in writing therefor shall have been presented to the proper board, commission or officer thereof, as provided by the charter of said City, and to the board, commission, officer or employee against whom it is intended to bring action, within one month from the time of the maturing of the obligation or occurrence of the injury upon which such claim or demand is based, and such claim shall have been rejected in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">\u201cIf such claim is founded in tort, it shall set forth the name and residence address of the claimant, the nature, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tent, date, place and time of injury, and an itemized statement of the damages claimed or demanded. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">It is urged by appellant that the general law allowing ninety days in which to file a claim is applicable in the present case, and that therefore the trial court erred in holding that his cause of action was barred because his claim was not filed within the one-month period prescribed by the ordinance. Respondents\u2019 position is that the ordinance is a valid exercise of authority granted by the city charter of the City of Glendale (Stats. 1921, p. 2204), which provides in article XI, section 5, that \u201c ... No action shall be brought on any claim or demand for money or damages against the City or any Board, commission or officer thereof, until a demand for the same has been presented as provided in this charter or by ordinance and rejected in whole or in part\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Respondents\u2019 contention in this regard cannot prevail. A city, by adopting a charter, becomes independent of general laws only as to \u201cmunicipal affairs\u201d, and in matters of general state concern the general law is paramount. (City <em>of Pasadena </em>v. Charleville, 215 Cal. 384 [10 Pac. (2d) 745]; Const., art. XI, secs. 6 and 8.) And it has been held not only that the public school system is a matter of general concern (Lansing v. <em>Board of Education, </em>7 Cal. App. (2d) 211 [45 Pac. (2d) 1021]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mertz, </em>2 Cal. (2d) 136 [39 Pac. (2d) 422] ; <em>Esberg </em>v. <em>Badaracco, </em>202 Cal. 110 [259 Pac. 730] ; <em>Vallejo H. S. Dist. </em>v <em>White, </em>43 Cal. App. 359 [185 Pac. 302]), but also that the question of the liability of municipalities, counties and school districts for tortious acts or omissions of their servants is not a \u201cmunicipal affair.\u201d <em>(Douglass </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>5 Cal. (2d) 123, 128 [53 Pac. (2d) 353].) In the last-cited case a claim for damages based on the defective condition of a street was filed with the board of public works and not with the city council as required by statute. It was held that such filing was ineffectual and the action could not be maintained. The court there said (p. 128) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe important question of the liability of municipalities, counties and school districts for the tortious acts or omissions of their servants is a matter of general state concern, and not, as contended by the plaintiff, a municipal affair. As this point is now regularly raised we confirm the \u2018foreword\u2019 stated by this court in <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>City of Marysville, </em>207 Cal. 657 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>[280 Pac. 118], that it would he an anomalous situation if a city could, by adopting a freeholders\u2019 charter, exclude itself from the operation of a general law of the state imposing a liability on municipalities generally for the negligent acts or omissions of its servants in the maintenance of the public streets, on the theory that such city is independent of general laws in municipal affairs. The question of the safety of public ways is \u2018a matter of state concern, and the obligation of a city to make its highways reasonably safe for general use cannot be chartered away even though a municipality should attempt to do so\u2019. (207 Cal. p. 665.) \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In <em>Sandstoe </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., </em>28 Cal. App. (2d) 215 [82 Pac. (2d) 216], which was a suit against the city of Pasadena for damages resulting from the defective condition of a street, it was held that the act of 1931 allowing ninety days in which to file a claim, and not the requirements of the city charter, 1 \u2018governs the situation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Esberg </em>v. <em>Badaracco, supra, </em>the Supreme Court, holding that the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco was without power to modify the school budget prepared by the Board of Education, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201d... The school system of the state is a matter of general concern as distinguished from a \u2018municipal affair\u2019, as that term is considered in connection with charter cities. Article IX of the organic law of California provides for the establishment of a public school system. It is provided in section 1 of that article: \u2018A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement. \u2019 Section 5 of the same article provides that \u2018the legislature shall provide for a system of common schools. . . . \u2019 Section 6 of the article provides that the legislature \u2018shall provide for\u2019 the levy of a \u2018city and county\u2019 tax by the board of supervisors for school purposes. By this article of the constitution the people of the state have made the school system a matter of state supervision, and judicial declarations to the same effect are numerous. . . . (Citing cases.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u2018\u2018The effect of this framework of laws surrounding and supporting our public school system is that the acts of the legislature, within constitutional bounds, are controlling over conflicting provisions of freeholders\u2019 charters. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Moreover, even assuming it to \"be a valid regulation in the ease of claims against the City of Glendale or its officers, the ordinance in question does not by its terms cover the situation here, for the present suit is against the Glendale Unified School District, a corporate entity distinct from the municipal corporation of Glendale. (See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>San Diego School Dist., </em>203 Cal. 712 [265 Pac. 821], and the authorities therein referred to.) In the cited ease, quoting from Kennedy v. <em>Miller, </em>97 Cal. 429 [32 Pac. 558], it was said: \u201c . . . The legislative declaration that every incorporated city is a school district does not import into the organization of the school district any of the provisions of the city charter, or limit the powers and functions which, as a school district, it has by virtue of the Political Code. The city is a corporation distinct from that of the school district, even though both are designated by the same name, and embrace the same territory. The one derives its authority directly from the legislature, through the general law providing for the establishment of schools throughout the state, while the authority of the other is found in the charter under which it is organized; and even though the charter may purport to define the powers and duties of its municipal officers in reference to the public schools in the same language as has the legislature in the Political Code, yet these powers and duties are referable to the legislative authority, and not to the charter. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">To us the conclusion seems inevitable that so far as the provisions of the city ordinance impair or abridge the time fixed by the general law of the state for filing such claims, such provisions of the ordinance are invalid, because of their conflict with the state law. We further hold that the city is without power to shorten the time within which to file claims under the state law in matters of this kind, just as it is without power by charter or ordinance to extend the time fixed by the state law in a matter affecting school districts, which are, without doubt, of general state concern and not \u201cmunicipal affairs\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Not only is the school district a separate entity from the city, but upon the authority of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>San Diego School District, supra, </em>it must be held that the members of the Board of Education are not \u201ccity officers\u201d, and hence, whether the suit be deemed one against the district or one against the members of the Board of Education, the city ordinance has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>It is next contended that the trial court erred in holding that appellant\u2019s claim \u201cwas not sufficient in law\u201d. In this contention appellant must be upheld. The requirements of the statute are that the claim specify the \u201cname and address of the claimant, the date and place of the accident and the extent of the injuries or damages received\u201d. These requirements are fully met by the filed claim here in question. But it is urged by respondents that the claim does not designate the injured plaintiff as the claimant, but rather purports to be a claim for damages sustained by his father, Claude Kelso, for the reason that the verification is by the father, who is described therein as the \u201cclaimant\u201d. The claim, say respondents, would support an action by the father for damages sustained by him alone, but affords no basis for an action by the son. This contention cannot be sustained. We think it is the claim itself that should be looked to, rather than the verification. The claim itself shows clearly enough that the son is the claimant. It is stated therein that the son was injured, his place of residence being given, and that \u201cclaim is hereby made for Twenty-five Thousand dollars ($25,000.00) as damages for the loss of an eye by said Earl C. Kelso\u201d. It would strain one\u2019s imagination to suppose that the board could have been led to believe that a claim for $25,000 was for damages sustained by the father alone. In making their concession that the claim as filed would have supported an action by appellant\u2019s father for such damages as he might have suffered personally as a result of the accident, respondents argue that in considering the claim for allowance or rejection they were only interested in whatever liability they owed to the father and were not concerned with any liability to the injured minor child. It is then admitted by respondents that the law requiring a claim to be filed as a condition precedent to bringing a suit against public entities, boards, commissions, etc., is simply to enable such public officials to make a proper investigation concerning the merits of the claim and to settle it without the expense of a lawsuit, if settlement should be shown to be proper. It is at once apparent that before the defendants could determine the presence or absence of any liability upon their part to the injured boy\u2019s father, they would of necessity have to determine the existence of any primary liability to the injured minor. If they owed the latter no obligation by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>way of compensation, then of course, no liability to the father would attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">It is the law that in the absence of an intention to mislead, a \u201csubstantial compliance with the charter requirements is sufficient\u201d. (Sandstoe v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., supra.) </em>The claim filed in the instant case certainly meets the requirements enunciated in <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>City of Seattle, </em>84 Wash. 275 [146 Pac. 621, Ann. Cas. 1916E, 720], and quoted with approval in <em>Uttley </em>v. <em>City of Santa Ana, </em>136 Cal. App. 23 [28 Pac. (2d) 377], as follows: \u201cWhen, therefore, there is no evident intention to mislead, but a <em>tona fide </em>attempt to comply with the law, the notice is sufficient in the absence of any evidence that it did in fact mislead.\u201d In cur opinion, the claim filed herein did not in anywise mislead respondents, but on the contrary, indicated without equivocation that it was filed for and on behalf of the minor child who sustained the injuries in question, and it certainly gave the respondents full opportunity to investigate the merits thereof. In the method pursued in the instant case in the filing of appellant's claim, the respondents were not prejudiced or misled in any manner, and the claim must therefore be held to be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">I concur in the conclusion reached. York, P. J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
