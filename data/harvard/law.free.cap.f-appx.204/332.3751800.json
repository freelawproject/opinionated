The district court sentenced Hayes under the advisory sentencing guidelines to 272 months\u2019 imprisonment, or the low end of the guidelines. Hayes claims that because we review sentences within the guidelines as presumptively reasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the guidelines are per se mandatory and our review is unconstitutional. Hayes further claims his sentence is unreasonable. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We review a <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. <em>738, </em>160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentence \u201cto determine whether the sentence is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). \u201c[A] defendant can only rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). While a district court must consider the various \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explain its sentence, it need not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553 or discuss every factor on the record. <em>Johnson, </em>445 F.3d at 345. This is particularly the case when the court imposes a sentence within the applicable guideline range. <em>Id. </em>One reason a sentence within an advisory range is presumptively reasonable is that the most salient \u00a7 3553(a) factors are already incorporated into guideline determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 342-43. A sentence falling outside the guidelines is not presumptively unreasonable. However, if the sentence was based on an error in construing the guidelines or if the court provided an inadequate statement of reasons or improper factors, it will be found unreasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). When a variance is justified by reasons tied to \u00a7 3553(a), it will be found reasonable. When a variance from the guidelines is substantial, we will more carefully scrutinize the reasoning. The further the sentencing court diverges from the guidelines, the more compelling the reasons for the divergence must be. <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">We find no merit to Hayes\u2019 claim that our standard of review renders the sentencing guidelines per se mandatory. We further find Hayes failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
