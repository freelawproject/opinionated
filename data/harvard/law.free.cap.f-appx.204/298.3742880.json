The district court sentenced him to a 135-month, term of imprisonment. Smith\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the plea colloquy but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Smith was advised of his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Counsel raises as a potential issue the adequacy of the plea colloquy in light of the district court\u2019s failure to inform Smith that any false statement could be used against him in a prosecution for perjury, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(A); that he could persist in his plea of not guilty, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(B); that he had the right to counsel, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(D); and that he had the right to compel the attendance of witnesses, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(E). Because Smith did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds raised on appeal, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (discussing standard of review). Our careful review of the record on appeal convinces us that the district court\u2019s omissions did not affect Smith\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id,.; United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (discussing factors courts should consider in determining whether substantial rights affected in decision to plead guilty).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
