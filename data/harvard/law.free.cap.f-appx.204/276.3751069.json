Shields, </em>133 Fed. Appx 60 (4th Cir.2005) (No. 04-4389). For the reasons stated below, we affirm Shields\u2019 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-15\">Following a jury trial, Shields was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) (Count One), but not guilty of possession of an unregistered shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871 (2000) (Count Two). The court sentenced Shields under the mandatory federal sentencing guidelines and applied two enhancements based on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, the court increased Shields\u2019 base offense level by two under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) (2003), based upon its finding that the firearm had an obliterated serial number. Furthermore, the court increased the offense level an additional four levels under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), based upon its finding that Shields used or possessed the firearm in connection with another felony, namely felonious first degree kidnaping. Neither the fact of the obliterated serial number nor the commission of the felonious first degree kidnaping was found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-16\">With these two enhancements, Shields\u2019 offense level was 26. His criminal history category was VI, yielding a guideline range of 120 to 150 months in prison. USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Without the two enhancements, Shields\u2019 guideline range would have been seventy to eighty-seven months in prison. <em>Id. </em>The district court sentenced Shields to 120 months in prison. We affirmed Shields\u2019 conviction but vacated his sentence because the district court\u2019s factual findings upon which it increased Shields\u2019 offense level and his sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>On remand, the district court determined that Shields\u2019 criminal history category was V instead of VI. The court found that Shields\u2019 offense level was 26, rejecting Shields\u2019 objections to the two-level increase in offense level for the obliterated serial number and the four-level increase in offense level for using or possessing the firearm in connection with another felony. With a criminal history category of V and offense level of 26, Shields\u2019 advisory guideline range was 110 to 137 months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG ch. 5, pt. A (sentencing table). Pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(1), however, the advisory guideline range became 110 to 120 months because Shields was subject to a ten-year statutory maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Although Shields presented evidence that he had cooperated with law enforcement and completed self-improvement classes since his conviction, the district court nevertheless sentenced Shields to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, the top of the guideline range. The court held that a greater sentence than 120 months was appropriate to meet the objectives of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), in light of what Shields did to the victim and because the court found that he brought in a witness to testify falsely. The court noted that 120 months was the highest sentence it could impose under the statute. Shields appeals, arguing that his 120-month sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a) and that the record fails to show that the court gave adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). A sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A defendant can only rebut that presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). While a sentencing court must explain the basis for its sentence, \u201ca district court need not explicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 632 (4th Cir.2006), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. June 20, 2006) (No. 05-11659). \u201cRather, the record must reflect that the court adequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">Shields\u2019 120-month sentence is within the properly calculated advisory guideline range and within the statutory maximum. In sentencing Shields, the district court adequately explained the basis for its sentencing decision, taking into consideration Shields\u2019 arguments. We find Shields\u2019 sentence to be reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
