Johnson challenges only his death sentence. He raises the following issues: (1) the prosecution suppressed material exculpatory evidence during the sentencing phase in violation of due process; (2) due process and equal protection required that his jury be instructed regarding parole laws; and (3) the Texas capital sentencing scheme\u2019s failure to require the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt future dangerousness and the absence of mitigation evidence violates due process and is in conflict with Supreme Court precedent. Finding that Johnson has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, we DENY the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\">Johnson filed his \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). The petition, therefore, is subject to the requirements, restrictions, and standards imposed by AEDPA. See <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 2068, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). Under AEDPA, a petitioner must obtain a COA before he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (\u201c[Ujntil a COA has been issued federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to rule on the merits of appeals from habeas petitioners.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-15\">A COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires this Court to conduct an overview of the habeas claims and make a general assessment of the merits. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. at 1039. This Court looks to the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-16\">A COA will be granted only if the petitioner makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cA petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. at 1034. Where the district court has denied claims on procedural grounds, a COA should issue only if it is demonstrated that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 1604, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). \u201cThe question is the debatability of the underlying constitutional claim, not the resolution of that debate.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 342, 123 S.Ct. at 1042. \u201cIndeed, a claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. at 1040. Moreover, \u201c[b]e-cause the present case involves the death penalty, any doubts as to whether a COA should issue must be resolved in [petitioner\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Johnson, </em>213 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201cWe further note that when reviewing the district court\u2019s assessment, we must be mindful of the deferential standard of review of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Brown v. Dretke, </em>419 F.3d 365, 371 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1434, 164 L.Ed.2d 137 (2006). Under \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court cannot grant habeas corpus relief with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the adjudication of that claim either (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States, or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). With respect to the review of factual findings, AEDPA significantly restricts the scope of federal habeas review. Factual findings are presumed to be correct, and a petitioner has the burden of rebutting this presumption with clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">II. SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Johnson argues that the State failed to disclose exculpatory evidence relating to a State\u2019s witness who testified during the punishment phase. <em>See Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The State has a duty to disclose evidence favorable to the accused that is material to guilt or punishment. <em>See id. </em>at 86-87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-97. To establish this due process violation, an accused must show that the State withheld evidence, that the evidence was favorable, and that the evidence was material to the defense. <em>Little v. Johnson, </em>162 F.3d 855, 861 (5th Cir.1998). <em>\u201cBrady </em>applies equally to evidence relevant to the credibility of a key witness in the state\u2019s case against a defendant.\u201d <em>Graves v. Dretke, </em>442 F.3d 334, 339 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 374, 166 L.Ed.2d 253 (2006). However, a new trial is not automatically required \u201cwhenever a combing of the prosecutors\u2019 files after the trial has disclosed evidence possibly useful to the defense but not likely to have changed the verdict.\u201d <em>Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. at 766 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">The standard for determining \u201cmateriality is a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). In assessing <em>Brady </em>materiality, \u201c[t]he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result is accordingly shown when the [State\u2019s] evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">During the punishment phase of Johnson\u2019s capital murder trial, the State called Donald Richardson to testify regarding violent threats Johnson made during a motorcycle trip from Tomball, Texas to Austin. Richardson testified that Johnson, who was armed with a gun, threatened to kill a man for his car. Subsequent to Johnson\u2019s conviction, Richardson recanted his trial testimony in an affidavit, stating that it was \u201call false\u201d and he \u201cconsented to do this on the grounds that [the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office] would contact the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole and secure my early release from prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">During Johnson\u2019s state habeas proceedings, his attorney submitted a note that had been handwritten by Richardson to Diana Lynn Glaeser, one of the prosecutors at Johnson\u2019s trial. Apparently, Johnson\u2019s habeas attorney had discovered the following note in the prosecution file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">I need to see you as soon as possible, please come see me at the jail. I am at 1301 Franklin 7th Floor at the moment. I am having some problems that I need fixed right now. If you can\u2019t make it today please send someone else to assist me. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">Sincerely Donald Richardson [address omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">P.S. Pertaining to Lonnie E. Johnson case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">With respect to the chronology of events, the note was written on October 10, 1994. The jury found Johnson guilty of both capital murders on November 14, 1994, and three days later the judge accepted the jury\u2019s punishment verdict of a death sentence. On January 30, 1995, the prosecutor informed Johnson\u2019s trial attorney that Richardson disavowed his testimony and wanted to \u201cchange his testimony, or words to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">During Johnson\u2019s state habeas proceedings, his counsel submitted an affidavit from Richardson, which provided as follows: \u201cThe statements I made at trial about Lonnie displaying a handgun and wanting to kill a motorist were all false. These were statements made to make the district attorney happy, so she would secure my early release from prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">The state habeas trial court made the ensuing findings of fact with respect to the instant claim based upon the \u201ccredible affidavit of Di Glaeser, the trial prosecutor in the primary case.\u201d In 1990, Richardson contacted a law enforcement agency and provided information about Johnson. In October of 1990, Richardson spoke to an investigator with the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the information provided in that interview was consistent with Richardson\u2019s trial testimony. The \u201cState\u2019s file was always open to the applicant\u2019s trial counsel, and that trial counsel went to the State\u2019s office to inspect the file.\u201d The court further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-13\">that Donald Ray Richardson contacted the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office several times in the days leading up to the trial of the primary case; that Richardson was serving concurrent prison sentences for auto theft and burglary at the time of trial and was bench warranted from TDC to the Harris County Jail prior to trial; that Richardson indicated that he was having problems in the jail and wanted to be moved; that Glaeser passed this information on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>her investigator, who in turn contacted the county jail personnel; and that Richardson was ultimately moved within the jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Additionally, the court found that after Richardson was moved once within the jail, any other requests he made, including to be moved again, were ignored by the State. Richardson was informed that he would not receive any \u201cdeals\u201d in exchange for his testimony against Johnson. The court expressly found that Glaeser neither made a deal with Richardson nor instructed or encouraged him to lie at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The court also found credible the affidavits of Rob Kepple, an assistant district attorney who was involved in the pretrial proceedings, and D.C. Wells, an investigator for the Hams County District Attorney\u2019s office. Both affiants stated that Richardson received no deal or agreement in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In a nutshell, the state habeas court found that the prosecution did not promise anything in exchange for Richardson\u2019s testimony. The only \u201cbenefit\u201d Richardson received was being relocated away from Johnson within the jail. As the court below stated, the state habeas court\u2019s factual findings \u201cdestroyed Johnson\u2019s habeas claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Johnson contends that he did not have a \u201cfair opportunity to challenge the credibility of the prosecutors\u201d and that \u201call credibility decisions were made from a cold record.\u201d Prior to AEDPA, this Court has explained that \u201cthe presumption of correctness does not become inapplicable for the <em>sole </em>reason that no live evidentiary hearing has been held.\u201d <em>May v. Collins, </em>955 F.2d 299, 311 (5th Cir.1992) (emphasis in original). Thus, this challenge to the factual findings would have failed even pre-AEDPA. AEDPA \u201cjettisoned all references to a \u2018full and fair hearing\u2019 from the presumption of correctness accorded state court findings of fact.\u201d <em>Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 949 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe presumption of correctness erected in its place at \u00a7 2254(e)(1), now simply provides that unless the petitioner can rebut the findings of fact through clear and convincing evidence, those findings of fact are presumed to be correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Johnson has failed to marshal clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption of correctness afforded the state court\u2019s findings of-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Moreover, as the district court concluded, \u201c[e]ven if the prosecution knew that Richardson would fabricate his testimony or made a \u2018deal\u2019 that resulted in his lies \u2014 and Johnson has not made either showing \u2014 the evidence against Johnson would allow the state habeas court to conclude that Richardson\u2019s testimony was not material under the <em>Brady </em>standard.\u201d \u201cThe materiality of <em>Brady </em>material depends almost entirely on the value of the evidence relative to the other evidence mustered by the state.\u201d <em>Edmond v. Collins, </em>8 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Johnson does not dispute the state court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere were twenty-three punishment phase witnesses other than Donald Richardson who testified concerning at least nine incidents of actual violence by [Johnson] as well as many other incidents of threatened violence.\u201d Moreover, numerous witnesses (both prison guards and inmates) testified to Johnson\u2019s continuing violent behavior <em>after </em>his incarceration for the instant capital murders. In view of the other evidence of Johnson\u2019s future dangerousness, combined with the instant execution-style murders of the two teenage boys who apparently were attempting to help Johnson with his feigned car trouble, we conclude that there is no reasonable probability that disclosure of the allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>suppressed evidence would have resulted in a different outcome at sentencing. Accordingly, because we conclude that jurists of reason would not find the district court\u2019s disposition of this claim debatable, we deny a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">III. PAROLE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Johnson next contends his due process and equal protection rights require that a jury be instructed with respect to parole laws and the \u201cimplication of a life sentence.\u201d Johnson did not request that the jury be so instructed, and the state habeas court found that the claim was procedurally barred. The district court therefore found that it was procedurally barred from considering this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Johnson acknowledges that no objection was made. Nonetheless, relying on Texas state law, he argues that he was not required to object based on the \u201cright not recognized\u201d exception. When faced with this precise argument, this Court has explained that \u201cit is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d <em>Rosales v. Cockrell, </em>48 Fed.Appx. 103 (5th Cir.2002) (unpublished) (quoting <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991)). As such, the district court\u2019s conclusion that habeas review of Johnson\u2019s claim is procedurally barred is not debatable among reasonable jurists. Johnson has not demonstrated either cause or prejudice, or that imposition of the bar would constitute a miscarriage of justice. He thus has failed to show that jurists of reason would find the district court\u2019s procedural bar debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In any event, our precedent squarely precludes Johnson from making a substantial showing regarding the denial of due process or equal protection rights with regard to this claim. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. Quarterman, </em>456 F.3d 537, 544-45 (5th Cir.2006) (rejecting claim that the equal protection clause is violated by the discretionary ability of Texas trial judges to instruct a jury regarding a defendant\u2019s parole eligibility); <em>Miller v. Johnson, </em>200 F.3d 274, 290 (5th Cir.2000) (rejecting claim that due process required parole instruction regarding petitioner\u2019s parole eligibility). The district court\u2019s disposition of this claim is not debatable, and thus, we deny a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">IV. UNCONSTITUTIONAL SENTENCING SCHEME</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">In his final claim, Johnson argues that the Texas sentencing scheme is \u201cunconstitutional because there is no requirement that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the answers to the special issues presented to the jury must be answered \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d In support of this argument, Johnson principally relies on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). The district court denied relief, stating, inter alia, that it could not grant relief without creating a new rule in violation of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">With respect to Johnson\u2019s reliance on <em>Booker </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>\u201c[t]his argument is foreclosed before this court by <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2005), and <em>In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 212-13 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam), both of which hold that the <em>Blakely/Booker </em>line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>cases does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>442 F.3d 258, 268 (5th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to his reliance on <em>Ring, </em>the Supreme Court has explicitly held that <em>\u201cRing </em>announced a new procedural rule that does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 358, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2526, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, this Court recently rejected the claim that the State is constitutionally required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of mitigating circumstances. <em>Granados v. Quarterman, </em>455 F.3d 529, 536-37 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 28, 2006)(NO. 06-6932). The district court\u2019s disposition of this claim is not debatable and thus, we deny a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">For the above reasons, the request for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that <em>Victor </em>is inapposite because Johnson is not challenging any definition of \"reasonable doubt\u201d contained in the jury instructions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
