Macaulay filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied Macaulay\u2019s motion but granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by interfering with his right to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Macaulay must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-94, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Failure to establish either deficient performance or prejudice is fatal to the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">The district court determined that counsel\u2019s advice against testifying did not render his performance deficient, considering Macaulay\u2019s prior convictions involving mendacity and the lack of evidentiary support for his claim of citizenship. Macaulay states that he would have testified that he had lied in the past but that he sincerely believed in his citizenship. He acknowledges that he had no evidence to support this claim, either documents or testimony. Given his prior criminal history, his lack of evidentiary support, and the anticipated nature of his potential testimony, counsel\u2019s advice against testifying was sound trial strategy. <em>See United States v. Mullins, </em>315 F.3d 449, 453-54 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-16\">The district court\u2019s ruling, including the sentence imposed, are</p>\n<p id=\"b442-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
