Vasquez (Vasquez) pled guilty to possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base (Count 1) and cocaine (Count 2), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(C). At sentencing, over Vasquez\u2019s objections, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> concluded he was a career offender based in part on his two previous felony convictions for crimes of violence \u2014 a Missouri conviction for second-degree attempted burglary and a Colorado conviction for second-degree assault with intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>to cause serious bodily injury in the heat of passion. The court imposed concurrent 120-month prison terms, and concurrent supervised release terms of 5 years on Count 1 and 3 years on Count 2. On appeal, Vasquez challenges the denial of his career-offender objections, arguing that neither of the predicate offenses was a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Career-offender status requires, among other things, at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is any federal or state offense punishable by more than one year in prison that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(a). \u201c[T]he offense of conviction (ie., the conduct of which the defendant was convicted) is the focus of inquiry.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 2. We review de novo whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence under section 4B1.2(a). <em>See United States v. Hollis, </em>447 F.3d 1053, 1054 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">First, Vasquez\u2019s Missouri conviction for second-degree attempted burglary is a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Strong, </em>415 F.3d 902, 907-08 (8th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Second, under Colorado Revised Statutes section 18-3-203(l)(f.5)(I), a person confined in a detention facility commits second-degree assault if the detainee, \u201cwith intent to infect, injure, harm, harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm,\u201d causes a detention facility employee \u201cto come into contact with blood, seminal fluid, urine, feces, saliva, mucus, vomit, or any toxic, caustic, or hazardous material by any means.\u201d Under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), an offense that is punishable by more than a year in prison and presents a serious risk of physical injury is a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. McCall, </em>439 F.3d 967, 971-72 (8th Cir. 2006) (en banc) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which is substantially similar to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) and explaining \u201cthe inherent potential for harm must be present, if not in every violation, at least in a substantial portion of the circumstances made criminal by the statute\u201d). To determine whether an offense involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, we take a common sense approach to evaluate the risks and consequences associated with the offense. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 999 (8th Cir.2005). Section 18-3-203(1)(f.5)(I) of the Colorado Revised Statutes proscribes conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, specifically, the threat infectious diseases pose. We therefore conclude the district court properly classified Vasquez\u2019s assault conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and sentenced Vasquez as a career criminal under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-19\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-8\">. Because we conclude Vasquez\u2019s conviction under Colorado Revised Statutes section 18-3-203(l)(f.5)(I) was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2), we need not consider whether Vasquez\u2019s conviction was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-16\">Having considered Vasquez\u2019s pro se arguments, we reject them as meritless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
