Barnes appeals from the April 12, 2004 judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Feuerstein, J.) granting the Appellee-Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>medical malpractice claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-22\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review. In a nutshell, Barnes contracted cancer in 1991, and underwent chemotherapy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>surgery at Veterans Affairs hospitals. Several years later, he visited the Brooklyn Veterans Affairs Medical Center (\u201cBVAMC\u201d) on two occasions while suffering from various painful physical ailments, mental distress, and addictions to alcohol and narcotic pain medication. He is currently incarcerated for an offense he committed soon after he left the BVAMC on the second visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">(1) Barnes\u2019s amended complaint alleges that he drove 46 his van drunk and had an accident because the BVAMC staff denied him admission to the \u201cMentally 111 Chemically Addicted\u201d program and then negligently discharged him. We review de <em>novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Romulus v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 131, 132 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a), suit cannot be brought under the FTCA unless the claimant first presented the claim to the relevant agency and obtained a final denial. A claim is not deemed \u201cpresented\u201d unless the claimant gives the agency \u201csufficient information both to permit an investigation and to estimate the claim\u2019s worth.\u201d <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>700 F.2d 836, 842 (2d Cir.1983). The information must be \u201cspecific enough to serve the purpose of the FTCA to enable the federal government to expedite the fair settlement of tort claims.\u201d <em>Romulus, </em>160 F.3d at 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">Barnes\u2019s initial administrative claim provided a great deal of detail about harms Barnes had suffered on other occasions, but little information concerning his March 1997 visit to BVAMC. Although the claim arguably did not provide sufficient information for the government to conduct an investigation, we need not decide that question, since the claim made no mention of Barnes\u2019s van accident and so certainly did not provide information sufficient for the government to estimate the claim\u2019s worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Barnes argues alternatively that the Department of Veterans Affairs had enough information to evaluate his claim\u2019s worth once the agency received a letter that he sent soon after his first claim was denied. But a claim under the FTCA is barred unless it is presented to the relevant agency within two years of accrual. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b). Barnes\u2019s letter was untimely, and Barnes advances no facts that would justify tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">A district court lacks jurisdiction under the FTCA unless the claim was both timely, <em>Johnson v. Smithsonian Inst., </em>189 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.1999), and properly presented to the relevant agency, <em>Keene, </em>700 F.2d at 841. Because Barnes did not properly present his claim within two years of its accrual, the district court correctly ruled that it had no jurisdiction over the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">(2) Barnes\u2019s amended complaint alleges that BVAMC negligently prescribed narcotic drugs, to which he became addicted. Barnes argues that, because he was a <em>pro se </em>litigant in the district court, this claim should not have been dismissed without leave to replead.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">The denial of leave to replead is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Pangburn v. Culbertson, </em>200 F.3d 65, 70 (2d Cir.1999). \u201c[A] pro se complaint is to be read liberally,\u201d and should not be dismissed without granting leave to replead at least once when such a reading \u201cgives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.\u201d <em>Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>171 F.3d 794, 795 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, leave to replead should be denied as futile where a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff speaking through appointed counsel on appeal suggests no new material he wishes to add to remedy substantive defects. <em>Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Barnes in fact did amend his complaint once after the motion to dismiss was filed. Moreover, the amended complaint has a substantive defect: it fails to allege facts sufficient to establish that narcotic drugs proximately caused any harm properly presented in Barnes\u2019s administrative claim. Barnes has not clarified how artful re-pleading could remedy this defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We decline to revisit allegations about other actions taken by the BVAMC staff. This Court\u2019s August 16, 2005 order dismissed Barnes\u2019s appeal as to all issues but those discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We have considered all of Barnes\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
