It is</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Ordered and Adjudged that the judgment of the District Court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">During a valid traffic stop, a police officer asked appellant for his license and registration. Appellant replied that he did not have a registration certificate because he had just purchased the car, and that the license plate displayed \u201cbelonged to another vehicle of his.\u201d The officer told appellant that it is illegal to drive an unregistered vehicle and asked him to step out of the car. When appellant did so, a 22-caliber Rohm lay in plain view. A jury convicted appellant of being a felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">Appellant challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the firearm on the grounds that the facts known to the officer at the time of arrest did not support probable cause justifying appellant\u2019s arrest. The uncontested facts, how-</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">ever, amply support the arrest. After hearing appellant\u2019s statements, a reasonable officer would believe that he drove an unregistered vehicle and did not possess a registration certificate i n violation of two separate provisions of the D.C.Code. <em>See </em>\u00a7 50-1501.04(a)(1)(A), (C). Appellant does not doubt that, with probable cause, he could be arrested for violations of these provisions. Rather, appellant argues, for the first time on appeal, that the officer should not have applied \u00a7 50-1501.04(a)(l) to a Maryland resident in the process of transferring registration to a newly acquired vehicle. We need not ponder whether appellant\u2019s claim comes too late, because it is plainly meritless. Appellant\u2019s statements to the officer did not indicate that he was \u201ctransferring\u201d plates from an old car to a new one. Had he so informed the officer, this might have put him within the compass of the Maryland law that he now cites. <em>See </em>COMAR \u00a7 11.15.11.02(A)(3) (\u201cRegistration plates acquired by any person, for any vehicle owned by that person, may be transferred to a newly acquired vehicle provided: ... [t]he vehicle from which the plates are to be transferred has been sold, traded, junked, or otherwise disposed of.\u201d). Appellant told the officer that the plate on the car that he was driving belonged to another car of his, not to a vehicle that had \u201cbeen sold, traded, junked, or otherwise disposed of.\u201d In these circumstances, the officer acted reasonably, and with probable cause, in arresting appellant for violations of the D.C.Code. In sum, because the officer had probable cause to arrest appellant for violations of District of Columbia law, there is no merit to his claim that the District Court improperly admitted the firearm that lay in plain view once appellant exited the car after he had been put under arrest. <em>See Horton v. California, </em>496 U.S. 128, 133-36, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990) (discussing the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>view doctrine); <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 460, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981) (\u201c[W]hen a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Appellant also argues that the District Court abused its discretion in admitting evidence that he had recently been shot. This evidence was obviously relevant and probative, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402, because being shot increases the probability that a person will arm himself for protection, <em>see </em>FED. R. EVID. 401 (defining evidence as relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d). Therefore, the evidence regarding appellant\u2019s gunshot wound was properly admitted to suggest motive. And we cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in applying Federal Rule of Evidence 403 and concluding that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Since the District Court neither erred in admitting the firearm nor abused its discretion in admitting evidence that appellant had been shot, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. CIR. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
