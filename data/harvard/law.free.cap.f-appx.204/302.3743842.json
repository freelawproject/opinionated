Wakefield asserts that he is entitled to the return of the property and he was never notified of any proposed forfeiture of the money. We review the denial of a motion for the return of seized property for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>192 F.3d 374, 376 (3d Cir.1999). A district court abuses its discretion if it fails or refuses to exercise its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>discretion, fails \u201cadequately to take into account judicially recognized factors constraining its exercise\u201d of discretion, or exercises its discretion based upon \u201cerroneous factual or legal premises.\u201d <em>James v. Jacobson, </em>6 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the present case, the record contains only Wakefield\u2019s motion, a notation on the docket sheet of the district court\u2019s oral order denying that motion, Wakefield\u2019s request for a statement of reasons for the decision, a docket sheet entry of the court\u2019s oral order denying that request, and the notice of appeal. The district court\u2019s orders do not express the reason for the denial of the motion for return of property. Because we cannot discern a basis for the decision on the sparse record before us, we are unable to determine whether the district court appropriately exercised its discretion. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings. We deny Wakefield\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
