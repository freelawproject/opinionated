Videla denying the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Tan Jin Lin, </em>No. A 95 429 672 (BIA October 20, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 429 672 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City August 5, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-23\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">In this case, the IJ found Lin\u2019s testimony incredible because she was unable to explain numerous inconsistencies between her testimony and her husband\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, Lin was unable to explain inconsistencies between her testimony and the documentary evidence she submitted. These are \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, regardless of any errors in the IJ\u2019s ruling. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74. Because the only evidence of a threat to Lin\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precludes success on the claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">Because Lin has not meaningfully challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of her CAT claim in her brief to this Court, that claim is waived and will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
