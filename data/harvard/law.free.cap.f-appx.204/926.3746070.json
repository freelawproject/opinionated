Defonzo granting Ford relief under former I.N.A. \u00a7 212(c), <em>In re Rudolph Oneil Ford, </em>No. A41 467 232 (B.I.A. June 24, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A41 467 232 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 12, 2004), was erroneous for the following reasons: (1) the BIA\u2019s order of removal that accompanied its reversal of the IJ\u2019s grant of relief under \u00a7 212(c) constituted an order of removal in the first instance that is not within the BIA\u2019s authority to issue, and (2) the BIA committed error when it failed to give proper consideration to the nature of Ford\u2019s criminal record and ignored evidence of Ford\u2019s rehabilitation because in so doing it ignored or misapplied its own precedent. For the reasons that follow we reject both arguments and hold that we lack jurisdiction to review this petition. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">A. <em>Whether a valid order of deportation was issued</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Ford argues that the IJ\u2019s finding that Ford is deportable does not constitute an order of deportation and, as a result, the BIA\u2019s order of removal that accompanied its reversal of the IJ\u2019s grant of discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c) is a legal nullity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. As this Court recently held in <em>Lazo v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 53 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam), \u201ca finding of removability is an order of removal, so that the [BIA] may reinstate a previous order of removal by overturning an IJ\u2019s grant of discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54. As a result, when the BIA reverses an IJ\u2019s grant of discretionary relief to a petitioner that accompanied the IJ\u2019s finding of deportability, the BIA\u2019s decision is not an order of deportation in the first instance, rather it merely \u201cremove[s] an impediment to the [deportation] that was ordered by the IJ.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, the IJ found that Ford was deportable. We hold, therefore, the IJ\u2019s finding that Ford was deportable constituted an order of deportation. Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>trary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, the BIA was fully within its authority to reinstate that order by reversing the IJ\u2019s grant of discretionary relief. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">B. <em>Whether we have jurisdiction to review the decision of the BIA denying Ford relief under former \u00a7 212(c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Having determined that the BIA had the authority to enter the order it did, we turn to whether this Court has jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), a discretionary decision of the BIA (as the delegate of the Attorney General) is generally unreviewable on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-6\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... no court shall have jurisdiction to review ... (ii) any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). The grant or denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief is a discretionary decision. I.N.A. \u00a7 212(c) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994) (repealed 1996)) (specifically providing that the granting of relief is within \u201cthe discretion of the attorney general\u201d); <em>see also In re Marin, </em>16 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 581, 583, 1978 WL 36472 (BIA 1978) (\u201c[T]he Attorney General or his delegate is required to determine as a matter of discretion whether an applicant warrants [\u00a7 212(c)] relief....\u201d). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) restores appellate jurisdiction in limited circumstances. That section provides that no provision of the INA \u201cshall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review....\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Our jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Ford \u00a7 212(c) relief depends, therefore, on whether Ford\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s decision can be characterized as raising either constitutional claims or questions of law. We hold they cannot. We, therefore, lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">As we recently explained, \u201cabsent a specific issue of statutory construction, the term \u2018questions of law\u2019 in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) does not provide our Court with jurisdiction to review a petitioner\u2019s challenge to a decision firmly committed by statute to the discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d <em>Bugayong v. I.N.S., </em>442 F.3d 67, 72 (2d Cir.2006). As for whether a petitioner raises a \u201cconstitutional claim,\u201d we have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-13\">[T]he mere assertion that an IJ has \u201cabused his discretion\u201d by \u201cincorrectly weighting] the evidence, failing] to explicitly consider certain evidence, [or] simply reaching] the wrong outcome\u201d does not itself establish a colorable \u201cconstitutional claim\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), even if a petitioner \u201cdressfes] up\u201d his claim in the language of due process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-14\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services, </em>437 F.3d 238, 244 (2d Cir.2006)). Here, Ford argues that the BIA ignored or misapplied its own precedent when it failed to give proper consideration to the nature of Ford\u2019s criminal record and ignored evidence of Ford\u2019s rehabilitation. Because those claims amount to nothing more than a challenge to the weight accorded them in the BIA\u2019s analysis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">Because the BIA acted within its authority when issuing the discretionary decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>that is the subject of this petition, this Court is without jurisdiction to review it, and the petition is, therefore, DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Upon consideration of Ford\u2019s motion filed October 27, 2006 for a stay of expiration of his voluntary departure period, that motion is hereby GRANTED, and Ford\u2019s voluntary departure period is stayed for a period of ten days from the filing of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b955-10\">. The IJ\u2019s decision refers to \"deportation\u201d and \"deportability.\u201d The BIA\u2019s decision orders Ford \"removed from the United States.\" Our recent decision, <em>Lazo </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 53 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam), referred to \"removal\u201d rather than \"deportation\u201d orders. The statute at issue in <em>Lazo, </em>as here, however, deals with \"orders of deportation\u201d and our conclusion in <em>Lazo </em>is based in part on the proposition that \"removal\u201d and \"deportation\u201d are terms that may be used interchangeably. <em>Lazo, </em>462 F.3d at 54 (citing <em>Evangelista </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 145, 147 n. 1 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>Duamutef v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 172, 176 n. 4 (2d Cir.2004)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b955-16\">. As in <em>Lazo, </em>because the IJ\u2019s finding of deportability constitutes an order of deportation, we need not and do not reach the issue of whether the BIA has the power to issue deportation orders in the first instance. <em>See Lazo, </em>462 F.3d at 55 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b956-10\">. Contrary to Ford\u2019s arguments on appeal, in considering his second degree manslaughter conviction the BIA stated that it adopted the IJ's findings of fact and considered not only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>the conviction but the circumstances of the offense as well. In so doing, the BIA followed its own precedent. <em>See In re Roberts, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 294, 301, 1991 WL 353515 (BIA 1991) (allowing consideration of circumstances surrounding a crime, but prohibiting going \"behind a record of conviction to reassess an alien\u2019s ultimate guilt or innocence\u201d). Also, although the BIA regarded Ford\u2019s additional criminal conduct during the pendency of his deportation proceeding to be \"a significant adverse factor,\u201d it specifically adopted the IJ\u2019s findings of fact and considered \"the record as a whole, weighing the positive equities against the negative factors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
