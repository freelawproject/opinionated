Masey is currently incarcerated on a guilty plea conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) &amp; 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">He argues that the district court adopted an automatic approach in denying him a two level reduction and that the district court failed to find that his pretrial release violations were willful. The court need not decide whether plain error applies to these precise issues because Mas\u00e9is arguments fail even under a more lenient clear error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIf the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d his offense level should be decreased by two levels. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2004). Because \u201c[t]he sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d the \u00a7 3E1.1 determination \u201cis entitled to great deference on review.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 5 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The sentencing transcript reflects that the district court thoroughly considered Masey\u2019s arguments in support of the reduction at the sentencing hearing. Masey failed to rebut the information contained in the presentence report that Masey\u2019s employer and friend was willing to provide him transportation to his Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in accordance with pretrial release conditions. <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). To the extent that Masey argues that the district court failed to make a finding that his violations were willful, Masey cites neither case law nor statutory authority that a finding of willfulness must be made prior to denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 359; <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 203 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
