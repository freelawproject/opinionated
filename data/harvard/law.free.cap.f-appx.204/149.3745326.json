No. 04-1530, <em>see In re Salemo, </em>130 Fed.Appx. 564 (3d Cir.2005), and assert jurisdiction over his motion filed pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After Salerno filed his mandamus petition, the District Court entered an order rescinding its prior order wherein it had concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his \u00a7 2255 motion. In accordance with our decision in <em>In re Salemo, </em>130 Fed.Appx. at 566, the District Court indicated that it would consider Salerno\u2019s motion as if it were the first \u00a7 2255 motion filed by petitioner. Additionally, the District Court entered an order on October 5, 2006, directing the government to file a response to Salemo\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Accordingly, insofar as the District Court has done that which Salerno has sought to have this Court compel it to do, the petition for a writ of mandamus will be denied as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
