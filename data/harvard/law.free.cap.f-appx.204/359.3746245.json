Gonzalez was sentenced to a 57-month term of imprisonment and to a three-year period of supervised release. Gonzalez gave timely notice of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Gonzalez contends that the district court erred in ruling that his prior New York conviction of third-degree felony rape was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2004). <em>See </em>N.Y. PENAL LAW ANN. \u00a7 130.25 (McKinney 1998). We review this question de novo. <em>See United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 338 (5th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by 16 levels if, prior to deportation, he was convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The offense of statutory rape is a crime of violence. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Gonzalez was convicted under part 2 of \u00a7 130.25, under which a person is guilty of rape in the third degree when, \u201cBeing twenty-one years old or more, he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person to whom the actor is not married less than seventeen years old.\u201d \u00a7 130.25-2. This statutory definition is consistent with a \u201ccommon sense\u201d meaning of the offense of statutory rape. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275-77 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005). The district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">Gonzalez contends that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum two-year term of imprisonment under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) because he was sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b) on the basis of facts that were not alleged in the indictment, admitted by him, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Gonzalez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Gonzalez contends <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>this court has repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-11\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
