Robinson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders granting summary judgment to Respondent and dismissing as untimely his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000), and denying his motion for reconsideration. The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Robinson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal in No. 06-6982.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Robinson petitions for a writ of mandamus in No. 06-7081, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on his \u00a7 2254 petition. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Because the district court rendered a final order in the case, we find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition in No. 06-7081. We also deny Robinson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">No. 06-6982, <em>DISMISSED; </em>No. 06-7081, <em>PETITION DENIED.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> We also note that Robinson\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is a successive petition. Robinson filed a prior \u00a7 2254 petition in the District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
