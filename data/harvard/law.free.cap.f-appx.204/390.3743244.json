Wooderts argues that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) improperly denied him credit on his federal sentence beginning from the time of his arrest by state law enforcement officials and that, following the dismissal of state charges and lifting of a state parole violator warrant, he was in the sole custody of the federal Government. Wooderts has failed to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>that the state custody was interrupted, and he was not entitled to credit on his federal sentence for the time that he was in federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>758 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). With the benefit of liberal construction, Wooderts also argues that the BOP failed to consider properly his request for a nunc pro tunc designation that would have effectuated the concurrent running of his federal and state sentences. Given the district court\u2019s clarification that Wooderts\u2019s sentence was to be served consecutively to any state sentence, the BOP did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant Wooderts\u2019s request. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3584(a)-(b), 3621(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
