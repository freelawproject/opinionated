Apr. 20, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A78 863 029 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 22, 2004). The BIA reissued its April 20, 2005 decision on May 27, 2005. <em>In re Qi Qing Chen, </em>No. A78 863 029 (B.I.A. May 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, this Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-22\">Even where an adverse credibility finding is based, in part, on flawed grounds, remand is not required where we can \u201cconfidently predict[ ]\u201d that the IJ would have reached the same conclusion absent the error-based grounds. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006). Although some of the IJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence, the remaining findings are sufficiently strong that remand would be futile. As the IJ noted, Chen\u2019s testimony was fairly vague throughout. The IJ reasonably determined that Chen\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his mother\u2019s letter as to whether they saw each other after her arrest and whether he actually practiced Falun Gong in China. In addition, Chen gave implausible testimony as to how he learned of his parents\u2019 arrests. Chen also failed to explain how the government might have learned of his involvement with Falun Gong. These factors directly relate to the basis of his claim. Accordingly, this Court can confidently predict that the agency would reach the same result absent the error-based grounds, and that, as a result, a remand would serve no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">As Chen failed to raise any arguments regarding the denial of his withholding of removal or CAT claims in his brief to this Court, we deem these claims waived. <em>See Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
