After two evidentiary hearings, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Nunez\u2019s claim and the Appeals Council affirmed. Treating the decision of the Appeals Council as the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, Nunez filed suit in the district court for the Western District of Texas seeking judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge who reviewed the record and briefs submitted by both parties. The district court entered final judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny Nunez benefits. Nunez appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Our review is limited to determining (1) whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and (2) whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision comports with relevant legal standards. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>174 F.3d 692, 693 (5th Cir.1999). We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the record excerpts, and relevant portions of the record itself. For the reasons stated in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order, we find that the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is based on a proper application of the law. We affirm the decision of the district court to enter final judgment against Nunez.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
