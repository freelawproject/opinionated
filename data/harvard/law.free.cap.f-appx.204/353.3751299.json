Tiburcio-Avila was sentenced to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Tiburcio-Avila contends that the district court abused its discretion by imposing as a condition of supervised release that he cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample. Because this issue is not ripe for review, this court does not have jurisdiction, and the appeal must be dismissed in part. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated by Riascos-Cuenu v. U.S., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 827, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2006). Tiburcio-Avila correctly concedes that the ripeness issue is foreclosed by circuit precedent but raises his argument to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Tiburcio-Avila argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing his sentence under the then mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, which were subsequently held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because he did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>104 F.3d 1465, 1471-72 (5th Cir.1997). Under the plain-error standard of review, \u201creversal is not required unless there is (1) an error; (2) that is clear or plain; (3) that affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>216 F.3d 456, 459 (5th Cir.2000). The imposition of Tiburcio-Avila\u2019s sentence under the mandatory Guidelines was error that was plain. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). However, Tiburcio-Avila has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights as he has not shown that the district court would likely have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory guidelines sentencing scheme. <em>See id. </em>at 600-01. Therefore, he has not shown that the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence under the mandatory Guidelines was reversible plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">Tiburcio-Avila argues that his conviction should be vacated because the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>His constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Tiburcio-Avila contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Tiburcio-Avila properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b382-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
