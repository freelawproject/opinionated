We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2005), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Singh challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility determination. In light of the particular facts presented here, including the IJ\u2019s finding regarding Singh\u2019s \u201creadily shifting\u201d testimony, we conclude that the inconsistencies in Singh\u2019s testimony deprive his claim of the requisite \u201cring of truth.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1067. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence in this case does not compel a finding that the petitioner was credible, or that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was based on impermissible grounds. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In the absence of credible evidence, Singh has failed to show eligibility for asylum or withholding. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Because Singh\u2019s claim under the CAT is based on the same facts that the IJ found to be not credible, and Singh points to no other evidence the IJ should have considered, he has failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
