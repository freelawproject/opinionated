Ali contends that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen, which raised the claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to request voluntary departure on his behalf. Ah has abandoned the remaining ineffective-assistance claims raised in his motion to reopen by failing to argue them in his petition for review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-21\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen under \u201ca highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). Our review of constitutional challenges is de novo. <em>Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 549 (5th Cir.2006). Likewise, we review de novo the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-22\">\u201c \u2018[T]he failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). A request for voluntary departure is a request for discretionary relief. <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997). Even if Ali had a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during the immigration proceedings, he had no due process right to effective assistance of counsel in pursuit of discretionary relief. <em>Gutierrez-Morales v. Homan, </em>461 F.3d 605, 609 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Mireles-Valdez v. Ashcroft, </em>349 F.3d 213, 219 (5th Cir.2003). Ali\u2019s argument that his case is distinguishable from <em>Assaad </em>because he \u201cwas unable to even request the relief\u2019 is unavailing. <em>Cf. Gutierrez-Morales, </em>461 F.3d at 609-10 (holding that alien has no due process right to effective assistance of counsel in seeking to present waiver application\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>purely discretionary relief \u2014 to the Immigration Judge or the BIA on its merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
