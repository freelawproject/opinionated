The court sentenced Gilchrist to 112 years of imprisonment. We affirmed the conviction. Thereafter, however, we granted Gilchrist\u2019s petition for rehearing and vacated and remanded to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court resentenced Gilchrist to an identical sentence and he again appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Gilchrist\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there <em>are </em>no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the district court erred by allowing Gilchrist to be tried and sentenced on an indictment that failed to allege specific violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). We have previously rejected this argument. See <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the precursor case to <em>Booker, </em>applies to facts that increase the sentence beyond the statutory maximum, but not to facts that merely increase the mandatory minimum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>including the issues raised in Gilchrist\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
