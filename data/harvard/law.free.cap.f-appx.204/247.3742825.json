Williams seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation to deny relief on her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. The report contained language advising Williams that she must file written objections to the report within ten days of the order\u2019s entry. The magistrate judge\u2019s report was entered on June 22, 2006, and within ten days of its entry, Williams filed in the district court an \u201cappeal\u201d of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. The document does not specifically express an intent to appeal to this court, but takes issue with various aspects of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The magistrate judge\u2019s report is not such an order. However, according Williams\u2019 document a liberal construction, <em>see Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147 (4th Cir.1978), we construe the \u201cappeal\u201d letter as objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We therefore deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal, dismiss the appeal, and remand to the district court with instructions to construe Williams\u2019 filing as timely objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-14\"> Such a construction is further warranted by the fact that, although the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C) (2000), the report states that the magistrate judge was conferred jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
