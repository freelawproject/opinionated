Dimas claims that his federal rights were violated 1) because the state trial court admitted evidence of his commission of an extraneous burglary and 2) because the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that he was guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-19\">We have reviewed the record and the briefs submitted by the parties and hold that Dimas failed to meet his burden of establishing that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claims resulted in a decision that was contrary to federal law, or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 402-13, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L,Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Story v.

Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
