For reversal, Peery argues that the court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it was at the top of the Guidelines range and the court considered only the nature and circumstances of the offense to the exclusion of other relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) that warranted a lesser sentence. We reject this argument and affirm Peery\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">Specifically, we conclude that the sentence was not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because we see no basis for Peery to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a sentence that falls within the undisputed advisory Guidelines range, <em>see United States v. Tobacco, </em>428 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 840, 163 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005). As to the section 3553(a) factors, the court was not required to explicitly discuss in open court each and every section 3553(a) sentencing factor, and notably, the court did discuss various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>relevant factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment, and the need to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public from further crimes. <em>See United States v. Lamoreaux, </em>422 F.3d 750, 756 (8th Cir.2005) (nothing in \u00a7 3553(a) requires \u201crobotic incantations\u201d that each factor was considered); <em>United States v. White Face, </em>383 F.3d 733, 740 (8th Cir.2004) (if sentencing judge references some \u00a7 3553(a) considerations, appellate court is ordinarily satisfied district court was aware of entire contents of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-16\">. The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
