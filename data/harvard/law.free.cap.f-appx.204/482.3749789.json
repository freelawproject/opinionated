Favorite appeals his guilty-plea conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He contends that the sentence imposed was unreasonable because it failed to reflect the unusual lack of seriousness of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-25\">Favorite does not challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of the guideline range. The district court considered the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and determined that a sentence at the top of the guideline range was appropriate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Therefore, Favorite\u2019s sentence within the properly calculated guideline range was presumptively reasonable, and he has failed to demonstrate that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
