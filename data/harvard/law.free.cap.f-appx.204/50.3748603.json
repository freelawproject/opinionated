Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), reducing from 78 to 63 months the term of imprisonment imposed in the original judgment of conviction entered on December 19, 2003, following guilty pleas on two counts of receiving and distributing materials that contained child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(B), and on one count of possessing materials that contained child pornography, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">There is no merit to Santiago\u2019s claim that the district court violated his rights as articulated in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), when it applied enhancements to his Sentencing Guidelines calculation based on facts that Santiago had not pled to, or admitted, in court. It appears, however, that Santiago in his plea may have allocuted to many of the facts that form the basis for the sentencing enhancements applied to his sentence. Nevertheless, even were we to assume that the court had enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence due to unadmitted findings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> our precedent makes clear that unless a defendant\u2019s sentence exceeds the maximum sentence prescribed by statute, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>violation. <em>Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 109-10 n. 6. It is clear that Santiago\u2019s sentence of 63 months is well under the statutory maximum penalty. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Santiago contends also that even if the district court could have enhanced his sentence by making factual findings to which he had not specifically pled, the court\u2019s application of a five-level enhancement under section 2G2.2(b)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines was erroneous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reviewing <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of section 2G2.2 here, <em>United States v. Rubenstein, </em>403 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir.2005), we agree with the district court that the enhancement requires only that \u201ca defendant distributed child pornography in anticipation of, or while reasonably believing in the possibility of, the receipt of a thing of value,\u201d and not \u201ca specific agreement or understanding between the distributor and the recipient of child pornography.\u201d <em>United States v. Maneri, </em>353 F.3d 165, 168-69 (2d Cir.2003). We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the enhancement applied to defendant\u2019s case, <em>Rubenstein, </em>403 F.3d at 99, where Santiago entered a chat room \u201c[Booking to trade videos\u201d and then transmitted images of child pornography based on that premise, and where a search of his computer\u2019s hard-drive revealed thousands of still and video images depicting child pornography and what appeared to be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>chart on which Santiago had columns listing images \u201cI sent them\u201d and images \u201cThey sent me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Further, the district court did not err when it refused to reduce Santiago\u2019s sentence to conform to those in three child pornography cases cited by defendant. The district court correctly noted that the Sentencing Guidelines themselves were the best way to eliminate sentence disparities because they took the individual circumstances of each case into account.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Finally, we reject Santiago\u2019s contention that the application of an enhancement for using a computer to aid in the distribution and possession of child pornography, pursuant to section 2G2.2(b)(5) of the Sentencing Guidelines, amounted to impermissible double counting. Here, Congress clearly viewed the distribution of child pornography as a serious harm but viewed such pornography\u2019s dissemination via computer as a distinct, more serious harm because computers permit, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cwide dissemination and instantaneous transmission\u201d of pornographic materials. <em>United States v. Demerritt, </em>196 F.3d 138, 142 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting H.R. Rep. No 104-90, at 3-4 (1995), <em>reprinted in </em>1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 759, 760-61). Given these distinct harms, the district court here, when \u201ccalculating [Santiago\u2019s] Guidelines sentence,\u201d appropriately \u201capplied] multiple Guidelines provisions based on the same underlying conduct where that is the result clearly intended by Congress and the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Maloney, </em>406 F.3d 149, 152-53 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">For the reasons discussed, the district court\u2019s amended judgment of conviction and sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-5\">. Santiago is also incorrect in contending that judicial factfinding by a preponderance of the evidence standard was error. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15 (2d Cir.2005) (\"Judicial authority to find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence survives <em>Booker.\").</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">. At the time of Santiago\u2019s offenses, a defendant who had not previously been convicted of any of the offenses listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b) was subject to maximum statutory penalties of 15 years for a violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(2)(B) and 5 years for a violation of \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(1) and (2) (enumerating statutory penalties). In 2003, \u00a7 2252A(b) was amended to increase these statutory maxima to 20 yeas and 10 years, respectively. <em>See </em>Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003, Pub.L. No. 108-21, \u00a7 103, 117 Stat. 650, 652-53 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\">. Section 2G2.2(b)(2)(B) applies to an offense involving the \"[d]istribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.\u201d In the November 2004 Sentencing Guidelines, this provision was recodified as section 2G2.2(b)(3)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b81-17\">. In <em>United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114 (2d Cir.2005), upon which defendant substantially relies for this argument, the Guidelines calculation was exactly the same as Santiago\u2019s \u2014 an adjusted offense level of 27 and a sentencing range of 70-87 months. <em>Id. </em>at 115. This reinforces the point of the Guidelines \u2014 that similar conduct results in similar sentencing calculations. That the district court in <em>Selioutsky </em>ultimately departed downward because of family circumstances and sentenced Selioutsky to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>at 115-16, does not help Santiago because he did not have a similar family circumstances claim. Insofar as the other factual circumstances of both his and Selioutsky\u2019s crimes are the same, the Guideline calculations treated them the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
