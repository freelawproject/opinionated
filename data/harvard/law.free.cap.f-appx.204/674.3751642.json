We deny the petition in part and dismiss in part. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000). Agent Schultz testified that Satchithananthan has been identified by name as a key member of a smuggling ring. In light of this evidence, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to credit Satchithananthan\u2019s testimony in the absence of any corroborative evidence. <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1257 (9th Cir.2003). Indeed, \u201cwhere the IJ has reason to question the applicant\u2019s credibility, and the applicant fails to produce nonduplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence and provides no credible explanation for such failure, an adverse credibility finding will withstand appellate review.\u201d <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir.2000). Given that Satchithananthan has corresponded with her Canadian family since coming to the United States, such corroboration was \u201ceasily available.\u201d <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1044-45. Because the IJ\u2019s determinations that: (1) there were \u201cweaknesses in the record\u201d sufficient to raise doubts about Satchithananthan\u2019s credibility; and (2) Satchithananthan failed to produce easily available corroboration are supported by substantial evidence, \u201cwe are bound to accept the IJ\u2019s credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Wang, </em>352 F.3d at 1259).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">In the absence of credible testimony, Satchithananthan failed to meet her burden of demonstrating eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review Satchithananthan\u2019s claim for relief under the Convention Against Torture because she failed to exhaust the claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b703-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
