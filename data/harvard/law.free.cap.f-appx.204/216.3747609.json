The court sentenced Carry to the statutory maximum of 60 months on count one, a concurrent 188-month term on count 2, a consecutive statutory maximum 120-month term on count 3, and a 180-month statutory maximum term on count 6, to run concurrently with the sentences on counts 1 and 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Thus, Carry received a total of 308 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-21\">On appeal, Carry argues that because his retained attorney did not appear in federal court and his appointed attorney advised him not to plead guilty pursuant to a plea agreement, his ability to obtain a lower sentence was compromised. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be brought in a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless it conclusively appears from the face of the record that counsel was ineffective. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006); <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir. 1991). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude the record in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>does not conclusively demonstrate that Carry\u2019s counsel was ineffective. Carry\u2019s allegations are not a substitute for a more extensive examination under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Mandello, </em>426 F.2d 1021 (4th Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Carry also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the court applied the sentencing guidelines as mandatory. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court excised the portions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the guidelines mandatory, and the Court made clear that the guidelines were to be applied in an advisory manner. Carry was sentenced eleven months after the <em>Booker </em>decision, and there is nothing in the record to suggest the court did not apply the guidelines as advisory, as directed by <em>Booker. </em>To the extent Carry alleges the district court faded to properly consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006) factors, this sentencing argument fads. Although the court did not specifically reference \u00a7 3553(a), its explanation of why it sentenced Carry at the low end of the advisory guidelines range reflects that it considered some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.) (noting that a court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor \u201cin checklist fashion\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The guidelines ranges for counts 1, 3, and 6 were greater than the statutory maximum terms, so the court imposed the statutory m\u00e1ximums pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5G1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
