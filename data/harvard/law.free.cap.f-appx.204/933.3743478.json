After finding that Gamble was an Armed Career Criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the district court imposed a sentence of, <em>inter alia, </em>216 months incarceration. On October 29, 2004, we affirmed Gamble\u2019s conviction, <em>United States v. Gamble, </em>388 F.3d 74 (2d Cir.2004), but later remanded his sentence for reconsideration pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). On January 5, 2006, the district court reaffirmed its original sentence. Gamble now appeals, arguing (1) that his sentence is unreasonable and (2) that the district judge engaged in impermissible fact finding in violation of the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">We review sentences for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Reasonableness review has both substantive and procedural dimensions. <em>See Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 114. Substantive reasonableness examines \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is reasonable in light of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006). Procedural reasonableness examines whether the district court correctly \u201c(a) identified the Guidelines range supported by facts found by the court, (b) treated the Guidelines as advisory, and (c) considered the Guidelines together with the other [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">Gamble argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the evidence at trial established possession of an \u201cextremely small quantity of drugs and ammunition\u201d \u2014 1.7 grams of crack cocaine and 6 bullets \u2014 and because, absent the Armed Career Criminal enhancement, his Guidelines range would have been substantially less. But Gamble does not challenge his eligibility for sentencing as an Armed Career Criminal, and the district court adequately responded to Gamble\u2019s complaint about the severity of such a sentence by downwardly departing one point in both Gamble\u2019s total offense level and his criminal history category. The district court acted well within its discretion in imposing a sentence in the middle of the Guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Gamble also contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to consider properly the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). But \u201c[t]he weight to be afforded any given argument made pursuant to one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge and is beyond our review, as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 32 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>Finally, Gamble argues the district court engaged in impermissible fact finding in violation of the Sixth Amendment when it considered Gamble\u2019s alleged perjury at a post-trial hearing. Because we have repeatedly upheld district courts\u2019 ability to \u201cresolve disputed facts by a preponderance of the evidence when arriving at a guidelines sentence\u201d following <em>Booker, United States v. Gonzalez, </em>407 F.3d 118, 125 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 112, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
