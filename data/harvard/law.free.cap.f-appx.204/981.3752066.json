(\u201cHunts\u201d) petitions for review of an order of the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (\u201cUSDA\u201d), which ordered publication of the facts and circumstances of its findings: that Hunts had repeatedly and flagrantly violated the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\u201cPACA\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 499a-499s. Petitioner contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that the decision not to postpone its hearing after it promised to make full payment to its suppliers was an abuse of discretion, as was the USDA\u2019s failure to take into account the possibility of repayment and other relevant mitigating circumstances before going forward with the hearing and imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">On March 31, 2003, the USDA filed a complaint alleging that during the period between September 2001 and June 2002, Hunts failed to make prompt and full payment to sellers of agricultural commodities, as mandated by PACA, which requires all covered entities such as petitioner to make \u201cfull payment promptly\u201d for all purchases of perishable agricultural commodities received in interstate commence. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4). \u201cFull payment promptly\u201d has been defined as, <em>inter alia, </em>payment \u201cfor produce purchased by a buyer, within 10 days after the day on which the produce is accepted.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.2(aa)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">On August 5, 2004, five days before the hearing, Hunts requested a postponement, allegedly so that it might pay its creditors in full. The USDA declined. Hunts reiterated this request in its preliminary statement at the hearing, but offered no evidence that it had any funds available to make full payment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Hunts had failed to make timely payments of over $795,000 to agricultural suppliers. The ALJ also found that Hunts\u2019 violations were repeated and willful, and since the appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>priate punishment would have been license revocation, but for the fact that Hunts had allowed its license to lapse in June 2002, the appropriate sanction was to publish the facts and circumstances of Hunts\u2019 violations. <em>See Finer Foods Sales Co. v. Block, </em>708 F.2d 774, 777 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Hunts now argues that the USDA\u2019s actions deprived it of an opportunity to avail itself of the agency\u2019s \u201cslow pay\u201d policy, as set forth in <em>In re Scamcorp Inc., </em>57 Agric. Dec. 527, 548-49 (1998), in a manner that was arbitrary and capricious. Hunts argues that since PACA is designed to promote prompt payment to the suppliers of perishable agricultural commodities, that by refusing Hunts\u2019 settlement offer (and thereby delaying payment to Hunts\u2019 creditors until after the hearing) the USDA acted in a manner contrary to PACA\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">This argument is without merit. While Hunts offered evidence that it had made partial repayment, it had failed to make full payment to those suppliers to which it was admittedly seriously in arrears within 120 days of being served with the complaint. Had the ALJ postponed the hearing (and had Hunts indeed been able to make full repayment to its suppliers, a fact which is not established by the record we have before us), the same sanctions as those actually imposed would still have been applicable, since Hunts would not have been able to retroactively avail itself of <em>Scamcorp\u2019s </em>\u201cslow pay\u201d provisions, as Hunts would have been making payment 17 months after having been served with the complaint. Hunts\u2019 argument that the decision not to postpone the hearing resulted in more serious sanctions is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Furthermore, the USDA\u2019s purported decision to delay the repayment of creditors in order to impose sanctions was not contrary to PACA\u2019s purpose. PACA is a remedial statute designed to ensure that commerce in agricultural commodities is conducted in an atmosphere of financial responsibility. <em>See Harry Klein Produce Corp. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>831 F.2d 403, 405 (2d Cir.1987). \u201cIt is an intentionally rigorous law whose primary purpose is to exercise control over an industry \u201cwhich is highly competitive, and in which the opportunities for sharp practices, irresponsible business conduct, and unfair methods are numerous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting S.Rep. No. 84-2507 at 3 (1956), reprinted in 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3699, 3701). Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s arguments, PACA\u2019s primary purpose is not compensatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">While petitioner also contends that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not based on substantial evidence, this argument is without merit, given Hunts\u2019 own admission that they were at one point over $1,000,000 in arrears to multiple agricultural suppliers. Accordingly, we find that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence, and that his conclusion that petitioner\u2019s violations were flagrant and repeated did not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See Havana Potatoes of New York Corp. v. United States, </em>136 F.3d 89, 91-92 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">Finally, petitioner\u2019s argument that the sanction here was arbitrary because lesser sanctions have been imposed in similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>cases is not convincing. <em>See Harry Klein Produce Corp., </em>831 F.2d at 407 (holding that \u201cPACA does not require uniformity of sanctions for similar violations.\u201d). We have carefully considered petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the petition is DENIED and we direct enforcement of the USDA\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">. Two of Hunts' suppliers had filed an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499e(b)(2). Pursuant to a preliminary injunction entered in that case, all of Hunts\u2019 assets are held in trust for those creditors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">. If, as petitioner seemingly alleges, PACA\u2019s requirements are inconsistent with industry custom or are counter-productive, \"Congress is the body that must make that judgment.\u201d <em>Havana Potatoes, </em>136 F.3d at 94. We do not find, given PACA\u2019s \"prompt payment\u201d requirement, that the application of the Secretary\u2019s regulations enforcing prompt payment are \"arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to [PACA].\u201d <em>See Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
