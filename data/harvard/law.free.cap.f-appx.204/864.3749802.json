We deny their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Guzman is descended from a family of wealthy ranchers and farmers who live in El Guamo, Colombia. For generations, her family has been involved in the Colombian Liberal Party. Guzman and Garcia met as college students in Bogota where Guzman was a member of the Liberal Party and, during vacations, participated in health and education activities around El Guamo. In 1997, the FARC, a Colombian terrorist organization, attempted to kidnap Guzman\u2019s father and later sent him threatening letters. Between March 1999 and July 1999, Guzman received several telephone calls from members of the FARC who threatened to harm her if she did not stop her health and education activities and leave the region. On July 4, 1999, Guzman flew to the United States to join her then-f\u00edanc\u00e9, Garcia, who was in this country on business.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The FARC continued its campaign against Guzman\u2019s family in her absence. The FARC assassinated her father\u2019s cousin and his wife, also farmers in El Guamo, in 2002 and 2004 respectively. The FARC forced a cousin of Guzman to flee El Guamo. The FARC also continued to threaten Guzman\u2019s father by sending him letters that demanded that he meet with them and pay a \u201cwar tax.\u201d Guzman\u2019s father began managing his business affairs from residences in other parts of the country. Guzman\u2019s sister moved to Spain.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In December 27, 2002, the Department of Homeland Security initiated proceedings to deport Guzman and Garcia. Guzman filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ considered Guzman\u2019s application for asylum timely, but denied it. The IJ also found that Guzman had not proved that it would be more likely than not that she would be persecuted upon returning to Colombia and denied her petition for withholding. The IJ found that Guzman may be able to relocate within Colombia because her political activities had been local. Guzman and Garcia appealed to the BIA and moved to submit additional evidence. The BIA dismissed the motion to allow new evidence and adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">\u201cWe review only the [BIAJ\u2019s decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). We review legal issues de novo, <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001), and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). To reverse a factual finding, we must conclude that the record compels a contrary finding. <em>Id. </em>at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Guzman and Garcia challenge the denial of their application for asylum and withholding of removal. Because Guzman and Garcia address the denial of their motion to submit additional evidence only in passing in the summary of their argument, this issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (noting precedent that \u201cpassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such issues are deemed abandoned\u201d). The arguments of Guzman and Garcia fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is unable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>unwilling to return to his or her home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion...\u201d INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A refugee seeking asylum \u201ccarries the burden of proving [her] statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status and thereby establishing asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230 (citing <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). \u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31. We have held that \u201c \u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citation omitted) (brackets in original). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). Guzman \u201cmust establish that the guerillas persecuted her or will seek to persecute her in the future <em>because of </em>her actual or imputed political opinion.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The record does not compel reversal of the conclusions that Guzman failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Even if the kidnaping attempt and assassinations of Guzman\u2019s relatives were sufficient to establish that Guzman had a well-founded fear of being in danger if returned to Colombia, the record does not compel the conclusion that this fear was on account of Guzman\u2019s political opinion. Guzman did not establish that the attacks on her family members were on account of either her political opinion or the political opinion of her family, which the FARC is aware that she shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Because substantial evidence supports the denial of their application for asylum, Guzman and Garcia are not entitled to withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must have established that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a statutorily protected factor if returned to Colombia.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 (citing INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)). \u201cWhere an applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, [s]he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in original) (quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Guzman\u2019s and Garcia\u2019s petitions are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
