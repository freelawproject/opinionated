The district court granted summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor, denying Hayes\u2019 access to courts claim on the merits. The court also dismissed without prejudice the remaining claims on the ground that Hayes failed to exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hayes appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-26\">Hayes contends on appeal that the district court erred by denying relief on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>access to courts claim because he was denied writing paper when he faced a January 6, 2003 filing deadline and because he was unable to perfect his appeal in <em>Hayes v. Corpening, </em>No. 1:99-cv-00232 (W.D.N.C. Sept. 16, 2003) (unpublished). We have carefully considered Hayes\u2019 claim and are convinced that the district court properly denied relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-56, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (requiring inmate to show an actual injury, such as establishing that defendants caused an actionable claim to be lost or prevented plaintiff from filing a claim); <em>Strickler v. Waters, </em>989 F.2d 1375, 1383-84 (4th Cir.1993) (holding that, to establish claim of denial of access to courts, prisoner must allege actual injury or specific harm resulting from denial).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Hayes also claims on appeal that the district court erred in finding that his remaining claims were unexhausted. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error in the dismissal of these claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Accordingly, we affirm this portion of the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Hayes v. Stanley, </em>No. 5:03-ct-00759-FL (E.D.N.C. Feb. 2, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-16\">. Generally, dismissals without prejudice are interlocutory and not appealable. <em>Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union </em>392, 10 F.3d 1064, 1066 (4th Cir.1993). However, a dismissal without prejudice could be final if no amendment to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>plaint would cure the defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 1066-67. We conclude that the defect in this case (the failure to exhaust administrative remedies) can only be cured by something more than an amendment to the complaint and that the order is therefore appealable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b333-25\">. We note that the district court did not specifically address Hayes\u2019 claim that he was unable to perfect an appeal in that pending litigation. Any error is harmless in light of the fact that Hayes did not exhaust his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
