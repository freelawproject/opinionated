Specifically, he faults his trial counsel for erroneously calculating his criminal history category and, on the basis of that miscalculation, erroneously advising him that he would be eligible, via the \u201csafety valve,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, to receive a sentence below the statutory mandatory 10-year minimum that would otherwise apply to his offense. Because the existing record here is sufficiently developed, we depart from our usual practice of treating ineffective assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of counsel claims raised for the first time on direct appeal as premature and, instead, proceed to consider Arizmendi\u2019s claim on its merits. <em>United States v. Natanel, </em>938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u201cThe touchstone for any ineffective assistance of counsel claim is the two-part test laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 [104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674] (1984). First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.... Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Colon-Torres, </em>382 F.3d 76, 85-86 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)). In the context of guilty pleas, \u201c \u2018[t]he second, or \u201cprejudice,\u201d requirement ... focuses on whether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366). To satisfy that second requirement, a defendant must \u201cshow \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We need not determine whether the first requirement is satisfied here because Arizmendi has clearly failed to satisfy the second, prejudice requirement. <em>Knight v. United States, </em>37 F.3d 769, 775 (1st Cir.1994). He does not argue that, absent his counsel\u2019s error about his criminal history, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Cf. Colon-Torres </em>(finding serious indicia of prejudice where defendant \u201cis now adamant that he wants to have the trial option\u201d). Rather, he alleges merely that the error deprived him of \u201cgiving consideration to exercising the constitutional right to a jury trial.\u201d However, the record is clear that Arizmendi\u2019s last-minute decision to forgo a jury trial was motivated not by his counsel\u2019s advice about his eligibility for the safety valve but rather by the government\u2019s stated intention, on the eve of trial, to file an information about his prior conviction for a felony drug offense, which would have doubled the length of his criminal sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, even after the presentence report found him ineligible for the safety valve because he committed the instant offense while still on probation for a prior offense, he made no attempt to vacate his guilty plea as involuntary or unknowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The other form of prejudice that Arizmendi asserts \u2014 that \u201che could have received a more lenient sentence\u201d \u2014 is patently nonexistent. The length of his sentence was driven by his prior record and his refusal to cooperate, not by his counsel\u2019s advice. Regardless of counsel\u2019s advice one way or the other, he was in fact ineligible for the safety valve and would therefore have been subject to, at least, the same ten-year sentence ultimately imposed. Indeed, if he had gone to trial, and the government had filed the intended information, his sentence would have, at least, doubled in length.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Accordingly, we reject Arizmendi\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on its merits and <em>affirm, </em>the judgment. <em>See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-6\">. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (providing for a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence if a person violates \u00a7 841(a) after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final); 851(a) (prohibiting such an increase in the mandatory minimum unless, before trial or entry of a guilty plea, the United States files an information stating the previous convictions relied upon).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
