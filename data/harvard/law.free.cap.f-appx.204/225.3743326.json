We find that the district court properly construed the motion as one under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Raines v. United States, </em>423 F.2d 526, 528 &amp; n. 1 (4th Cir.1970); <em>see also Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2647, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (where a motion is \u201cin substance a successive habeas petition,\u201d it \u201cshould be treated accordingly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Because McArn\u2019 s motion was properly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, the order dismissing the motion is not appeal-able unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are likewise debatable. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that McArn has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
