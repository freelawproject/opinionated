R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b685-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">California state prisoner Allen Kirk Ware appeals <em>pro se </em>from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing for lack of jurisdiction his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging the 1987 decision of the Board of Prison Terms (\u201cBoard\u201d) rescinding his parole date and finding him unsuitable for parole. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-24\">On appeal, Ware contends that the district court erred in dismissing his 2003 habeas petition as successive to his 1998 habeas petition because although \u201cinartfully pled[,] the habeas petition pertained to issues raised at the October 30, 2001 Board hearing, and not merely error from 1987.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-25\">We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2254 petition as successive. <em>United States v. Gutierrez, </em>116 F.3d 412, 415 (9th Cir.1997). The fact that a petitioner has previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>filed habeas petitions does not automatically render subsequent petitions \u201csecond or successive.\u201d <em>See Hill v. Alaska, </em>297 F.3d 895, 898 (9th Cir.2002). A ground is \u201csuccessive if the basic thrust or gravamen of the legal claim is the same, regardless of whether the basic claim is supported by new and different legal arguments.\u201d <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>157 F.3d 661, 664 (9th Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We conclude that none of the claims in Ware\u2019s 2003 petition is unique to his 2001 proceeding or reflects intervening changes in the law, but instead his claims stem from his ongoing dissatisfaction with Board\u2019s actions in 1987. Because the claims were addressed on the merits in his 1998 habeas petition, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The Government\u2019s motion for a stay of appellate proceedings is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b685-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
