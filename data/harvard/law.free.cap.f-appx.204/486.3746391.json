The IJ found Roman removable for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of admission and for having been convicted of an aggravated felony. The Government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Roman\u2019s petition for review because it is based on his commission of an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The REAL ID Act<footnotemark>**</footnotemark>, which became effective on May 11, 2005, altered judicial review of removal orders in habeas corpus proceedings. Under \u00a7 106(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), \u201ca petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of [the Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006) (quoting \u00a7 106(a), which may be found at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5)). Although \u00a7 1252(b)(2)(C) \u201cgenerally prohibits judicial review of removal orders issued on the basis of an alien\u2019s commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d the REAL ID Act provides that none of its jurisdiction-stripping provisions \u201c \u2018shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosales, </em>426 F.3d at 736. Because Roman raises a due process claim, this court has jurisdiction over his petition for review pursuant to \u00a7 1252(b)(2)(D). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Roman argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by not allowing him to testify on his own behalf at the removal proceedings. He also contends that the IJ violated his due process rights by misapplying the burdens of proof and requiring him to establish his own deportability.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">This court reviews a claim of a due process violation de novo. <em>Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 598 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cDue process challenges to deportation proceedings require an initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997). Although the IJ did deny Roman an opportunity to be heard at his hearing, Roman has failed to show substantial prejudice, i.e., make a prima facie showing that he would have been entitled to the INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(P) exception. <em>See id. </em>Further, the record does reflect that the IJ correctly placed the burden of proof regarding Roman\u2019s deportability on the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. The only burden that the IJ placed on Roman was to establish his affirmative defense that he was not deportable because he fell within the \u00a7 101(a)(43)(P)\u2019s exception. This was correct on the part of the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(P)(requiring the alien to \u201caffirmatively show[]\u201d that the offense was committed to assist a parent, spouse, or child).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Roman also argues that the BIA erred by summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s ruling without opinion. He contends that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance was erroneous because the IJ violated his due process rights and because the record was incomplete due to the IJ\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>This court has held that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures \u201cdo not deprive this court of a basis for judicial review and ... do not violate due process.\u201d <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003). Because the IJ did not violate Roman\u2019s due process rights, the BIA did no err in its summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b516-13\"> REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 302-11 (May 11, 2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
