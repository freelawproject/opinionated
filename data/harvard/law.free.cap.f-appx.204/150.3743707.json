Beginning in the 1970s, the Viscontis periodically borrowed money from the USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (\u201cFSA\u201d) for operating their farm in Cumberland County, New Jersey. When they were unable to repay their loans, the USDA, by letters dated February 4,1997 and March 3, 1997, declared the loans immediately due and notified the Viscontis of its intent to use administrative offset to collect the debt. On August 1, 1997, the Viscontis submitted an administrative complaint with the USDA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights, alleging discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (\u201cECOA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 1691 <em>et seq. </em>The Office of Civil rights issued a decision finding no discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">On October 17, 2000, the Viscontis requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) pursuant to section 741 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1999 (\u201c\u00a7 741\u201d). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 105-277, \u00a7 741, 112 Stat. 2681 (codified at 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2279 notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As relevant here, \u00a7 741 extended the ECOA\u2019s two-year limitations period for individuals who had filed administrative complaints with the USDA between January 1, 1981 and July 1, 1997, for alleged acts of discrimination occurring between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1996. The ALJ concluded that the Viscontis\u2019 complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because it was not filed before July 1, 1997, as required by \u00a7 741. The ALJ also rejected the Viscontis\u2019 contention that they had first raised allegations of discrimination in three letters dated prior to July 1, 1997. In particular, the ALJ noted that those letters did not mention the word \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or contain \u201cany language that would lead one to believe that Complainants were complaining of national origin, sex, or handicap discrimination.\u201d The Viscontis requested review by the USDA, which affirmed and adopted the AL J\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Viscontis then sought judicial review of the agency\u2019s final decision. The USDA filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the Viscontis had not filed any claim of discrimination prior to July 1, 1997. The District Court granted the USDA\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part: the District Court concluded that the Viscontis were time-barred from proceeding under \u00a7 741, but held that their discrimination claims arising out of the USDA\u2019s February and March 1997 decisions to use administrative offset to immediately collect the debt were timely brought within the general ECOA two-year statute of limitations. The USDA addressed the latter claims in a second motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Viscontis had not made out a prima facie case of discrimination. The District Court agreed, granted the motion, and entered judgment in favor of the USDA on September 20, 2005. The District Court later denied as untimely the Viscontis\u2019 efforts to seek reconsideration of its decision. The Viscontis timely appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(f), \u00a7 741, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. This Court has appellate jurisdiction by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Sikirica v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>416 F.3d 214, 219-20 (3d Cir.2005). Summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>rial fact and if, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">As noted above, ECOA claims are generally governed by a two-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(f). However, in \u00a7 741, Congress retroactively extended the limitations period for certain \u201celigible complaints.\u201d The term \u201celigible complaint\u201d refers to a nonemployment related discrimination complaint filed with the USDA prior to July 1, 1997, which alleged discrimination by the USDA at any time between January 1, 1981, and July 1, 1997. <em>See </em>\u00a7 741(e); 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15f.2. \u201cEligible complaints\u201d may be brought in a civil action or in an administrative proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 741(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The Viscontis\u2019 discrimination complaint, submitted to the Office of Civil Rights on August 1,1997, is not eligible for consideration under \u00a7 741 because it was filed after July 1, 1997. In addition, the Viscontis\u2019 letters dated October 31, 1988, June 17, 1991, and April 1, 1997, are not \u201celigible complaints.\u201d Although these letters meet the time-filing requirements of \u00a7 741, none alleges discrimination, even when construed broadly. <em>Cf. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema, </em>534 U.S. 506, 512, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (holding that a charge of discrimination must \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff\u2019s claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d (quoting <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 47, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957))). In the October 1988 letter, addressed to the Office of the United States Attorney in Camden, New Jersey, the Viscontis sought assistance in obtaining records pertaining to themselves from the USDA. The letter also attempted to explain why a woman who had lived with the Viscontis was lodging \u201cvicious and absurd charges\u201d against them. The June 1991 letter, sent to the Farmers Home Administration (now the FSA), alleged that the USDA violated the Viscontis\u2019 right under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a to apply for a moratorium on their loan principal and interest. Finally, the April 1997 letter, which was addressed to the FSA office in New Jersey, sought a meeting to discuss whether the Viscontis would be permitted to plant crops. Although Mary Visconti noted in the letter that she was a \u201cminority,\u201d she neither identified the minority group nor claimed that she was discriminated against on that basis; rather, she simply stated that \u201c[sjince I am a minority I sincerely need your help in trying to solve my problems.\u201d Thus, the letters were insufficient to put the agency on notice that the Viscontis were asserting a discrimination claim. Because the Viscontis have failed to point out any issues of material fact regarding whether these letters constitute an eligible complaint under \u00a7 741, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of the USDA was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Although the Viscontis may not pursue their claims under \u00a7 741, the District Court concluded that they could proceed on their allegations of discrimination arising out of the USDA\u2019s February and March 1997 collection letters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>trict Court held, however, that the Viscontis were unable as a matter of law to make out a case of discrimination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The ECOA makes it unlawful for a creditor to discriminate against an applicant \u201cwith respect to any aspect of a credit transaction.\u201d 15 U.S.C. 1691(a). To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ECOA in these circumstances, the Viscontis must establish, inter alia, that others not in their protected class were treated more favorably. <em>See Jones v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., </em>198 F.3d 403, 410-11 (3d Cir.1999); <em>cf. Chiang v. Veneman, </em>385 F.3d 256, 259 (3d Cir.2004). The Viscontis alleged that the USDA discriminated against them on the basis of national origin and Mary Visconti\u2019s sex in its debt collection efforts. By letter dated February 4, 1997, the FSA declared that the debt was due immediately because the Viscontis had been delinquent in their payments. On March 3, 1997, the FSA notified the Viscontis of its intent to use administrative offset to collect the debt. There is no evidence, however, that the Viscontis were treated differently than other loan recipients who were delinquent in repaying the FSA, and the Viscontis cannot demonstrate a violation of the ECOA by simply alleging that the agency is attempting to collect on a debt. <em>See Lewis v. ACB Business Services, Inc., </em>135 F.3d 389, 406 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The Viscontis raise several arguments in support of their contention that the District Court erred in granting the USDA\u2019s motions for summary judgment. As explained below, these arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">According to the Viscontis, the ALJ improperly failed to hold an administrative hearing on their complaint. The right to an administrative hearing, however, does not apply in every circumstance. The regulations provide that complainants have a right to a hearing if they present an \u201celigible complaint,\u201d and dismissal of the complaint without a hearing is authorized if the ALJ determines that the complaint was not eligible under section 741. <em>See </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15f.l2. Further, the regulations allow for a complaint to be decided without a hearing if the only dispute is a question of law. <em>See id. </em>Under this scheme, it was proper for the ALJ to adjudicate the Viscontis\u2019 claim based solely on a written record since there was no evidence of a timely filed complaint or of disparate treatment. <em>Cf. State of Pa. v. Riley, </em>84 F.3d 125, 130 (3d Cir.1996) (stating that \u201c[a]n administrative agency need not provide an evidentiary hearing when there are no disputed material issues of fact ... or when the dispute can be adequately resolved from the paper record\u201d) (citations omitted). In support of their claim, the Viscontis cite 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 556(b) and numerous sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, including, 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.8(d), 9 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.110(b), and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.12(b). To the extent these authorities had any applicability in the Viscontis\u2019 administrative proceedings, none requires that the ALJ conduct a hearing. Moreover, the Viscontis had opportunities to present evidence to the ALJ in their complaint, <em>see </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15f.6 (concerning what should be included in complaint under \u00a7 741), and in response to the ALJ\u2019s order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">The remainder of the claims raised in the Viscontis\u2019 brief are not properly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>this Court because they were not raised in the District Court. <em>See Harris v. City of Philadelphia, </em>35 F.3d 840, 845 (3d Cir. 1994) (issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered). In any event, these claims lack merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Having considered the parties\u2019 briefs and other submissions for our review, and having reviewed the administrative record and the District Court record, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-11\">. John Visconti, the co-plaintiff in this action, died during the course of these proceedings. Nevertheless, we will refer to the Viscontis in the plural.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b179-21\">. The ECOA creates a private right of action against a creditor, including the United States, who \"discriminate[s] against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction ... on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>or age.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a). ECOA claims are subject to a two-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-8\">. We will construe the Viscontis\u2019 October 26, 2005, motion for leave to seek reconsideration of the September 20, 2005 order \u2014 in which Mary Visconti references her desire to appeal from that order \u2014 as a timely notice of appeal. <em>See Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992) (\u201cCourts will liberally construe the requirements of [Fed. R.App. P.] 3;\u201d and \u201d[i]f a document, filed within the time specified by [Fed. R.App. P.] 4 gives the notice required by Rule 3, it is effective as a notice of appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Dyszel v. Marks, </em>6 F.3d 116, 122 n. 9 (3d Cir.1993) (stating that an untimely motion for reconsideration has no effect on a simultaneously filed notice of appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. In particular, the District Court held (hat the Viscontis\u2019 August 1, 1997 complaint was filed with the USDA within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory events, <em>see </em>7 C.F.R. \u00a7 15d.4, and that the ECOA's two-year statute of limitations was tolled while the Viscontis pursued their administrative remedies. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6912(e) (exhaustion requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>grievances filed against USDA). Because the USDA does not challenge on appeal the determination that these claims were timely, we will not examine it. <em>See Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir.1993) (noting that issues not raised and argued on appeal are deemed abandoned and waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b183-16\">. For instance, the Viscontis claim that Mary Visconti\u2019s testimony before Congress, as well as a civil action filed in 1996, constitute complaints under \u00a7 741. Importantly, however, Mary Visconti testified before Congress in October 1997, several months after the date by which \u00a7 741 complaints had to be filed, <em>see </em>\u00a7 741(e), and the Viscontis 1996 civil complaint was not based on discrimination. Furthermore, contrary to the Viscontis\u2019 contention, the principles of relation back, equitable tolling, due diligence, and continuing violation cannot remedy the defects in their discrimination claims. Finally, the Viscontis have offered no persuasive support for their allegations that the ALJ failed to consider whether the USDA retaliated against them for complaining about discrimination and whether the USDA violated their rights under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
