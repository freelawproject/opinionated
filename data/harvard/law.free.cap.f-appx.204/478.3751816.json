When, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). This court reviews the BIA\u2019s factual conclusion that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Under this standard, \u201cthe alien must show that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An IJ\u2019s findings on credibility are accorded great deference. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Muhammad argues that the BIA erred in denying him withholding of removal because he suffered persecution in Pakistan due to his membership in the Altai faction of the political party Muttahida Quami Movement. In denying withholding of removal, the IJ found that Muhammad\u2019s testimony was not credible, that conditions had changed significantly in Pakistan since the events surrounding Muhammad\u2019s 1996 departure, and that, if Muhammad felt threatened, he could safely relocate to another part of Pakistan. In affirming the IJ, the BIA noted that, even assuming arguendo that Muhammad\u2019s testimony regarding his claimed past persecution was credible, the IJ \u201ccorrectly found that the presumption that the respondent\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the future had been rebutted\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(i). After reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence does not compel a conclusion contrary to the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">Accordingly, Muhammad\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
