May 2, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 162 993 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 30, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 158-60 (2d Cir.2006) (agreeing with this principle, but avoiding remand, in spite of deficiencies in an adverse credibility determination, because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the decision were the case remanded).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">Youdon does not argue that she suffered past persecution in China; she argues only that the IJ erred in finding that she did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, any challenge to the denial of her past persecution claim is waived. <em>See, e.g., Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir. 2006). As a result, this Court will consider only Youdon\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">To meet the burden for a well-founded fear of persecution, an applicant must demonstrate either a reasonable possibility of persecution against her as an individual or a pattern and practice of persecution against a group to which she belongs. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Both the IJ and the BIA addressed whether the Chinese government would person<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>ally target Youdon upon her return to China, due to her pro-Tibet activities in Tibet, Nepal, and the United States, and they found that it would not. These particular findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">However, Youdon correctly asserted in both her brief to the BIA and to this Court that she need not show she would be individually targeted for persecution if she can demonstrate that \u201cthere is a pattern and practice .... of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to [her].\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). In order to establish eligibility for asylum based on a pattern and practice of persecution, the applicant must prove that she is a member of a group of persons that is regularly persecuted and that her fear of persecution on account of her membership in that group is objectively reasonable. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Therefore, the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s findings that Youdon failed to prove that the Chinese government was particularly interested in her are not dis-positive. Neither the IJ nor the BIA considered whether Youdon\u2019s activities in the past may subject her to persecution as a member of group that is persecuted by the Chinese government. On remand, the BIA should consider whether Youdon\u2019s credible testimony was sufficient for You-don to prove that she is a member of a group, defined as individuals who protest for a free Tibet, that is subject to persecution by the Chinese government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">There is documentation in the record evidencing the Chinese government\u2019s willingness to suppress pro-Tibetan ideas, as well as suggesting close ties between China and Nepal, the country in which Youdon carried out much of her political activity. Additionally, the 2005 State Department Report on Human Rights Practices for China indicates that serious human rights problems continue to plague the country, and that the situation is particularly difficult for Tibetans. <em>See Country Report on Human Rights Practices, 2005, China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 2006), <em>available at </em>http://www.state.gov /g/drl/rls/hrrpt/ 2005/61605.htm. This Court may take judicial notice of adjudicative facts, such as current events, that materially bear on an applicant\u2019s claim for relief from removal. <em>See </em>Fed. Rule Ev. 201(b),(c); <em>Latifi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 103, 106 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (taking \u201cjudicial notice of the fact that the Democratic Party returned to power in Albania through general elections in July\u201d 2005, and suggesting that, \u201c[o]n remand, the BIA may wish to consider this event\u201d with regard to changed circumstances in Albania); <em>Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir.2002) (remanding to the BIA for consideration of recent country conditions that \u201cbear vitally\u201d on the applicant\u2019s claim and that close the time-gap between the adjudication of his petition and the present); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). Because there is evidence supporting Youdon\u2019s assertions that the Chinese government persecutes pro-Tibet supporters, the BIA must consider, among other things, whether there is a pattern and practice of persecution against similarly situated individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Because Youdoris withholding of removal claim is based on the same facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>as her asylum claim, and because the BIA should reevaluate the likelihood of future persecution under a pattern and practice scheme, we are also remanding Youdon\u2019s withholding of removal claim for further consideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2)(i)-(ii) (discussing the requirements to make out a pattern and practice claim for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The IJ denied Youdon\u2019s CAT claim because she had \u201cset forth no facts or circumstances to show that it is more likely than not she would be tortured if forced to return to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d As mentioned above, there is evidence in the record of the Chinese government\u2019s torture of supporters of Tibet. When discussing the conditions in Tibet, the most recent State Department report stated, \u201cAuthorities continued to commit serious human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary arrest and detention....\u201d In addition, there is also evidence in the report that Chinese authorities commit torture against detainees. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s blanket statement that Youdon presented \u201cno facts or circumstances\u201d to support a CAT claim is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-8\">. The IJ noted that Youdon failed to present sufficient corroborating evidence of her identity. Inherent in the analysis of whether You-don is a member of a group that is persecuted by the Chinese government is the evaluation of whether Youdon established her identity. The BIA may wish to re-evaluate the IJ\u2019s identity finding in light of the agency\u2019s finding that she was credible and within the context of the pattern and practice claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
