Talledo-Acosta asserts that the denial of his motion to reopen was a violation of his Fifth Amendment due process rights because he has never been granted an opportunity to present evidence on behalf of his application for adjustment of status, which is based on a 1995-approved 1-140 immigrant worker visa petition filed by his prospective employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">The decision to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision, and this court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard when reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000). Talledo-Acosta does not challenge the BIA\u2019s ruling that his motion to reopen his 1986 deportation proceedings was untimely filed. Thus, any challenge to the timeliness of his motion to reopen is deemed abandoned. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003). Because there is no protected liberty interest in a motion to reopen, Talledo-Acosta cannot establish a due process violation under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Accordingly, Talledo-Acosta\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
