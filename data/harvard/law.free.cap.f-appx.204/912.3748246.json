Nelson denying the petitioners\u2019 applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Hong Yun Qiu, </em>No. A 96 390 150 (B.I.A. Mar. 2, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 390 150 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 26, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\"><em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir. 2004); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 158-60 (2d Cir. 2006) (agreeing with this principle, but deciding not to remand because it could be confidently predicted that the IJ would adhere to the original decision on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The IJ erred in her decision in the following respects. First, the IJ found that Qiu\u2019s background material did not establish that \u201csisters of Falun Gong practitioners [wejre ... persecuted.\u201d However, Qiu claimed that she feared persecution not because her sister practiced Falun Gong, but because the Chinese authorities might believe that Qiu herself is a Falun Gong supporter because she hid her sister and lied to the police about her sister\u2019s whereabouts. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir.2005). In support of her claim, Qiu indicated that after she went into hiding, the police went to her house to ask about her and Hong Xian \u201cseveral times.\u201d Thus, IJ Nelson should have considered whether Qiu was entitled to relief based on the possibility of persecution on account of \u201cimputed political opinion,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>support of the Falun Gong movement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Furthermore, the IJ mischaracterized the record by stating that Qiu failed to indicate on her written application that she \u201cfear[ed] that she would be arrested,\u201d and that she disclosed this fear only during direct examination. Qiu did not state in her asylum application that she specifically feared being arrested upon her return to China. However, she did state in her application that: (1) she hid in \u201ca remote riverside area\u201d because she was afraid \u201cthat the police would come back and arrest [her]\u201d; and (2) she left China because of this fear of arrest and because the police had returned to her house \u201cseveral times\u201d to ask about her. Qiu, therefore, properly disclosed her fear of arrest in her written application and substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Third, the IJ found it \u201cunlikely that [Qiu] would be subject to arrest because of her sister\u2019s activities or because the sister lived with her at the mother-in-law\u2019s home for a month.\u201d A finding of implausibility must not be based on flawed reasoning or speculation. <em>See e.g., Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 309-10; <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.2006). Here, Qiu did not assert that she would be subject to arrest because of her sister\u2019s Falun Gong activities or because her sister stayed in Qiu\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s home for a month. Instead, Qiu argued that she faced persecution for the actions she had taken to protect Hong Xian from Chinese authorities. Thus, the IJ erred in her implausibility finding because she failed to distinguish Qiu\u2019s claims of personal persecution based on her affirmative efforts to hide her sister from the persecution that her sister, Hong Xian, might suffer for practicing Falun Gong or her mother-in-law might suffer because Hong Xian lived in her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s observation that Qiu\u2019s mother-in-law had faced only harassment, and not persecution, \u201ceven though [Qiu\u2019s] sister was living in the mother-in-law\u2019s home,\u201d was beside the point. The record does not indicate that Qiu\u2019s mother-in-law resisted the officials to any extent. Therefore, the validity of Qiu\u2019s fear of persecution, on account of her resistance to the authorities on behalf of her sister, did not depend upon the level of harassment her mother-in-law faced. The IJ\u2019s observation does not support her finding that Qiu failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">Due to the IJ\u2019s errors, this Court cannot state with confidence that the agency would reach the same result on remand. <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 107-08 (2d Cir.2006). Qiu\u2019s asylum claim is remanded to the BIA for further proceedings. Because the agency\u2019s denial of Qiu\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief rested on the same grounds that are insufficient to support its rejection of her asylum claim, those claims are also remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Accordingly, Qiu and Zhang\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED. The BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
