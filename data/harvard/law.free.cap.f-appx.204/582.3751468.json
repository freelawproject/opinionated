R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b611-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-22\">G. Gregory Williams appeals pro se from the published decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP), which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s retroactive annulment of the automatic stay in his bankruptcy case. <em>See Williams v. Levi (In re Williams), </em>323 B.R. 691 (9th Cir. BAP 2005). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm the BAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-23\">We review the BAP decision de novo, and independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>See Carillo v. Su (In re Su), </em>290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-24\">A bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction after dismissal in some circumstances to \u201c \u2018interpret\u2019 and \u2018effectuate\u2019 its orders,\u201d including retroactive annulment of the automatic stay as occurred in this case. <em>See Aheong v. Mellon Mortgage Co. (In re Aheong), </em>276 B.R. 233, 239-40 &amp; n. 8 (9th Cir. BAP 2002) (quoting <em>Tsafaroff v. Taylor (In re Taylor), </em>884 F.2d 478, 481 (9th Cir.1989)). Further, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>authorizes the court to annul \u201cthe stay provided under [\u00a7 362(a)].\u201d The stay in Williams\u2019 second bankruptcy case arose under \u00a7 362(a), and the statute does not limit annulment to stays arising in pending cases. We agree with the BAP that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We also conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion when it annulled the stay. <em>See National Envtl. Waste Corp. v. City of Riverside (In re National Envtl. Waste Corp.), </em>129 F.3d 1052, 1054 (9th Cir.1997) (reviewing decision retroactively to lift automatic stay for abuse of discretion). The bankruptcy court properly balanced the equities when, although it acknowledged that the foreclosure sale may have violated the automatic stay, it considered several adverse factors and concluded that Williams had failed to commence a timely, appropriate proceeding to void the foreclosure sale. <em>See Fjeldsted v. Lien (In re Fjeldsted), </em>293 B.R. 12, 24-25 (9th Cir. BAP 2003) (court may consider whether debtor engaged in unreasonable conduct and how quickly debtor moved to set aside sale). We conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion retroactively to annul the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We have considered Williams\u2019 reply brief. Williams\u2019 motion to strike appellees\u2019 brief and his request for monetary sanctions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
