R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j).

The district court held that appellant had failed to prove his case, and appellant has not met his burden of showing that the district court\u2019s ruling was erroneous. <em>See, e.g., Golden Blount, Inc. v. Robert H. Peterson Co., </em>365 F.3d 1054, 1063 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201cAs the appellant, Peterson bears the burden of convincing us that the district court committed reversible error.\u201d); <em>Patrick v. Jasper County, </em>901 F.2d 561, 566 (7th Cir.1990) (\u201cIt is Patrick\u2019s burden as an appellant to bring to this court\u2019s attention the alleged errors in the district court\u2019s summary judgment order and cite relevant case law in support of his argument for reversal thereof.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
