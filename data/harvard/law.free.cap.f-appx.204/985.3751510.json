Feb. 23, 2004), <em>aff'g </em>No. A. 77 353 864 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 21, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">\u201cWhen the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that an asylum applicant is not credible and emphasizes particular aspects of the IJ\u2019s decisions, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005)). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 177-78 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus to the finding, and must be valid grounds for disregarding an applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-17\">Both the BIA and the IJ erred in relying on the State Department report without considering contradictory background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>evidence in the record as required by <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]here a [State Department] report suggests that, <em>in general, </em>an individual in the applicant\u2019s circumstances would not suffer or reasonably fear persecution in a particular country, the immigration court may consider that evidence, but it is obligated to consider also any contrary or countervailing evidence with which it is presented, as well as the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case demonstrated by testimony and other evidence.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Here, in addition to assuming that the State Department report could be used to impeach Li\u2019s particular circumstances and testimony, the IJ and the BIA ignored other background materials that were consistent with Li\u2019s claim, particularly testimony before Congress regarding coercive enforcement of the family planning policy in China. [JA at 248-59].</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">A number of the IJ\u2019s factual findings also rely improperly on speculation. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307 (a finding \u201cbased on flawed reasoning\u201d is <em>not </em>supported by substantial evidence). For example, the IJ\u2019s conclusions with respect to the payment of a fine, the safety of Li\u2019s husband, and the ability of Li\u2019s husband to obtain documents are all speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Finally, to the extent that the BIA relied on Li\u2019s airport interview when it adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s credibility decision, such reliance was inappropriate because the BIA failed to evaluate the reliability of the airport interview. <em>See Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">We remand, because we cannot say with confidence that the agency would reach the same result in the absence of these errors. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 428 </em>F.3d 391, 402 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. Having completed our review, the stay of removal previously granted is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
