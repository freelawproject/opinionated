Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2)(A) (iii). Jordan argues that the IJ erred in finding a 2002 New York marihuana conviction to be an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2), this court has jurisdiction to review claims, such as Jordan\u2019s, raising questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See also Rodriguez-Castro v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2005) (holding \u00a7 1252 applies retroactively to cases pending upon its enactment); Oma<em>ri v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (stating that question of whether a prior conviction is an aggravated felony is a legal one). Even if the REAL ID Act did not provide jurisdiction, this court would \u201chave jurisdiction to determine [its] own jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>to determine whether the conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.\u201d <em>(Omari v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 303, 306 (5th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">This court accords substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA. <em>Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 306-07 (citing <em>Smalley v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 332, 335-36 (5th Cir. 2003)). The court reviews de novo \u201cwhether the particular statute that the prior conviction is under falls within the relevant INA definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Because the BIA affirmed \u201cwithout opinion,\u201d this court directly review the IJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>decision. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), an alien who commits an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 122T (a)(2) (A)(iii). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), an \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes \u201cdrug trafficking crime[s],\u201d as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). A \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d has two elements under \u00a7 924(c)(2): (1) the offense is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and (2) that the offense is a felony under federal or state law. <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 574 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1142, 163 L.Ed.2d 1000 (2006). Such a drug offense is a felony if it \u201cis punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44); <em>see Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d at 574 (holding that \u00a7 802(44) provides the applicable definition of \u201cfelony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">In analogous immigration cases involving determination of whether a prior conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, courts employ a categorical approach, looking first to the elements of the offense, and then to the charging documents, stipulated facts, or some other formal finding of the relevant facts of conviction. <em>See Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 307. If the offense conduct charged can encompass something less than an aggravated felony, the offense is not deemed an aggravated felony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">In the instant case, Jordan was convicted of violating New York Penal Law \u00a7 221.40, stating \u201cA person is guilty of criminal sale of marihuana in the fourth degree when he knowingly and unlawfully sells marihuana except as provided in section 221.35 of this article.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.40. The violation is a state class A misdemeanor, for which the sentence \u201cshall not exceed one year.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 70.15. Section 221.35, criminal sale of marihuana in the fifth degree (also a misdemeanor), penalizes an individual who \u201cknowingly and unlawfully sells, without consideration, one or more preparations, compounds, mixtures or substances containing marihuana and the preparations, mixtures or substances are of an aggregate weight of two grams or less; or one cigarette containing marihuana.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.35. An offense would not be included in \u00a7 221.35 (and would be included in \u00a7 221.40) either if the sale was (1) for consideration or (2) for an amount of more than two grams or one cigarette. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.35. Under New York law \u201csell\u201d is defined as \u201cto sell, exchange, give or dispose of to another, or to offer or agree to do the same.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">An individual may violate \u00a7 221.40 without that conviction qualifying as a federal felony. If an individual either sells <em>for </em>consideration less than two grams or one cigarette of marihuana or distributes <em>without </em>consideration more than two grams or one cigarette of marihuana (but less than 25 grams) then he has violated \u00a7 221.40 because the crime is not encompassed by \u00a7 221.35 (but has not risen to the 25 grams level of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.45). That state misdemeanor would not be a federal felony if it fell within the purview of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(4). Section 841(b)(4) provides that an individual who \u201cdistribut[es] a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration\u201d shall be punished as if for simple possession (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844). A simple possession conviction under \u00a7 844 is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of one year, unless the indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>vidual has a prior narcotics conviction, in which case the individual may be sentenced to a maximum term of two years imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a), a simple possession conviction without a prior narcotics conviction would be a federal misdemeanor (less than one year imprisonment), but the two year maximum sentence conviction would be a federal felony. Thus, a violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.40 is not categorically an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). <em>See Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308 (holding that a conviction under federal fraud statute was not categorically an aggravated felony for immigration purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Because the New York statute at issue is divisible, the court may look to Jordan\u2019s actual conviction to determine if it was for conduct qualifying as an aggravated felony. <em>See id. </em>419 F.3d at 308 (citations omitted). In such an analysis, the court examines the record of conviction to determine if the particular conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>Id. </em>In a situation involving a guilty plea, the court may consider \u201cthe charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 20-21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308. The court may not consider \u201c[djocuments not of that kind, including police reports and complaint applications.\u201d <em>Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In this case, the only formal document of Jordan\u2019s conviction in the administrative record is the Certificate of Disposition of the 2002 conviction. That document states only that Jordan pleaded guilty to a violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.40. The document does not indicate that the conduct involved a sale for consideration or the distribution or sale of more than a small amount. The document also does not indicate that Jordan has prior narcotics convictions. The documentation does not support a finding that Jordan engaged in conduct or had prior convictions that would raise his violation to the level of a federal felony. <em>See Omari, </em>419 F.3d at 308-09 (finding record insufficient to establish a prior conviction was an aggravated felony where the only available formal documents of conviction did not show that actual offense qualified). Thus, the IJ erred in finding that the prior state conviction qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Government additionally argues that the IJ did not err because Jordan was removable as an alien convicted of an offense involving a controlled substance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227, \u201c[a]n alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 in Title 21) other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.\u201d Although the Government alleged the controlled substance grounds in the Notice to Appear, the IJ did not rule on the issue. A court reviewing an agency decision may not conduct a de novo inquiry into a matter not considered by an administrative agency and reach its own conclusions in the matter based on its inquiry. <em>Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 1615, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (citations omitted). Because the agency has not considered whether the 2002 offense constituted a controlled substance offense, the matter must be remanded to \u201cbring its expertise to bear upon the matter,\u201d \u201cevaluate the evidence,\u201d and \u201cmake an initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>determination.\u201d <em>INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam) (quoted with approval in <em>Thomas, </em>126 S.Ct. at 1615).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Accordingly, Jordan\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED and the order of the BIA is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
