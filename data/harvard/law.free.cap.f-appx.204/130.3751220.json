In 2002, he was convicted in a New York state court of the criminal sale of cocaine in the fifth degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A.R. 133-35. He was sentenced to two to four years in prison. Two years later, the Government charged him with removability, alleging that the state drug conviction constituted both (i) an aggravated felony, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) ], and (ii) a controlled substance offense, <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i)]. The immigration judge (IJ) found Brown removable on both bases. <em>See </em>A.R. 47-78. Brown, who represented himself during the removal proceedings, sought cancellation of removal under INA \u00a7 240A [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b] or relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)]. <em>See, e.g., </em>AR. 62. The IJ concluded, however, that Brown was eligible for neither kind of relief. A single member of the BIA affirmed. A.R. 2. Continuing to act <em>pro se, </em>Brown timely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>petitioned us for review, and the proceeding was docketed by the Clerk at C.A. No. 05-2053.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">At about the same time, Brown filed a habeas petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In the petition, he argued that Congress\u2019s repeal of INA \u00a7 212(c) was impermissibly retroactive as to him because he committed his offense in 1994, when \u00a7 212(c) relief was still available. <em>See </em>Habeas Petition, 3-15. Shortly after Brown filed the petition, Congress enacted the Real ID Act of 2005, which required the transfer of a habeas petition like Brown\u2019s to this court for treatment as a petition for review. <em>See </em>Real ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, Div. B, \u00a7 106(c), 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005); <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir. 2005). On the District Court\u2019s transfer, the Clerk docketed Brown\u2019s new proceeding (i.e., his second petition for review) at C.A. No. 05-2774.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In Brown\u2019s first appeal, C.A. No. 05-2053, the Government \u2014 represented by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Immigration Litigation \u2014 has filed, in lieu of a brief, a motion for summary affirmance and to dismiss. In C.A. No. 05-2774, the Government \u2014 represented by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania \u2014 has filed a brief. Brown has filed a brief in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">Brown\u2019s proceedings in this court both present the same questions \u2014 primarily whether the IJ and BIA rightly concluded that he was ineligible for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c). Accordingly, we resolve the two petitions in this single opinion. We have jurisdiction pursuant to INA \u00a7 242(a)(1) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) ]. Our review extends to \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d raised in petitions for review filed by aggravated felons. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D). We exercise plenary review over the purely legal questions at issue in Brown\u2019s case. <em>See Tran v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 464, 467 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that whether a state offense qualifies as an aggravated felon is a pure question of law); <em>Garcia v. Atty. Gen'l, </em>462 F.3d 287, 290-91 (3d Cir.2006) (noting the standard of review for constitutional claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">It appears that Brown has never contested that his New York state conviction for the criminal sale of cocaine in the fifth degree, <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.31, constitutes an aggravated felony. Accordingly, the issue is not properly before us. <em>See Bejar v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 127, 132 (3d Cir.2003) (on the consequences of an alien\u2019s failure to exhaust an argument).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Apparently accepting that he is an aggravated felon, Brown argues that he should be available for relief under former INA \u00a7 212(c). <em>See, e.g., </em>Informal Brief, C.A. No. 05-2053, 6 \u00b68. However, in April 1996, in \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Congress narrowed the class of aliens who could obtain \u00a7 212(c) relief. Aggravated felons and those convicted of certain drug crimes were made ineligible. <em>See Perez v. Elwood, </em>294 <em>F.3d </em>552, 557 (3d Cir.2002). Thereafter, in \u00a7 304(b) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), Congress altogether repealed the \u00a7 212(c) waiver; that repeal became effective on April 1, 1997. <em>See id. </em>These repeals directly affect Brown, whose conviction occurred in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">In <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that AEDPA\u2019s repeal of \u00a7 212(c) was unconstitutionally retroactive as to persons who pleaded guilty prior to the amendment of \u00a7 212(c). We have since extended <em>St. Cyr </em>to persons who declined a plea agreement and proceeded to trial at a time when they might reasonably have relied on the availability of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. <em>Ponnapula v. Ashcroft, </em>373 F.3d 480, 494 (3d Cir.2004). Brown contends that these cases, and others, mean that \u00a7 212(c) relief must be available to him because he committed his criminal conduct <em>prior to </em>the 1996 and 1997 limitations on \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See </em>A.R. 15-19. In his view, the fact that he was not convicted until 2002 should be irrelevant. A.R. 15 (arguing that the \u201crelevant \u2018event\u2019 for purposes of evaluating the retroactive effect [of AEDPA and IIRIRA]\u201d is his \u201ccommission of the criminal offense\u201d prior to AEDPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Brown is mistaken. In both <em>St. Cyr </em>and <em>Ponnapula, </em>the relevant date was the date of conviction, not the date of the criminal conduct. <em>See also Santa Cruz-Bucheli v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 105, 107-08 (1st Cir. 2006) (reaching the same conclusion); <em>Domond v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir.2001) (same). Moreover, in <em>Ponnapula, </em>we specifically rejected any argument that an alien might reasonably have committed criminal conduct <em>in reliance on </em>the existence of \u00a7 212(c) relief. \u201c \u2018[I]t would border on the absurd\u2019 to argue that an alien would refrain from committing crimes ... if he knew that after he had been imprisoned and deported, a discretionary waiver of deportation would no longer be available to him.\u201d <em>Ponnapula, </em>373 F.3d at 496 n. 14 (quoting <em>LaGuerre v. Reno, </em>164 F.3d 1035, 1041 (7th Cir.1998)). Accordingly, Brown\u2019s argument cannot succeed. Because his conviction occurred long after the repeal of \u00a7 212(c), the repeal was not retroactively impermissible as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">After the repeal of \u00a7 212(c), Congress replaced it with a form of relief known as cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240A. Unfortunately for Brown, and as the IJ correctly explained to him, <em>see </em>A.R. 62, this form of relief is wholly unavailable to aggravated felons. \u00a7 240A(a)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Brown\u2019s petitions for review in C.A. No. 05-2053 and C.A. No. 05-2774. Respondent\u2019s motion in C.A. No. 05-2774 for summary affirmance and to dismiss is GRANTED to the extent that it seeks denial of Brown\u2019s petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\">. Brown was also convicted on a charge of attempted assault. Although he argues in his brief in C.A. No. 05-2774 that attempted assault is not a deportable offense, he was not charged with removability on the basis of that conviction. <em>See </em>A.R. 148. Only the drug conviction is an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-26\">. Because Brown was detained by the Department of Homeland Security when he mailed his petition for review, we deem it filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>March 27, 2005, the date he turned it over to prison officials for mailing (and not on April 4, 2005, when it was received by the Clerk). <em>Cf. Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 276, 108 5. Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Even if Brown's petition for review had been untimely, we would have jurisdiction over his claims in C.A. No. 05-2774.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">. In any event, even if the issue were fairly pressed in some of Brown's pleadings, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we would conclude that the offense is \"illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,\u201d made an aggravated felony by INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) ]. A state drug conviction may be found an aggravated felony under either of two routes. Under one of those routes, known as the \"hypothetical felony route,\u201d an offense is an aggravated felony when \"regardless of categorization [by the state], [it] would be punishable as a felony under an analogous federal statute.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 377, 381 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Gerbier v. Holmes, </em>280 F.3d 297, 313-15 (3d Cir.2002). The state statute Brown violated criminalizes the conduct of \"knowingly and unlawfully sell[ing] a controlled substance.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.31. The analogous fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>eral offense is a felony, distribution of a controlled substance. <em>Wilson, </em>350 F.3d at 381; <em>see also </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), (b). Under the \"hypothetical felony approach,\" Brown is an aggravated felon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">. Before the BIA, Brown argued that he was entitled to relief under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and/or the Convention on the Rights of the Child. A.R. 23-25. He does not press these arguments in this court, and we need not address them. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garth, </em>188 F.3d 99, 105 n. 7 (3d Cir.1999) (on the consequences of a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s failure to raise an issue in his briefs). We note, in any event, that neither the non-self-executing ICCPR nor the unratified Convention could possibly provide Brown with any relief. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>Guaylupo-Moya v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 121, 136-37 (2d Cir.2005) (ICCPR); <em>Martinez-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 500, 502 (5th Cir. 2006) (Convention).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
