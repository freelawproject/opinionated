In accordance with the REAL ID Act, his \u00a7 2241 petition was converted into a petition for review and transferred to this court. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir. 2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1055, 163 L.Ed.2d 882 (2006); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-27\">Plata contends that his removal order is invalid in light of this court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001). Once removed from this country, Plata\u2019s case was effectively finished. <em>See Navarro-Miranda v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 672, 675 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>(5th Cir.2003). Because Plata\u2019s removal order had been legally executed at the time <em>Chapa-Garza </em>was decided, <em>Chapa-Garza </em>does not retroactively apply to Plata\u2019s removal order. <em>See Alvarenga-Villalobos v. Ashcroft, </em>271 F.3d 1169, 1172 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Plata also argues that the BIA erred by relying on a decision from this court that was not \u201ccontrolling authority\u201d at the time of his removal. The BIA relied, in part, on our decision in <em>Camacho-Marroquin v. INS, </em>188 F.3d 649 (5th Cir.1999), which later was withdrawn, 222 F.3d 1040 (5th Cir.2000). However, Plata fails to address the BIA\u2019s additional reliance on its own decision, <em>In re Puente-Salazar, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1006, 1014 (BIA 1999), which itself was later overruled by <em>In re Ramos, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 336 (BIA 2002). There is no indication that <em>Puente-Salazar </em>was not \u201ccontrolling authority\u201d for the BIA at the time of Plata\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">Finally, Plata argues that he may collaterally challenge his prior order of removal as a miscarriage of justice following our decision in <em>Chapa-Garza. </em>However, Plata cannot show a miscarriage of justice because he faded to file a petition for review in this court following the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Ramirez-Molina v. Ziglar, </em>436 F.3d 508, 515 (5th Cir.2006). As in that case, there is no miscarriage of justice because, if Plata had petitioned this court for review, \u201che could have attained the result that was ultimately achieved by the petitioner in <em>Chapa-Garza.\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">Accordingly, Plata\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
