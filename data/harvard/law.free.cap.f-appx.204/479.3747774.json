Quintero now exercises his right to appeal. All of Quintero\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Castelo, </em>415 F.3d 407 (5th Cir.2005), in which Quintero\u2019s co-defendant appealed on the very same issue. The district court\u2019s order denying Quintero\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">In addition, Quintero appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. When considering whether to grant a motion to withdraw a guilty plea this Court takes into consideration the factors set forth in <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984). A review of the record shows that the district court properly applied these factors. Furthermore, Quintero fails to identify how the district court abused its discretion. Therefore, the district court\u2019s order denying Quintero\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
