Coghill, Jr., pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to one count of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (2000) and one count of bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000). In the presentence report (PSR), the probation officer recommended a base offense level of six pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number><em>Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2F1.1 (a) (2000). The probation officer determined that Coghill\u2019s offense involved at least $3,080,520 in actual loss and, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2F1. 1(b)(1)(N), increased the base offense level by thirteen. Additionally, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Fl.1(b)(2), because Coghill\u2019s offense involved a scheme to defraud more than one person, Coghill\u2019s offense level was increased an additional two levels. After a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, the PSR recommended a total offense level of eighteen. Coghill\u2019s prior criminal conduct yielded a criminal history category of I. The total offense level of eighteen and criminal history category of I resulted in a sentencing range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The district court adopted the recommendations in the PSR, sentenced Coghill to thirty months in prison, and ordered restitution in the total amount of $2,909,520. On appeal, Coghill raises four issues. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Coghill first asserts that the district court improperly included interest as a component of loss, and thus improperly added thirteen levels to Coghill\u2019s sentence. This court reviews the determination of the amount of loss, to the extent it is a factual matter, for clear error, and reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the term \u201closs\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. West, </em>2 F.3d 66, 71 (4th Cir.1993). The relationship of payment of fees, interest and penalties to principal in calculating loss is a question of law, and is thus reviewed de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Valuation of \u201closs\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2F1.1 is discussed in the commentary to USSG \u00a7 2B1.1. Application note 3(D)(i) to USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 states that \u201c[ljoss shall not include ... [ijnterest of any kind, finance charges, late fees, penalties, amounts based on an agreed-upon return or rate of return, or other similar costs.\u201d Coghill cites this language in support of his contention that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is erroneous. Coghill argues that loss should have been calculated by subtracting all payments made on his fraudulently obtained loan directly from the amount of principal borrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The exclusion of interest from the calculation of loss under the Guidelines serves to prevent victims from recovering all interest they could have earned had the fraud never occurred. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>376 F.3d 1002, 1014 (9th Cir. 2004). It does not follow, as Coghill suggests, that payments already made that both parties understood would be applied in part to interest due and the remainder to principal ought to instead be applied solely to principal for purposes of calculating loss. Rather, the district court properly calculated loss by determining the outstanding principal balance of the loan less the amount the victims were able to recover through liquidation of the collateral provided to secure the loan. <em>See United States v. Abbey, </em>288 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Coghill next argues that the district court failed to restrict loss calculations to the houses on which the fraudulent loans were obtained. The district court\u2019s findings at sentencing as to the amount of loss suffered by a party are findings of fact reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir. 1989). The amount of loss should be calculated based on the value of the loans procured through fraud, not including outstanding legitimate loans. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>980 F.2d 259, 262 (4th Cir.1992) (limiting amount of loss under \u00a7 2F1.1 in fraudulent loan application case to the amount of loss related to the false statement, rather than the total loan amount.) Our review of the record reveals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>that the district court did not clearly err in determining the amount of loss suffered by each party. Therefore, CoghilTs argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Third, Coghill asserts that the district court erred in failing to subtract $712,040 in alleged losses attributable to accounting errors. Again, this is purely a question of fact, and will be reviewed for clear error. <em>Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d at 217. The district court made a proper determination of loss by taking the total amount of the loan principal associated with the fraud outstanding at the time that the fraud was discovered, and subtracting the amount the lenders were able to recover through the liquidation of collateral. The court based these figures on the victims\u2019 testimony, records provided by the victims, and the presentence report. Thus, the district court\u2019s determination that the victims\u2019 records were reliable and correctly established their loss is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Finally, Coghill asserts that the district court failed to comply with mandatory statutory requirements necessary to depart upward thirteen levels. This argument is without merit as the district court did not depart from the Guidelines. Rather, the district court merely rejected Coghill\u2019s proposed method of loss calculation. Because the district court did not depart, it was not required to state a reason for a departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
