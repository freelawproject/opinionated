EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">Defendant Wallace R. Bennett appeals from two orders of the district court rejecting his efforts to void a garnishee judgment. Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">Relevant Background</p>\n<p id=\"b757-19\">On March 18, 2003, plaintiff The Society of Lloyd\u2019s (Lloyd\u2019s) obtained a judgment against Bennett based on an award of summary judgment that was subsequently affirmed by this court. <em>See Soc\u2019y of Lloyd\u2019s v. Reinhart, </em>402 F.3d 982 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 366, 163 L.Ed.2d 73 (2005). Seeking to collect on the judgment, on June 28, 2004, Lloyd\u2019s served a writ of garnishment on Morgan Stanley, an investment bank where Bennett held a brokerage account. Accompanying the writ were interrogatories to be answered and filed by Morgan Stanley. The writ advised Morgan Stanley that if it did not receive a court order regarding the writ within sixty days of filing its interrogatory responses, the writ would expire and could be ignored. Based on the timing of Morgan Stanley\u2019s responses, the writ was to expire on September 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-22\">On July 14, 2004, Bennett filed objections to the writ of garnishment and requested a hearing. The hearing was held on August 6, 2004, before a magistrate judge to whom the case had been referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 686(b)(1)(A). The minute entry from the hearing reflects that the magistrate judge heard arguments concerning Bennett\u2019s objections to the writ of garnishment, one of which was that the writ would unduly interfere with his wife\u2019s interest in the account. At some point during the hearing, the court recessed to allow the parties to schedule discovery regarding Mrs. Bennett\u2019s interest. When the court reconvened the parties had reached a stipulation. The following is a quote from the minute entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">Counsel stipulated to the following: Mr. Barton to subpoena Morgan Stanley today and expect production of documents by 8/20/04; Mr. Bennett to produce all account information requested by Mr. Barton by 8/20/04; <em>extend the garnishment pending further order of the Court; </em>set the matter for status conference prior to setting the case for evidentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Aplt.App. at 48 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">On August 23, 2004, the magistrate judge issued an Order Regarding Pending Garnishment reflecting his findings from the August 6 hearing. The magistrate judge overruled all of Bennett\u2019s objections to the writ except for the objection based on Mrs. Bennett\u2019s interest in the account. As to that objection, the magistrate judge found that discovery into the matter was warranted and that the parties had stipulated as to the nature and timing of that discovery. \u201cWith respect to the status of the Account, the Magistrate Judge [found] that each of the parties stipulated and agreed, on the record, that the Account remain frozen until the current dispute regarding the respective interests of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett [was] resolved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148. He therefore found, pursuant to the local civil rules, that \u201cgood cause exist[ed] to stay the release of the Writ of Garnishment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">On October 7, 2004, after discovery into Mrs. Bennett\u2019s interest was complete, the magistrate judge ordered counsel for Lloyd\u2019s to prepare a proposed order and garnishee judgment. It is at this point in the appellate record that Bennett\u2019s objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s authority first appears. On October 15, 2004, he filed \u201cSpecific Objections to a Magistrate Judge Effecting a Final Irrevocable Disposition\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 150), alerting the district judge that the magistrate judge was prepared to sign the garnishee judgment. Bennett argued that the magistrate judge lacked authority to sign the garnishee judgment and that he had already exceeded his authority in staying the release of the writ of garnishment. Lloyd\u2019s conceded that a garnishee judgment is a final and appealable order, which, absent the parties\u2019 consent, cannot be signed by a magistrate judge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636. Lloyd\u2019s also conceded that the parties had not given their consent to the magistrate judge\u2019s exercise of such power.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Accordingly, on October 21, 2004, the court revoked its earlier order of reference and issued a second order of reference, this time under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), which sets forth the procedure for a magistrate judge to hear and make recommendations concerning certain dispositive matters. On October 25, 2004, the magistrate judge issued a report pursuant to that section recommending that a garnishee judgment be entered against Morgan Stanley for one-half the net value of Bennett\u2019s brokerage account. Bennett filed a timely objection to the report and recommendation under \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). He then filed for bankruptcy and the case was held in abeyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">In response to a request from the bankruptcy court, the district court issued an order on April 22, 2005, holding that the magistrate judge had not exceeded his au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>thority under the first order of reference by staying the release of the writ of garnishment. On May 6, 2005, Bennett filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the April 22, 2005, order. Before deciding that motion, however, the court entered a garnishee judgment based on the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge. On May 24, 2005, Bennett filed a motion to reconsider the garnishee judgment. On July 7, 2005, the court denied Bennett\u2019s motion for reconsideration with respect to its April 22, 2005, order, reaffirming its decision that the magistrate judge had authority to extend the writ of garnishment. On August 26, 2005, it denied Bennett\u2019s motion to reconsider the garnishee judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Based on the time of filing, the district court considered Bennett\u2019s first motion for reconsideration under Rule 60(b) and his second motion under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We therefore review the court\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Adams v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>225 F.3d 1179,1186 n. 5 (10th Cir.2000) (Rule 59(e)); <em>AUender v. Raytheon Aircraft Co., </em>439 F.3d 1236, 1242 (10th Cir.2006) (Rule 60(b)). \u201cUnder that standard, a motion for reconsideration should be granted only to correct manifest errors of law or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>225 F.3d at 1186 n. 5 (quotation omitted). We review questions of law de novo. <em>Strong v. Laubach, </em>443 F.3d 1297, 1298 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Bennett\u2019s appeal challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the magistrate judge acted within his authority in staying the release of the writ of garnishment and ordering the Morgan Stanley account to remain frozen. He argues that \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A), which he maintains was the only source of the magistrate judge\u2019s authority, pertains only to non-dispositive, non-injunctive pretrial matters, and that the magistrate judge\u2019s order extending the writ was a post-judgment grant of injunctive relief clearly beyond its scope. Therefore, the writ actually expired on September 7, 2004, and all orders flowing from the writ after that date, including the garnishee judgment, are invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Lloyd\u2019s counters that \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) should not be read literally to preclude any matter not occurring before trial. It argues that the term \u201cpretrial matter\u201d as used in \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A) was meant to refer to any non-dispositive matter, whether occurring before, during, or after trial. Lloyd\u2019s contends that the challenged order was neither injunctive nor dispositive and was therefore within the bounds of \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A). Alternatively, it argues that authority for the magistrate judge\u2019s order can be found in the \u201cadditional duties\u201d language of \u00a7 636(b)(3). Furthermore, Lloyd\u2019s argues that the magistrate judge had authority to extend the writ under \u00a7 636(c)(1), because the parties agreed to the extension on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Both parties raise interesting and complex arguments concerning the scope of a magistrate judge\u2019s authority to issue post-judgment orders under the Federal Magistrates Act. We need not reach the merits of the arguments, however, because we can affirm the district court judgment based on the parties\u2019 on-the-record stipulation to extend the writ of garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">\u201cIn this circuit, the rulings of a trial court in accordance with stipulations that are clear and unambiguous will not be considered erroneous on appeal.\u201d <em>Mills v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>827 F.2d 1418, 1422 (10th Cir.1987) (quotation omitted). At the August 6, 2004, hearing Bennett clearly and unambiguously agreed to an extension of the writ pending discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>into Mrs. Bennett\u2019s interest in the account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He now argues that the stipulation was never intended to broaden the magistrate judge\u2019s authority. This argument, however, is a red herring because regardless of whether Bennett consented to the magistrate judge\u2019s general authority, he clearly consented to the very act now complained of. We have long been \u201creluctant to relieve parties from the benefits, or detriments, of their stipulations.\u201d <em>L.P.S. ex rel. Kutz v. Lamm, </em>708 F.2d 537, 539-40 (10th Cir.1983). Therefore, we conclude that the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the extension of the writ of garnishment waived any objections to the matter, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bennett\u2019s motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b757-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-24\">. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 request, we have consolidated cases 05-4208 and 05-4239, as the latter is merely a carbon-copy of the former filed to cure a jurisdictional defect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b760-16\">. Contrary to Lloyd\u2019s assertion, the parties did not grant the type of consent contemplated in \u00a7 636(c)(1), which would have authorized the magistrate to conduct any and all proceedings, including the entry of a final garnishee judgment. See <em>Colo. Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. B.B. Andersen Constr. Co., </em>879 F.2d 809, 810 (10th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
