The District Court entered judgment following a jury verdict finding Metro-North 90% at fault for the accident in question and awarding Cooper damages for pain and suffering and lost wages. Metro-North appeals the jury\u2019s award of lost wages in the amount of $940,400. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Although we review de novo the District Court\u2019s denial of a Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, we apply the same strict standard governing the District Court. See <em>Cross v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., </em>417 F.3d 241, 248 (2d Cir.2005). \u201c[J]udgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless (1) there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury\u2019s findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise [or] conjecture, or (2) there is such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded [persons] could not arrive at a verdict against [it].\u201d <em>Taylor v. Brentwood Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>143 F.3d 679, 685 (2d Cir.1998) (alterations in original). We review the District Court\u2019s denial of a Rule 59 motion for abuse of discretion. See <em>Medforms, Inc. v. Healthcare Mgmt. Solutions, Inc., </em>290 F.3d 98, 106 (2d Cir.2002). \u201cA motion for a new trial ordinarily should not be granted unless the trial court is convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations marks omitted). Under either standard, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Id.; Taylor, </em>143 F.3d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">We find that the record fully supports the jury\u2019s award of lost wages, and therefore the District Court properly denied Metro-North\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. Evidence presented at trial included Cooper\u2019s testimony regarding the tasks required of him as an engineer or operations manager and the nature of his injuries, testimony from an orthopedic surgeon regarding Cooper\u2019s physical limitations, and testimony from a vocational rehabilitative expert regarding Cooper\u2019s loss of earning capacity due to his inability to perform certain physical tasks. The jury could properly choose to credit such testimony over that presented by Metro-North\u2019s experts. Accordingly, we reject Metro-North\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s award of lost damages was speculative and without evidentiary foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Furthermore, while we agree that the District Court improperly limited Metro-North\u2019s questioning of John Longobarti, we find this error harmless. There was sufficient evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, including testimony from other witnesses that engineers and operation managers were required to climb. Metro-North itself, in fact, solicited this testimony from one witness, and its own expert testified that climbing is one ability required of a railroad engineer, and Cooper could not work as an engineer or operations manger if he were unable to climb. Thus, we do not find that this evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ruling warrants a new trial. <em>See Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 143, 150 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201c[E]ven an erroneous evidentiary ruling will not lead to reversal unless affirmance would be \u2018inconsistent with substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 61)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
