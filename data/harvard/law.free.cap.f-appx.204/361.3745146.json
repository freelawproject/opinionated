(\u201cChevron\u201d) and Crawford &amp; Co. (\u201cCrawford\u201d) appeal the order of the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d or \u201cthe Board\u201d) affirming the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision to deny Petitioners\u2019 request for special fund relief under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d) \u00a7 8(f), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(f), 944. The BRB\u2019s order contains no reversible error. The Board correctly applied the law, and it properly concluded that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. We therefore AFFIRM the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Christopher Heavin (\u201cHeavin\u201d) began working for subsidiaries of Gulf Oil<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the day of his graduation from college in 1976. On October 13, 1986, while working as a facility operator, Heavin fell approximately forty feet from an offshore drilling platform. He suffered a bruised heart, punctured lungs and diaphragm, an injured liver, a laceration to his left kidney, and fractures to his ribs, back, hip, and right femur.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">In February 1982, prior to his accident, Heavin was treated for back pain at Lafayette General Hospital. Heavin also suffered from pre-existing kidney problems. In March 1983, Dr. Charles Williams removed Heavin\u2019s right kidney due to a congenital deformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Heavin filed a claim for benefits arising from the injuries that he sustained from the October 13, 1986, accident against employer Chevron and Crawford, Chevron\u2019s insurance carrier, under the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>as extended by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 <em>et seq. </em>The ALJ issued a Decision and Order Granting Permanent Total Disability Benefits on December 11, 2003. Of relevance to this appeal, the ALJ denied Chevron and Crawford\u2019s petition for section 8(f) relief because the ALJ found that Chevron and Crawford failed to prove that Heavin\u2019s permanent total disability was not due solely to the injuries he sustained from the October 13, 1986, accident. The ALJ then issued a Decision and Order Denying Request for Modification dated May 7, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">On May 20, 2004, Petitioners filed a timely notice of appeal with the BRB. On April 26, 2005, the Board issued its Decision and Order, which, among other things, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny Petitioners\u2019 request for section 8(f) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">Following the Board\u2019s decision, Petitioners filed a petition for review with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 22, 2005. The Ninth Circuit transferred the case to this court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 because Heavin sustained his injuries while working in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">The ALJ\u2019s Decision and Order Granting Permanent Total Disability Benefits resolved several issues related to Heavin\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim; however, the sole issue raised in this appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>whether Petitioners have proved that they qualify for section 8(f)\u2019s super fund relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">When considering an appeal of an ALJ\u2019s order, the BRB lacks statutory authority to \u201cto engage in a de novo review of the evidence or to substitute its views for those of the ALJ.\u201d <em>Ceres Marine Terminal v. Dir., </em>118 <em>F.3d 387, 389 </em>(5th Cir.1997); <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). The BRB must accept the ALJ\u2019s findings unless they \u201care not supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole or unless they are irrational.\u201d <em>Ceres, </em>118 F.3d at 389. Therefore, when reviewing a decision from the BRB, this court\u2019s \u201conly function is to correct errors of law and to determine if the BRB adhered to its proper scope of review \u2014 i.e., has the Board deferred to the ALJ\u2019s fact-finding or has it undertaken de novo review and substituted its views for the ALJ\u2019s.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Avondale Shipyards, Inc. v. Vinson, </em>623 F.2d 1117, 1119 n. 1 (5th Cir.1980)). When conducting a review of the Board\u2019s order, this court must \u201cindependently examine the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence because the LHWCA \u201chas the effect of shifting deference away from the BRB and to the ALJ.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Substantial evidence is \u201cthat relevant evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 that would cause a reasonable person to accept the fact finding.\u201d <em>Dir. v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc., </em>125 F.3d 303, 305 (5th Cir.1997). In other words, substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Louis Dreyfus Corp. v. Dir., </em>125 F.3d 884, 886 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Petitioners contend that the Board and the ALJ\u2019s finding that Petitioners failed to satisfy section 8(f)\u2019s requirements is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, Petitioners point to evidence which they argue clearly demonstrates that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing back and kidney problems contributed to his current permanent total disability. Petitioners also argue that the ALJ erred by focusing on the fact that their experts addressed the incorrect standard for satisfying section 8(f). Petitioners maintain that the ALJ should have delved into the record to determine whether Petitioners produced enough evidence to prove that they met section 8(f)\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Traditional workers\u2019 compensation regimes follow the \u201caggravation rule,\u201d which makes an employer hable for an employee\u2019s entire disability even though the disability resulted from a current employment injury and a pre-existing impairment. <em>Ceres, </em>118 F.3d at 389. However, section 8(f) limits the employer\u2019s liability for a work-related permanent disability if the employer can show that the employee had a pre-existing permanent partial disability that contributed to the current employment-related disability. <em>Id.; see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f). After 104 weeks, section 8(f) shifts liability from the employer to a special fund financed through contributions from employers in the industry. <em>Ingalls, 125 F.3d </em>at 306 n. 4; <em>see </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(f)(1), 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The elements that an employer must establish to take advantage of section 8(f)\u2019s super fund provision depend on whether the employee suffered a permanent partial disability or a permanent total disability. <em>Two R Drilling Co. v. Dir., </em>894 F.2d 748, 750 (5th Cir.1990). In this case, the ALJ determined that Heavin suffered a perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>nent total disability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as a result of his work-related injuries from the October 13, 1986, accident. Thus, Petitioners must establish that Heavin had: \u201c(1) an existing permanent partial disability before the employment injury; (2) that the permanent partial disability was manifest to the employer; and (3) that the current disability is not due solely to the employment injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The employer bears the burden of proving these elements. <em>Id.; Louis Dreyfus, </em>125 F.3d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The ALJ determined that Petitioners had satisfied the first two of section 8(f)\u2019s three requirements. Therefore, the only disputed issue on appeal is whether Petitioners proved that Heavin\u2019s current disability is not due solely to the employment injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioners contend that they met the contribution requirement because Heavin\u2019s October 13, 1986, accident would not have rendered him permanently totally disabled absent his pre-existing back and kidney disabilities. Petitioners also argue that this court should grant them section 8(f) relief as a matter of public policy to avoid discouraging employers from hiring employees with pre-existing permanent partial disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>A. The Contribution Requirement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Petitioners maintain that the Board and the ALJ erred by finding that it did not meet the contribution requirement. To support its claim, Petitioners cite to a medical report by Dr. James London in which he opined that Heavin\u2019s injuries from the October 13, 1986, accident combined with his pre-existing back impairment to produce a greater total impairment than would have resulted from the work injury alone. Petitioners also rely on Dr. London\u2019s deposition testimony in which he stated that Heavin\u2019s current work restrictions arose from both the October 13,1986, injuries and his pre-existing back impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">In addition to the pre-existing back condition, Petitioners maintain that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing kidney disability contributed to his present disability. A medical report authored by Dr. London dated August 25, 1998, stated that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing congenital kidney condition made his injuries from the October 13, 1986, accident materially and substantially greater. Petitioners also rely on a medical report by Dr. Nachman Brautbar, which opines that the removal of Heavin\u2019s right kidney in 1983 was a contributing factor to his current impairment because being hired with one kidney increases the risk for developing renal failure and hemodialysis. Finally, Petitioners cite a medical report by Dr. Peter Grodon in which he noted that Heavin\u2019s kidney condition left him vulnerable to nephrotoxic drugs and profound dehydration. Petitioners use Dr. Grodon\u2019s report to argue that the pre-existing kidney condition contributed to Heavin\u2019s current permanent total disability. Petitioners maintain that if Heavin still had a right kidney, he would be able to reenter the labor market because he would have higher kidney function, which would allow him to take medications that would enable him to control his back pain and incontinence.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 arguments, the ALJ found that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing back condition did not contribute to his current permanent total disability. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ALJ cited a medical report from Dr. Blanda, which noted that Heavin\u2019s back pain resulted from kidney problems. A report from Dr. Raymond Linovitz also suggested that Heavin\u2019s back problem really arose from his kidney problems or possibly a sciatic nerve problem. The ALJ credited Dr. Linovitz\u2019s opinion that a 1982 medical record referring to back pain with no follow-up treatment was insufficient to show that Heavin suffered from a pre-existing back condition. The opinions of Drs. Blanda and Linovitz provide substantial evidence \u2014 such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion \u2014 to sustain the ALJ\u2019s determination that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing back condition, if he even had one, did not contribute to his present disability. <em>See Louis Dreyfus, </em>125 F.3d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">There was also substantial evidence in the record for the ALJ to conclude that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing kidney problems did not contribute to his present disability. Dr. Grodon testified that \u2018You have a perfect example of people donating a kidney for transplant, and they have one kidney left, and they live normal lives ... [Heavin] does not have a disability because of his kidneys. Even now.\u201d <em>Heavin v. Chevron USA, Inc., </em>2002-LHC-2122, 07-105398, at 27 (Dep\u2019t of Labor Dec. 11, 2003). Put differently, only having one kidney does not limit someone from the labor market. Dr. Grodon also stated that \u201cconsidering the substantial trauma to his body, in my opinion, both kidneys would have been damaged, in all medical probability to an identical degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, even assuming Heavin\u2019s kidney problems did limit him for the labor force, the October 13, 1986, accident was so traumatic that it alone would have been sufficient to render Heavin permanently totally disabled. The ALJ concluded from this testimony that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing kidney problem played no role in the severity and extent of his permanent condition. In other words, Heavin\u2019s pre-existing kidney problems did not contribute to his present inability to enter the labor force.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The record yielded substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that neither Heavin\u2019s pre-existing back condition, if he had one, nor his pre-existing kidney problems contributed to his present inability to reenter the labor force. The ALJ credited a medical report from Dr. Grodon dated June 18, 2001, which stated that Heavin\u2019s orthopedic limitations, not his liver or kidney disorders, limited him from the labor market. Thus, Petitioners\u2019 own expert, Dr. Grodon, provided the substantial evidence for the ALJ to determine that Heavin\u2019s pre-existing kidney condition did not contribute to his current permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Having reviewed both Petitioners\u2019 arguments and the ALJ\u2019s decision and order, Petitioners establish \u2014 at best \u2014 that a fact finder could draw multiple inferences from the evidence in the record. The well-established law in this circuit is that whether \u201cthe facts may permit diverse inferences is immaterial. The administrative law judge alone is charged with the duty of selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if supported by the evidence, may not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Presley v. Tinsley Maint. Serv., </em>529 F.2d 433, 436 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Mendoza v. Marine Pers. Co., </em>46 F.3d 498, 500 (5th Cir.1995). It is the ALJ who \u201cdetermines the weight to be accorded to evidence and makes credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>46 F.3d at 500. Further, \u201cwhere the testimony of medical experts is at issue, the ALJ is entitled to accept any part of an expert\u2019s testimony or reject it completely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501; <em>Mijangos v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 941, 945 (5th Cir.1991). In this case, the ALJ\u2019s selection of inferences was reasonable and supported by the evidence. Therefore, this court cannot disturb the ALJ\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Petitioners argue that the ALJ erred by focusing on the fact that their experts\u2019 opinions did not address the correct legal standard for permanent total disability cases. Petitioners\u2019 experts, Drs. London and Grodon, stated that Heavin\u2019s current injury is materially and substantially greater because of his pre-existing injuries. The ALJ correctly noted that those opinions would be relevant to a permanent partial disability case, but not to Heavin\u2019s permanent total disability case. <em>See Two R Drilling, </em>894 F.2d at 750. Petitioners contend that instead of focusing on the fact that their experts addressed the incorrect standard, the ALJ should have delved into the record to determine whether Petitioners had proved the contribution requirement for a permanent total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Petitioners\u2019 argument fails for two reasons. First, in permanent total disability eases, an employer cannot establish the contribution requirement by simply showing that the employee\u2019s current disability is greater than it would have been absent the employee\u2019s pre-existing impairments. <em>Ceres, </em>118 F.3d at 390; <em>Ingalls, </em>125 F.3d at 306-07. Instead, the employer has to prove that the employee would not be totally disabled \u2014 i.e., unable to reenter the labor force \u2014 without his prior injury. <em>Ingalls, </em>125 F.3d at 307. Second, the ALJ\u2019s decision demonstrates that the ALJ looked beyond the fact that Petitioners\u2019 experts addressed the incorrect standard and that the ALJ delved into the record evidence when making factual determinations. For example, the ALJ discredited Dr. Grodon\u2019s testimony that Heavin\u2019s current disability is substantially greater than it would have been from the October 13, 1986, accident alone not only because this testimony was irrelevant to the correct standard, but also because it was conclusory and contradicted some of his other statements. <em>Heavin, </em>2002-LHC-2122, 07-105398 at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>B. Public Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Petitioners argue that this court should grant them section 8(f) relief as a matter of public policy because Congress enacted section 8(f) to reduce discrimination against handicapped workers. In order to further congressional intent, Petitioners contend that this court should construe section 8(f) liberally in favor of employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Almost all authorities agree that Congress enacted section 8\u00a9 to diminish an employer\u2019s incentive to discriminate against partially disabled workers. <em>See Lawson v. Suwwanee Fruit &amp; S.S. Co., </em>336 U.S. 198, 201, 69 S.Ct. 503, 93 L.Ed. 611 (1949); <em>Ceres, </em>118 F.3d at 389. Section 8(f) strikes a balance between encouraging employers to hire partially disabled workers and avoiding a moral hazard problem in which employers would seek to shift liability to the special fund in cases where there were only insignificant pre-existing injuries. <em>Ingalls, </em>125 F.3d at 306. Therefore, the elements that an employer must prove to benefit from section 8\u00a9 reflect Congress\u2019s judgment about the best way to achieve the public policy goal of reducing discrimination against disabled workers. Broadly referring to Congress\u2019s desire to reduce discrimination against the partially disabled is no substitute for actually meeting section 8ffl\u2019s demands. Public policy does not entitle Petitioners to section 8\u00a9 relief because Petitioners failed to meet the contribution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the decision of the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-20\">.
