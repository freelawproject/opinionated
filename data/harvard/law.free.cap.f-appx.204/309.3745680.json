For the following reasons, we affirm Appeal No. 06-4705 and dismiss Appeal No. 06-4706.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-24\">We review the imposition of special conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Dotson, </em>324 F.3d 256, 259 (4th Cir.2003). Although a sentencing court must impose various statutorily required conditions of supervised release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), it also enjoys substantial latitude to \u201cimpose any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>condition it considers to be appropriate, as long as that condition is \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to [the] statutory factors referred to in \u00a7 3588(d)(1).\u201d <em>Dotson, </em>324 F.3d at 260 (quoting 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d)(1)). Such factors include \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006); providing adequate deterrence, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and \u201cprotecting] the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Additionally, a special condition must \u201cinvolve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\u201d to achieve its intended purpose. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Watson began his period of supervised release on June 25, 2006. Because the ninety-day period Watson was required to stay at a halfway house following his release has concluded, we dismiss as moot his appeal of the order challenging the imposition of this condition in Appeal No. 06-4706.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> With respect to the condition imposing GPS monitoring, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, a transcript of the hearings, and the other materials submitted on appeal and conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the condition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order in Appeal No. 06-4705. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">No. 06-4705, <em>AFFIRMED</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">No. 06-4706, <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> We note that, by subsequent order entered August 15, 2006, the district court further modified this condition to require Watson to serve the remainder of the ninety days on home confinement, as soon as he secured a suitable, independent residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
