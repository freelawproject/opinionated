The district court sentenced Eliely to concurrent terms of fifty months\u2019 imprisonment on all counts. Eliely appealed and asserts insufficient evidence supported his convictions.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984). A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, we do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Nothwithstanding these principles, Eliely urges us to review the credibility of a trial witness, Demetrial Stewart. At the sentencing hearing, Stewart gave testimony that conflicted with her testimony before the grand jury; consequently, the district court found Stewart\u2019s testimony concerning a sentencing enhancement for possession of firearms in connection with another felony lacked credibility, and it sustained Eliely\u2019s objection to the enhancement. On this basis, Eliely contends that Stewart wholly lacked credibility. Because Stewart was an important witness to the prosecution, Eliely\u2019s argument follows, her lack of credibility renders the evidence against him insufficient to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The guilty verdicts indicate that the jury as factfinder found Stewart\u2019s testimony credible. While the district court found Stewart\u2019s conflicting and uncorroborated testimony did not support one sentencing enhancement, the court also found Stewart\u2019s testimony sufficiently credible to support a separate enhancement for obstruction of justice. Nothing in the record indicates Stewart\u2019s testimony at trial lacked credibility, and we decline to upset the jury\u2019s obvious finding that Stewart was a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">After reviewing the trial transcript, we conclude substantial evidence supports Eliely\u2019s jury convictions; therefore, we affirm the convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-9\"> Eliely does not challenge his sentence on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
