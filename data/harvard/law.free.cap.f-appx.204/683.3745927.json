R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b711-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-23\">Petitioner Martha Orosco-Lopez, an undocumented alien from Mexico, was placed in removal proceedings in 1999, conceded removability and requested cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, relief that the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied. The IJ found that Petitioner was statutorily ineligible for relief because the IJ had reason to believe that Petitioner was involved in drug trafficking based on state court documents indicating that Petitioner was convicted of possession for sale of a controlled substance under section 11351 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>of the California Health and Safety Code. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">To be eligible for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure, an alien has the burden to demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that she had good moral character during the relevant period. <em>See Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 998 n. 1 (9th Cir.2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(B); 1229c(b)(1)(B). Where the IJ \u201cknows or has reason to believe\u201d that an alien \u201cis or has been an illicit trafficker in any controlled substance,\u201d the alien is per se excluded from eligibility for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3); 1182(a)(2)(C)(i). The IJ may determine an alien is statutorily ineligible even where the alien has not been convicted of a drug trafficking offense. <em>See Lopez-Umanzor v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1049, 1053 (9th Cir. 2005) (\u201cSection 1182(a)(2)(C) does not require a conviction, but only a \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that the alien is or has been involved in drug trafficking.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The IJ\u2019s decision that there was reason to believe that Petitioner was a drug trafficker was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ concluded that Petitioner pled guilty to and was convicted of possession for sale of a controlled substance in light of an Information alleging the controlled substance violation, a February 14, 2002 minute order issued by a Fresno County Superior Court indicating that Petitioner had \u201cwaive[d] time for sentencing,\u201d and the fact that Petitioner had been engaged in on-going plea negotiations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The minute order indicated that a judgment had been entered against Petitioner and that the only remaining issue was sentencing. Because the Government is not required to prove the conviction under section 1 182(a)(2)(C), this evidence provided a substantial basis for the IJ\u2019s conclusion. Moreover, Petitioner did not rebut the Government\u2019s evidence of a conviction where Petitioner had the ultimate burden to prove good moral character. <em>See Lopez-Molina v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir.2004) (upholding denial of cancellation of removal without conviction where petitioner neither testified nor submitted evidence to rebut the facts in Government documents indicating involvement in drug trafficking). The record here does not compel a contrary conclusion to that reached by the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Finally, we reject Petitioner\u2019s claim under the Tenth Amendment that removal interfered with an on-going criminal investigation by state law enforcement. Petitioner\u2019s removal pursuant to federal immigration law did not unconstitutionally hinder state law enforcement efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b711-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. Petitioner asserts a meritless claim that a conviction of possession for sale of a controlled substance is not an aggravated felony and cannot be the basis for an ineligibility finding because a drug trafficking offense by definition features a firearm element. The IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner was statutorily ineligible for relief hinged on a finding that she could not show good moral character due to her involvement in drug trafficking activities under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3) and 1182(a)(2)(C)(i), not because Petitioner was convicted of the aggravated felony of drug trafficking. The IJ explicitly stated that the aggravated felony issue was immaterial to her ruling. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(B)(l)(B) and (C) (listing good moral character and no conviction of aggravated felony as separate requirements for eligibility).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
