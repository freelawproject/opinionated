Rohan denying Wong\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Bidiman Wong, </em>No. A. 96 262 931 (B.I.A. May 9, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A. 96 262 931 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 26, 2004). Wong appeals only the denial of his application for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). While the government correctly notes that adverse credibility findings are reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard, here the IJ did not make an adverse credibility finding against Wong. Rather, assuming Wong credible and accepting his testimony as true, the IJ held that Wong had failed to satisfy his burden of establishing a clear probability of persecution on account of one of the protected grounds. We review de novo the IJ\u2019s legal conclusion that the evidence presented by Wong was insufficient to satisfy his burden of proof. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 146 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">Withholding of removal is granted when an applicant \u201cestablishes that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened in [the] country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted; brackets in original). A past threat to life or freedom creates a rebuttable presumption of a future threat. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). Based on our review of the record, we agree with the IJ that Wong failed to meet his burden of proof for substantially the reasons discussed in the IJ\u2019s opinion, including that Wong voluntarily returned to Indonesia after his store was destroyed in the 1998 riots, Wong did not encounter any difficulties in Indonesia in the two years prior to the time he left for the United States, and Wong\u2019s brothers, who are also ethnic Chinese businessmen, have not encountered any problems in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Furthermore, while we agree with Wong that the IJ should have explicitly determined whether the incidents recounted by Wong amounted to past persecution, <em>see Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226-27 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>(2d Cir.2006), we do not find that this failure warrants remand in Wong\u2019s case. The IJ discussed each of the three incidents described by Wong as the basis of his claim, and encompassed within her ruling that Wong failed to satisfy his burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is the finding that Wong had failed to set forth sufficient evidence establishing either a past or future threat to life or freedom on account of one of the protected grounds. As discussed above, the record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion. Accordingly, remand in this case would be futile. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir.2006) (finding remand unnecessary when \u201cwe can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-10\">. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Wong's asylum application was time-barred because it was filed nearly two years after his entry into the United States and Wong had not established changed circumstances to excuse the delay. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D). Wong acknowledges that we lack jurisdiction to review these factual determinations. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Wong also does not challenge the denial of his claim for CAT relief in his brief to this Court, and therefore, this claim is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
