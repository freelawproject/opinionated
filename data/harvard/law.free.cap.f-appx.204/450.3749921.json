For the first time on appeal, Gama contends that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court committed reversible error by sentencing him under mandatory Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>This claim is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). Gama has shown that the district court clearly erred by sentencing him under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See id. </em>at 600; <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-57. Because the court\u2019s remarks about the sentence are equivocal, Gama has not, however, shown that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">As the Government correctly notes, a sentencing judge\u2019s comment that the guidelines sentence is \u201charsh\u201d does not alone establish that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, nor does a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310, 317 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005). In <em>Bringier, </em>the sentencing court \u201cdid not lament over the sentence he imposed, nor did he state that the sentence is <em>\u2018more </em>than appropriate\u2019 or <em>\u2018too </em>severe.\u2019 Instead, he merely acknowledged the sentence was harsh.\u201d <em>Bringier, </em>405 F.3d at 318 (emphasis in original). Here, the court used the term, \u201csomewhat harsh\u201d, but she also noted that \u201ca sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range is sufficient in this case to meet the sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence and incapacitation.\u201d We are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s remarks suggest that it may have imposed a lesser sentence under advisory Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 677 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Gama\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
