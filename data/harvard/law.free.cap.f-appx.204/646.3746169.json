To the extent we have jurisdiction it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part, dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Petitioners\u2019 equal protection challenge to the constitutionality of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act is foreclosed by <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 602-03 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">As to petitioner Rebeca Lopez Lopez only, we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s determination that she did not establish the requisite hardship. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">As to petitioner Eduardo Perez Gutierrez only, an intervening change in the law requires us to remand the case. It is not possible to determine from the record if his departure in 1998 was a border turnaround or an uninformed voluntary departure, as opposed to a knowing acceptance of administrative voluntary departure. In <em>Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 998 (9th Cir.2005), we \u201cconclude[d] that being turned away at the border by immigration officials does not have the same effect as an administrative voluntary departure and does not itself interrupt the accrual of an alien\u2019s continuous physical presence.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 619 (9th Cir.2006), we held that voluntary departure under threat of deportation breaks the accrual of continuous physical presence only where the alien is informed of and accepts the terms of the removal. Accordingly, we grant his petition for review and remand for further fact-finding consistent with <em>Tapia </em>and <em>Ibarra-Flores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part, and GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
