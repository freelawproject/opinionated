We conclude from a review of the record that the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and the record does not compel a conclusion contrary to the IJ\u2019s findings that the encounters with the guerrillas do not rise to the level of persecution and that Sachica failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 304 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The petition for review is DENIED. Sachica\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b509-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
