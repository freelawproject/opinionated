INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998) (setting forth standard of review). We have also reviewed Fikri\u2019s claim that the Board rendered its decision in violation of his rights to due process of law. As Fikri fails to establish that his rights were \u201ctransgressed in such a way as is likely to impact the results of the proceeding,\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320-21 (4th Cir.2002), we find that he is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
