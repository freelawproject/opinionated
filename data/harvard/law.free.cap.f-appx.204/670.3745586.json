We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir. 2004), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The IJ did not make an express adverse credibility finding, so we accept Gabrielyan\u2019s testimony as true. <em>See Kataria v. </em>INS, 232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000). Gabrielyan failed to demonstrate that either of the attacks he suffered during his military service was based on anything other than purely personal retribution, \u201ccompletely untethered to a governmental system.\u201d <em>See Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 n. 3 (9th Cir.2000). Gabrielyan also did not establish that the April 2002 attack was anything more than a random criminal act. <em>See Gormley, </em>364 F.3d at 1177. Further, even if Gabrielyan\u2019s two-day detention in March of 2002 was based on his political opinion, the IJ\u2019s determination that Gabrielyan failed to demonstrate that this mistreatment rose to the level of persecution is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (persecution must be \u201cextreme\u201d treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Finally, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Gabrielyan did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that an applicant must provide credible, direct, and specific evidence to satisfy the objective component of a well-founded fear of future persecution claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Because Gabrielyan failed to demonstrate he was eligible for asylum, it follows he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Gabrielyan\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s streamlined decision indicates the BIA did not consider his CAT claim is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 850-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b698-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
