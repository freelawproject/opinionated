Jarrell seeks review of the final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) finding that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was in compliance with an earlier Board order to recalculate his ex-wife\u2019s share of his retirement annuity. <em>Montague v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DC-0831-01-0651-X-1, 100 M.S.P.R. 644 (Dec. 6, 2005). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-28\">Mr. Jarrell and Judy B. Montague were divorced on May 10, 1991. The divorce decree provided that Ms. Montague would receive a share of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) annuity benefits according to a specified formula. The decree further provided that Ms. Montague\u2019s interest in her ex-husband\u2019s CSRS retirement annuity and survivor benefits \u201cshall exclude increases as a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>suit of merit raises or promotions occurring after the date of divorce but shall include all future cost of living adjustments (COLAS).\u201d Mr. Jarrell retired from federal service on June 3, 1999, and OPM subsequently calculated Ms. Montague\u2019s share of his retirement annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Ms. Montague disagreed with OPM\u2019s calculations and filed an appeal with the Board. The Board reversed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision and ordered OPM to recalculate Ms. Montague\u2019s share. <em>Montague v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DC-0831-01-0651-X-1 (Nov. 16, 2001) (Initial Decision); <em>Montague v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>93 M.S.P.R. 174 (2002) (Final Order). Ms. Montague subsequently filed a petition for enforcement of the Board\u2019s order. An administrative judge (AJ) found that OPM was in compliance, but in an order dated April 22, 2005, the Board reversed the AJ\u2019s initial compliance decision and ordered OPM to recalculate Ms. Montague\u2019s share of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s annuity according to the following procedure. <em>Montague v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>98 M.S.P.R. 440 (2005). First, OPM was ordered to calculate what Mr. Jarrell\u2019s \u201chigh-three\u201d salary would have been at the date of his retirement in 1999 had he received COLAs but no merit raises or promotions after May 10,1991, the date of the divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 442. OPM then was ordered to calculate a hypothetical annuity based on that high-three figure and the entire length of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s creditable service up until the date of his retirement. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to the formula in the divorce decree, Ms. Montague was to receive 30.57% of that hypothetical annuity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">On June 8, 2005, OPM submitted to the Board a statement of compliance with the Board\u2019s April 22, 2005, order. Mr. Jarrell subsequently filed a \u201ccross petition for review\u201d in which he alleged that OPM erred by including in its calculation annual pay adjustments, all of which he contended were merit pay or promotion increases. In response, OPM explained that the Board\u2019s directions to exclude merit raises and promotions but include COLAs implied that annual adjustments to the basic rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5303 should be included in its calculation. The Board concluded that OPM was in compliance with its April 22, 2005, order and dismissed the petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Before this court, Mr. Jarrell repeats the argument that OPM should have excluded from its calculation all adjustments to his salary after May 10, 1991. Based on our review of the record, however, we agree with Ms. Montague that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the divorce decree is reasonable and that OPM correctly calculated Ms. Montague\u2019s share of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s retirement annuity in accordance with the Board\u2019s directions. Under OPM\u2019s own regulations and guidelines for interpreting divorce decrees, a court order awarding a former spouse a share of an employee annuity based on a formula is interpreted to entitle the former spouse to all salary adjustments after the date of the divorce unless the court order directly and unequivocally orders otherwise. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.622(b)(1)\u00a9; 5 C.F.R. Pt. 838, Subpt. J, App. A, Part I, Section B. In this case, the divorce decree specifically excludes only merit and promotion increases; all other salary adjustments, including annual pay adjustments under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5303, are therefore properly included in OPM\u2019s calculation of Ms. Montague\u2019s share of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s retirement annuity. In addition, there is nothing in the record to indicate that OPM has incorrectly adjusted Ms. Montague\u2019s annuity for COLAs after the date of Mr. Jarrell\u2019s retirement. <em>See </em>5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 838.622(b)(l)(ii); 5 C.F.R.
