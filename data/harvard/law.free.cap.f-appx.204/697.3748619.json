We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>INS v. Elias Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-28\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Mazariegos did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of an enumerated ground. <em>Id. </em>at 481-482, 112 S.Ct. 812. Mazariegos\u2019 claim centers on her father\u2019s involvement with the National Police. Her father, however, as well as her four brothers, continue to reside in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Guatemala without incident and she has testified that neither she nor her family was politically active. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201can applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident\u201d); <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1491 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that petitioner failed to show that he faced problems on account of his political opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b725-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
