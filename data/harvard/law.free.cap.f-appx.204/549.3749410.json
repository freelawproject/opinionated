On appeal he challenges the application of an upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for a four-level increase if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d The district court found that Swearengin possessed ammunition in connection with a felony drug offense, but Swearengin argues that it was error to base the adjustment on that ammunition because it was not the subject of either \u00a7 922(g)(1) count, both of which involved guns. Because the district court did not err in using the ammunition as the basis for applying the adjustment, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On January 3, 2005, state probation officers searched Swearengin\u2019s residence under the terms of his probation. The officers located an unloaded shotgun in his bedroom closet. They then searched Swearengin\u2019s garage and found items used to manufacture methamphetamine \u2014 empty blister packs of pseudoephedrine, a pill crusher with white powder, a bucket containing lithium batteries, and coffee filters. The officers also located 12.5 grams of methamphetamine, 8.6 grams of marijuana, and two boxes of .357 caliber ammunition in the garage. Swearengin later admitted that he\u2019d been handling a friend\u2019s .357 Magnum handgun in the garage not long before the probation officers had arrived. Swearengin was arrested on January 3, but apparently he was released on bond. On January 13, police officers responding to a battery complaint were told by the victim that Swearengin beat him up over guns Swearengin wanted the victim to keep at his residence. On the same day a second victim at a different location advised police that Swearengin had left guns at his residence. Officers retrieved three handguns from the second victim\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Swearengin eventually was turned over to federal authorities and charged with two counts of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1). Count 1 charged him with possessing the shotgun retrieved from his bedroom on January 3, and Count 2 charged him with possessing the three handguns located at the second victim\u2019s residence on January 13. He entered blind guilty pleas to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The probation officer who prepared the presentence report recommended that Swearengin\u2019s base offense level be increased by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which applies if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d The probation officer made this recommendation because \u201cthe defendant possessed a weapon in connection with the possession or manufacturing of methamphetamine in his garage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Swearengin objected to the recommended four-level increase. He did not dispute the probation officer\u2019s assumption that he committed \u201canother felony offense,\u201d i.e., the \u201cpossession or manufacturing of methamphetamine in his garage.\u201d And he conceded that there was \u201csufficient evidence in the record to establish a connection between the .357 ammunition and/or revolver and the offense of meth manufacturing.\u201d He also conceded that this connection \u201cwould be enough to apply the enhancement if Mr. Swearengin were convicted of possessing a .357, or .357 ammunition.\u201d Swearengin argued, however, that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) could not be applied because he was not charged with possessing either the .357 ammunition found in his garage or the .357 Magnum handgun he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>admittedly possessed there (the handgun was never recovered). Swearengin acknowledged that the language of subsection (b)(5) did not itself mandate that the gun or ammunition underlying the upward adjustment be charged in the indictment, but he reasoned that the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, effectively imposed such a limitation. In making this argument, however, Swearengin narrowly focused on just one of the four separate paragraphs in \u00a7 lB1.3(a) that define the scope of relevant conduct: he cited only subsection (a)(1), which encompasses within the definition of relevant conduct those acts and omissions attributable to the defendant \u201cthat occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The government contended that \u00a7 lB1.3(a) did not prevent the district court from considering the uncharged ammunition because subsection (a)(4) of that guideline also encompasses within the definition of relevant conduct \u201cany other information specified in the applicable guideline.\u201d And in this case, the government reasoned, the applicable guideline\u2014 \u00a7 2K2.1 \u2014 specifies in subsection (b)(5) that the court should look at whether the defendant possessed <em>any </em>firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense, not whether he possessed a <em>charged </em>gun or ammunition in connection with another offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">The district court sided with the government and overruled Swearengin\u2019s objection, reasoning that \u201cthe presence of the firearms in the home, together with the ammunition in the garage in the general area of the drug manufacturing operations, clearly warrants the application of the relevant conduct enhancements of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(4) to this sentence under the specific offense characteristics of \u00a7 282.1(b)(5).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-14\">On appeal Swearengin renews his argument that the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement is inappropriate because it does not constitute relevant conduct under subsection (a)(1) of \u00a7 1B1.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He points out that under subsection (a)(1) the other acts constituting relevant conduct must have occurred \u201cduring the commission of the <em>offense of conviction, </em>in preparation for <em>that offense, </em>or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for <em>that offense </em>\u201d (emphasis by the defendant). Because the .357 ammunition was not charged, Swearengin argues, its possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>was not part of the \u201coffense of conviction\u201d and therefore could not be considered as relevant conduct in applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Chamness, </em>435 F.3d 724, 726 (7th Cir.2006). The problem for Swearengin, as the government points out, is that \u201crelevant conduct\u201d includes all acts or omissions falling within <em>any </em>of the four subsections of \u00a7 lB1.3(a). <em>See United States v. Soy, </em>413 F.3d 594, 613 (7th Cir. 2005). Language in the guidelines that is not specifically defined should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 462, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991); <em>United States v. Turchen, </em>187 F.3d 735, 739 (7th Cir.1999). And the directive in subsection (a)(4) of \u00a7 1B 1.3 to look to \u201cany other information specified in the applicable guideline\u201d means that a sentencing court literally may include as relevant conduct \u201cany other information\u201d specified in the applicable guideline. As we have explained, \u201c\u00a7 1B1.3(a) explicates the fundamental rule that relevant conduct must be criminal in nature,\u201d but \u201csubsection (a)(4) indicates that each applicable guideline may also specify additional relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>291 F.3d 932, 939 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Lane, </em>323 F.3d 568, 591 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">That is the situation here. The Eighth Circuit recently held in <em>United States v. Davis, </em>360 F.3d 901 (8th Cir.2004), that \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(4) is pertinent in applying \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). In <em>Davis </em>the court of appeals upheld a district court\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s involvement in a carjacking ten days before his possession of the gun that led to his \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction counted as \u201canother felony offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). <em>Id. </em>at 903. The defendant argued that the carjacking could not count as \u201canother felony offense\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because it did not occur contemporaneously with the offense of conviction, arguing \u2014 as does Swearengin\u2014 that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) limits what can be considered under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) to acts or omissions that occurred during, in preparation for, or while attempting to avoid detection of the offense of conviction. <em>Id. </em>The Eighth Circuit rejected this argument, concluding that relevant conduct also includes, pursuant to \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(4), \u201cany other information specified in the applicable guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that the applicable guideline, \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), directed a four-level increase if a firearm was possessed in connection with \u201canother felony offense\u201d without regard to whether the other felony offense occurred contemporaneously with the offense of conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The opinion in <em>Davis </em>fully supports the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) in this case. Section 1B1.3(a)(4) is unambiguous in that it states that factors specified in the applicable guideline shall be considered by the judge. The applicable guideline\u2014 \u00a7 2K2.1 \u2014 specifies in subsection (b)(5) that a four-level increase is appropriate so long as the defendant possessed \u201cany firearm or ammunition\u201d in connection with the other felony offense. Swearengin possessed ammunition, and he conceded at sentencing both that the drug-related activity in his garage qualified as \u201canother felony,\u201d and that a sufficient connection existed between that activity and the ammunition. Thus, the upward adjustment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">In addition to its decision in <em>Davis, </em>the Eighth Circuit also has held that the firearm or ammunition relevant to an upward adjustment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) need not be charged in the indictment. In <em>United States v. Mann, </em>315 F.3d 1054, 1057 (8th Cir.2003), the court held that \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>applies to the use or possession of any firearm, not just the one on which the defendant\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 922(g) is based. The majority reasoned that the language of the guideline \u2014 particularly the use of <em>\u201cany </em>firearm\u201d instead of <em>\u201cthe </em>firearm\u201d \u2014 plainly means that the gun attached to the offense of conviction needn\u2019t be one in the same with the one connected to the second felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1056. <em>See also United States v. Williams, </em>431 F.3d 767, 770 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Settle, </em>414 F.3d 629, 633-34 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Jardine, </em>364 F.3d 1200, 1208 (10th Cir.2004) (same conclusion under analogous provision of guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Swearengin\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">.
