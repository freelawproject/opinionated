On August 5, 2005, Vargas was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of 120 months\u2019 incarceration to be followed by five years\u2019 supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Vargas appeals only his sentence, arguing that imposition of the statutory mandatory minimum (1) violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers by vesting excessive sentencing power in the Executive Branch of government, and (2) deprived him of an individualized sentencing hearing in violation of the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const, amend. V. The district judge rejected Vargas\u2019s arguments, concluding that they presented \u201cquestions of policy and not of constitutional law.\u201d Sentencing Tr. 3-4. Because the district court\u2019s ruling presents issues of law, we review it <em>de novo, see United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2005), and reach the same conclusion. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-19\">1. <em>Separation of Powers Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-20\">Vargas\u2019s separation of powers argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Huerta, </em>878 F.2d 89 (2d Cir.1989). <em>Huerta, </em>like Vargas, was unsuccessful in persuading the prosecution to move for a sentence below the mandatory minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). <em>See also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. He argued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u201cthat sentencing is a judicial prerogative and necessarily includes the power to consider all relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Huerta, </em>878 F.2d at 91. Thus, he claimed that \u201ca scheme which delegates to the prosecutorial arm of the Executive Branch the authority to control when a judge may consider cooperation with the government as a mitigating factor [warranting exception from a mandatory minimum] interferes with or usurps a constitutionally assigned judicial function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected this separation of powers challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">Sentencing is not inherently or exclusively a judicial function, and \u201cthe sentencing function long has been a peculiarly shared responsibility among the Branches of government and has never been thought of as the exclusive constitutional province of any one Branch.\u201d <em>[Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 390, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989)]. In <em>Mistretta, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201cthe scope of judicial discretion with respect to a sentence is subject to congressional control.\u201d 488 U.S. at 364, 109 S.Ct. 647. In fact, as appellant concedes, Congress can constitutionally eliminate all discretion in sentencing judges by establishing mandatory sentences, and thus has the power to preclude sentencing judges from giving any consideration to a defendant\u2019s cooperation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 93 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Vargas argues that <em>Huerta </em>does not control his appeal because <em>Huerta </em>rejected only a separation of powers challenge to what Vargas conceives of as the usurpation of due judicial discretion. The distinction between usurpation of such discretion and the accretion of power in one branch, which Vargas now complains of, is one without a difference. Vargas also argues that the <em>Huerta </em>court could not foresee how \u201cthe growth in <em>de facto </em>sentencing power in the hands of prosecutors in the seventeen following years,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 3, would violate \u201cthe separation of powers doctrine,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. Vargas references what he describes as a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of criticism regarding the appropriateness of mandatory-minimum laws and the inordinate discretion that such laws grant to federal prosecutors. <em>Id. </em>at 10-12. While such experience and commentary may provide support for a policy challenge to mandatory m\u00ednimums, it does not support Vargas\u2019s constitutional argument. To the extent the decision to charge crimes carrying mandatory minimum sentences allows the Executive Branch to exercise some control over a defendant\u2019s sentence, that control continues to derive from legislative decisions that are well within Congress\u2019s authority to make. <em>See Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. at 364, 109 S.Ct. 647. Accordingly, this panel has no reason to revisit <em>Huerta\u2019s </em>holding that imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence does not violate separation of powers. <em>See United States v. Kane, </em>452 F.3d 140, 144 (2d Cir.2006) (stating general rule that \u201c[o]ne panel of this Court cannot overrule a prior decision of another panel unless there has been an intervening Supreme Court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Similarly unpersuasive is Vargas\u2019s argument for reconsideration of <em>Huerta </em>in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Vargas contends that <em>Booker </em>\u201cforeshadowed\u201d a finding that mandatory m\u00ednimums are unconstitutional \u201cby emphasizing the importance of judicial discretion, the Judiciary\u2019s ability to consider all relevant factors in order to impose a sentence, and the dangers of expanded Executive power.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 7. We are not persuaded. <em>Booker </em>reiterated a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have critical facts increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence decided by a jury. It did not foreshadow the end of, or otherwise cast doubt on the constitutionality of, mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See United States v. Barrero, </em>425 F.3d 154, 158 (2d Cir.2005) (upholding <em>post-Booker </em>challenge to mandatory minimum sentence). Moreover, to the extent Vargas claims that <em>Booker </em>\u201ccreat[ed] incentives for the Legislative and Executive Branches to rely increasingly on mandatory minimum penalties as a way to prevent courts from exercising their discretion in sentencing matters,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5, such a concern is appropriately presented to Congress rather than to federal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">2. <em>Due Process Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Vargas\u2019s due process challenge similarly fails. Like Vargas, the defendant in <em>United States v. Huerta </em>raised a due process challenge to mandatory m\u00ednimums, arguing that \u201c[sjection 3553(e) violates due process by allowing prosecutors unlimited and unreviewable discretion in deciding whether to make substantial assistance motions and by curtailing a judge\u2019s ability to consider evidence of cooperation.\u201d 878 F.2d at 93. <em>Huerta </em>rejected this argument, along with the separation of powers challenge, because it \u201crest[ed] on the faulty premise that judicial sentencing discretion cannot be validly circumscribed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94. \u201c[TJhere is no right to individualized sentencing, and Congress may constitutionally prescribe mandatory sentences or otherwise constrain the exercise of judicial discretion so long as such constraints have a rational basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Vargas has not presented any facts or arguments that would permit this panel to reconsider this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Because we reject Vargas\u2019s sentencing challenge as without merit, the district court\u2019s August 5, 2005 judgment of conviction is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
