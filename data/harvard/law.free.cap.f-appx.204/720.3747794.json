We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s determination of eligibility for asylum. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have jurisdietion under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-14\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Kumar has not established eligibility for asylum is supported by substantial evidence, in that Kumar did not show that he or his family were or would be targeted on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Kumar testified that his father was assaulted and threatened because of his factual reporting on \u201ccriminal elements\u201d in their village, and the record does not compel the conclusion that the assailants were motivated, even in part, by political or religious animosity. <em>Cf. Zayas-Marini v. INS, </em>785 F.2d 801, 806 (9th Cir.1986) (finding no nexus to a protected ground where applicant had previously accused his attackers of embezzlement and engaged one in a fistfight).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-15\">As Kumar is not eligible for asylum, it necessarily follows he is ineligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">Kumar is not entitled to protection under CAT because the IJ\u2019s determination that Kumar had not shown it was more likely than not he would be tortured upon returning to Gujarat was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 CFR \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
