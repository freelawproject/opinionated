Henderson was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment. He appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), in determining, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was responsible for more than fifty grams of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>crack for sentencing purposes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Henderson incorrectly maintains that, following <em>Booker, </em>facts that increase the offense level must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>specifically rejected this approach. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 246, 125 S.Ct. 738. After <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing court continues to make factual findings concerning sentencing factors by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United, States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.) (remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>ensures that determination of sentencing factors will continue to be made by sentencing judge by preponderance of evidence) (internal quotation and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006) (No. 05-11378). In imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The sentence must be within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Although Henderson acknowledges that the district court treated the guidelines as advisory, he argues that the court effectively treated them as mandatory because it did not make a detailed analysis of the factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). This argument is without merit. The court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> Henderson states in his brief that application of the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>constituted a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. He provides no argument or support for this claim. To the extent the issue is properly raised at all, it is without merit. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>444 F.3d 250, 253-54 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>July 10, 2006 (No. 06-5152).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
