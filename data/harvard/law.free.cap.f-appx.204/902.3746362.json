R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b930-22\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed June 30, 2005 and November 2, 2005 be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that appellant Mwabira-Simera\u2019s claims against Sodexho Marriot Management Services and its employees were barred by a settlement agreement. <em>Cf. Francis v. Rodman Local Union 201 Pension Fund, </em>367 F.3d 937, 940-41 (D.C.Cir.2004) (holding that claim against pension fund barred by individual settlement agreement); <em>Saksenasingh v. Sec\u2019y of Educ., </em>126 F.3d 347, 350 (D.C.Cir.1997) (recognizing that if settlement agreement is not breached, it bars claim). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing appellant Simera-Nandala\u2019s claims pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37. <em>See Founding Church of Scientology of Washington, D.C. v. Webster, </em>802 F.2d 1448, 1457-59 (D.C.Cir.1986). The district court also did not abuse its discretion by declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the pendent state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Shekoyan v. Sibley Intern., </em>409 F.3d 414, 423-24 (D.C.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-23\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en bane. See Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
