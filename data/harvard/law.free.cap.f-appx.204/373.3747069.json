We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Michael Needleman died in a bathtub, shot in the chest with a .357 Magnum revolver. His wife witnessed the suicide, having discovered him in the bathroom, armed, redfaced, and crying. When she entered, he told her, \u201cI wanted to do this before you got home.\u201d After 45 minutes, with his wife by his side, he pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The district court ruled that John Hancock had proved the affirmative defense of suicide as a matter of law, pretermitting a scheduled bench trial. Plaintiffs speculate that Needleman might have slipped in the bathtub, accidentally discharging his weapon. In support, Needleman\u2019s son submits in an affidavit that the .357 Magnum has a hair trigger. There was a witnesses to the suicide, however. And Mrs. Needleman\u2019s deposition testimony does not support the plaintiffs account. Mrs. Needleman was asked, \u201cAnd what facts to you have to suggest that his elbow slipped?\u201d She responded, \u201cI do not have any facts.\u201d When pressed further, she reiterated, \u201cI know of no facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">Plaintiffs next argue that it would have been irrational for Needleman, a man who was wildly successful in business and in life, to have committed suicide. They offer mountains of evidence that Needleman loved his family and that they loved him. This evidence makes the case much sadder, but not closer.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
