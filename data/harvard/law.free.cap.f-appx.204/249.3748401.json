The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal on the basis of a waiver of appellate rights contained in its plea agreement with Smith. Smith\u2019s brief has been filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and counsel for Smith asserts that if the waiver is found to be unenforceable, the sentence is unreasonable. Although advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Smith has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-25\">Addressing the Government\u2019s motion first, this court\u2019s interpretation of Smith\u2019s plea agreement is guided by contract law. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(4th Cir.1997). The waiver provision in Smith\u2019s plea agreement precludes a challenge to Smith\u2019s sentence, but does not bar a challenge to his conviction on direct appeal. We conclude the waiver is enforceable to the extent Smith seeks to challenge his sentence. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion as it applies to Smith\u2019s appeal of his sentence and deny the motion as it applies to our review of Smith\u2019s conviction under <em>Anders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Turning to Smith\u2019s conviction, we have reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Anders </em>and find no error. The district court fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in conducting Smith\u2019s plea hearing, and we discern no basis for concluding that Smith\u2019s guilty plea was involuntary or unknowing. Finding no meritorious issues, we affirm Smith\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
