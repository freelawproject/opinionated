Although Hazel alternatively sought, and received, transfer of his \u00a7 2241 petition from the District of Kansas, his place of confinement, to the Eastern District of Virginia, the sentencing court, Hazel states that he intended to file a \u00a7 2241 petition raising a challenge to the manner in which his sentence was calculated. Judicial review of a \u00a7 2241 petition must be sought in the district of confinement rather than the sentencing court. <em>In re: Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000). In cases such as this one, where relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 is sought in the sentencing court, the court is without jurisdiction to consider the request. On this basis, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hazel\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
