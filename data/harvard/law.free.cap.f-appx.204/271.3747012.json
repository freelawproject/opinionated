(\u201cMCI\u201d) filed this lawsuit against Paetec Communications, Inc. (\u201cPaetec\u201d) to recover telecommunications access charges that it paid for a period of time, but later chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>lenged as unsupported by tariff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. Specifically, MCI alleges that Paetec unlawfully charged it for routing toll-free calls from third-party wireless carriers to MCI\u2019s network when that service was not within the Paetec tariffs, either federal or state, to which MCI subscribed. MCI paid the charges initially because Paetec\u2019s invoices did not separately state them. When the charges were disaggregated and MCI became aware of them, it withheld payment of two monthly invoices from Paetec in an effort to recoup its funds and subsequently brought this action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In its answer, Paetec raised as an affirmative defense a provision from its tariffs requiring 90-days notice of a billing dispute and also asserted counterclaims, both statutory and equitable, to recover the balances of the two invoices that MCI refused to pay. Paetec then filed a motion for partial summary judgment based on the 90-day notice provision. The district court denied the motion concluding that a party could not use a tariff to shorten unilaterally the two-year statute of limitations for tariff overcharges under the Federal Communications Act. <em>MCI WorldCom Network </em>Servs., <em>Inc. v. Paetec Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>No. 04-1479, at 2-3 (E.D.Va. May 16, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Both parties then moved for summary judgment on the merits. The district court granted MCI\u2019s motion and denied Paetec\u2019s cross-motion. <em>MCI WorldCom Network Servs, Inc. v. Paetec Commc\u2019n, Inc., </em>No. 04-1479, 2005 WL 2145499 (E.D.Va. Aug. 31, 2005). In granting MCI\u2019s motion, the district court rejected Paetec\u2019s argument that its access tariffs included the service of transmitting to MCI interstate toll-free calls made by end-users of other telecommunications carriers for two reasons. First, under the circumstances presented, MCI was not a \u201ccustomer\u201d of Paetec with respect to the service in question. <em>Id. </em>at 7-9. Second, even if MCI could be considered a customer, the court concluded that the service Paetec performed for MCI was not within its tariffs. <em>Id. </em>at 9-11. In denying Paetec\u2019s cross-motion, the district court held that the filed rate doctrine<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> precluded equitable counterclaims and that MCI acted lawfully in withholding payment on the two invoices as an offset for the disputed charges. <em>Id. </em>at 11-13. Paetec now appeals the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, and having had the benefit of oral argument, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to MCI and the denials of summary judgment to Paetec on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See MCI WorldCom Network Servs, Inc. v. Paetec Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>No. 04-1479, 2005 WL 2145499 (E.D.Va. Aug. 31, 2005); <em>Paetec Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>No. 04-1479 (E.D.Va.
