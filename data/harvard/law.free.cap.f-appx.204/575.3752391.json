At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found Larkins was a career offender based in part on two prior drug offenses, and it denied an U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 downward departure, finding Larkins\u2019s career-offender status did not significantly overrepresent his criminal history. The court sentenced Larkins to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Larkins maintains his sentence is unreasonable, arguing his criminal history is overstated and the court failed to consider, and explain its application of, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">We reject these arguments. First, the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward from an alleged overstated criminal history cannot be reviewed. <em>See United States v. Morell, </em>429 F.3d 1161, 1164 (8th Cir.2005). Second, the court adequately addressed the sentencing factors, particularly Larkins\u2019s criminal history, the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the instant offense and to protect the public, and potential sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2); <em>United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005). Finally, the sentence-which was within the applicable Guidelines range-is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Tobacco, </em>428 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 840, 163 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-19\">.
