The district court sentenced Cockrell as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000), which carries a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. Cockrell received the minimum 180 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">On appeal, Cockrell\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there exist no meritorious issues for appeal but contending that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because Cockrell has been rehabilitated, and no further punishment is necessary.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, as noted by both the district court and Cockrell\u2019s counsel, the term of imprisonment imposed in this case is the mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Because the district court could not have given a lower sentence under the terms of the statute, the sentence is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Cockrell\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> Although notified of her right to do so, Cockrell has not submitted a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
