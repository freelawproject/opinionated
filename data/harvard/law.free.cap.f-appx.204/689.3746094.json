We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-24\">The BIA found Shao not credible based upon inconsistent statements regarding the circumstances of his alleged release from detention, his knowledge of his mother-in-law\u2019s arrest, and the year in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>the events he alleged precipitated his departure from China occurred. These inconsistencies go to the heart of his claim and support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Because there was adequate reason to question Shao\u2019s credibility, the BIA properly considered Shao\u2019s lack of persuasive corroborative evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1044. Accordingly, Shao faded to establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Because Shao\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony that the BIA found to be not credible, and because he points to no other evidence that the BIA failed to consider, he failed to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
