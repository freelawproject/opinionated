Smith argues that the district court improperly construed his suit and erred by rejecting his myriad claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">Smith contends that the district court misconstrued his filings and erred by dismissing his retaliation claims. Our review of the record reveals no such error. The district court\u2019s construction of Smith\u2019s claims is based on a reasonable reading of his voluminous pleadings. Further, the district court did not err by dismissing Smith\u2019s retaliation claims. Smith failed to allege facts from which retaliation could plausibly be inferred, and most of the adverse acts of which he complains are de minimis. <em>See Morris v. Powell, </em>449 F.3d 682, 684-86 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-26 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). Smith has shown no error in connection with the district court\u2019s dismissal of his retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">Smith likewise has shown no error concerning the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Equal Protection claim because his allegations concerning this claim do not show that the alleged improper acts that form the basis for his suit were motivated by racial animus. <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 473 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Coleman v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>113 F.3d 528, 533 (5th Cir.1997). Smith\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim that he was denied access to courts fails because he has not demonstrated prejudice in connection with the defendants\u2019 actions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number><em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.1998). To the extent Smith requests that state law claims concerning \u201cemotional and mental anguish\u201d be allowed to proceed, he asserted no such claims in his complaint, nor does he allege that the district court erred by failing to consider such claims. Moreover, Smith does not reference such claims again in his brief, and they are appropriately deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Beaumont, </em>972 F.2d 553, 563 (5th Cir.1992) (\u201cFailure of an appellant to properly argue or present issues in an appellate brief renders those issues abandoned.\u201d). The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s suit counts as a strike under the three-strikes provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Additionally, Smith garnered at least two other strikes when prior suits were dismissed. <em>See Smith v. Pollunsky, </em>No. C-99-501 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 16, 2000), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 00-40362 (5th Cir. Sept. 5, 2000); <em>Smith v. Barrios, </em>No. C-98-101 (S.D.Tex. Aug. 3, 1998), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>No. 98-41090 (5th Cir.98-41090); <em>see also Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 464 (5th Cir.1998). Because Smith has at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba, </em>103 F.3d at 388; \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">AFFIRMED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
