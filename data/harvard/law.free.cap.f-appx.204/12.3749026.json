Mobley petitions this court for review of the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing his Board appeal based upon the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>Docket No. PH-0752-05-0551-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 1, 2005) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d); Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>101 M.S.P.R. 200 (2006) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b41-19\">Mobley\u2019s petition has its origins in events that occurred sixteen years ago and that have already been the subject of several Board proceedings and one opinion of this court. In September of 1990, the United States Postal Service issued Mobley a Notice of Proposed Adverse Action charging him with multiple incidents of sexual harassment and proposing to remove him from his employment. [RA at 83] The notice advised that Mobley would be able \u201cto review the material relied on to support the reasons\u201d for the proposed removal at the Postal Service\u2019s Labor Relations Office, and gave Mobley 10 calendar days in which to respond. [RA at 85] On October 24, 1990, the Postal Service issued its Letter of Decision terminating Mobley\u2019s employment. Mobley timely appealed his removal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-20\">Less than a month later, however, the Postal Service notified Mobley that the Letter of Decision was being \u201crescinded,\u201d in order to afford Mobley \u201can additional opportunity to respond to the charges.\u201d [RA at 86] Mobley was retroactively reinstated to his original pay grade, but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>not returned to his position of postmaster; instead, he was returned to administrative leave status. [RA at 86]</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Following rescission of the removal, the Postal Service moved to dismiss Mobley\u2019s Board action as moot. On November 30, 1990, the administrative law judge issued an order to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed as moot. Mobley, through counsel, argued that the agency\u2019s rescission of the removal order was little more than an attempt to \u201cclean up\u201d a removal that was plagued with significant irregularities. He also pointed out that the removal, \u201ceven if technically rescinded at present, is ... nevertheless imminent,\u201d since the agency continued to actively pursue the charges against Mobley, and that dismissing the pending appeal would simply require that another, essentially identical appeal be filed shortly thereafter. [RA at 89] Mobley did not argue that the agency\u2019s \u201crescission\u201d was incomplete and therefore inadequate to moot the appeal. [RA at 87-90; RA at 82]</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The administrative law judge dismissed Mobley\u2019s appeal as moot, noting that \u201cthe agency has furnished evidence that it restored the appellant to the status quo ante by canceling the removal action and retroactively restoring him to a pay status.\u201d <em>Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>Docket No. DC7529110081 (M.S.P.B. Dec. 24, 1990). That decision became final on January 28, 1991. There is no indication in the record that Mobley filed a petition for review of the initial decision by the full Board or for review of the final order by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Following dismissal of the initial Board appeal, the Postal Service proceeded with its removal action against Mobley. A second Letter of Decision was issued on February 20, 1991. [RA at 93] This time, the Postal Service elected to \u201cexercise leniency\u201d and reduced Mobley\u2019s penalty to demotion and reassignment to a non-supervisory position. [RA at 93] Mobley again appealed to the Board, which held a hearing on May 7, 1991. During that hearing, the parties reached an oral settlement agreement, which was subsequently reduced to writing and entered into the record. On May 28, 1991, the administrative law judge issued an initial decision dismissing Mobley\u2019s appeal as settled. The initial decision became final on July 2, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">On October 24, 1991, however, Mobley filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement. The administrative law judge denied the petition in an initial decision issued on January 30, 1992, and the full Board denied Mobley\u2019s petition for review in an order dated May 8, 1992, rendering the initial decision final on that date. <em>Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>53 M.S.P.R. 680 (1992) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">On July 7, 1992, Mobley filed a document styled \u201cREQUEST AND MOTION FOR JOINDER OF THE APPEALS, TO REOPEN, RECONSIDER AND RESTATE APPEALS, AND TO SET ASIDE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.\u201d <em>Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>55 M.S.P.R. 467, 470 (1992). The Clerk of the Board notified him that, \u201cto the extent that he was filing a petition for review of the removal and demotion appeals, his petition appeared to be untimely filed,\u201d and directed him to submit an affidavit showing either that the petition was timely or that good cause existed for the delay. <em>Id. </em>Mobley\u2019s affidavit asserted that the Postal Service obtained the settlement agreement of his demotion appeal by fraud, and that Mobley could not have known of the fraud until after the filing period for his petition had passed. <em>Id. </em>He therefore requested that the settlement agreement be set aside and both his appeals reinstated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The Board concluded that the petition for review was untimely as to both deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>sions and that Mobley had failed to demonstrate good cause for the untimeliness. <em>Id. </em>at 471-72. With respect to Mobley\u2019s original appeal, the Board held, the alleged fraud occurred more than four months after the decision became final, and therefore was irrelevant to that decision. As for the second appeal \u2014 the appeal that was dismissed after the settlement agreement was reached \u2014 Mobley argued that the Postal Service acted fraudulently by encouraging his former co-workers \u201cto pursue actions against him in civil and criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472. The Board rejected Mobley\u2019s position, pointing out that Mobley knew or should have known of the government\u2019s assistance to his former employees\u2019 state-court actions a full year before he filed his petition for review. The Board concluded that in, light of that knowledge, Mobley could not demonstrate good cause for his untimely filing. Finally, the Board refused to set aside the settlement agreement, concluding that by its terms the agreement did not prevent agency personnel from assisting Mobley\u2019s accusers in their legal actions against him. <em>Id. </em>at 474. The Board therefore dismissed Mobley\u2019s petition as untimely. Mobley appealed to this court, which affirmed without opinion. <em>Mobley v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>6 F.3d 787 (Fed.Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On August 3, 2005 \u2014 fifteen years after the underlying events \u2014 Mobley filed another appeal to the Board challenging the original removal action. He argued that because the Postal Service\u2019s \u201crescission\u201d of its original removal notice did not restore him to his postmaster position, it did not return him to the status quo ante, and therefore, under longstanding principles of law, was insufficient to moot his appeal. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 2. The administrative law judge dismissed the appeal in a brief opinion on the basis of collateral estoppel, holding that \u201c[t]he issue of mootness was raised and decided in the 1990 appeal\u201d and noting that the new appeal would be barred even if the \u201cthe prior decision was reached through an erroneous application of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Mobley petitioned for review by the full Board, which denied review in a final order filed on February 6, 2005. <em>Final Order </em>at 2. Mobley then filed a petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a Board decision is limited. This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>see Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>29 F.3d 1578, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1994). Questions involving \u201c[t]imeliness of petition for review and extension for good cause are matters committed to the board\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd., </em>748 F.2d 681, 683 (Fed.Cir.1984). This court will disturb the Board\u2019s judgment about such questions only upon a showing that the Board has abused that discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">The precise scope and nature of Mobley\u2019s assignments of error are unclear, but his submissions focus primarily upon two issues: whether the Board properly dismissed his initial appeal as moot, and whether the Postal Service\u2019s disciplinary actions violated Mobley\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Board\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The issue of mootness was expressly raised and considered by the Board in its 1990 proceeding. This court has recently noted that \u201c[l]ike other tribunals, the Board may apply collateral estoppel where: (i) the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented in the pri- or action.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>424 F.3d 1271, 1274 (Fed.Cir.2005) (citations omitted). There is no question that all four of these factors are present in Mobley\u2019s case, and Mobley does not seriously dispute that they are. He directs his argument, instead, to the merits of the mootness issue, pointing out that he was \u201cnever returned to duty status\u201d and thus not to the \u201cstatus quo ante\u201d necessary to render his appeal moot under numerous Board precedents. <em>See, e.g., Henry v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>100 M.S.P.R. 399, 402 (2005) (noting that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s unilateral modification of its adverse action after an appeal has been filed does not divest the Board of jurisdiction unless\u201d the appellant is returned to the status quo ante); <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>96 M.S.P.R. 193, 196 (2004) (stating that \u201creturn to the status quo ante requires return, with back pay, to a position of the same grade, pay, status, and tenure as the one occupied before the agency\u2019s action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Whatever the merits of Mobley\u2019s arguments on mootness, however, he makes them too late. The administrative law judge\u2019s initial decision mooting the case was appealable to the full Board, and the Board\u2019s final decision could have been appealed to this court. Mobley chose not to pursue either avenue of redress, and the time for doing so has long since passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The same is true of Mobley\u2019s constitutional due process arguments. Constitutional claims, like other claims, are subject to applicable time limitations. <em>See, e.g., DuMarce v. Scarlett, </em>446 F.3d 1294 (Fed.Cir.2006) (dismissing Fifth Amendment taking claim as untimely). Here, Mobley appears to argue that the actions of the Postal Service beginning in late 1990 violated due process because he was denied \u201ca letter of charges,\u201d an opportunity to review the evidence, and an opportunity to respond. Even if Mobley\u2019s argument were supported by the evidence of record \u2014 and it is not \u2014 his opportunity to challenge the process afforded him in the years 1990-1992 expired with the applicable filing periods, all of which passed more than a decade ago. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v. Marsh, </em>807 F.2d 988, 992 (Fed.Cir.1986) (noting that a claimant\u2019s due process claim would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">As the Supreme Court noted long ago, \u201cThere must be an end of litigation some time.\u201d <em>Corning v. Troy Iron &amp; Nail Factory, </em>56 U.S.(15 How.) 451, 466, 14 L.Ed. 768 (1853). The time has come for this litigation, now sixteen years in the making, to come its overdue end.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">We affirm the judgment of the Board. Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
