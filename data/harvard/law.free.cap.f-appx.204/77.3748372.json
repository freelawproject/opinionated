Reid on December 11, 2001. <em>In re Montague-</em>Griffith, No. A36 966 256 (Immig. Ct. Batavia Dec. 11, 2001). In support of his habeas petition, Montague-Griffith argued that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel during the Immigration Court proceedings. In March 2004, the District Court (John T. Elfvin, Judge) dismissed the petition without prejudice, and granted Petitioner sixty days to file an amended petition and supporting affidavit in accordance with <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Dec. 637, 1988 WL 235454 (B.I.A.1988). <em>Montague-Griffith v. Holmes, </em>02-CV-0509E(Sc), 2004 WL 626799 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 24, 2004). After Montague-Griffith filed an amended petition, the government moved to dismiss it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. While that motion was still pending, the REAL ID Act went into effect, and the case was transferred to this Court. <em>See </em>REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(c), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005) (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural context, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The REAL ID Act \u201celiminates habeas corpus review of orders of removal and requires that any \u00a7 2241 petition pending in the district court at the time of its enactment be transferred to the court of appeals in which the petition could have been properly brought as a petition for review from a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.\u201d <em>Marquez-Almanzar v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 210, 212 (2d Cir.2005). The Act provides that a transferred case is to be treated \u201cas if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review\u201d under \u00a7 1252. REAL ID Act \u00a7 106(c); <em>Gittens v. Menifee, </em>428 F.3d 382, 384-85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 151 n. 3 (2d Cir.2006) (observing that a primary effect of the REAL ID ACT \u201cis to convert habeas corpus petitions filed by criminal aliens seeking review of their removal orders into petitions for review in order to \u2018to limit all aliens to one bite of the apple .... [and thereby] streamline what the Congress saw as uncertain and piecemeal review of orders of removal, divided between the district courts (habeas corpus) and the courts of appeals (petitions for review)).\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 446 (3d Cir.2005)). We must therefore construe Montague-Griffith\u2019s case as a petition for review of the IJ\u2019s December 11, 2001 order, and must decide the petition without considering the District Court\u2019s intervening ruling or any materials outside the administrative record. <em>Marquez-Almanzar, </em>418 F.3d at 212; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\u201c[T]he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2347(a) (\u201c[P]etitions to review orders renewable under this chapter are heard in the court of appeals on the record of the pleadings, evidence adduced, and proceedings before the agency....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Montague-Griffith was ordered removed from this country on account of his convictions for the sale and possession of a controlled substance. Under the REAL ID Act, we lack jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed [certain drug and aggravated felony] criminal offensefs],\u201d except insofar as review entails \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); <em>see Xiao Ji Chen, </em>434 F.3d at 151. Here, the issue presented is one of ineffective assistance of counsel. While there is no specific right to counsel in a removal proceeding, an alien does enjoy a general right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. <em>Jian Yun Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2005). An alien\u2019s due process right is violated when the counsel\u2019s performance is so ineffective that it \u201c\u2018impinge[s] upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing.\u2019\u201d <em>Rabiu v. INS, </em>41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Saleh v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>962 F.2d 234, 241 (2d Cir.1992)). To show a deprivation of fundamental fairness, an alien \u201cmust allege facts sufficient to show (1) \u2018that competent counsel would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>have acted otherwise,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that [the alien] was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u201c[W]here an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel implicates issues of constitutional significance, the BIA lacks \u2018jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue.\u2019\u201d <em>Jian Yun Zheng, </em>409 F.3d at 46 (quoting <em>Rabiu, </em>41 F.3d at 882). For prudential reasons, however, this Court generally requires that ineffectiveness claims be presented to the BIA in the first instance, either on direct appeal or through a motion to reopen. <em>Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 614 (2d Cir.1994) (prudential exhaustion requirement \u201cavoid[s] any premature interference with the agency\u2019s processes\u201d and \u201cafford[s] the parties and courts the benefit of the agency\u2019s expertise\u201d). An alien must substantially comply with the <em>Lozada </em>requirements before the BIA to preserve his right to judicial review. <em>Jian Yun Zheng, </em>409 F.3d at 47-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Because Montague-Griffith has never presented his ineffectiveness claim to the BIA,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we decline to reach the merits of the claim at this time. To properly raise this issue, Petitioner must first file a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23; <em>see Iavorski v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 124, 134-35 (2d Cir.2000). If the motion is denied, and the BIA affirms that decision, Montague-Griffith may petition for review of that denial to this Court. <em>See Arango-Aradondo, </em>13 F.3d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">. As we need not decide the issue, we intimate no view as to whether an alien enjoys a due process right to effective assistance of counsel in a proceeding for discretionary relief. <em>Cf. Nativi-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 805, 808-09 (8th Cir.2003) (discussing <em>Rabiu </em>and confining its application to removal proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b108-18\">. We note that prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, an alien\u2019s failure to perfect an appeal on direct review did not bar a subsequent collateral attack by habeas petition. <em>See, e.g., Evangelista v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 145 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Luya Liu v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 36 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
