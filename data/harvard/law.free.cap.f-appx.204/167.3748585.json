He was sentenced to death for each murder conviction and to seventy-eight and one-half years\u2019 imprisonment for the other convictions. Lynch has petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 on the grounds that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated (1) when the prosecutor made inflammatory comments during closing argument in the guilt phase of his trial and (2) when the jury foreperson read from the Bible during the penalty phase. The district court denied his petition, and we affirm. The state courts did not make an unreasonable determination of either claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Moreover, we have concluded independently that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments at closing did not render Lynch\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">David Lynch was arrested after he killed two persons and wounded several others in an extended shooting spree in Gaston County, North Carolina. He confessed to his crimes, including the two murders. The following facts are not in dispute. On December 9, 1991, Lynch got out his .223-caliber rifle, .308-caliber rifle, .45-caliber automatic pistol, and 1,250 rounds of ammunition and placed them next to his bedroom window. He lined his bedroom walls with mattresses, pushed the refrigerator against the front door, and wedged the kitchen stove and washing machine against the back door. He then \u201cnailed all the windows shut that [he] knew [he] would not be shooting from.\u201d Trial Transcript (T.T.), May 13, 1993, at 726 (Lynch\u2019s statement to the police). After completing these fortifications, Lynch re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>turned to the bedroom, sat down in the middle of the floor, and \u201cwaited for [his neighbors] the Andersons to come out.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">At 8:00 a.m. Tammy Anderson left her house with her twelve-year-old daughter, India, and Heather Shumate, the daughter of a friend. Lynch attempted to open fire, but his rifle jammed. By the time he reloaded, Mrs. Anderson and the two girls had entered the family car. Lynch decided to shoot at the car, hoping the occupants would \u201cget out and see what happened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>His scheme worked, and he opened fire on the three as they left the car. Lynch said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">I shot Mrs. Anderson first, and then I shot [India]. I don\u2019t know how many times I shot them; but after I shot the mother a couple of times, the daughter started running to the house. So I shot the mother a couple more times, and then I shot the daughter at least two or three times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\"><em>Id. </em>A neighbor, Ronald Hunter Sr., heard the shooting and rushed outside to try to help the victims. Lynch immediately shot Hunter in the back and then continued to shoot him after he fell to the ground. Mrs. Anderson and Heather fled back into the Anderson house, where Mrs. Anderson called 911. While Mrs. Anderson was on the telephone, Lynch fired into the house, killing Bobby Anderson, the father. Meanwhile, the wounded Mr. Hunter made it out into the street where India lay and attempted to pull her to safety. Lynch fired at the two, hitting them both. Mr. Hunter collapsed, losing consciousness. India\u2019s wounds were fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Police officers soon arrived at the scene, and Lynch began firing on them, injuring several. A police crisis negotiator, Sergeant James Edwards, was called in to talk with Lynch. Edwards reached Lynch by telephone, and Lynch said he was suffering from mental problems. Lynch also explained that he wanted to Mil the Andersons because they played loud music and had parties. After two and one-half hours, Lynch surrendered. At the station Lynch told police that he was very depressed and had recently driven to Seattle to commit suicide. He then decided that instead of killing himself, he would kill the people who had been bothering him. Lynch admitted that he knew what he had done was wrong, but said \u201cthey needed to die.\u201d J.A. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Lynch asserted the defense of insanity at trial. Two defense experts (a psychologist and a psychiatrist) testified that Lynch suffered from mental diseases, including major depression and schizotypal personality disorder, which caused him to lose touch with reality. Both experts offered the opinion that Lynch could not understand the nature and quality of his acts on the day of the murders. The prosecution responded with an expert psychiatrist who testified that he did not detect any evidence of psychosis during his examination of Lynch. This expert did not opine on Lynch\u2019s mental state on the day of the shootings. The prosecution also presented the testimony of several of Lynch\u2019s coworkers and friends, who all testified that Lynch did not appear to be insane during the weeks leading up to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">The jury determined that Lynch was not legally insane at the time of the murders and found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and twenty-one counts charging lesser offenses. The jury recommended the death penalty for each murder, and the trial court sentenced Lynch to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Lynch\u2019s convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of certiorari. Next, Lynch\u2019s (post-conviction) motion for appropriate relief (MAR) was denied by the North Carolina trial court, and the State Supreme Court denied review of the MAR claims. Lynch\u2019s application for federal habeas relief was likewise denied by the U.S. district court, and two of his claims are now before us pursuant to certificates of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Lynch first contends that the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial remarks during closing argument rendered his trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. Second, he contends that the foreperson\u2019s reading of a biblical passage during the jury\u2019s sentencing deliberations violated his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The North Carolina courts decided these claims on the merits, and under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act we review these decisions under a \u201chighly deferential standard.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 24, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002). Accordingly, a writ of habeas corpus cannot be granted unless the state court decisions \u201cw[ere] contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or \u201cw[ere] based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). \u201c[W]e presume the [state] court\u2019s factual findings to be sound unless [the petitioner] rebuts the \u2018presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller-El v. Dretke, </em>545 U.S. 231, 125 S.Ct. 2317, 2325, 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)). If legal or factual error of the degree specified in \u00a7 2254(d)(1) or (d)(2) occurred, then a federal court has the obligation to conduct an independent review of the petitioner\u2019s claims to determine whether the issuance of a writ is warranted. <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 690 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Lynch argues that the prosecutor\u2019s inflammatory and prejudicial remarks during closing argument rendered his trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. In rebuttal argument the prosecutor said that if the jury found Lynch not guilty by reason of insanity, there would be \u201cno restrictions\u201d upon him. Lynch claims that the jury was never instructed to disregard the statement, even though it was contrary to North Carolina law. (If the jury had found Lynch to be insane, he would have been committed immediately to a mental health institution, and he could have been released only by proving in court that he was no longer mentally ill or a danger to others. <em>See </em>N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 15A-1321, 122C-277(b1), 122C-268.1(i).) According to Lynch, the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cno restrictions\u201d statement created a misguided fear on the part of the jury that led it to disregard compelling evidence of his insanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The North Carolina Supreme Court rejected Lynch\u2019s unfair trial claim, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">We conclude that in this case the trial court properly controlled the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument so as to avoid any prejudicial error to the defendant. During the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments the trial court intervened ex mero motu and specifically instructed the jury not to take the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinions into consideration. The jurors were also instructed to disregard statements by the prosecutor that defendant would be under no restrictions if found not guilty .... Based on our careful review of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ment and the instructions given by the trial court during the closing argument, defendant\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><em>State v. Lynch, </em>340 N.C. 435, 459 S.E.2d 679, 692 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">According to Lynch, the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on the court\u2019s unreasonable factual determination that Lynch\u2019s \u201cjurors were ... instructed to disregard statements by the prosecutor that [Lynch] would be under no restrictions if found not guilty\u201d by reason of insanity. <em>Id. </em>Lynch says that the following excerpt from the closing argument transcript reveals the state court\u2019s error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: Ladies and gentlemen, the last point I am going to make. Think about this. Are you satisfied that he was insane on December 9, 1991.[sic] The state submits to you that you are not. If you are even thinking about it, remember this. Not guilty by reason of insanity is not guilty. Oh, it has a little bit more wording there but the effect is not guilty. When you say not guilty you are saying that no crime was committed. You are saying David Lynch\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Interrupting) \u2014 OBJECTION to that argument</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">THE COURT: OVERRULED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: You are saying David Lynch didn\u2019t kill and assault. Are you satisfied? When you say not guilty that means there are no restrictions on Mr. Lynch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: OBJECTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">THE COURT: SUSTAINED. Well, OVERRULED as to that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">[PROSECUTOR]: No restrictions. Perhaps some day he becomes your neighbor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: (Interrupting) \u2014 OB JE CTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-17\">THE COURT: SUSTAINED. Stay within the bounds of argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-18\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard the last statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-19\">THE COURT: ALLOWED. Members of the jury, do not take the last statement of the district attorney in consideration in your jury deliberations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-20\">Closing Argument Transcript at 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-21\">Lynch argues that in light of the trial court\u2019s initial approval of the \u201cno restrictions\u201d statement, the court\u2019s instruction to the jury moments later to disregard \u201cthe last statement\u201d referred only to the \u201cyour neighbor\u201d sentence. It did not, he says, refer to the \u201cNo restrictions\u201d sentence. This reading is a plausible one, but it is not the only reasonable reading. The word \u201cstatement\u201d commonly refers to more than one sentence. Thus, it was not unreasonable for the North Carolina Supreme Court to find that when the trial court used the term \u201clast statement,\u201d it was instructing the jury to disregard <em>all </em>of what the prosecutor had just said, specifically, \u201cNo restrictions. Perhaps some day he becomes your neighbor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-22\">In any event, a final curative instruction made it reasonable for the North Carolina Supreme Court to find that the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cno restrictions\u201d argument. Defense counsel made his request for this instruction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-23\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I am requesting that you instruct the jury that if they return verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity that \u201cThe defendant shall immediately be committed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>state mental facility; any further proceedings would be a matter for the Court and should not concern you.\u201d ... We are simply requesting that [instruction] because of the comments of the state district attorney during the final argument that words to the effect of\u2014 \u201cIf you find him not guilty by reason of insanity <em>there would be no restrictions on the defendant,\u201d </em>which we OBJECTED to and made a motion for a mistrial. Of course, the objection was overruled and the motion for mistrial was denied. We feel that this is sufficient to tell the jury a correct statement of the law ... to counter that statement by the state that he would be unrestricted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">T.T., May 17, 1993, at 534 (emphasis added). The trial court gave the curative instruction exactly as requested by Lynch\u2019s counsel, who considered the instruction to be sufficient to counter the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cno restrictions\u201d remark. The State Supreme Court therefore did not err in finding that the jury was \u201cinstructed to disregard statements by the prosecutor that [Lynch] would be under no restrictions if found not guilty [by reason of insanity].\u201d <em>Lynch, </em>459 S.E.2d at 692. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument did not render Lynch\u2019s trial to be unfair was not based on an unreasonable determination of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief to Lynch on his unfair trial claim can be affirmed because he has failed to demonstrate that the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on an unreasonable determination of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In the alternative, our independent review of the Fifth Amendment claim reveals that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cno restrictions\u201d comments did not render Lynch\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">In analyzing \u201ca due process claim premised on unfair prosecutorial conduct,\u201d we examine several factors, including \u201cthe nature of the prosecutorial misconduct, the extent of the improper conduct, the issuance of curative instructions from the court, any defense conduct inviting the improper prosecutorial response, and the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Humphries v. Ozmint, </em>397 F.3d 206, 218 (4th Cir.2005) (en banc) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (stating that the relevant question is \u201cwhether the prosecutors\u2019 comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process\u2019 \u201d). These factors are examined in the context of the entire trial, and no one factor is dispositive. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 639, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">The conduct challenged here is the prosecutor\u2019s statements in rebuttal argument that Lynch would be released with \u201cno restrictions\u201d if he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The argument was improper because it was not true and appeared calculated to frighten the jury into believing that an insanity verdict would free Lynch, putting him in a position to attack and kill his next set of neighbors. Unless countered by an appropriate instruction, this fear could influence a juror to overlook evidence of insanity and vote for a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-13\">The two improper \u201cno restrictions\u201d comments were isolated, but they came at the end of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>They were among the last comments the jurors heard from the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The trial court issued curative instructions, during closing argument itself and later in a supplemental charge. The prosecutor made the \u201cno restrictions\u201d comments in quick succession. After the second time, when the prosecutor said, \u201cNo restrictions. Perhaps some day he becomes your neighbor,\u201d the court instructed the jury to disregard the \u201clast statement.\u201d Regardless of whether that instruction was clear enough, the court, <em>at Lynch\u2019s request, </em>gave the jury the following additional instruction immediately before it retired to deliberate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Now, members of the jury, I instruct you in addition to the instruction that I gave to you yesterday as follows. That if you return verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity, the defendant shall immediately be committed to a state mental institution or facility. Any further proceedings would be a matter for the Court and should not concern you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A59\">T.T., May 17, 1993, at 539. Defense counsel said at the time that this instruction would be \u201csufficient to tell the jury a correct statement of the law ... to counter the statement by the state that [Lynch] would be unrestricted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">We see nothing in the record to suggest that defense counsel\u2019s conduct invited the prosecutor to make the improper comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The evidence of Lynch\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. He confessed to the murders. Moreover, the substantial evidence that Lynch understood the nature and quality of his actions on the day of the murders reduces the likelihood that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cno restrictions\u201d comments induced the jury to disregard evidence of Lynch\u2019s insanity. Dr. Clabe Lynn, the State\u2019s expert witness, testified that Lynch was depressed but that he did not show any \u201csigns or symptoms of psychosis or schizophrenia.\u201d J.A. 452. An employer testified that Lynch acted normally at work, and a coworker testified that he did not seem \u201cmentally ill at all.\u201d J.A. 513. Police negotiator Sergeant Edwards testified that Lynch spoke calmly, deliberately, and rationally throughout his three and one-half hour negotiations with the police. The evidence also established that Lynch carefully and deliberately planned the murders. Finally, in his confession Lynch recounted in meticulous detail the events on the day of the murder. His words suggest that he was lucid. Nothing in the confession indicates that he was mentally impaired or that he could not tell the difference between right and wrong. In fact, Lynch stated that he knew what he did was wrong, but that his neighbors \u201cneeded to die.\u201d J.A.831.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">After considering all of these factors, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments during closing argument did not deprive Lynch of a fair trial. The curative instructions sufficiently clarified the consequences of a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict, and there was substantial evidence that Lynch was sane when he committed the murders. Lynch\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-15\">Lynch\u2019s second argument is that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the jury foreperson recited a Bible verse during sentencing deliberations. Lynch asserts that habeas relief is warranted because the state court\u2019s adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tion of this claim was contrary to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The facts underlying this claim are not contested. Jury foreperson Ronald Walker took his own copy of the Bible to the sentencing deliberations. During those deliberations the jury determined that Lynch was eligible for the death penalty. The jury then took a further vote on its recommended sentence, and eleven jurors voted for death. Next, Walker led the jury in prayer. In addition, he told his fellow jurors that he believed in the death penalty because of Genesis, Chapter 9, verse 6, which he read aloud: \u201cWhoever sheddeth a man\u2019s blood by man his blood must be shed.\u201d J.A. 815. The undecided juror, Nellie Fox, said that she understood the passage, but that she did not believe the Old Testament was relevant today. Shortly thereafter, the jury took another vote, and the vote for the death penalty was unanimous. Fox later testified that the foreperson\u2019s biblical reading did not influence her decision to vote for death. The state MAR court determined that Lynch \u201cpresented nothing at the evidentiary hearing which satisfactorily demonstrates that juror Fox changed her vote from life to death as a result of foreman Walker\u2019s reading of Genesis 9:6.\u201d J.A. 818. As a result, the court denied Lynch\u2019s motion for appropriate relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Lynch argues that the MAR court\u2019s adjudication of this claim was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent because the fact that the Bible reading did not cause Fox to change her vote is not a valid basis for rejecting his claim. The Bible reading, Lynch argues, was an extraneous influence on the jury that is presumptively prejudicial. <em>See Remmer v. United States, </em>347 U.S. 227, 229, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). In habeas review, however, we look at the \u201cresult that the state court reached, not \u2018whether [its decision] [was] well reasoned.\u2019 \u201d <em>Robinson v. Polk, </em>438 F.3d 350, 358 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Ozmint, </em>352 F.3d 847, 855 (4th Cir.2003)). Our task is to determine whether the result reached by the state MAR court was \u201ccontrary to ... clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Longstanding considerations, particularly the critical need for \u201cfrankness and freedom of discussion and conference\u201d among jurors, <em>McDonald v. Pless, </em>238 U.S. 264, 268, 35 S.Ct. 783, 59 L.Ed. 1300 (1915), \u201csupport the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive inquiry\u201d by courts, <em>Tanner v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 107, 127, 107 S.Ct. 2739, 97 L.Ed.2d 90 (1987). Thus, the Sixth Amendment does not require judicial examination of all alleged prejudicial influences on a jury. Indeed, the general rule is that juror testimony may not be used to impeach a jury verdict. <em>See id. </em>at 117, 107 S.Ct. 2739. The Supreme Court, however, has carved out a limited exception to this rule for the situation where it is alleged that an external influence affected jury deliberations. <em>Parker v. Gladden, </em>385 U.S. 363, 364-66, 87 S.Ct. 468, 17 L.Ed.2d 420 (1966). This exception with respect to external influences is aimed at ensuring an impartial jury that takes the evidence it considers \u201conly from the witness stand in a public courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 87 S.Ct. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">A distinction is thus made between external and internal influences on jury deliberations. <em>See Robinson, </em>438 F.3d at 361-62. The Supreme Court has not provided a precise test for distinguishing between the two, nor has it determined which category a Bible reading fits into. <em>See id. </em>at 363. The Court, however, has provided some guidance. In determining whether an influence is external or inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>nal, a court should look to the \u201cnature of the [influence],\u201d not to whether it \u201ctook place inside or outside the jury room.\u201d <em>Tanner, </em>483 U.S. at 117, 107 S.Ct. 2739. For example, a radio newscast in the jury room about the case at issue is properly considered an external influence. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 107 S.Ct. 2739. On the other hand, statements made by jurors during deliberations are internal influences. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 107 S.Ct. 2739.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The result in this case is dictated by our decision in <em>Robinson. </em>There, we held that the state court had not unreasonably applied Supreme Court precedent, described above, in determining that a Bible reading during jury deliberations was an internal influence that was not subject to judicial inquiry. We reasoned that \u201creading the Bible [during sentencing deliberations] is analogous to a situation where a juror quotes the Bible from memory, which assuredly would not be considered an improper influence.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>438 F.3d at 365. We also concluded that it was reasonable to determine that the biblical passage did not constitute evidence against the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 363. As a result, we held that the petitioner was not entitled to habeas relief on his claim that he was denied his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 366. Lynch\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim based on the foreperson\u2019s Bible reading fails because Lynch\u2019s case is indistinguishable from <em>Robinson. Robinson, </em>in other words, confirms that the result reached by the state MAR court on Lynch\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim was not contrary to clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court denying David Lynch\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
