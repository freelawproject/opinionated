It was the second such motion Singh filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">In a per curiam order, the BIA denied the motion as numerically barred pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), which allows for only one motion to reopen. In a footnote, the BIA added that even if the motion were interpreted as a motion to reconsider, it nevertheless would be denied because Singh \u201cfailed to specify any error in our previous decision.\u201d <em>In re: Balvir Singh, </em>BIA, A 75 256 403, order dated Dec. 20, 2002, at 1 n. 1.; <em>see also, </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-16\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>Jie Chen v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 76, 77 (2d Cir.2006). In particular, \u201c[wjhere the BIA, based on relevant regulations, determines that the claims asserted in an ambiguous motion are properly construed as either a \u2018motion to reopen\u2019 or a \u2018motion to reconsider,\u2019 the BIA\u2019s conclusion would be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78 n. 5. \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the Board\u2019s decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233-34 (2d Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">Our review is limited to the motion filed on October 21, 2002. The petitioner did not timely appeal the BIA\u2019s underlying decision on the merits of his asylum application or withholding of removal claim, nor did he timely appeal the BIA\u2019s denial of the first motion to reopen. \u2018We are therefore \u2018precluded from passing on the merits of the underlying exclusion proceedings,\u2019 and must confine our review to the denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen these proceedings.\u201d <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">We need not determine whether Singh\u2019s motion was a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider because the BIA properly analyzed the motion under both alternatives. In either case, the BIA adequately explained why the motion failed, and it included citations to the relevant and controlling regulations. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See Chen, </em>436 F.3d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Singh\u2019s petition is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
