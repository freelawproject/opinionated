Though one member of his former political group was killed, it is far from clear that he was killed on account of his political affiliation, much less by government officials or forces the government is unwilling or unable to control. <em>See Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-22\">The dispositive issue on petitioner\u2019s two remaining claims is whether he is eligible for relief in light of his prior sham marriage. By statute, relief is barred where a noncitizen has been a party to any sham marriage in the past, regardless of whether his current marriage is bona fide. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(c). Petitioner was party to such a marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The petitions for review must therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
