Phelps pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846 (2000), one count of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). The district court sentenced Phelps to 262 months in prison. Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Phelps\u2019 sentence was reasonable. Although Phelps was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he has not filed one.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court no longer is bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence post <em>-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the applicable guideline range, as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006). <em>Id. </em>If the sentence imposed is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Phelps\u2019 sentence was within the guideline range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment, as well as the statutory maximum of life in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924. Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3353(a) factors, we find the sentence reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Phelps\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
