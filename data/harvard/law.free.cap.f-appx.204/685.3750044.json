We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the BIA\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-26\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on omissions and inconsistencies going to the heart of Wei\u2019s claim. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination where petitioner knew little about the political party he claimed to belong to and there were significant inconsistencies within his testimony). The BIA concluded that Wei inaccurately described some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the critical fundamentals of Falun Gong. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">As the record does not compel the conclusion that Wei\u2019s testimony was credible, <em>see id., </em>Wei has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, <em>see Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b713-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
