Chase denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jin Xiu Chen, </em>No. A96 257 717 (B.I.A. Jan. 20, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 257 717 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 21, 2004). In its decision, the BIA also denied Chen\u2019s motion to remand. <em>In re Jin Xiu Chen, </em>No. A96 257 717 (B.I.A. Jan. 20, 2006). For the reasons discussed in our published opinion, <em>see Jin Xiu Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>No. 06-0762, 2006 WL \u2014 (2d Cir. Nov. \u2014 , 2006), we remand this case to the BIA for further proceedings. We address here the remaining issues raised in Chen\u2019s petition for review. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness. <em>Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). We will vacate and remand for new findings, however, if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir. 2004). This Court reviews questions of law <em>de novo. See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">We disagree with Chen that the IJ applied the wrong standard when analyzing her claim of future persecution. Chen is correct that an applicant must demonstrate a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of persecution to succeed on an asylum claim. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i)(B). The IJ did state in his decision that Chen \u201chas failed to establish the significant possibility that she would be sterilized for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>three children all born in the United States.\u201d The IJ\u2019s recitation of the eligibility standards for asylum and withholding of removal, however, make clear that he recognized that Chen\u2019s burden for asylum was less stringent than the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for withholding. The IJ\u2019s single reference to a \u201csignificant possibility\u201d of future persecution, when viewed in context, does not indicate that he applied the wrong standard with respect to Chen\u2019s claim of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Chen argues further that the BIA misconstrued the IJ\u2019s decision as having denied her claim for asylum in the exercise of discretion. In denying Chen\u2019s claim for asylum, the IJ explained his reasoning as follows: \u201cFrankly, if [Chen] had met the standard [for establishing future persecution], I guess, we\u2019d then have to go in the exercise of discretion .... [b]ut she will be deemed to have failed to meet the standard before we would even get to the discretionary analysis.\u201d We are uncertain whether the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of asylum (and if so, whether it construed the IJ\u2019s decision properly) or instead denied Chen asylum in the exercise of its own discretion. Because we remand on Chen\u2019s withholding of removal claim, we need not reach this question. On remand, however, the BIA should clarify the nature of its decision regarding Chen\u2019s asylum claim, and, if it determines that Chen should not have been denied asylum on a discretionary basis, it should consider Chen\u2019s asylum claim along with her claim for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Finally, Chen argues that the IJ denied her due process when he failed to consider her claim of a well-founded fear that her third pregnancy would be terminated if she were returned to China. The IJ noted that it was highly unlikely that Chen would have been returned to China during her pregnancy, given that an appeal to the BIA would have significantly delayed her removal from the United States. According to Chen\u2019s brief, moreover, she in fact gave birth in December 2004, more than a year before the BIA issued its decision. We cannot say that the IJ\u2019s presumption that Chen\u2019s third child would be born before she would be returned to China, which thus would moot her claim that the pregnancy would be terminated upon her return, deprived Chen of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d as required for a due process violation in this context. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 144, 155 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Chen does not raise any arguments challenging the denial of her CAT claim, nor does she make any arguments regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand on the basis of the record before the agency at the time. Accordingly, this Court considers these claims waived. <em>See Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED in part, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED in part, and for the reasons discussed in the accompanying published opinion, the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
