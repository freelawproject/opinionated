Scharein, seeks review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) that dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, his appeal regarding his removal from supervisory duties, his disenrollment from the Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP), his 2003-2004 performance appraisal at the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), and the MDA\u2019s denial of a contribution rate increase (CRI). <em>Scharein v. Dep\u2019t of Def., </em>No. AT-0839-05-0650-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 31, 2005) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision </em>\u201d). The Initial Decision became final when the Board declined to review it. <em>Scharein v. Dep\u2019t of Def., </em>No. AT-0839-05-0650-I-1, 101 M.S.P.R. 200 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 22, 2006). We have considered Mr. Scharein\u2019s claims and find them without merit. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b48-13\">The petitioner, Arthur A. Scharein, is a full-time employee of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The MDA is a sub-agency of the Department of Defense (DoD). During the time relevant to this appeal, Mr. Scharein\u2019s position was part of an experimental personnel system called the Acquisition Demonstration Project (AcqDemo). In 1998, Mr. Scharein was selected by the MDA to enter the Defense Leadership and Management Program (DLAMP), a training program established by the DoD. As part of the program, Mr. Scharein attended the Air War College (AWC) for one year. While attending the AWC, Mr. Scharein received an unfavorable academic rating. As a result of the unfavorable academic rating, the Executive Director of the MDA disenrolled Mr. Scharein from DLAMP and returned him to a different position at the MDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-14\">When Mr. Scharein returned to the MDA he received a performance appraisal. Mr. Scharein\u2019s contribution to the MDA was evaluated according to a new Contribution-Based Compensation and Appraisal System (CCAS). Mr. Scharein\u2019s final Overall Contribution Score (OCS) was less than expected. As a result of the low score, Mr. Scharein\u2019s request to be reinstated into DLAMP was denied and he did not receive a Contribution Rate Increase (CRI), however, his pay remained at the same level as the previous year. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Scharein grieved his performance rating according to the MDA\u2019s CCAS Grievance Procedures, but the MDA denied his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Mr. Scharein appealed the MDA\u2019s decision to the MSPB. Specifically, Mr. Scharein appealed his CCAS appraisal and the MDA\u2019s failure to restore him to his previous supervisory position. On August 31, 2005, in the Initial Decision, the Board dismissed Mr. Scharein\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. After the Board denied Mr. Scharein\u2019s petition for review, he appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Whether the MSPB has jurisdiction to hear a claim is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo. Vesser v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>29 F.3d 600, 602 (Fed. Cir.1994). Mr. Scharein has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. <em>Garcia v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>437 F.3d 1322, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2006) (en banc). \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Board is limited to those matters specifically delineated by Congress or granted to it by way of regulatory authority exercised by the OPM.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On appeal to this court, Mr. Scharein contends (1) that the MDA took adverse action against him by issuing an unfavorable appraisal; (2) that his position at DLAMP was a permanent position and his reassignment constituted an adverse action; and, (3) that MDA\u2019s personnel system does not provide for independent review of an agency decision and thus, does not meet requirements set by Congress. None of these contentions establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Mr. Scharein\u2019s unfavorable appraisal and resulting denial of a CRI do not constitute adverse actions and do not establish jurisdiction. The Board has jurisdiction of only those actions made appeal-able by statute or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 7513, 7701(a) (2006). Several appealable actions in \u00a7 7512 include:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">(1) a removal;</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">(2) a suspension for more than 14 days;</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">(3) a reduction in grade;</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">(4) a reduction in pay; and</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">(5) a furlough of 30 days or less.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">An unfavorable appraisal, or performance rating, is not listed as an appealable action and thus, is not appealable to the Board. <em>See Werry v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>995 F.2d 1048, 1050 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 7513, 7701(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-16\">Mr. Scharein argues that the MDA\u2019s denial of CRI is an appealable action; however, in the AcqDemo project a denial of a CRI is not an appealable action. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335(c), an employee under the General Schedule (GS) system can appeal a denial of a within-grade step increase to the Board. Mr. Scharein argues the CRI of the AcqDemo project is equivalent to the within-grade step increase of the GS system and, as a result, the denial of a CRI is appealable to the Board. His argument fails for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">First, within-grade increases are available only to employees \u201coccupying a permanent position within the scope of the General Schedule.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5335(c). Since, Mr. Scharein is not paid under the General Schedule, but rather under a system called \u201cCore Compensation,\u201d he, therefore, is not eligible for within-grade increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">Second, Mr. Scharein\u2019s position was part of the AcqDemo project, which waives employees\u2019 appeal rights for denials of pay increases. The Civil Service Reform Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4708 (2006), authorizes the Office of Personal Management (OPM) to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements in order \u201cto conduct demonstration projects that experiment with new and different personnel management concepts[.]\u201d Civilian Acquisition Workforce Personnel Demonstration Project, 64 Fed. Reg. 1426, 1426 (Jan. 8. 1999). As part of the AcqDemo Project, the OPM waived 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5331-5336, which contain the GS employee\u2019s right to appeal a denial of a within-grade step increase. <em>Id. </em>at 1491. Even if a denial of a CRI is equivalent to a denial of a within-grade increase, Mr. Scharein has no right to appeal a denial to the Board because that right was waived by the OPM for the AcqDemo project.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Next, Mr. Scharein argues that his reassignment from a supervisory position at DLAMP to a non-supervisory position at the MDA constituted an adverse action. \u201c[T]he board does not have appellate jurisdiction over reassignments not constituting a reduction in grade or pay, even though the reassignment reduces the employee\u2019s status, duties, or responsibilities.\u201d <em>E.g. Artmann v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>926 F.2d 1120, 1122 (Fed.Cir.1991). Since Mr. Scharein does not allege a reduction in grade or pay, the Board does not have jurisdiction over his reassignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Additionally, Mr. Scharein\u2019s disenrollment from DLAMP does not constitute a removal because his position, although supervisory, was temporary. Mr. Scharein states that his appointment to DLAMP \u201cwas a permanent appointment until completion at graduation.\u201d In so doing, Mr. Scharein admits that his appointment terminated upon graduation and therefore, was not a permanent position. <em>See e.g. Gosnell v. Department of Justice, </em>69 F.3d 1138, 1140 (Fed.Cir.1995) (termination of a temporary position is not appealable to the Board as an adverse action). Since Mr. Scharein has not provided any further reasons as to why his position at DLAMP was permanent, he has not met his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Finally, Mr. Scharein argues that the AcqDemo project does not provide for independent review of labor disputes and thus, does not meet requirements set by Congress under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 9902 (2006). Mr. Scharein cites <em>National Treasury Employees Union v. Chertoff, </em>385 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C.2005), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>and <em>remanded, </em>452 F.3d 839 (D.C.Cir. 2006) and <em>American Federation of Government Employees v. Rumsfeld, </em>422 F.Supp.2d 16 (D.D.C.2006), in which various provisions of the new personnel systems implemented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DoD were invalidated because they did not comply with the requirements imposed by Congress in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9701, 9902. In <em>Chertoff, </em>the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court because DHS provisions defied the plain language of \u00a7 9701(b)(4), which ensures collective bargaining. <em>Chertoff, </em>452 F.3d at 864-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We do not need to address the merits of this argument because Mr. Scharein has neither demonstrated an adverse action by the MDA nor pointed to any statute or regulation that establishes Board jurisdiction to review the question of whether the AcqDemo project lacks independent review of labor disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board properly dismissed Mr. Scharein\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
