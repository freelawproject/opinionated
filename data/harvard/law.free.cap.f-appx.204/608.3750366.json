The district court held that Farmers lacked standing to appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s reopening order because such order was ministerial in nature and did not affect Bank\u2019s substantive rights. The district court also held that even if Farmers had standing to contest the reopening order, that order is interlocutory and therefore not appealable as of right. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we will not recount them here. A party has appellate standing in the context of bankruptcy appeals if that party is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. <em>See Fondiller v. Robertson (In re Fondiller), </em>707 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir. 1983). A \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d is one who is \u201cdirectly and adversely affected pecuniarily by an order of the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. The order \u201cmust diminish the appellant\u2019s property, increase its burdens, or detrimentally affects its rights.\u201d <em>Duckor Spradling &amp; Metzger v. Baum Trust (In re P.R.T.C., Inc.), </em>177 F.3d 774, 777 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Bankruptcy court reopening orders do not satisfy this standard. The case law is clear that reopening orders are \u201csimply a mechanical device.... \u201d <em>Abbott v. Daff (In re Abbott), </em>183 B.R. 198, 200 (9th Cir. BAP 1995). They have \u201cno independent legal significance and determine[ ] nothing with respect to the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Menk v. LaPaglia (In re Menk), </em>241 B.R. 896, 913 (9th Cir. BAP 1999). Given the nature of reopening orders, the district court did not err in determining that Farmers is not a person aggrieved. Even if VBC became a \u201cdebtor-in-possession\u201d over the estate\u2019s sole asset \u2014 the claims against Fanners \u2014 as a result of the reopening order, Farmers still lacks person aggrieved status. <em>See Paine v. Dickey (In re Paine), </em>250 B.R. 99, 105 (9th Cir. BAP 2000); <em>In re Abbott, </em>183 B.R. at 200-01. Thus, we hold that Farmers lacks standing to contest the reopening order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Further, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that reopening orders are interlocutory and therefore not appealable as of right. We have explained that a bankruptcy court order is final for purposes of appeal where the order (1) \u201cresolves and seriously affects substantive rights,\u201d and (2) \u201cfinally determines the discrete issue to which it is addressed.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Four Seasons Properties (In re Frontier Properties, Inc.), </em>979 F.2d 1358, 1363 (9th Cir.1992). Even under this more flexible standard of finality, the ministerial reopening order was not a final order. Reopening orders simply do not affect the substantive rights of the litigants because the orders do not determine the merits of any claim. <em>See Wilborn v. Gallagher (In re Wilborn), </em>205 B.R. 202, 206 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b636-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
