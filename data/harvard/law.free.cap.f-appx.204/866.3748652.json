Dominguez essentially reasserts his original claims that state prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs in failing to provide him with a liquid diet, failing to issue him passes for a single-man cell and a low bunk, and failing to provide him treatment for wires that he alleges were placed in his body in an illegal surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">\u201c[D]eliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious illness or injury states a cause of action under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). To succeed on a claim of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, \u201ca plaintiff must set forth evidence of an objectively serious medical need\u201d and \u201cprove that the prison official acted with an attitude of \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to that serious medical need.\u201d <em>Farrow v. West, </em>320 F.3d 1235, 1243 (11th Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted). \u201c[A] serious medical need is considered one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation omitted). \u201c[Djeliberate indifference has three components: (1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; (3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">\u201c \u2018[Supervisory officials are not liable under \u00a7 1983 for the unconstitutional acts of their subordinates on the basis of <em>respondeat superior </em>or vicarious liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cottone v. Jenne, </em>326 F.3d 1352, 1360 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Hartley v. Parnell, </em>193 F.3d 1263, 1269 (11th Cir.1999)). Rather, such liability attaches under \u00a7 1983 only \u201cwhen the supervisor personally participates in the alleged unconstitutional conduct or when there is a causal connection between the actions of a supervising official and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Hartley, </em>193 F.3d at 1269 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">Because Dominguez presented no competent evidence to substantiate his claim that the defendant prison officials had been deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, the district court was duty bound to grant these officials summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
