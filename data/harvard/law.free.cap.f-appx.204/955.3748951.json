Nelson denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (\u201cINA\u201d), and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordering her removed to China as an inadmissible alien. <em>In re Jiao Ying Qu, </em>No. A 96 233 048 (B.I.A. Sept. 8, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 233 048 (Immig. Ct. New York City March 30, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-15\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms and adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, but rejects one of the grounds relied upon by the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review agency findings of facts under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir. 2004). The \u201cparticular deference\u201d with which we treat credibility determinations is \u201cmeant to ensure that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-16\">In the instant case, we believe that one of the two \u201cserious inconsistencies and problems\u201d with petitioner\u2019s testimony relied upon by the IJ in her adverse credibility determination may reflect misstatements of the facts in the record, and that the second, standing alone, may not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>enough to support an adverse credibility finding. The other reasons given by the IJ for finding that petitioner was not credible appear to presuppose the existence of the inconsistencies that we now instruct the agency to revisit. Therefore, remand is appropriate to allow the agency to determine whether, considering the record as a whole, an adverse credibility determination is still warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Stating that petitioner was \u201cnot credible or reliable as a witness because of serious inconsistencies and problems with her testimony,\u201d the IJ first noted that at one point during petitioner\u2019s testimony, petitioner testified that she had an IUD inserted in November 1998. This date conflicted with the date she had provided in her written application \u2014 January 1998\u2014 and was inconsistent with testimony that she had the IUD removed prior to a medical examination in March 1998. However, the IJ did not mention that petitioner later corrected her testimony, stating that \u201c[w]hen [she] was held for the IUD insertion, that was in January of '98.\u201d We do not speculate as to whether this subsequent statement, which conforms to petitioner\u2019s written application, was an honest rectification of an earlier slip-of-the-tongue or translation error, or whether it was a calculated attempt to cover-up being caught in a lie. We do, however, think it necessary that the factfinder consider these possible implications upon remand, particularly where, as here, the IJ\u2019s decision suggests that the November date given by petitioner was an isolated discrepancy from her written application and other testimony. <em>Cf. Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 68, 76-77 (holding that petitioner\u2019s repeated testimony as to differing dates of his wife\u2019s sterilization supported adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The only other inconsistency commented on by the IJ that was not rejected by the BIA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 either within petitioner\u2019s testimony or between petitioner\u2019s testimony and written application \u2014 concerned the fact that petitioner \u201cwas very contradictory regarding where she lived and whom she lived with.\u201d For example, petitioner testified that the address on her written application, where she purportedly lived from 1997 to 2003, was actually her mother\u2019s address, and that she had a primary residence elsewhere until moving in with her mother in 2000. If, taking into account the full record regarding the date of petitioner\u2019s IUD insertion, the IJ were to determine that the rest of petitioner\u2019s testimony, including the testimony as to the IUD insertion, was \u201cgenerally consistent, rational, and believable,\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000), then the IJ would have to consider whether the contradictory evidence about where petitioner lived from 1997 to 2000 was \u201crelatively minor and isolated,\u201d <em>id. </em>Again, we make no comment as to the outcome of this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">After discussing the inconsistencies within petitioner\u2019s testimony and between petitioner\u2019s testimony and written application, the IJ pointed out that petitioner had \u201clied on previous occasions to U.S. Government authorities\u201d when she was apprehended entering the United States at the U.S.Mexiean border. Therefore, \u201cConsidering [petitioner\u2019s] willingness to lie to Immigration officials,\u201d the IJ could not \u201cput much weight on [petitioner\u2019s] inconsistent and contradictory testimony.\u201d To the extent that this propensity-to-lie rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>presupposes petitioner\u2019s \u201cinconsistent and contradictory testimony,\u201d any reevaluation that the agency makes with respect to the date of petitioner\u2019s IUD insertion and pre2000 address may change the importance of the border interview to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination. To the extent that the IJ\u2019s reference to the border interview reflects not just a \u201cwillingness to he,\u201d but specific statements that conflict with statements in petitioner\u2019s testimony and written application, the agency must consider the reliability of those statements before relying on them. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004). Similarly, we cannot say what effect revisiting the record with respect to petitioner\u2019s IUD insertion and pre-2000 address will have on the weight assigned by the IJ to petitioner\u2019s failure to provide reliable corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination prevented petitioner from proving eligibility for both asylum and withholding of removal, and the BIA reviewed petitioner\u2019s CAT claim \u201cbased solely on the same testimony she presented for her asylum and withholding of removal claims,\u201d all three claims should be remanded to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is GRANTED, the decision of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-11\">.
