Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>cause GM\u2019s appeal was untimely, the district court correctly determined that it lacked appellate jurisdiction over GM\u2019s appeal, and properly dismissed the case. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">This case arises out of a post-confirmation contested matter adjudicated in the Bankruptcy Court. GM filed a post-confirmation third-party indemnity claim against Kitty Hawk in Michigan state court. Kitty Hawk responded by filing a motion to enforce the confirmation order and a motion to show cause why GM should not be held in contempt (\u201cMotion to Enforce Confirmation Order\u201d). On the court\u2019s suggestion, Kitty Hawk and GM entered into an Agreed Order on Kitty Hawk\u2019s Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order. As part of the Agreed Order (entered March 15, 2004), GM was to dismiss the matter and instead file its late administrative expense claim in the Bankruptcy Court. Upon confirmation of GM\u2019s dismissal of the state court matter, Kitty Hawk was to dismiss its Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Although GM dismissed the Michigan claims pursuant to the agreed resolution, it did not file its expense claim in the Bankruptcy Court. To resolve the matter, on September 1, 2004, Kitty Hawk filed a motion to determine that GM did not have an administrative expense claim against debtors. On November 9, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court granted the motion and denied GM\u2019s late claim; the Court\u2019s Order was entered by the clerk on November 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 8002(a), the deadline to appeal the November 9 Order was November 22, 2004. On November 28, 2004, GM filed a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s November 9 Order. GM did not file a motion requesting that the deadline to file its notice of appeal be extended. Kitty Hawk moved to dismiss GM\u2019s appeal because it was not filed timely. On August 25, 2005, the District Court granted Kitty Hawk\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and entered a Final Judgment dismissing GM\u2019s appeal with prejudice. GM subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">GM acknowledges that it appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s November 9 Order pursuant to the provisions applicable to final judgments. However, due to the untimeliness of its appeal, GM now performs an about-face. GM now contends that its appeal was not late, but rather premature, because the November 9 Order was in fact interlocutory. As a result, GM argues, its notice did not ripen until the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s January 24, 2005, final Order closing the bankruptcy case. To decide whether GM\u2019s argument has merit, we must determine whether the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s November 9 Order was final or interlocutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Unwilling to concede the untimeliness of its appeal, GM contends that, because Kitty Hawk did not dismiss the Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order, the November 9 Order adjudicating its administrative expense claim remained interlocutory. As noted <em>supra, </em>after GM filed a third-party claim for \u201cindemnity\u201d against Kitty Hawk in Michigan, Kitty Hawk filed its Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order. The Bankruptcy Court then entered an Agreed Order under which GM was to dismiss certain third-party claims (which would purge it of contempt), and upon confirmation of the dismissal, Kitty Hawk would in turn dismiss its Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order (which was based on the improper pursuit of the Michigan claims). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>As a separate matter, to pursue the late indemnity claim, GM was to file a motion to allow a late filed administrative expense claim in the Bankruptcy Court, which Kitty Hawk would oppose. When GM failed to file its motion, in order to resolve the viability of GM\u2019s purportedly outstanding claim, Kitty Hawk filed a motion to deny GM\u2019s claim, which the Bankruptcy Court granted in the November 9 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">GM now claims that the Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order (to stop GM from improperly pursuing its purported claim in Michigan state court, which was resolved by the Agreed Order) and the Motion to Deny GM\u2019s Claim (to dispose of GM\u2019s purported late claim, which was resolved by the November 9 Order) were two overlapping, pending motions that comprised one judicial unit. Therefore, GM argues that the November 9 Order was not final until the bankruptcy case was formally closed by the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s January 24, 2005, Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">This court \u201chas long rejected adoption of a rigid rule that a bankruptcy case can only be appealed as a \u2018single judicial unit\u2019 at the end of the entire bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d <em>Bartee v. Tara Colony Homeowners Assoc. (In re </em>Bartee), 212 F.3d 277, 282 (5th Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Rather, under a flexible rule of finality, \u201c[a]n Order which ends a discrete judicial unit in the larger case concludes a bankruptcy proceeding and is a final judgment for the purposes of [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158].\u201d <em>Orix Credit Alliance, Inc. v. Heard Family Trucking, Inc. (In re Heard Family Trucking, Inc.), </em>41 F.3d 1027, 1029 (5th Cir.1995). In other words, the bankruptcy system favors the appeal of discrete orders, and appeal of final adjudication of issues does not await the closing of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In the instant case, the two motions (Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order and Motion to Deny GM\u2019s Claim) on their faces addressed separate matters, and each motion was fully adjudicated by a separate order. On the one hand, Kitty Hawk\u2019s nonpursuit of its Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order was tied to GM\u2019s dismissal of its third-party claims in Michigan. That is, the Motion to Enforce Confirmation Order was to stop the improper proceeding outside the Bankruptcy Court. On the other hand, resolution of the viability of GM\u2019s late administrative claim was a separate issue that was to be triggered by GM filing a motion to allow its late claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Because GM did not file the motion, Kitty Hawk was forced to file a motion to deny GM\u2019s purported late claim. That GM forced Kitty Hawk to file a motion to dispose of GM\u2019s claim does not transform that issue into part of the resolved matter that stopped the improper state court proceedings. The discrete issue before the Bankruptcy Court was whether GM had a valid, late administrative claim. The granting of the Motion to Deny GM\u2019s Claim and denial of any late administrative claim in the November 9 Order resolved the only purported rights of GM before the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, \u201c[t]he character of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order demonstrates that the court was aware that policy and practicality counseled against retaining jurisdiction over the case.\u201d <em>In re Bartee, </em>212 F.3d at 283. The bankruptcy court\u2019s order \u201cconclusively determined the substantive rights at issue and ended the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, \u201c[t]he record does not contain any indication that the bankruptcy court intended to take any further action on\u201d GM\u2019s late administrative claim. <em>See id. </em>Finally, as noted <em>supra, </em>GM knew that the Order was final, and appealed it as such.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>in its attempt to appeal, GM simply missed the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s November 9 Order concluded the discrete judicial unit relating to GM\u2019s late filing of an administrative expense claim and was a final and appealable judgment. Thus, because GM\u2019s appeal was untimely, the district court correctly determined that it lacked appellate jurisdiction over GM\u2019s appeal, and properly dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s dismissal of GM\u2019s appeal is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
