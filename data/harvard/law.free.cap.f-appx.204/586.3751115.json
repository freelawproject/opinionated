We review de novo the district court\u2019s summary judgment. <em>See Hervey v. Estes, </em>65 F.3d 784, 788 (9th Cir.1995) (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Liability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) arises not only when a covered entity discriminates or retaliates against a person suffering from <em>\u201ca </em>physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more ... major life activities,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(A), but also where the covered entity discriminates against a person who it \u201cregard[s] as having such an impairment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Hainan asserts that her assignment to a position as a security guard/reeeptionist evidences that Donnelley regarded her as disabled. This evidence, however, is subject to the bar of <em>Thornton v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., </em>261 F.3d 789, 798 (9th Cir.2001), which provides that when an employer that is also a covered entity \u201ctakes steps to accommodate an employee\u2019s restrictions, it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ADA or that it regards the employee as disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-19\">Hainan has failed to produce any other evidence from which a reasonable inference may be drawn that Donnelley regarded her as disabled. Therefore, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b615-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
