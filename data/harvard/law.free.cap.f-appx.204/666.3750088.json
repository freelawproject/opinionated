We disagree. The waiver provision expressly required May to object to the government\u2019s failure at the time of sentencing in order to preserve his objection, which he did not. <em>See United States v. Baramdyka, </em>95 F.3d 840, 843 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that this court must focus also upon language of waiver to determine its scope). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Accordingly, May waived any objection to the government\u2019s failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">To the extent May argues, for the first time in the reply brief, that his failure to object was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to address this issue on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Daychild, </em>357 F.3d 1082, 1095 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cwe do not ordinarily consider on direct review claims challenging the efficacy of a criminal defendant\u2019s representation\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Ullah, </em>976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that this court will not ordinarily consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in appellant\u2019s opening brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
