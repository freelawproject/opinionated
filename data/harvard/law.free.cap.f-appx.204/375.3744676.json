Alegr\u00eda argues that (1) the magistrate judge erred in determining that his claims against Dr. Charles Adams were unexhausted; (2) the magistrate judge abused her discretion in deeming frivolous his claims against Dr. Kenneth Love and David Fortner; and (3) the magistrate judge erred in determining that venue was improper as to the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">We hold that the magistrate judge did not err in holding that Alegr\u00eda failed to exhaust his claims against Dr. Adams. \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under [\u00a7 1983] ... by a prisoner ... until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d <em>Booth v. Churner, 532 </em>U.S. 731, 736, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record reveals that administrative procedures existed for Alegr\u00eda to vindicate his claims against Dr. Adams. And the record in front of the district court contained no grievances about the September 2003 claims against Dr. Adams; although Alegr\u00eda claims on appeal he did file such a grievance, he cannot introduce new evidence on appeal. <em>See Schwarz v. Folloder, </em>767 F.2d 125, 128 n. 2 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-17\">Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). We further hold that the evidence supports the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the adjustments made by Dr. Love and Fortner to Alegria\u2019s Darvocet dosage were medical judgments as opposed to deliberate indifference to his pain. Alegria\u2019s claims against Dr. Love and Fortner amounts to no more than disagreements over the type of care he received, which, under the facts of his case, is not actionable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-18\">Finally, we lack jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the magistrate judge\u2019s transfer order. <em>See Louisiana Ice Cream Distribs., Inc. v. Carvel Corp., </em>821 F.2d 1031, 1033-34 (5th Cir.1987); <em>see also Brinar v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number><em>Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Alegria\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims and our dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Alegria is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
