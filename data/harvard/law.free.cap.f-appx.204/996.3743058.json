Rakoff of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1024-21\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-22\">Following a jury trial in the District Court, Defendant-Appellant Mark A. Capozzi was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of wire fraud. He was sentenced principally to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution of more than $2.5 million. In short, the charges against Capozzi involved his actions as an intermediary and facilitator in a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d masterminded by his co-defendant Carolyn Mintus. Capozzi appeals his conviction and sentence on four grounds: (1) the District Court erred in issuing a \u201cno ultimate harm\u201d jury instruction that could confuse the jury into convicting without finding an intent to defraud; (2) the District Court abused its discretion in denying Capozzi\u2019s motion for a mistrial after learning that Capozzi\u2019s trial lawyer was being paid to represent Capozzi by Mintus; (3) Capozzi\u2019s lawyer during the mistrial hearing provided ineffective assistance of counsel by not designating the trial lawyer as an adverse witness in order to ask more leading questions; and (4) the District Court impermissibly treated the Guidelines sentence as presumptively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-23\">We assume familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-24\">With respect to the argument that the District Court erred in not granting Ca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>pozzi a mistrial based on his lawyer\u2019s conflict of interest, we see no reason to question the District Court\u2019s findings \u2014 made in the course of its careful and comprehensive opinions denying Capozzi\u2019s motions for a mistrial and reconsideration \u2014 that the conflict was not a reason why the trial lawyer chose, or did not choose, to pursue certain defense strategies or tactics. <em>Cf. United States v. Levy, </em>25 F.3d 146, 158 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that a lawyer\u2019s failure to \u201cshift[ ] primary criminal responsibility\u201d to another individual was a Sixth Amendment violation because there were not \u201cjustifiable reasons other than the attorney\u2019s conflicts that better explained why alternative defense strategies were not pursued\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">We have considered all of Capozzi\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
