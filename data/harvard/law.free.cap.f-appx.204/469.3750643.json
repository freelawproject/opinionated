He contends that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-25\">Hernandez contends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence in that it refused to consider the sentencing disparity between his case and those of defendants in districts which offer \u201cfast-track\u201d programs. This court recently rejected a nearly identical argument, holding \u201c[t]he refusal to factor in, when sentencing a defendant, the sentencing disparity caused by early disposition programs does not render a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-26\">Hernandez\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and is presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Such a sentence is given \u201cgreat deference,\u201d and we infer that the sentencing court considered all the factors for a fair sentence under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). We conclude that Hernandez has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence, which was at the bottom of the applicable range under the Sentencing Guidelines, was reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-29\">Hernandez also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 46-month term of imprisonment imposed in his case exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprend% </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
