Martinez-Rodriguez also claims that the district court should have held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he was in custody when he made the admission, entitling him to <em>Miranda </em>warnings. However, \u201c[a]n evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress need be held only when the moving papers allege facts with sufficient definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude that contested issues of fact exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 620 (9th Cir.2000). Because there were no contested issues of fact concerning the circumstances under which Martinez-Rodriguez made his admission, the district court did not err in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
