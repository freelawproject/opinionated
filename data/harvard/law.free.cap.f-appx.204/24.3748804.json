Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b52-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the order of the District Court be affirmed because the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction. This case did not arise under the patent laws because the complaint speaks solely to patent ownership and \u201cthe question of who owns patent rights, and on what terms, typically is a question exclusively for state courts.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Nutrition Co. v. Horphag Research Ltd., </em>257 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Because the district court clearly lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, we need not address the issue of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
