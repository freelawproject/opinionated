On appeal, Rodriguez-Estrada argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence when it sentenced him above the applicable guideline range based on his extensive criminal history. Rodriguez-Estrada argues that (1) the district court erred by failing to conduct the criminal history departure analysis required under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 before imposing his sentence outside the guideline range; (2) the district court should have examined \u201cthe next criminal history category\u201d to determine if his closely resembled defendants in that category; and (3) the district court ignored \u00a7 4A1.3 and, without proper analysis, sentenced him to a term of imprisonment that was 260% higher than the advisory guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005). Post <em>-Booker, </em>district courts are still required to consider the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005). Section 4A1.3 of the guidelines allows a sentencing court to upwardly depart when it believes that a defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant would commit other crimes. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. However, after accurately calculating the guideline range, a sentencing court may, post <em>-Booker, </em>impose a more severe or more lenient sentence. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1244-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In imposing its sentence, the sentencing court considers the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1328-1329 (11th Cir.2005). These factors include <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for law, and provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; and (4) the need for the sentence to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 for an alien who had been removed previously for a felony is 10 years imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the sentence imposed in the instant case was reasonable. Although Rodriguez-Estrada argues, in essence, that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was a disguised upward departure under \u00a7 4A 1. 3, a review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court did not impose an upward departure under the guidelines. Moreover, the district court appropriately considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a reasonable sentence. The court\u2019s deliberations reflect consideration of: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the law; (3) the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s further crimes; and (4) the history and characteristics of the defendant. Thus, because the imposition of Rodriguez-Estrada\u2019s 72-month sentence reflected consideration of several of the relevant factors, including the guidelines, was supported by the record, and fell below the 120 month statutory maximum, his sentence outside the guidelines range is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
