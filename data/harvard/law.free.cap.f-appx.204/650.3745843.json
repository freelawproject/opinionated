We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-25\">The BIA\u2019s decision did not address Galvez\u2019s contention that the plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act requires rescission of his in absentia removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229(a)(1)(G)(i) (requiring notices to appear to specify the \u201ctime and place at which the proceedings will be held\u201d); 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii) (stating that in absentia orders may be rescinded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>\u201cif the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section [1229(a) ]\u201d). We therefore remand this matter to the BIA so the agency may consider Galvez\u2019s claim in the first instance. <em>See Barroso v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 1195, 1208-09 (9th Cir. 2005) (remanding after stating that the BIA is \u201cnot free to ignore arguments raised by a petitioner\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>see also INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Galvez\u2019s due process contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
