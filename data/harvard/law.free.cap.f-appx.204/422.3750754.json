Myers-Pacheco argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence because it failed to consider the impact of his belief that he was a United States citizen on the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(5). Although the court did not identify each factor under \u00a7 3553(a), the court considered and rejected the impact of Myers-Pacheco\u2019s beliefs about his citizenship on the sentencing factors. In fact, the district court\u2019s questioning concerning the contradiction between Myers-Pacheco\u2019s belief and his action in obtaining a resident alien card reflected the court\u2019s skepticism regarding Myers-Pacheco\u2019s belief that he was a citizen. Accordingly, Myers-Pacheco has not overcome the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">Myers-Pacheco also argues, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that the 46-month <em>term </em>of imprisonment exceeds the statutory maximum sentence allowed for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged in his indictment. He challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">Myers-Pacheco\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garzar-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Myers-Pacheco properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
