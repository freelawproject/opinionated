No member of the panel nor judge in regular active service of the court having requested that the court be polled on Rehearing En Banc (Fed. R.App. P. and 5th C\u00ede. R. 35), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED. We withdraw our previous opinion and substitute the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Lionel Gonzales Rodriguez was convicted in Texas state court for the murder of Tracy Gee. He now seeks habeas corpus relief from his sentence of death. After denying habeas relief on all claims, the district court granted Rodriguez a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on one issue: whether Rodriguez\u2019s death sentence violated his constitutional rights because he received ineffective assistance of counsel (\u201cLAC\u201d) in the punishment phase of his trial. We find that Rodriguez\u2019s claim is meritless and AFFIRM the denial of habeas relief. We DENY Rodriguez\u2019s request for a COA on all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">These are the facts as recounted by the district court:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">Rodriguez confessed to the murder for which he was convicted. According to Rodriguez\u2019s confession, he became physically abusive in an altercation with his mother and sister on the night of the murder. He then stole a shotgun and an automatic rifle from his stepfather and drove around with his cousin, Jaime Gonzalez, looking for a place to rob. Rodriguez unsuccessfully attempted to rob a gas station. While driving around, Rodriguez became angry at another driver and repeatedly fired shots at him. This occurred in a residential neighborhood. The other driver drove safely away and, at a distance, turned his car around to write down Rodriguez\u2019s license plate number. Rodriguez jumped out of his car and fired another shot at the other driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-16\">Rodriguez and Gonzalez continued driving. While stopped at a stop light, Rodriguez noticed a young woman, Tracy Gee, sitting alone in her car. He decided to rob her and steal the car. He confessed to shooting at her one time with the rifle. The shot pierced the passenger side window and Gee\u2019s head fell forward. Her car started rolling, and Rodriguez jumped out of his car and ran over to the other car. He managed to get into the car and pushed Gee out the driver side door onto the street. He then drove off in the stolen car.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-17\">Gonzalez drove away from the scene, and a police officer, Theron Runnels, pulled him over. Gonzalez exited the car and, after initially approaching the officer, began to run. After a chase, a second officer, Randy West, arrested Gonzalez for evading arrest. In the meantime, Runnels found a rifle and shotgun in the car. When West brought Gonzalez to Runnels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>so that the latter could identify him, Gonzalez shouted that he did not kill Gee but that his cousin did.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Rodriguez was arrested in the victim\u2019s car while fleeing the scene of the crime. His pants were stained with blood, and there was blood, bone, and brain matter inside the car. Rodriguez had brown matter in his hair. Police also recovered a fired bullet from the victim\u2019s car and found gunpowder residue in Gonzalez\u2019s car. The gunpowder residue showed that a gun was fired from inside that car.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">An autopsy revealed a massive entrance gunshot wound to Gee\u2019s right temple that had very large lacerations radiating around it, and an exit wound with extensive lacerations on the left forehead. Gee\u2019s skull had massive fractures. Some of her brain extruded through the wounds. Gee lost some bone fragments from her skull when she was shot. The cause of death was the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">During Rodriguez\u2019s sentencing, the State presented evidence that Rodriguez shot at the other driver. Officers Runnels and West testified that, when West brought Gonzalez to the scene of the crime where Runnels was performing inventory on Gonzalez\u2019s car, Gonzalez stated that his cousin, Rodriguez, killed Gee.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The State produced evidence that Rodriguez burglarized an elementary school in January 1990. Rodriguez received probation for the burglary, but his probation was later revoked. His probation officer testified that Rodriguez was physically abused by an alcoholic father during childhood. The probation officer characterized Rodriguez as having average to somewhat above average intelligence and having the potential to do something with his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The State introduced records from the Harris County Jail naming Rodriguez as an \u201cescape threat\u201d and as \u201caggressive towards staff,\u201d instructing jail staff to use handcuffs and leg irons when moving Rodriguez from his cell. A Harris County Sheriffs Deputy testified that, during Rodriguez\u2019s incarceration at the Harris County Jail on the capital murder charge, there was a standing order that Rodriguez was to wear leg irons and handcuffs when he was out of his cell. Rodriguez became belligerent to a jail deputy while being brought to a visit with his mother. Upon returning to his cell, Rodriguez broke a window. There was also evidence that while at Harris County Jail, Rodriguez was frequently disruptive, and jail staff tried to perform a daily search of his cell for shanks or weapons. During one of these searches, deputies found a homemade shank.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Veronica Vinton and her father testified that, after Veronica refused Rodriguez\u2019s request for a date, Rodriguez stalked her. Another witness testified that Rodriguez assaulted him and damaged his car with a baseball bat. Other witnesses testified that Rodriguez had a bad reputation for not abiding by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">Gee\u2019s sister Susan offered victim impact testimony. She testified that her mother\u2019s health was affected by Tracy Gee\u2019s death. She also described Tracy as a person of integrity, and one who loved children.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">Rodriguez\u2019s sister, Veronica Lopez, testified on Rodriguez\u2019s behalf. She testified that he became very angry and rude when he was on crack. She never saw Rodriguez get violent with anyone. She testified that Rodriguez changed dramatically in the time between the murder and his trial. He had adapted to being in prison and started a program creating pamphlets that he and other inmates would send to juvenile homes and churches so that young people could read about how the inmates wound up on death row and could avoid the same fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Rodriguez\u2019s uncle testified that he is a recovering alcoholic who became sober at age 23, the same age as Rodriguez at the time of his trial. He testified that he saw changes in Rodriguez, specifically in Rodriguez\u2019s desire to help others. Rodriguez\u2019s aunt testified that Rodriguez\u2019s father, Henry, abused drugs and alcohol and was extremely violent toward his wife and children. She also testified that Rodriguez changed and that he had a religious conversion while incarcerated. Rodriguez\u2019s great aunt corroborated that he experienced a religious conversion and that he was working to discourage kids from pursuing a path of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Janie Warstler, Rodriguez\u2019s mother, testified that Henry was very abusive and an alcoholic. She also suspected that he was using drugs. Henry started taking Rodriguez to bars and giving him beer to drink when Rodriguez was six or seven years old. Rodriguez started using drugs in his early teens.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Henry threatened to kill Ms. Warstler on more than one occasion. He choked her and pushed her against a wall, threatened her with a knife, and tried to run her over. On one occasion, he used a shotgun to shoot down the door of Ms. Warstler\u2019s mother\u2019s house. He was also physically abusive to Rodriguez and his siblings, and once threatened Rodriguez\u2019s sister with a gun. He also abused the family pets and other animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">When Rodriguez was fourteen, Janie left Henry, but Rodriguez insisted on staying with his father. Some time later, Rodriguez called his mother and told her that Henry was drunk all the time, was not buying groceries, and was not giving Rodriguez any lunch money. When Janie said she would come and get him, Rodriguez told her not to because he was afraid Henry would be there and would be violent. Janie sent her brothers to pick up Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Henry also testified and agreed with Janie\u2019s testimony. He also observed that Rodriguez has changed for the better during the time he has been in prison. Several other witnesses testified that Rodriguez has changed while in prison, experienced religious conversion, had no significant disciplinary problems, and was a positive influence on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The jury found that: (1) Rodriguez deliberately caused Tracy Gee\u2019s death and with the reasonable expectation that her death would occur; (2) there is a reasonable probability that Rodriguez would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society; and (3) there were not sufficient mitigating circumstances to warrant imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. Accordingly, the Harris County jury convicted Rodriguez of capital murder and sentenced him to death on September 20,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">On direct appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Rodriguez\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>Rodriguez v. State, </em>No. 71,974 (Tex.Crim.App. Feb. 5, 1997). Rodriguez did not seek certiorari review in the Supreme Court of the United States. Instead, he timely filed a state habeas application on March 27, 1998. Rodriguez\u2019s application was denied by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals based on the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>Ex parte Rodriguez, </em>No. 50,773-01 (Tex.Crim.App. Oct. 23, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">On July 3, 2003, Rodriguez timely filed an amended federal writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Rodriguez v. Dretke, </em>No. H-03-317 (S.D.Tex.2005). On March 29, 2005, the district court ordered that all habeas relief be denied, and granted a COA on one claim. Rodriguez filed notice of appeal on May 19, 2005. Rodriguez appeals the denial of a COA on six claims and presents one claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Because Rodriguez\u2019s habeas petition was filed in the district court after the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, AEDPA governs his petition. <em>See Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 336, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). We will consider Rodriguez\u2019s COA request first, followed by the issue for which the district court granted COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Under AEDPA, Rodriguez must obtain a COA from either the district court or appellate court before he can appeal the denial of habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To obtain a COA, Rodriguez must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). That is, if Rodriguez can show that the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA to his constitutional claims was debatable among reasonable jurists, we will issue a COA. <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">In deciding whether to grant a COA, we are limited \u201cto a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [the petitioner\u2019s] claims.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (citing <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 481, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). Our analysis \u201crequires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of [their] merits\u201d rather than a \u201cfull consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. \u201cBecause the present case involves the death penalty, any doubts as to whether a COA should issue must be resolved in [the petitioner\u2019s] favor.\u201d <em>Hernandez v. Johnson, </em>213 F.3d 243, 248 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In deciding whether to grant a COA, we recognize that AEDPA imposes a deferential standard of review on a federal habeas court with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court. A federal court cannot grant habeas relief unless the state court adjudication of that claim either:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); see <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). A decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it \u201creaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 337 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1179, 124 S.Ct. 1413, 158 L.Ed.2d 81 (2004). We presume the facts to be correct unless Rodriguez meets his burden of rebutting that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Rodriguez argues that reasonable jurists would find it debatable that: (1) the admission of Gonzalez\u2019s statement and Rodriguez\u2019s jail disciplinary records did not violate Rodriguez\u2019s Sixth Amendment right, (2) the challenge for cause of potential juror Anita Rodriguez did not violate Rodriguez\u2019s right to due process, and (3) the ineffective assistance of counsel he received with respect to each of the aforementioned alleged errors did not violate his Sixth Amendment right. Each claim will be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\n<em>1. Admission of Accomplice Statements and Jail Disciplinary Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Rodriguez claims a COA should issue because reasonable jurists could debate whether his Sixth Amendment right was violated by the district court\u2019s admission of Gonzalez\u2019s statement implicating Rodriguez as Gee\u2019s murderer as an \u201cexcited utterance.\u201d He also argues the admission of his jail disciplinary records and Gonzalez\u2019s statement violated the Sixth Amendment under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Rule 803(2) of the Texas Rules of Criminal Evidence<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> states that an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d is a \u201cstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d Tex.R. Evid. 803(2). The \u201ccritical factor\u201d for determining whether a statement is an excited utterance is \u201c \u2018whether the declarant was still dominated by the emotions, excitement, fear, or pain of the event.\u2019 \u201d <em>Apolinar v. State, </em>155 S.W.3d 184, 186 (Tex.Crim.App.2005) (citing <em>Zuliani v. State, </em>97 S.W.3d 589, 596 (Tex.Crim.App. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s determination that Gonzalez\u2019s statement was an excited utterance, and that its admission did not violate the Sixth Amendment. In the district court, Rodriguez argued the facts are insufficient to show that Gonzalez\u2019s statement was spontaneous and unreflective, because of the period of time that had elapsed between Gonzalez\u2019s flight and his return to his vehicle. The district court concluded that Rodriguez\u2019s argument fails because an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d is not defined by the period of time elapsed between the startling event and the statement made about it. <em>See Zuliani, </em>97 S.W.3d at 596 (\u201c[I]t is not dispositive that the statement is an answer to a question or that it was separated by a period of time from the startling event; these are simply factors to consider in determining whether the statement is admissible under the excited hearsay exception.\u201d). The district court noted that: (1) Gonzalez blurted out his remarks concerning Tracy Gee\u2019s murder after fleeing a routine traffic stop, being chased by police officers, and being apprehended while weapons from within his vehicle were being inventoried by police, and (2) Gonzalez actually observed the events he described and his intervening actions, including hiding in a swimming pool and in someone\u2019s vehicle, and demeanor were known to the two officers. Rodriguez fails to make a substantial showing that he was denied his constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">Rodriguez also argues that reasonable jurists could debate the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>court\u2019s determination that the introduction of both Gonzalez\u2019s statement and the jail disciplinary records do not violate <em>Crawford,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>541 U.S. 86, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). <em>See also </em>U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV. Rodriguez\u2019s arguments are barred by the non-retroactivity doctrine of <em>Teague v. Lane. Lave v. Dretke, </em>444 F.3d 333, 337 (5th Cir.2006) (holding that the rule in <em>Crawford </em>is not to be applied retroactively); <em>see also Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (holding that, except in very limited circumstances, a federal habeas court cannot retroactively apply a new rule of criminal procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s determination that the state court admitted both Gonzalez\u2019s statement and the jail disciplinary records under prevailing law at the time that Rodriguez\u2019s conviction became final. The district court found that the officers\u2019 testimonies recounting Gonzalez\u2019s statement satisfied the Confrontation Clause because they qualified under a firmly-rooted hearsay exception. <em>See White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 355 n. 8, 356, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (1992). Rodriguez has not shown that a COA should be granted on this issue. <em>See Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060. As to the jail disciplinary records, the district court determined that the trial court admitted the jail disciplinary records, over objection, under the business records exception to the general rule barring hearsay. The business records exception was applicable at the time of Rodriguez\u2019s trial and direct appeal. Tex.R.Crim. Evid. 803(6). Rodriguez fails to make a substantial showing that his constitutional right was denied by the admission of either of these pieces of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\n<em>2. Challenge to Prospective Juror Anita Rodriguez</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Rodriguez claims a COA should issue because reasonable jurists could debate whether the State did not violate his right to due process by misinforming the trial court regarding the eligibility of a challenged juror, Anita Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Prior to voir dire, the prosecution advised the trial court that it believed Ms. Rodriguez was subject to a challenge for cause under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 35.16(a)(2), which provides that a juror is disqualified from serving if she has been convicted of any grade of theft or of a felony. Tex.Code.Crim. Proc. art. 35.16(a)(2). Defense counsel objected to the challenge on the grounds that a successfully completed probation was not a conviction for purposes of disqualifying a prospective juror.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Rodriguez admitted to the trial court that she had been convicted of misdemeanor theft in 1984 and placed on probation, and she said that her probation was terminated. The trial court granted the challenge for cause. Neither the trial court nor defense counsel requested copies of Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s probation records.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Records from the Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office reflect that Ms. Rodriguez was successfully discharged from her probation, and the charge against her was dismissed. In the district court, Rodriguez argued that Ms. Rodriguez was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>subject to challenge for cause because she received and successfully completed probation; he believes the prosecution lied to the trial court about Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s eligibility to serve. Rodriguez further argued that the prosecution deliberately confused the trial court by employing the term \u201cterminating\u201d rather than \u201crevoking\u201d in describing the manner in which Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s probation ended. The district court found the fact that Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s probation had \u201cterminated\u201d was an accurate reflection, and the trial court deemed it enough to rule on the challenge. Reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s determination that Rodriguez failed to make a substantial showing that prosecutorial misconduct violated his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AT4\">We turn to Rodriguez\u2019s IAC claims regarding the admission of Gonzalez\u2019s statement and the jail disciplinary records and the challenge to potential juror, Ms. Rodriguez. Rodriguez alleges that reasonable jurists could debate the district court\u2019s decision in denying his IAC claims based on (1) his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the admission of Gonzalez\u2019s statement through the testimonies of Officers Runnels and West, (2) his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the introduction of the jail disciplinary records in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, and (3) his trial counsel\u2019s failure to timely supplement the record with evidence demonstrating the trial court\u2019s erroneous conclusion in dismissing Ms. Rodriguez as a juror, and to advise appellate counsel of this possible ground for error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\"><em>Strickland v. Washington </em>governs IAC claims. 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to prevail, Rodriguez must meet both the deficiency and prejudice prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Rodriguez must tie the deficiency and prejudice prongs to specific acts or omissions of his counsel that are not the result of professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. If Rodriguez fails to prove either prong, his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">First, to prove deficiency, Rodriguez must prove that in light of all the circumstances as they appeared at the time of the conduct, his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Rodriguez\u2019s burden is heavy. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (stating that the court presumes the alleged deficiencies \u201cfall[ ] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d). <em>See also Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 749, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983) (\u201cIt is not required that an attorney argue every conceivable issue on appeal, especially when some may be without merit. Indeed, it is his professional duty to choose among potential issues, according to his judgment as to their merit and his tactical approach.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Second, to prove prejudice, Rodriguez \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of [his] proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 103 S.Ct. 3308.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">A COA will not issue on any of Rodriguez\u2019s IAC claims because reasonable jurists would not debate the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>determination on each issue. Rodriguez\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of Gonzalez\u2019s statement, and he was overruled. Rodriguez contended in the district court that his appellate counsel was ineffective by failing to raise this ground on direct appeal. Rodriguez\u2019s state appellate counsel filed a brief containing thirty points of error, but did not raise as a claim for relief the trial court\u2019s admission of Gonzalez\u2019s accusations against Rodriguez. The district court found that there was no error in admitting Gonzalez\u2019s statement, and, therefore, Rodriguez\u2019s appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise the issue. Further, the district court concluded Rodriguez cannot show prejudice because it is not reasonably likely that he would have received any relief had the claim been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Rodriguez argued in the district court that the reliability of the jail disciplinary records was subject to challenge at the time of appeal. The district court found that Rodriguez cannot show that his appellate counsel was deficient in failing to object to the admission of these records because the trial court properly admitted the records according to the law existing at the time of Rodriguez\u2019s trial and direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Finally, reasonable jurists would agree that Rodriguez cannot show deficiency or prejudice on the issue of whether his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s records in time to present them to the trial court and for failing to advise appellate counsel of this possible ground for error. <em>See Jones, </em>463 U.S. at 751-52, 103 S.Ct. 3308.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">For the issue certified by the district court, we engage in a determination of its merits under AEDPA. Rodriguez claims that his death sentence violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments because he received IAC during his sentencing proceedings. As discussed, a petition for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings unless the prior adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). Again, a decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it \u201creaches a legal conclusion in direct conflict with a prior decision of the Supreme Court or if it reaches a different conclusion than the Supreme Court based on materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Miniel v. Cockrell, </em>339 F.3d 331, 337 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1179, 124 S.Ct. 1413, 158 L.Ed.2d 81 (2004). As also discussed, in ruling on the merits, we defer to the state court\u2019s factual findings unless they \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Our inquiry into reasonableness is objective, not subjective, and we will not issue the writ as a result of our independent judgment that the state habeas court \u201capplied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409-11, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). We presume correct the factual findings of the state unless the petitioner \u201crebut[s] the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Rodriguez contends that trial counsel neither investigated nor presented evidence in relation to the etiological origins of his brain damage and the link between the damage to his brain\u2019s frontal lobes and his impulsive nature. Rodriguez\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>dence consists of written statements found in the institutional records of the Orchard Creek Hospital, a psychiatric facility where Rodriguez was treated prior to his trial for Gee\u2019s murder, that were known to his counsel but were not presented at his trial. In addition, Rodriguez complains that his jury did not hear a neuro-psychologist\u2019s opinion that his abusive upbringing, lengthy drug addiction, and use of cocaine damaged his brain\u2019s frontal lobes. He argues that this unproffered evidence could have persuaded one juror to vote against the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Rodriguez admitted that his counsel at his state habeas proceeding did not provide this claim to the state court. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1), Rodriguez should have fully exhausted remedies available to him in state court before proceeding to federal court; he should have presented the substance of his claim in the state court. <em>Nobles v. Johnson, </em>127 F.3d 409, 420 (5th Cir.1997). <em>\u201cA </em>habeas petitioner fails to exhaust state remedies \u201cwhen he presents material additional evidentiary support to the federal court that was not presented to the state court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kunkle v. Dretke, </em>352 F.3d 980, 988 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 835, 125 5. Ct. 250, 160 L.Ed.2d 56 (2004) (quoting <em>Graham v. Johnson, </em>94 F.3d 958, 968 (5th Cir.1996)). <em>See also Moore v. Quarterman, </em>454 F.3d 484, 491 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201cEvidence is not material for exhaustion purposes if it <em>supplements, </em>but does not <em>fundamentally alter, </em>the claim presented to the state courts.\u201d) (internal quotations and citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">In assessing the exhaustion of Rodriguez\u2019s IAC claim as it pertains to his counsel\u2019s failure to investigate Rodriguez\u2019s brain damage, we look to Rodriguez\u2019s diligence at the state habeas level: \u201c[A] failure to develop the factual basis of a claim is not established unless there is a lack of diligence.... Diligence ... depends upon whether [petitioner] made a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time, to investigate and pursue claims in state court....\u201d <em>Williams, </em>529 U.S. at 430-32, 435, 120 S.Ct. 1479.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Rodriguez claims that he could not present these pieces of evidence in the state habeas proceedings because he was not provided enough resources to conduct his investigation. However, the record shows that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted Rodriguez $4000 for investigative services in connection with his state habeas proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As noted by the district court, Rodriguez does not explain why he did not obtain at least some neurological or psychological tests with the funds granted him. It is unclear whether Rodriguez exercised sufficient diligence at the state habeas level.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">However, even if Rodriguez had exhausted his state remedies, his claim for IAC fails. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2) (\u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d) Again, <em>Strickland </em>governs Rodriguez\u2019s IAC claim. 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to prevail, Rodriguez must meet both the deficiency and prejudice prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As discussed, to prevail on the deficiency prong, Rodriguez must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>In order to prove prejudice, Rodriguez must show a reasonable probability that but for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the \u201cadditional mitigating evidence [was] so compelling that there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror could reasonably have determined that, because of [the defendant\u2019s] reduced moral culpability, death was not an appropriate sentence.\u201d <em>Neal v. Puckett, </em>286 F.3d 230, 241 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1104, 123 S.Ct. 963, 154 L.Ed.2d 772 (2003); <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[T]he question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer\u2014 including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence\u2014 would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u201c[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations <em>or </em>to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn assessing counsel\u2019s investigation, we must conduct an objective review of their performance, measured for reasonableness under prevailing professional norms, which includes a context-dependent consideration of the challenged conduct as seen from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 523, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 381, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005) (noting that \u201chindsight is discounted by pegging adequacy to \u2018counsel\u2019s perspective at the time\u2019 investigative decisions are made\u201d) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The evidence does not support Rodriguez\u2019s contention that his trial counsel performed deficiently by not presenting evidence of his brain damage. Trial counsel pursued a mitigation case that described Rodriguez as a changed person. The jury heard abundant evidence lessening Rodriguez\u2019s moral culpability and humanizing him. They heard from witnesses who described Rodriguez as having reformed his conduct through religious studies following his incarceration in 1991 and that he had a good disciplinary record while incarcerated. It is a reasonable conclusion, and within trial counsel\u2019s purview of professional judgment, that evidence of brain damage to explain Rodriguez\u2019s violent behavior would counteract counsel\u2019s mitigation strategy. Evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s permanent brain damage presents the proverbial double-edged sword: it could bolster the State\u2019s case on future dangerousness without significantly reducing, if at all, Rodriguez\u2019s moral blameworthiness. <em>See Martinez v. Dretke, </em>404 F.3d 878, 889 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 550, 163 L.Ed.2d 466 (2005) (\u201cAs we have held, evidence of organic brain injury presents a \u2018double-edged\u2019 sword, and deference is accorded to counsel\u2019s informed decision to avert harm that may befall the defendant by not submitting evidence of this nature.\u201d). Thus, trial counsel\u2019s decision not to introduce evidence of brain damage, given the availability of other, less damaging, mitigating evidence, falls within the bounds of sound trial strategy. <em>See id. </em>at 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Rodriguez insists that trial counsel\u2019s strategic decision not to introduce evidence of brain damage was unreasonable because trial counsel failed to investigate brain damage. In support of this failure to investigate claim, Rodriguez points to the institutional records of the Orchard Creek Hospital and a neuro-psychologist\u2019s opinion that his abusive upbringing, lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>drug abuse, and use of cocaine damaged his frontal lobes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The state habeas court found: that trial counsel was aware of the institutional records at Orchard Creek Hospital but decided not to introduce them; that trial counsel objected to the State\u2019s attempt to admit the Orchard Creek Hospital records, \u201cin part, because trial counsel did not want the jury informed of a diagnosis of sociopathy for [Rodriguez], and that trial counsel instead offered extensive evidence of [Rodriguez\u2019s] character change and his good deeds in prison to persuade the jury that [Rodriguez] would not be a future danger\u201d; and that the institutional records were used by the State for the limited purpose of cross-examining Rodriguez\u2019s mother and that the records did not present the jury with a diagnosis of sociopathic behavior. The state habeas court further found that \u201ctidal counsel presented extensive testimony ... of [Rodriguez\u2019s] home life, his father\u2019s abuse, and its affect on [Rodriguez],\u201d and that trial counsel presented evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s drug problem, including Rodriguez\u2019s anger when he used crack cocaine. Rodriguez has not rebutted the presumption of correctness of the state court\u2019s factual findings, and we defer to these findings in ruling on the merits. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Most of the evidence that Rodriguez claims resulted in an unreasonable investigation by trial counsel was actually presented by trial counsel and heard by the jury. As found by the state court, the jury heard evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s home life, his father\u2019s abuse, his drug abuse, and the fact that he got angry when he used crack cocaine. The jury did not hear evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s institutional records at Orchard Creek Hospital. The decision not to introduce those records and to forego further investigation into those records probably was not unreasonable in light of other potentially conflicting mitigating evidence, what trial counsel knew at the time of Rodriguez\u2019s 1994 trial, what the State introduced into evidence, and the \u201cheavy measure of deference\u201d owed to counsel\u2019s investigative judgments. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 523, 123 S.Ct. 2527. The only remaining evidence that Rodriguez proffers \u2014 the opinion of the neuropsychologist in post-conviction proceedings \u2014 is irrelevant to determining the reasonableness of trial counsel\u2019s perspective (and thus investigation) in Rodriguez\u2019s 1994 trial. <em>See Martinez, </em>404 F.3d at 886 (stating that testimony of experts and family members not involved in the defendant\u2019s 1989 trial proceedings is \u201cirrelevant to counsel\u2019s perspective <em>in 1989 </em>\u2019\u2019); <em>see also Rompilla, </em>545 U.S. at 381, 125 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Even if counsel\u2019s strategies in failing to further investigate or present evidence of brain damage could be described as deficient, they cannot form the basis of a constitutional ineffectiveness assistance of counsel claim because Rodriguez cannot affirmatively demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In other words, there is no evidence that trial counsel\u2019s strategies, even if they fell below professional norms, prejudiced Rodriguez or \u201c \u2018permeated [his] entire trial with obvious unfairness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martinez, </em>404 F.3d at 890 (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>287 F.3d 325, 331 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1018, 123 S.Ct. 549, 154 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>L.Ed.2d 424 (2002)). \u201cIn assessing prejudice, we \u2018must consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In addition to the mitigation evidence presented by the defense, the jury had before it evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s execution of the crime of conviction. The jury heard evidence that on the night of the murder, Rodriguez stole a shotgun and an automatic rifle from his stepfather and was driving around looking for a place to rob. The jury heard that Rodriguez unsuccessfully attempted to rob a gas station, and that he repeatedly fired shots at another driver in a residential neighborhood before shooting Gee and stealing her car. The State produced evidence that Rodriguez burglarized an elementary school in 1990. The State also produced evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s Harris County Jail records depicting Rodriguez as an \u201cescape threat\u201d and \u201caggressive towards staff.\u201d The jury found there was not sufficient mitigating evidence to warrant imposition of a life sentence in lieu of the death sentence. It is not reasonably probable that this outcome would change if, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>his counsel had not erred in investigating or presenting this additional evidence. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201c[T]he question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer \u2014 including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence \u2014 would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d). The nature of the evidence against Rodriguez advises against a prejudice finding. <em>Cf.
