R. CivJP. 60(b) motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Boyd has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
