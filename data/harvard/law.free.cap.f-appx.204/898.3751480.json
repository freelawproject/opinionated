R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed August 22, 2006, be affirmed. Dismissal with prejudice is justified when a district court determines that \u201c\u2018allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Firestone v. Firestone, </em>76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (quoting <em>Jarrell v. United States Postal Serv., </em>753 F.2d 1088, 1091 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (other quotations omitted)). The district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice where he could not possibly state a claim for damages resulting from his allegations concerning the late President Nixon.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
