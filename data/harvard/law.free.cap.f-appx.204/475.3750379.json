Affording the issue de novo review, we reverse and remand. <em>See Hudson v. Johnson, </em>242 F.3d 534, 535 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">Due process requires, at a minimum, that the record contain \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the disciplinary decision. <em>Morgan v. Dretke, </em>433 F.3d 455, 457 (5th Cir. 2005). The \u201csome evidence\u201d standard is extremely deferential. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, on federal habeas review, we do not assess the weight of the evidence, <em>Hudson, </em>242 F.3d at 537, and will overturn a prison disciplinary proceeding only where no evidence in the record supports the decision. <em>Broussard v. Johnson, </em>253 F.3d 874, 877 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">The district court found that Officer Brooks, the charging officer, had mischaracterized offender Ian Smelser\u2019s written statement as a \u201cconfession\u201d based on the court\u2019s reading of that statement. The district court held that because Smelser\u2019s statement was not a confession, neither the statement nor Brooks\u2019 representation to the hearing officer that Smelser had confessed qualified as \u201csome evidence\u201d to support Sharp\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-19\">At the prison disciplinary hearing, however, Brooks testified that during his interview with Smelser, Smelser confessed that he did drawings for money, which he sent to his family, and that he relied on Sharp to send the drawings to the \u201cfree world.\u201d This information was not contained in Smelser\u2019s written statement. Additionally, Brooks testified that Smelser\u2019s credibility was at issue because when initially questioned, Smelser denied having any knowledge of the third-party deposit at issue; however, Smelser\u2019s commissary spending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>history indicated that he indeed had knowledge of the deposit. Finally, Sharp admitted during the hearing that \u201c[Smelser] was right that he does it [i.e., drawings] for money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Consequently, based on the testimony adduced at the disciplinary hearing, there was \u201csome evidence\u201d to support a finding that Smelser had received third-party compensation from Sharp\u2019s mother in exchange for drawings. Given the deference owed to prison disciplinary decisions, particularly where live testimony is concerned, the district court erred in reversing the decision. <em>See Broussard, </em>253 F.3d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
