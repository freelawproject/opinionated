Ct. N.Y. City April 19, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-21\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir .2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Zheng claims that he suffered past persecution in China. Substantial evidence, however, supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng did not describe any actions that rose to the level of persecution. Zheng failed to demonstrate that he was either mistreated or mishandled. <em>See Kambolli v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 454, 457 (2d Cir. 2006). Nor has Zheng shown economic deprivation that might constitute persecution. <em>See Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 67, 70 (2d Cir.2002). The IJ\u2019s finding that Zheng has not proven past persecution is, thus, supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In his brief to this Court, Zheng has not challenged the IJ\u2019s denial of his claim of well-founded fear of persecution based on his illegal exit from China. And issues not sufficiently argued are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The IJ did not believe that Zheng would suffer future persecution. Zheng claims that, although he admittedly was not a member of Falun Gong, the IJ and BIA overlooked evidence that Chinese authorities may have imputed an anti-government opinion or Falun Gong affiliation to him, and on that basis may subject him to future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Zheng\u2019s argument has some merit but ultimately fails. In <em>Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir.2005), this Court found that the main issue in finding whether a petitioner was persecuted \u201con account of\u2019 an enumerated ground in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cAct\u201d) was not whether the petitioner was a practitioner of Falun Gong, but whether, because of his activities, authorities would have <em>perceived </em>him to be a practitioner or supporter of the movement. We, therefore, agree that the IJ may have failed to consider adequately the fact that, although Zheng was not a Falun Gong practitioner, he might have been perceived by the Chinese government to be a Falun Gong practitioner or supporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Nevertheless, \u201c[w]e are not required to remand where there is no realistic possibility that, absent the errors, the IJ or BIA would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005). And, when, as here, an asylum petitioner has failed to establish past persecution, he has the burden of proving an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. <em>See Melendez v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>926 F.2d 211, 215 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that to establish fear of future persecution a petitioner must provide documentary proof or credible testimony of \u201cspecific facts\u201d that give rise to the inference of a reasonable fear of future persecution). This Zheng has not done; that is, we conclude that even if the IJ took full account of the risk that the authorities might impute a political opinion to him, Zheng did not proffer enough evidence to meet his burden here. Because Zheng is unable to establish his eligibility for asylum, he also fails to satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Abankwah v. INS, </em>185 F.3d 18, 22 (2d Cir.1999). Zheng\u2019s claims under CAT also fail, since substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Zheng did not establish a likelihood of Zheng\u2019s being subjected to torture if returned to China. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>NIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
