At the initial sentencing hearing, the district court granted Robinson\u2019s request for a downward departure for diminished capacity over the Government\u2019s objection and sentenced Robinson to a total of 384 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Robinson appealed his convictions and sentence; the Government cross-appealed, contending the district court erred in granting the downward departure. We affirmed Robinson\u2019s convictions but reversed his sentence and remanded to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cdid nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence\u201d except upon the Government\u2019s motion on the basis of substantial assistance) <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">At the second sentencing hearing, the district court imposed a term of 193 years and three months\u2019 imprisonment. Robinson again appealed. His counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there exist no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting that the sentence imposed by the district court on remand violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Although notified of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>submit a pro se supplemental brief, Robinson has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We previously reversed Robinson\u2019s sentence because it was below the statutory minimum, and remanded for re-sentencing in conformity with that opinion. <em>See Robinson, </em>404 F.3d at 863. The district court resentenced Robinson in accordance with the mandate rule. \u201c[I]n the absence of exceptional circumstances, ... [the mandate rule] compels compliance on remand with the dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, we noted that while the sentence Robinson faced on remand \u201cmay seem manifestly unjust given Robinson\u2019s age and well-documented intellectual limitations, it is the result mandated by Congress.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>404 F.3d at 862. Although \u201c[s]evere, mandatory penalties\u201d such as those imposed on Robinson \u201cmay be cruel, ... they are not unusual in the constitutional sense.\u201d <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 994, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Robinson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Robinson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Robinson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\">. The sentence from which the district court departed \u201cwas calculated as follows: 84 months for the first [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 924(c) [ (2000) ] conviction, 300 months consecutive for the seven additional \u00a7 924(c) convictions, and 135 months for the armed robbery counts.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>404 F.3d at 862. After granting Robinson a downward departure for diminished capacity, the district court sentenced Robinson to 384 months\u2019 imprisonment, \u201crunning only the first \u00a7 924(c) conviction and one additional \u00a7 924(c) conviction consecutively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This sentence violated the applicable statute, which \u201cprovides, in relevant part, that 'no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) (2000)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">.
