See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-6\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Harvey Brewer appeals his conviction and 121-month sentence imposed following a guilty plea for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of a quantity of a mixture substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846 (2000). After thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In 1999, members of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), in cooperation with the Baltimore City Police Department, investigated alleged drug trafficking in Baltimore City, Maryland, which revealed that Brewer and others, including Troy Crawley, conspired to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute heroin. As part of its investigation, the DEA sought authorization to intercept wire communications on a cellular phone used by Crawley, and electronic and wire communications on a pager and cellular phones used by Brewer. Brewer contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence derived from the interception of wire and electronic communications because the affidavits in support of the wire and electronic surveillance (1) did not establish probable cause; (2) were based on probable cause that was stale; and (3) failed to comply with the \u201cexhaustion\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c) (2000). Brewer further argues that the district court\u2019s assessment that the Government established \u201csuper probable cause\u201d did not satisfy the probable cause assessment required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-20 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress ruling for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Bush, </em>404 F.3d 263, 275 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 289, 163 L.Ed.2d 254 (2005). When a suppression motion has been denied, the evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>United States v. Grossman, </em>400 F.3d 212, 216 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Brewer first argues there was no probable cause to obtain a wiretap to achieve the objectives set forth in the affidavits. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(b) (2000) permits a district court to enter an order authorizing a wiretap if \u201cthere is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through such interception.\u201d In applying for such an order it is not necessary for the applicant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that communications concerning the offense will be obtained, but only that there is a fair probability thereof. <em>United States v. Alfano, </em>838 F.2d 158, 162 (6th Cir.1988). The issuing judge is in the best position to determine if probable cause has been established in light of the circumstances as they appear at the time. <em>United States v. DePew, </em>932 F.2d 324, 327 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">Probable cause is judged by an analysis of the totality of the circumstances, <em>see Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), which are weighed \u201cnot in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cfact that an innocent explanation may be consistent with the facts alleged,\u201d does not necessarily negate probable cause. <em>United States v. Fama, </em>758 F.2d 834, 838 (2d Cir.1985). In <em>United States v. Leavis, </em>853 F.2d 215, 221 (4th Cir.1988), we held that the showing of need is tested in a practical and common sense fashion and not in an overly restrictive manner that would unduly hamper the investigative powers of law enforcement agents. The applications in the present case met this standard and the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Turning to the exhaustion requirement, under \u00a7 2518(1)(e), a wiretap application must contain \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d The burden upon the government \u201cto show the inadequacy of normal investigative techniques is not great, and the adequacy of such a showing is \u2018to be tested in a practical and common sense fashion.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>31 F.3d 1294, 1297 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Clerkley, </em>556 F.2d 709, 714 (4th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The affidavits in this case presented extensive detail regarding various investigative techniques that had been tried, and the reason for their failure, as well as those that were not possible in light of the investigative goals. These included: use of an informant, material from a prior search warrant and other investigative data, physical surveillance, toll record and pen register analysis, use of the grand jury, undercover investigation, and other subscriber information. The affidavits explained that through these procedures, law enforcement authorities had been able to gather a limited amount of evidence concerning the organization but could not determine the identities of other co-conspirators and sources. For example, it was only through the use of electronic surveillance that Brewer\u2019s identity became known to law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The affidavits also explained that such techniques as introducing undercover agents, employing physical surveillance, and search warrants would not be successful in disclosing the nature of the conspiracy and those involved. Because the application and affidavit provided specific factual information as to how certain investigative methods had been employed with limited success and how others were unlikely to succeed, we find the Government provided sufficient facts from which the issuing court could reasonably have concluded a wiretap was necessary. Thus, we find the district court did not err in denying Brewer\u2019s motion based on exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Brewer next argues that the information set forth in the affidavits in support of the wiretaps was stale. He claims that the investigation came to a \u201cstandstill\u201d in August 2003 and almost five months elapsed from August 2003 until January 2004, during which time there was no indication that agents obtained any new information as to Crawley\u2019s activities. As this court has made clear, \u201c[t]he vitality of probable cause cannot be quantified by simply counting the number of days between the occurrence of the facts supplied and the issuance of the affidavit.\u201d <em>United States v. McCall, </em>740 F.2d 1331, 1336 (4th Cir.1984); <em>see also United States v. Spikes, </em>158 F.3d 913, 923 (6th Cir.1998) (staleness not measured \u201csolely by counting the days on a calendar\u201d). \u201cRather, we must look to all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the unlawful activity alleged, the length of the activity, and the nature of the property to be seized.\u201d <em>McCall, </em>740 F.2d at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Even the most cursory read of the affidavits does not support Brewer\u2019s conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>tion. The affidavits establish that the investigation was ongoing and information and evidence was being obtained by the investigators in support of probable cause to seek the wiretaps. Here, Brewer was under investigation for drug trafficking\u2014 not \u201cmere isolated violation[s]\u201d of the law, but criminal activities of \u201ca protracted and continuous nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Farmer, </em>370 F.3d 435, 439 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1022, 125 S.Ct. 676, 160 L.Ed.2d 498 (2004) (citation omitted). The ongoing nature of the drug trafficking operation rendered the recency of the information in the affidavit less crucial, and \u201csuggested] that probable cause [was] not diminished solely by the passage of time.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Alvarez, </em>358 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Valenzuela v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 887, 125 S.Ct. 126, 160 L.Ed.2d 148 (2004) (long-term drug trafficking operation) (other citations omitted). Brewer\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Finally, Brewer complains that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress by referring to the Government\u2019s demonstration of what was characterized as \u201csuper probable cause.\u201d Contrary to Brewer\u2019s allegations, the district court\u2019s remarks at the suppression hearing demonstrated a full awareness of the relevant statutory standards for the judicial authorization of wire and electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Even if Brewer is correct that the affidavits did not set forth adequate probable cause, or that the exhaustion requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(e) had not been met, the affiants were entitled to rely on the facially valid wiretap orders pursuant to the good faith exception of <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>41 F.3d 370, 376 (8th Cir.1994) (good faith doctrine required that suppression of wiretap evidence be denied, despite defect in order allowing electronic surveillance); <em>United States v. Malekzadeh, </em>855 F.2d 1492, 1497 (11th Cir.1988) <em>(Leon </em>applied to wiretap affidavit that was devoid of deliberately false or recklessly false information); <em>United States v. Baranek, </em>903 F.2d 1068, 1071-72 (6th Cir.1990) (recognizing that Congress intended federal wiretap law to incorporate Fourth Amendment evidence suppression doctrines).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Brewer\u2019s conviction and sentence. We further grant Brewer\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief but deny Brewer\u2019s motion to compel the Government\u2019s response to his pro se supplemental brief and deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw representation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
