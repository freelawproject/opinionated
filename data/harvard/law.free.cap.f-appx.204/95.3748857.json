Specifically, Edem contends that defendants conspired to deprive him of procedural due process by denying him the right to appeal from an August 15, 2000 state court order of filiation and child support. The district court, which had previously dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction two prior complaints by Edem raising virtually identical claims, <em>see Edem v. State of New York, </em>No. 03-cv-1220 (RJD)(LB) (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2004); <em>Edem v. Northfield Savings Bank, </em>No. 04-cv-657 (RJD)(LB) (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2004), <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Edem\u2019s most recent complaint as frivolous, holding, once again, that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear Edem\u2019s claims pursuant to the doctrine articulated in <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923) and <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482-86, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). <em>See Edem v. Spitzer, </em>05-cv-3504, 2005 WL 1971024 (E.D.N.Y. Aug.15, 2005). On appeal, we review this ruling <em>de novo. See Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>77, 83 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>goes to subject-matter jurisdiction, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the doctrine.\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine establishes that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction in \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Edem\u2019s complaint satisfies all four factors identified in <em>Exxon Mobil </em>for the application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine: (1) Edem lost the filiation claim in state court and, thus, was directed to provide financial support; (2) he complains of the injury caused by the state court order; (3) the state court determinations in question were rendered before this action was commenced; and (4) Edem seeks a declaration that the state court\u2019s judgment is unconstitutional and void. Accordingly, as the district court correctly concluded, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">In an effort to demonstrate that his claim is not barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>Edem submits that he does not challenge the state judgment, but rather the defendant\u2019s failure to afford him \u201cadequate notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the deprivation of his property rights,\u201d thereby depriving him of due process. Complaint at 5-6, \u00a7 13. We are not convinced. The procedural defects that plaintiff alleges are, in fact, inextricably intertwined with the substantive decisions of the state court. <em>See Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d at 86-87 <em>(\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>bars a federal claim, whether or not raised in state court, that asserts injury based on a state judgment and seeks review and reversal of that judgment; such a claim is \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the state judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Under New York law, no appeal of right was available from the filiation or support order. <em>See Matter of Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv. v. Jay W., </em>105 A.D.2d 19, 28, 482 N.Y.S.2d 810, 818 (2d Dep\u2019t 1984); Family Court Act \u00a7 439(e). Nevertheless, the issues underlying both orders were reviewable on appeal from the state court\u2019s final order dated May 30, 2001. <em>See Matter of Ise-Smith v. Orok-Edem, </em>296 A.D.2d 414, 414-15, 745 N.Y.S.2d 461, 461 (2d Dep\u2019t 2002). To this extent, it appears that Edem was given a full and fair opportunity to litigate the challenged orders, which suggests that his due process claim is frivolous. We do not, however, reach that issue. Rather, we summarize the state proceedings only to illustrate that Edem\u2019s procedural due process claims are, in fact, inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s judgment, and thus, outside our subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Phifer v. City of New York, </em>289 F.3d 49, 57 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that this court may not review family court determinations that were decided after providing plaintiff a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to litigate those issues\u201d). As we observed in <em>Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>simply \u201cpresenting in federal court a legal theory not raised in state court ... cannot insulate a federal plaintiffs suit from <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>if the federal suit nonetheless complains of injury from a state court judgment and seeks to have that state-court judgment reversed.\u201d 422 F.3d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">Because we lack jurisdiction, we do not address plaintiffs remaining arguments or his miscellaneous motions. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court and DENY all pending motions as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
