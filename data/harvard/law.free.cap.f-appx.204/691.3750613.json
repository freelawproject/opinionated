We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2005), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Garcia Guevara testified that in 1988 members of an unidentified group attempted to recruit him, threatening harm to him and his family if he refused to join. Contrary to Garcia Guevara\u2019s contention, neither his testimony nor any other evidence in the record compels the conclusion that he was or would be targeted on account of a statutorily protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1171-72. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Garcia Guevara is not eligible for asylum or -withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The BIA properly denied Garcia Guevara CAT relief because he failed to present evidence that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured by Guatemalan officials or anyone acting with their acquiescence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
