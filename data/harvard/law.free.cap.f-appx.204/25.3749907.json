R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b53-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed May 18, 2006 be affirmed. The district court correctly held that appellant\u2019s present complaint concerning her 1992 termination is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. <em>See, e.g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326 n. 5, 99 S.Ct. 645, 58 L.Ed.2d 552 (1979). Moreover, the court did not abuse its discretion in barring appellant from filing future complaints relating to her termination, after giving her notice and an opportunity to be heard on the matter. <em>See, e.g., In re Powell, </em>851 F.2d 427, 431 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
