On appeal, Small argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny, the district court violated his Sixth and Fifth Amendment rights and committed statutory error by imposing enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C), 2K2.1(b)(5) and 3Bl.l(c), and sentencing him above the statutory maximum, which he defines as the maximum sentence that may be imposed under the guidelines based on facts that were reflected in the jury verdict, or admitted by him. Further, he argues that the Sentencing Guidelines are at odds with the constitutional guarantee that each defendant be tried by a jury and that every fact be found beyond a reasonable doubt. Small argues that, because all of the enhancements increased his base offense level, the district court unconstitutionally and unreasonably enhanced his sentence through a \u201cmandatory application\u201d of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">We review a preserved <em>Booker </em>claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court (1) held that sentence en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>hancements based solely on judicial fact-finding pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment, and (2) excised the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the guidelines mandatory \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(b)(1) and 3742(e) \u2014 thereby rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 233-35, 259-60, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51, 764. After <em>Booker, </em>the guideline range now is advisory, but still an important factor that the sentencing court must consider, along with the factors contained in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 258-60, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">There are two types of <em>Booker </em>errors: (1) the Sixth Amendment (\u201cconstitutional\u201d) error of using judge-found facts to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence under a mandatory guideline system; and (2) the \u201cstatutory\u201d error of applying the guidelines as mandatory, as opposed to advisory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). The use of extra-verdict enhancements in an advisory guidelines scheme, however, is not unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). In <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005), we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that, under an advisory guidelines scheme, the Sixth Amendment prohibits a sentencing court from finding facts supporting extra-verdict enhancements. There, we found that a district court may continue to determine enhancements under the guidelines based on a preponderance of the evidence standard, so long as the guidelines are applied in an advisory fashion. <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Because the district court applied the guidelines in an advisory fashion, it did not violate <em>Booker </em>or Small\u2019s constitutional rights by imposing a sentence based in part on judge-found facts supporting extra-verdict enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Next, on appeal, Small argues that the district court unreasonably sentenced him to the maximum advisory guideline sentence by not giving proper weight to mitigating factors, such as his age, the fact that he required surgery, the fact that he was deportable for the instant offense, and his lack of criminal history. He contends that these factors indicate that a lengthy term of imprisonment was not necessary to achieve the goals of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation. Specifically, he argues that: (1) the goals of retribution and deterrence were satisfied by his advanced age, as it would be foolish for him again to risk being jailed, where he likely would die; and (2) the goal of incapacitation was satisfied because there was no need to protect the public from him, as he had not set foot in the United States, and the weapons that he allegedly wanted were to be used in Trinidad. Further, he argues that the court\u2019s use of a 25-year-old conviction, which was not scored as part of his criminal history, to increase his sentence was not reasonable. He contends that the district court\u2019s lack of in-depth reasoning or analysis indicated that the court did not do a \u201csufficient evaluation\u201d of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that the district court gave the guidelines undue weight in determining the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentence, imposed after consulting the guidelines and considering the factors set forth at \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">In sentencing a defendant, the factors that a district court must consider include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public, and provide needed correctional treatment; (4) the applicable guideline range; (5) the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; and (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7). \u201cA district court need not, however, explicitly consider every single \u00a7 3553(a) factor in order for the sentence to be reasonable.\u201d <em>See e.g., United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe now ... hold that nothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d). A district court may determine on a case-by-case basis what weight to give the guidelines, so long as its determination is made with reference to the remaining \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential ... and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Upon review of the sentencing transcript and the presentence investigation report, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we And no reversible error with respect to Small\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Because the imposition of Small\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of several of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), Small\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
