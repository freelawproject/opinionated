The BIA\u2019s order affirmed an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) denial of her applications for asylum under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and withholding of removal under the INA and the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231(b)(3)(A). Because we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s finding that Parra did not file a timely application for asylum, we dismiss that part of her petition. And because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision not to withhold removal, we deny that part of her petition as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Parra entered the United States in September 2000 as a non-immigrant visitor authorized to remain in the United States until March 2001. She remained in the United States beyond the authorized period, and in April 2003, she filed an application for asylum under INA \u00a7 208(a) and for withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241(b)(3) and CAT art. III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her application Parra alleged that she was threatened and persecuted in Colombia by the United Auto Defense Forces of Colombia (UAC), a group of violent paramilitaries who seek to control that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-15\">In her application, Parra attributed the UAC\u2019s alleged persecution to her political opinions and her membership in a particular social group. Specifically, Parra stated in her application that she had previously acted as a campaign assistant for the Liberal Party and that she had received threatening phone calls from the UAC after she refused to provide members of the group with money and food. Her application also alleges that UAC members stole food from her family\u2019s farm and, on one occasion, even shot at her house, which was located on the farm. She further alleged that the shooting incident prompted her family to sell their farm and relocate to Bogota. Parra, however, decided Bogota was not safe enough and resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>to move to the United States with her children. About two months after her family left the farm she sent her son to live with an uncle in the United States. Then, \u201cfive or six\u201d months later, she and her daughter entered the United States legally as non-immigrant visitors. She now contends that if she or her children return to Colombia, they will \u201ccertainly\u201d be hunted, tortured, and killed by the UAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In June 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) charged Parra with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) for remaining in the United States beyond her authorized time period. When she appeared before the IJ to answer the charge, she gave testimony that conflicted with portions of her asylum application. First, she told the IJ that she had sent her son to the United States to frustrate the UAC\u2019s attempts to recruit him, but her application made no mention of any attempted recruitment. Second, Parra told the IJ that her family vacated the farm without selling it because they would have been forced to give the sale proceeds to the UAC, but her application states that her family sold the farm. And third, in response to the IJ\u2019s questions about her political affiliations, Parra stated that although she was never a member of the Liberal Party, she had collaborated with them \u201conce or twice\u201d by assisting with political meetings held by the Liberal Party at the family farm, but her application states that she \u201cbelonged\u201d to the Liberal Party and was an active campaign assistant. The IJ found her political activities \u201cunspecific and unremarkable.\u201d In addition to the inconsistencies between Parra\u2019s testimony and her asylum application, Parra\u2019s testimony also revealed that during her eight months in Bogota she had experienced no threats or attacks from the UAC and that her parents have lived safely in Bogota since they left the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The IJ denied Parra\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. He found that her application for asylum was untimely and that withholding of removal under the INA was improper because Parra had not established that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be persecuted in Colombia. He also denied her request for CAT relief, finding that she had not stated a valid claim because she had not established that a government official or anyone acting under a government official\u2019s consent would torture her or her children if they were removed to Colombia. Instead, the IJ found that any hostilities directed at Parra were meant only to coerce her family into providing food or money to the UAC or to pressure Parra\u2019s son into becoming a member of the UAC. On appeal, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s factfindings under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201caffirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)). Under the substantial evidence test, \u201cwe review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005)). The test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weigh[ing] the evidence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (llth Cir. 2001). Under the substantial evidence test, the record must not only support reversal, it must compel it. <em>Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except for those portions of the IJ\u2019s decision expressly adopted by the BIA. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision that Parra failed to file a timely application for asylum and failed to present sufficient credible evidence to carry her burdens of proof and persuasion in support of her application for withholding of removal. Thus, we review the IJ\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence test and will uphold those findings unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The IJ found that Parra\u2019s application for asylum was untimely. Parra concedes that point, but claims that she has established \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that excuse her late application. In response, the government argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the timeliness of Parra\u2019s application. The government is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">As part of the asylum application process, an alien must demonstrate \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). If an alien files after the one-year deadline, his application may still be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General ... extraordinary circumstances related to the delay in filing .... \u201d \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). However, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) specifies that \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General [under \u00a7 1158(a)(2)].\u201d <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting \u00a7 1158(a)(3)) (alteration in original). We have held that the phrase \u201cno court\u201d in \u00a7 1158(a)(3) includes this Court. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to reconsider Parra\u2019s asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">In addition to her application for asylum, Parra is also petitioning for withholding of removal under the INA and CAT. \u201cAn applicant for withholding of removal may satisfy her burden of proof in either of two ways.\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. First, an applicant may prove that she experienced past persecution that was motivated, at least in part, because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id. </em>Second, an applicant may establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that she would be persecuted on account of one of those grounds if she returned to country of citizenship. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Either way, the applicant must establish a causal connection between her political opinion and the feared persecution by presenting \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that [she] will be singled out for persecution on account of such an opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">Although the INA does not define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have held that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d requiring \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and that \u201c[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Menacing telephone threats do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>Id. </em>Also, \u201c[i]t is not enough to show that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>was or will be persecuted or tortured due to her refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">On appeal, Parra contends that the Liberal Party\u2019s occasional use of her family\u2019s farm as a political forum caused the UAC to label her as a \u201ccollaborator\u201d with that party. According to Parra, being labeled as a collaborator is the equivalent of being identified as a member of a political party or of a particular social group that opposes the UAC\u2019s goals. Accordingly, since the UAC allegedly views her as a political enemy, she contends that if she were returned to Colombia, the group would resume its alleged hostilities against her and her children. The IJ, however, discounted Parra\u2019s testimony and denied her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. Parra\u2019s testimony regarding her political activities lacks the \u201cspecific, detailed facts\u201d necessary to qualify for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Although Parra contends that if she were returned to Columbia the UAC would punish her for being a \u201ccollaborator\u201d with the Liberal Party, the IJ found that her \u201cunspecific and unremarkable\u201d political activities did not satisfy her burden of proving that she would be persecuted because of her political opinion. On appeal Parra points to no facts that undermine the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Even if we assume that she received threatening phone calls from the UAC and that she relocated to Bogota because the UAC shot at her home, there is no persuasive evidence that undermines the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the guerillas did so because they were seeking material support, and not because she had collaborated with the Liberal Party. Parra\u2019s application for asylum and her testimony to the IJ indicate that members of the UAC were upset with Parra for not complying with their demands for support. However, violence and threats of violence brought on by a refusal to cooperate are not forms of political persecution that meet the burden for withholding of removal under the INA. <em>See Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438 (\u201cIt is not enough to show that she was or will be persecuted or tortured due to her refusal to cooperate with the guerillas.\u201d); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (explaining that threatening phone calls do not constitute political persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Further, the IJ also noted that Parra lived peacefully in Bogota for eight months after she and her family left their rural farm. In fact, her parents still live there. We have stated that a petitioner\u2019s claim that she fears future persecution can be contradicted by the fact that she has family members who remain in the country from which he fled. <em>Ruiz v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir. 2006). Thus, Parra did not meet her burden in front of the IJ to establish that she \u201cmore likely than not\u201d would be persecuted if she were returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Additionally, the IJ\u2019s finding that Parra did not qualify for CAT relief is also supported by substantial evidence. To qualify for CAT relief, Parra \u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured in [Colombia] at the hands of [the] government or that the government will acquiesce in the torture.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>392 F.3d at 438. Parra has presented no evidence that she faces torture from anyone acting on behalf of the Colombian government. Thus, her claim for relief under CAT also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision, Parra\u2019s petition for withholding of removal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">. Luz Parra\u2019s children, Marcela and Ricardo, were named as derivative applicants. For clarity\u2019s sake, this opinion will refer to the three applicants as \"Parra,\u201d and to the extent that the children are derivative appellants, their claims for review fail for the same reasons that Luz Parra's fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
