Respondent elected to abide by his answer and a writ of peremptory mandamus was ordered. To reverse the order, respondent appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-7\" pgmap=\"670\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b670-8\" pgmap=\"670\">1.

Municipal corporations, \u00a7 1152*\u2014when duty of mayor to sign warrant. It is the duty of the mayor to sign a warrant for services rendered the city, though there was no valid contract for the services, where the city accepted the services and the city council voted to allow the bill, and the warrant was made out on a proper fund and signed by the proper clerk and the sum voted for the services was a reasonable compensation for the services.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-4\" pgmap=\"670\">John M.
