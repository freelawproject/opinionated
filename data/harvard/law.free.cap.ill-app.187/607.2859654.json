Two affidavits were filed in support of the motion. One affidavit stated that appellant gave an order for certain stock food to an agent that he supposed was acting for a certain company instead of for the appellee, and that appellant would not have bought the appellee\u2019s stock food had he known of the circumstances, and further states that appellant was induced to believe certain things, without stating what was said or done to induce him to believe them, or that he had a right to rely on the representations, or who induced him to believe them. The other affidavit stated that he did not sign the note sued on nor authorized it be signed, and that said note was a forgery. Neither of the affidavits stated that the suit was brought to recover the price of said stock food.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-8\" pgmap=\"634\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b634-9\" pgmap=\"634\">1.
