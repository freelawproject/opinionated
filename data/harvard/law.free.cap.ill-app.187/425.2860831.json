Stumpf and William C. Heinemann asking that on final hearing the defendants be restrained from incumbering, disposing of or collecting or in anyway transferring a certain trust deed and notes described in the bill and for a mandatory order compelling them to surrender the same to complainant. Later, the bill was dismissed as to Heinemann and an amended bill was filed against defendant Stumpf alone, averring on information' and belief that the deed and notes had been transferred by Stumpf to Heinemann and by him to an innocent purchaser without notice and praying for an injunction restraining Stumpf from transferring or incumbering certain real estate and shares in an incorporated company owned by him, and for an accounting. The bill as amended was presented to the chancellor who, without notice to the defendant and without requiring an injunction bond, ordered a writ of injunction to issue. To reverse the order, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-9\" pgmap=\"451\">A. G.
