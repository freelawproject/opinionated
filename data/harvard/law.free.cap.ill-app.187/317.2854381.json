Appeal and ebbob, \u00a7 1502<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when improper questions ashed of jurors on voir dire reversible error. In an action for personal Injuries sustained hy reason of the unsafe condition of a window, during the examination of the jury plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked a juror: \u201cDo you know anyone connected with the Aetna Insurance Company?\u201d and asked three other jurors: \u201cDo you carry casualty insurance?\u201d The questions were objected to as indicating and suggesting to the jury that the defendant was insured against liability by the insurance company and that the defense was conducted by it, and the objections were sustained, but a motion by defendant\u2019s counsel to withdraw a juror and continue the case on the ground that the error was not cured merely by sustaining the objections were overruled. Held that the action of the court in overruling defendant\u2019s motion was reversible error, that the fact that the court sustained objections to the questions indicated that the court did consider the examination as made for the purpose of enabling counsel to exercise the right of peremptory challenge and that the harm was done when the improper questions were asked.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\" pgmap=\"343\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.
