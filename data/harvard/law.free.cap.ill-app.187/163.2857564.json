It appeared that the sidewalk where the injury occurred consisted of five flagstones, each about five ft. by ten ft., that there was a complete break across the middle of one of the stones so that each half sloped towards the break, that the sidewalk at one end of the break was about two inches below the general level of the walk and that at the other end of the break it was about four inches below the general level. The accident happened when it was dark and there was a brisk wind. Snow had fallen and was still falling at the time of the accident, and all depressions on the sidewalk had been covered by the snow. Plaintiff while walking along the sidewalk at such point struck his foot in the deep end of the break and tripped and fell heavily to the sidewalk, striking on his right leg, his right thigh and his right side and sustained serious injuries. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff for $12,700, defendant appeals.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-8\" pgmap=\"190\">1.
