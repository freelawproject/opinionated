Troutman against Postal Telegraph-Cable Company, a corporation, to recover damages sustained by plaintiff resulting from the failure of defendant to deliver to the addressees a telegram given to it to be transmitted. Upon trial by the court, plaintiff recovered a judgment for $101.10, which was for railroad fare from Meadville, Pennsylvania to Chicago and return amounting to $21.10, and $80 for loss of profits and commissions while absent from Meadville. To reverse the judgment, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\" pgmap=\"272\">Plaintiff was an insurance solicitor and was employed on a commission basis by the Traveler\u2019s Insurance Company. He had in his employ George A. Wilson and Deaton J. Brooks, who were engaged by him as solicitors of insurance, the plaintiff receiving commissions on all policies written by himself and his employes. Wilson and Brooks had become dissatisfied and were contemplating a change of employment. At this time George S. Penfield, the manager of the company and plaintiff\u2019s official superior, was in Hartford, Connecticut, while plaintiff was in Meadville. Plaintiff had informed Penfield that Wilson and Brooks wanted a larger share of commissions, and Penfield wired plaintiff as follows:</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-6\" pgmap=\"272\">\u201cWire Brooks \u201cand Wilson not to make a change until after hearing from me.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-7\" pgmap=\"272\">Pursuant to this instruction plaintiff sent the following telegram to Chicago through the defendant:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A16\" pgmap=\"272\">\u201cMeadville, Pa., Jan. 20, 1913.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkZ\" pgmap=\"272\">To Wilson and Brooks</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-8\" pgmap=\"272\">306 Ins.

Wilson and Brooks did not receive it. These men left the employ of the Traveler\u2019s Insurance Company, and this fact becoming known to plaintiff at Meadville he came to Chicago. It does not appear just why he came to Chicago or what he did after his arrival. As indicated above, he was allowed as damages his railroad fare for this trip and his loss of profits caused by his absence from Meadville.</p><headnotes data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-7\" pgmap=\"273\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-8\" pgmap=\"273\">Telegraphs and telephones, \u00a7 37*\u2014when recovery for failure to deliver telegram not warranted by the evidence.
