Borgerson against Chicago Railways Company to recover for injuries sustained by plaintiff resulting from a collision while attempting to pass one of defendant\u2019s westbound cars on his motorcycle. It appeared that plaintiff was following the car, and when it stopped at a street intersection to discharge passengers he attempted to pass it on the side next to the eastbound track, and while approaching the front end of it a passenger came out the front door of the car on that side and stepped to the street in front of plaintiff so that he was unable to avert a collision and he was thrown to the pavement and injured. Plaintiff recovered a verdict for five hundred dollars, and not being satisfied with the amount recovered appeals from the judgment.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-7\" pgmap=\"92\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b92-8\" pgmap=\"92\">1.

A judgment will not be reversed for the reason that the damages awarded are inadequate, where the damages claimed are of a class where no definite measure exists and the verdict of a jury is ordinarily conclusive, the reviewing court not being able to say that the verdict is so disproportionate to the damages as to warrant it in awarding a new trial, or to indicate that the jury were influenced by passion, prejudice or other improper motives.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-4\" pgmap=\"92\">Morse Ives, for appellant</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\" pgmap=\"92\">Charles L.
