Warehousemen, \u00a7 15<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when sale for charges treated as a conversion. Where a storage company sells goods for charges and. purchases the same at its own sale, the owner may elect to treat the sale as a conversion; since the duty of a storage company as a public warehouseman arising out of the fiduciary relation created thereby precludes it, at such election of the owner, from asserting ownership of the property claimed to have been acquired by purchase at its own sale.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b99-9\" pgmap=\"99\">2.

In trover for the conversion of a piano, a verdict finding the value of the piano to be four hundred and fifty dollars at the time of its conversion held manifestly excessive, it appearing that it had been purchased new upon the instalment plan more than six years before the conversion for five hundred and fifty dollars and that it had been used and moved a couple of times.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-4\" pgmap=\"99\">Robert W.
