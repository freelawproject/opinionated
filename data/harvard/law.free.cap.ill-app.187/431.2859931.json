Roach and Henry A. Blair, receivers of the Chicago Railways Company, to recover for personal injuries received by plaintiff resulting from a street car of the Chicago City Railway Company colliding with plaintiff\u2019s wagon. Plaintiff was driving south in the west car track in Halsted street and a northbound car on the east track was diverted by a switch which led to the west track at 18th street, and when the car reached the west track it collided with plaintiff\u2019s wagon, on which he was riding. The defendant receivers were in possession of the railway at the place of the accident and permitted the Chicago City Railway Company to operate over their line of tracks.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\" pgmap=\"457\">The declaration in separate counts alleged that the defendants were guilty of negligence in the management of the switch, in permitting the same to be in defective condition and in the management and operation of the track, switches and cars. To reverse a judgment in favor of plaintiff for thirty-five hundred dollars, defendants appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-6\" pgmap=\"458\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-7\" pgmap=\"458\">1.
