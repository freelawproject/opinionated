Plaintiff, a boy nine years of age, with three, other boys got upon the rear steps of one of the ice wagons of the Zuttermeister Ice Company after it was about to move off after making a delivery of ice. This wagon was followed by another wagon of the Ice Company, and after going some distance one of the wheels of the first wagon went into a hole in the street and plaintiff fell to the pavement and was run over by the second wagon and injured. The declaration charged the City with negligence in permitting the street to be out of repair and charged the Ice Company with negligence in driving its wagons upon such a street at a high and dangerous rate of speed. At the close of 'all the evidence the court directed a verdict in favor of defendants. To reverse the judgment entered on the verdict, plaintiff prosecutes a writ of error.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-7\" pgmap=\"57\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-8\" pgmap=\"57\">1.

The act of the driver for an ice company in permitting a boy to ride on the wagon is an act done hy the driver while engaged in his employer\u2019s work, hut not done as a means or for the purpose of performing that work, and is not deemed to be an act of his employer.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-9\" pgmap=\"57\">2. Negligence, \u00a7 16*\u2014duty of owner of vehicle to trespasser riding thereon. Where a person injured while riding on a wagon is a trespasser, the owner of the vehicle owes no duty to him other than to not injure him wantonly or wilfully.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-10\" pgmap=\"57\">3. Master and servant, \u00a7 867*-\u2014sufficiency of evidence. Where a boy riding on an ice wagon fell off when a wheel went into a hole in the street and another wagon of the Ice Company ran over him, held in an action against the Ice Company for the injuries that the evidence was insufficient to show that the driver of the first wagon knew he was on the wagon or that the driver of the second wagon was negligent.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b57-11\" pgmap=\"57\">4.
