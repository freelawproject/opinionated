In an action to recover damages to plaintiff\u2019s touring car caused by a collision with defendant\u2019s auto truck, where it appeared that plaintiff\u2019s machine was out of repair when the collision occurred and he had the repairs made thereon which were made necessary by such condition as well as those made necessary by injuries resulting from the collision, held that the testimony of the manager of the concern that made the repairs as to the expense of such as were made necessary by the collision could not be regarded as an estimate of the cost of such repairs before they were made, so as to render such testimony inadmissible.</headnotes><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-4\" pgmap=\"209\">The only ground urged for reversal is that as the machine of plaintiff was repaired, evidence of estimates of the cost of making such repair's was not admissible, but the recovery must be based on evidence of the cost of making such repairs.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-5\" pgmap=\"209\">Adams, Crews, Bobb &amp; Wescott, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-6\" pgmap=\"209\">Clarence W.
