Where a ladder, which is a simple and ordinary tool, the nature of which is easily understood, is used by a servant who is familiar with it, the servant in using the same is conclusively presumed to assume the risk of all defects therein, whether patent or latent and whether the master knows of such defects or could have known of them by the exercise of reasonable care or not.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b438-9\" pgmap=\"438\">2.
