The plaintiff was injured in attempting to open a door leading to the street. The door was one which closed automatically and consisted of a wooden frame six and one-half inches wide at the top and sides and fourteen inches wide at the bottom, inclosing a pane of glass nineteen inches wide and six feet in height. The evening before the accident the glass was broken and boards were nailed across the middle of the door and the next morning when plaintiff returned to work the boards were still across the door. In the evening when plaintiff started for home the boards had been removed and the door had been cleared of the shattered glass. When plaintiff reached the door several persons had passed out and the door was released and closing automatically and plaintiff put out her right hand against it to prevent it from closing and for the purpose of pushing the door open so she could pass out. As she put out her hand, she turned her head to avoid the glare of the sun in her eyes, and her hand was only partially placed against the inside of the door frame. In exerting the pressure necessary to prevent the door from closing and to open it her hand slipped from the edge of the frame' and went through the opening caused by the absence of the glass and she was precipitated through the opening onto the sidewalk and injured. The declaration charges defendant with negligence in permitting the door to remain without the pane of.glass; in permitting the door to remain without said pane of glass without notice to plaintiff and without placing some means of protection or guard across the space where said glass had been in the door. Plaintiff recovered a verdict and judgment against defendant for two thousand five hundred dollars, and to reverse the judgment, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-5\" pgmap=\"96\">Miller, Gorham &amp; Wales and W.
