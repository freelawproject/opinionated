To warrant an action by an undisclosed principal based on a contract made by the agent, it must appear (1) that the contract was made on behalf of the principal; (2) that there is mutuality in the contract between the principal and the one who deals with the agent, so that the contract can be enforced against the principal when he is discovered; and (3) that the principal has the right to perform the contract</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b437-6\" pgmap=\"437\">2.
