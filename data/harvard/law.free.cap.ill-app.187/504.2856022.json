Forrest against Roper Furniture Company to recover for an injury to his right eye while in the defendant\u2019s employ. The injury was alleged to have been caused by defendant\u2019s violation of section 1 of the Act of 1910, Hurd\u2019s R. S. 1911, p. 1128, J. &amp; A. ft 5386, which provides: \u201cThat all power driven machinery including all saws * * shall be so located wherever possible as not to be dangerous to employes or shall be properly inclosed, fenced, or otherwise protected.\u201d Though stipulated to be under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1912, plaintiff claims the right to maintain this action under the provisions of section 3 of that Act, Hurd\u2019s B. S. 1911, p. 1137, J. &amp; A. 5451, which provides: \u201cThat when the injury to the employe was caused by the intentional omission of the employer, to comply with statutory safety regulations, nothing in this act shall affect the civil liability of the employer.\u201d</p><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-8\" pgmap=\"531\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-9\" pgmap=\"531\">1. Master and servant, \u00a7 701<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when evidence shows injury resulted in loss of sight of an eye. In an action by an employee for the loss of the sight of his eye alleged to have been caused by a splinter thrown from unguarded saw machinery, where the defense was that the loss of sight resulted from an old injury and not from the accident complained of. Evidence held sufficient to show an injury at the time and in the manner charged by plaintiff which resulted in the loss of sight of plaintiff\u2019s eye perhaps because of a weakened condition produced by the old injury.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b531-10\" pgmap=\"531\">2.

Master and servant, \u00a7 Tl^-^when direction of verdict not warranted. In an action by an employe for the loss of sight of an eye alleged to have been caused by a splinter thrown from unguarded saw machine, where it appeared that the eye had been formerly injured, held that the fact that plaintiff\u2019s evidence did not show he could see with that eye immediately before the accident did not warrant a direction of a verdict for defendant, where plaintiff testified he could see with his eye before the accident and offered proof showing that a few months before he did work with the other eye bandaged, since in such case the jury would be warranted in presuming from his testimony that his ability to see with his eye continued up to the time of the accident.</headnotes><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">From a judgment entered on a verdict for plaintiff for two thousand five hundred dollars, defendant appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531\">Trusdell, Smith &amp; Leech, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-6\" pgmap=\"531\">John E.

Master and servant, \u00a7 98*\u2014statute relating to guarding of saw machinery construed. Splinters thrown from a saw driven by machinery held to be a danger which an employer is required to guard against under the provisions of section 1 of the Act of 1910, Hurd\u2019s R. S. 1911, p. ,1128, J. &amp; A. If 5386.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532\">6. Master and servant, \u00a7 620*\u2014admissibility of evidence. In an action by an employee for personal injury resulting from the failure of the employer to guard daw machinery as required by section 1 of the Act of 1910, Hurd\u2019s R. S. 1911, p. 1128, J. &amp; A. IT 5386, testimony offered by plaintiff to show that there were guards in use or on the market that were practicable to prevent the dangers, held competent.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b532-8\" pgmap=\"532\">7. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1514*\u2014when remarks of counsel not reversible error. In a suit by an employee to recover, for injuries, the fact that counsel for plaintiff in cross-examination of witnesses called attention to the fact that the suit was defended by an insurance company, held not reversible error where an officer of the defendant previously testified without objection that he notified the insurance company of the accident.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b532-9\" pgmap=\"532\">8. Master and servant, \u00a7 833*\u2014when rejection of evidence as to condition of machinery not reversible error. In an action by an employee for personal injuries caused by the unguarded condition of machinery, rejection of evidence offered by the employer as to the condition of the machine sometime after the accident held not reversible error where the condition of the machine at the time of the accident was known to many and could have been readily shown.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b533-4\" pgmap=\"533\">9.
