Laughlin against Charles H. Norton and Henry P. Norton to recover money claimed to be loaned by plaintiff to defendants. Plaintiff filed the common counts and a bill of particulars, in which he claimed he loaned the defendants on three separate occasions sums of money aggregating in all $4,017.75. The defendants filed a set-off claiming money due from plaintiff to defendants as follows: $2,046.82 due upon a certain land contract between the parties, dated May 6, 1905: and $1,251.35 due upon another land contract between the parties dated October 31, 1905, which sums, with interest, amounted to $4,487.36; and giving the plaintiff credit for $1,277.08, for cash paid on account of contracts, with interest. The claim of set-off showed a balance due the defendants of $3,210.28. Plaintiff filed an affidavit of merits to the set-off, denying that defendants performed under the contract of October 31, 1905, and alleging that he did not waive any of the provisions of the contract and was entitled to a credit of $1,891.95, as payment upon the contract of May 6, 1905. The court found that the sum of $1,891.95 was paid by plaintiff to defendants as a loan and that performance of the contract of October 31, 1905, was not fulfilled by the defendants; that plaintiff had paid on the contract of October 31, 1905, $2,125.81, and such sum together with $1,891.95, and interest thereon, amounted to a total of $4,735.12. As against this amount the court allowed defendants a credit of $2,046.82 named in the contract of May 6, 1905, with interest, leaving a balance of $1,895.20 due plaintiff and entered judgment therefor. To reverse the judgment, defendants appeal.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b284-8\" pgmap=\"284\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b284-9\" pgmap=\"284\">1.
