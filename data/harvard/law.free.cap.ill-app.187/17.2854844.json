In an action for the purchase price of a multigraph machine, where the defense was that there was a breach of warranty, it appeared that the defendant had kept and used the machine for more than a year from the date of its delivery and that he had employed it for other purposes than that referred to in the warranty. Held that such acceptance and use of the machine constituted a waiver of the breach of warranty and that the warranty did not survive acceptance.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\" pgmap=\"43\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

Defendant sought to avoid payment on the ground that it did not comply with a certain warranty. The contract contained the words, \u201cMachine warranted to do work as sample attached.\u201d The sample was one of defendant\u2019s circulars printed on both sides. The machine would print both sides of a circular as shown by the sample with electrotype but not with loose type, and defendant claims that the warranty related to the use of loose type and not electrotype.
