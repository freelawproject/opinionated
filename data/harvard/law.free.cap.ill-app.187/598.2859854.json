Sales, \u00a7 18<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sustains finding of unqualified acceptance of offer. In an action for the purchase price of a corn shredder claimed to have been sold to defendant, evidence held sufficient to sustain a verdict that there was an unqualified acceptance of plaintiffs offer to sell the shredder, where the facts showed that the defendant, upon being offered the shredder for one hundred dollars, accepted the offer by saying: \u201cYou have bought it, the shredder is yours,\u201d and the defendant then asked if it was in good condition and plaintiff replied that it was, there being conflicting evidence on the question whether the defendant then stated that he would take the shredder if it was in good condition, but no attempt by defendant to prove that he made any complaint to plaintiff regarding the condition of the shredder after he examined it, nor that he gave plaintiff any notice he did not intend to carry out the bargain.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b624-8\" pgmap=\"624\">Appeal from the County Court of Lake county; the Hon.
