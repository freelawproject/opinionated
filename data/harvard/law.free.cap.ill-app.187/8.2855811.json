Bozinch against Chicago Railways Company brought in the Municipal Court of Chicago to recover damages to an automobile caused by a collision with one of defendant\u2019s street cars at a street intersection. Plaintiff recovered a judgment for $409.95, and to reverse the judgment, defendant prosecutes error.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b34-11\" pgmap=\"34(79) 35(59)\">The street car that collided with plaintiff\u2019s automobile was going west on Chicago avenue on the north track and plaintiff was driving south on Hoyne avenue. Plaintiff\u2019s version of the accident was that as he came to Chicago avenue he slackened up for an eastbound car to pass and when it passed in front \u00f3f him he was practically on the westbound track and did not notice the westbound car until it was within two or three feet away from him and he had no time to do anything until he was struck. Defendant\u2019s theory was that when the car reached Hoyne avenue plaintiff had not reached Chicago avenue and that when the street car reached the west cross walk of Hoyne avenue the automobile swerved around the corner and turned directly in front of the car.</p><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-7\" pgmap=\"35\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b35-8\" pgmap=\"35\">Street railroads, \u00a7 144<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction on contributory negligence not prejudicial. In an action to recover damages for injury to plaintiff\u2019s automobile caused by a collision with a street car,, an instruction telling the jury that plaintiff may recover damages for an injury due to defendant\u2019s negligence notwithstanding his own negligence exposed him to the risk of injury, if the injury to the plaintiff was proximately caused by the negligent act or omission of the defendant, after having such notice of the plaintiff\u2019s danger as would put a prudent man on his guard to use. ordinary care to avoid such injury, held to state the settled law of this State and the giving of the same not reversible error, it appearing that the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff furnished a basis for the instruction, and the jury found that plaintiff\u2019s theory of the accident was correct.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-4\" pgmap=\"35\">Edward C.
