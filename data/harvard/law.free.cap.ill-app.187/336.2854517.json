Lettiere against N. L. Blackman and Leonard J. Williams in the Municipal Court of Chicago to recover the sum of ninety-five dollars from defendants for commissions on the sale of certain real estate, which sum, as alleged in the statement of claim, defendants agreed to apply on the purchase price of four lots in Clarkdale, which lots plaintiff agreed to buy, but which defendants on request refused to transfer to plaintiff, after tender to defendants of the balance of the purchase price. Blackman alone was served with summons and he entered his appearance. The summons was returned \u201cnot found\u201d as to Williams. The nature of Blackman\u2019s defense was, as disclosed from his affidavit of merits, that he was not jointly liable with Williams to plaintiff in any sum whatsoever, and that plaintiff was not entitled to recover any commissions from either of the defendants. The cause was tried before the court without a jury, resulting in a finding of the issues against Blackman and the assessment of plaintiff\u2019s damages at the sum of ninety-five dollars. A motion for a new trial was overruled, and judgment was rendered against Black-man for ninety-five dollars and costs, which judgment he seeks by this writ of error to reverse.</p><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-9\" pgmap=\"363\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-10\" pgmap=\"363(61) 364(21)\">1.
