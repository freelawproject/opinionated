Englert filed in the County Court for his release from arrest and imprisonment under the Insolvent Debtors\u2019 Act. The petition alleged that petitioner had been arrested under a writ of ca. sa. issued by the clerk of the Circuit Court in favor of Henry Kors for the sum of five thousand dollars, and that he was in the custody of the sheriff by virtue of said writ. On the same day in which the petition was filed a hearing was had in the County Court and the court entered an order of record in which it found that \u201cmalice was the gist of the action in which judgment was heretofore rendered against said petitioner,\u201d and ordered that Englert be remanded to the custody of the sheriff. To reverse the order, petitioner appeals.</p><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-9\" pgmap=\"493\">George Remus, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-10\" pgmap=\"493\">Moran &amp; Moran, for appellee; Eugene A.

Evidence held sufficient to warrant the County Court in dismissing a petition for a discharge from arrest under a ca. sa. and remanding petitioner to the custody of the sheriff on the ground that malice was the gist of the action, where the declaration introduced in evidence showed the defendant was charged by plaintiff with wickedly and wilfully alienating his wife\u2019s affections and with causing his wife to abandon him and cohabit with defendant, and the order directing the issuance of the ca. sa. introduced in evidence, stated the action was in tort and that the gist of the action was malicious, wicked and wilful.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494\">2. Execution, \u00a7 305*\u2014when petitioner for discharge from arrest-under ca. sa. cannot complain of evidence heard on petition. On appeal from an order of the County Court dismissing a petition for discharge from arrest under a ca. sa. and ordering the petitioner to be remanded to the custody of the sheriff, where it appears that the court found that malice was the gist of the action from the declaration and the order directing the issuance of the ca. sa., which were introduced in evidence, held that the petitioner could not complain that no copy of the judgment was introduced in evidence, where it did not appear from the bill of exceptions that said copy of order and the declaration were all the evidence introduced before the County Court.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
