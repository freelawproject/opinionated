Blair and John M. Boach as receivers of the Chicago Railways Company to recover for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff while in the employ of defendants as a street car conductor. The facts showed that the car on which plaintiff was conductor was run to the end of the line and in order to make the return trip the conductor was required to change the trolley pole to the other end of the car and fix the fenders; that when he went around to such end with the trolley pole he noticed that another car of the company was on the same track in close proximity with his car and asked the motorman of his car- to back up a little; that the conductor then stepped in between the cars and put the trolley on the wire and was standing at the time in the middle of the car, on the fender and that such motorman instead of backing the car caused the car to move forward on account of his failure to properly use the reverse handle, and the conductor\u2019s leg was caught between the bumpers and crushed. To reverse a judgment in favor of plaintiff for six thousand dollars, defendants appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-8\" pgmap=\"491\">Joseph D.
