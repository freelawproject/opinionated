In an action by a clothing firm against a manufacturer of clothing to recover damages for failure of defendant to deliver certain goods ordered through defendant\u2019s sales agent, held that the loss of profits which would have accrued from plaintiffs\u2019 resale of the goods ordered was a proper measure of damages, it appearing that defendant accepted the order with knowledge that the goods so ordered had been sold to plaintiffs\u2019 customers and that by reason of defendant\u2019s failure to supply the same plaintiffs were required to purchase goods on the market at a price in excess of the contract price to supply their customers upon the orders taken.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\" pgmap=\"93\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Though ordinarily, where a vendor fails to comply with his contract to sell and deliver certain goods at a fixed price, the measure of damages in an action by the vendee is the difference between the contract price and the value of the goods in the market at the time and place of delivery, yet where the vendor knows that the vendee has an existing contract for a resale at an advanced price, and that the purchase is to fulfil such contract, and the vendor agrees to supply the goods to enable the vendee to perform his contract, profits which would accrue to the vendee upon performing the contract of resale may properly be said to have entered into the contemplation of the parties in making the contract, and such profits constitute a proper measure of damages.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
