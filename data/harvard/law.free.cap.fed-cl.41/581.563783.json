(1990) referred a pending bill, H.R. 5148, 101st Cong. (1990) (\u201cA bill for the relief of Banfi Products Corporation\u201d) to this Court for proceedings in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">In pertinent part H.R. 5148 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj6\">SECTION 1. SATISFACTION OF CLAIM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">(a) IN GENERAL. \u2014 (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to Banfi Products Corporation, a New York corporation with an office at Old Brookville, New York, a sum of money in compensation for amounts expended by Banfi Products Corporation as a result of the recall in 1985 and 1986 of certain eases of imported Riunite wine based upon the negligent identification by the United States Government of such wine as a health hazard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(2)(A) Amounts expended by Banfi Products Corporation for which compensation under paragraph (1) is made shall include, but not be limited to, amounts expended as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">(i) refunds to distributors of the purchase price of the recalled wine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">(ii) costs, credits, and refunds for recalled wine owned by Banfi and held in inventory at the time of the recall;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">(in) reimbursements to distributors for their transportation, storage, and handling costs associated with the recall; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">(iv) other costs incurred for transportation, destruction, brokerage and custom fees, demurrage, printing, and postage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">(B) Compensation under paragraph (1) shall not be made for loss of anticipated profits or legal fees associated with the recall of the wine described in that paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">(b) CONDITION OF PAYMENT. \u2014 The payment of the sum set forth in subsection (a)(1) shall be in full satisfaction of all claims of Banfi Products Corporation against the United States in connection with the recall described in subsection (a)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">As contemplated by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509, upon receipt of the reference by Congress the matter was assigned to a Judge of this Court, designated as a Hearing Officer. Following extensive pretrial and trial proceedings, the Hearing Officer on November 26, 1997 filed a comprehensive report, subsequently modified by Errata, filed on January 9, 1998. The Hearing Officer\u2019s Report concluded that Banfi Products Corporation, \u201c... does not have a viable legal or equitable claim against the United States and such relief should be denied.\u201d <em>Banfi Products Corp. v. United States, </em>40 Fed.Cl. 107, 141 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">The Hearing Officer\u2019s Report also concluded that, \u201c[a]ny award to the plaintiff would be a gratuity.\u201d 40 Fed.Cl. at 141-142. Following this determination, the Hearing Officer proceeded on the assumption that, at times in Congressional Reference proceedings, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509, the Court has recommended an amount for a gratuity and, as a result, included additional discussion as to a gratuity award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Following the filing of the Hearing Officer\u2019s Report, the parties filed exceptions, or noted an intention to file exceptions, and a briefing schedule was established. After obtaining several extensions of the time for filing briefs, on June 15, 1998, the parties filed a Joint Stipulation withdrawing their exceptions to the Hearing Officer\u2019s Report, as modified by the Errata, filed January 9, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-17\">Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509(d), the Review Panel must proceed to \u201c... adopt or modify the findings or the conclusions of the Hearing Officer.\u201d <em>McQuown v. United States, </em>199 Ct.Cl. 858, 861 (1972).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>After consideration and in the absence of any exceptions filed by the parties, the Review Panel adopts the findings and conclusions of the Hearing Officer with the exception of those portions of the Report concerning the award of a gratuity amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">As the Hearing Officer notes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509(c) does not contemplate that the Court will consider or report any amount due as a \u201cgratuity.\u201d 40 Fed.Cl. at 121. The governing statute provides for a report to Congress as to the \u201c... amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United States to the claimant.\u201d In recent years, the Court has uniformly employed the term \u201cgratuity\u201d as applying to the situation where no legal or equitable claim has been established such that no award is recommended \u2014 that is, any payment would be a \u201cgratuity.\u201d <em>See e.g., Oliver v. United States, </em>217 Ct.Cl. 742 (1978); <em>Arizona Ins. &amp; Inv. Co. v. United States, </em>221 Ct.Cl. 997, 998 (1979); <em>Foss v. United States, </em>217 Ct.Cl. 743 (1978); <em>Sperling &amp; Schwartz, Inc. v. United States, </em>218 Ct.Cl. 625, 627 (1978); <em>Johnstone, Jr. v.

United States, </em>1 Cl.Ct. 270, 280 (1982); <em>Shane v. United States, </em>3 Cl.Ct. 294, 306 (1983); <em>Lance Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>3 Cl.Ct. 762, 780 (1983)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>Sea-Gate, Inc. v. United States, </em>4 Cl.Ct. 25, 38 (1983); <em>California Canners &amp; Growers v. United States, </em>9 Cl.Ct. 774, 786 (1986); <em>White Sands Ranchers of New Mexico v. United States, </em>16 Cl.Ct. 13, 17 (1988); <em>Paul v. United States, 21 </em>Cl.Ct. 758, 767 (1990); <em>Spalding &amp; Son, Inc. v. United States, </em>28 Fed.Cl. 242, 251 (1993); <em>Sneeden v. United States, </em>33 Fed.Cl. 303, 312 (1995); <em>Bear Claw Tribe v. United States, </em>36 Fed.Cl. 181, 192 (1996); <em>Martin v. United States, </em>37 Fed.Cl. 86, 94 (1996); <em>Kanehl v. United States, </em>38 Fed.Cl. 89, 106 (1997); <em>INSLAW, Inc. v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 307, 410 (1997); <em>Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. United States, </em>39 Fed.Cl. 441, 458 (1997). <em>See also </em>M. Bennett, Private Claims Acts and Congressional References, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (Comm. print 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Use of the term \u201cgratuity\u201d other than, as employed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509, to recommend against any payment can have adverse consequences. For example, in <em>Burt v. United States, </em>199 Ct.Cl. 897 (1972) monetary relief was recommended by the Court as an equitable claim. The bill granting relief, H.R. 6624, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., was then amended in committee to recharacterize the award \u201cas a gratuity.\u201d H.Rept. No. 93-441, 93d Cong. 1st Sess. This bill, upon enactment, was vetoed by the President. The veto message explained the President\u2019s action as follows (10 Pres. Doc. 1387 (1974)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-14\">s{\u00ab $ }\u25a0: # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-15\">Approval of H.R. 6624 cannot, in my view, be justified by invoking terms such as \u201cgratuity,\u201d as the awards are characterized in the bill, or \u201cbroad moral considerations,\u201d the basis used by the Court of Claims panel. To adopt such an approach could easily set a precedent for the payment of a myriad of claims involving financial hardship to selected individuals simply on the grounds that they lack legal redress. Once we start down this road, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to turn back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-16\">I urge that in the future Congress adhere to the traditional equity basis for awards, whether or not they have been recommended by the Court of Claims under congressional reference procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-17\">In the instant ease, Congress did not pass a jurisdictional act, as in <em>Mizokami v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>States, </em>188 Ct.Cl. 736, 740, 414 F.2d 1375 (1969), or in any other way add jurisdiction, beyond that set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1492, 2509, to provide the basis for considering and reporting any gratuity award in this matter. This discussion included in the Report constitutes surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2509(d), the Hearing Officer\u2019s Report is modified to delete the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">(1) The words \u201cin comparison to a gratuity\u201d and the last sentence of the first paragraph on page 20 of the Slip Opinion, 40 Fed.Cl. at 122 (in first sentence and last sentence in paragraph before \u201cB. Legal Claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">(2) The \u201cD. Determination of Negligence by FDA in Identifying Riunite as a Health Hazard\u201d section of the Report commencing on page 29, of the Slip Opinion, 40 Fed.Cl. at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">(3) The language commencing \u201cNevertheless\u201d and concluding with \u201caction\u201d in the conclusion of the Report at page 47 of the Slip Opinion, together with footnote 21, 40 Fed.Cl. at 141-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Accordingly, as modified above, the Review Panel adopts the well supported findings and the conclusion of the Hearing Officer that Banfi Products Corporation has neither a viable legal or equitable claim against the United States stemming from the events at issue and that, consequently, any payment to plaintiff would constitute a gratuity.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-12\">.
