Under instructions of the court, we report the facts proved on the trial of the case substantially as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-12\">Dr. J. T. Hensley testified: He was called to see John Baker, the deceased, between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock on the night of December 26, 1892; found him lying on the floor of the Corrigan Hotel, in the village of Merkel, suffering from several incised wounds on the neck and face, which he (witness) did not regard as serious. He also had a gunshot wound in the back; it passed through the eleventh dorsal vertebra, wounding the spinal cord, and the ball lodged just inside the abdominal cavity. This wound was necessarily fatal, and Baker died from the effects of same some twelve or thirteen days afterwards. After his death, he (witness) extracted the bullet from the wound at the post mortem. The witness here produced the ball, and said it looked like a 44 or 45 caliber. This witness also stated, that as he was going to the hotel he noticed the moon, and it was just above the horizon in the west.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b384-13\">Dr. A.

W. Brooks stated, that he was engaged in the saloon and livery business at Merkel. That on the night of December 26, 1892, defendant, Sam Hamblin, Elzy Easterwood, and deceased, John Baker, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of whom he knew, came into his saloon between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock at night. There were a number of persons in the saloon at the time they came. Thinks Feazer, Jinks Clark, and Boyett were there. Heard defendant abusing Baker about something the latter had sworn in a steer case at Sweetwater. \u201cHe said he was a friend to the Cogginses, Bill Barbee, and the Easterwoods; that deceased was a damned son of a bitch, and had sworn to lies. Baker told him he was not armed, and did not want any trouble. Defendant struck him several times in the breast, and then told Baker he had to set up the drinks to the house. Baker told him he did not have any money, and Hamblin said, \u2018Your credit is good,\u2019 and asked me if it was not. I set out perhaps a dozen glasses, and quite a number drank. Defendant drank. I am not certain whether Easterwood and Baker drank. When defendant was abusing Baker, as above stated, Baker put down his hands as if to put them in his pants, when defendant drew his pistol and made him put his hands upon the counter. I told him to let him alone; that I thought he was a first-rate fellow. Defendant replied, \u2018I know him a damned sight better than you do.\u2019 Hamblin struck on a box several times with his pistol, and then jobbed it down barrel end on the counter three or four times, hard enough to make an impression on the eo\u00fanter. I could see part of the pistol. It looked to be a 44 or 45. Hamblin, Easter-wood, and Baker, together with a large crowd, left the saloon about the same time, and when they left defendant had hold of Baker. A short time after they left, defendant came back into the saloon and whispered to me that John Baker said to send him a pint of whisky. I gave him the whisky, and he left, and I saw him no more that night. I closed my saloon and went to my room, and suppose I had been in my room a half or three-quarters of an hour, perhaps not so long, when I heard two pistol shots in the direction of the Corrigan Hotel, and heard a horse running down the road west of the hotel. Heard some one calling, and went over to the hotel, and there found Baker shot.\u201d [This witness described the location of the hotel and streets of the town, and his place of business.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-5\">Bob Martin testified: Was in Merkel on the night of December 26, 1892, attending a dance. The dance broke up about 11 o\u2019clock. That he got his horse and went to the Corrigan Hotel, and was waiting there for John Baker, as they were going home together. \u201cWhile at at the hotel Lem Jeffries came in and spoke to me, and I left immeately to find John Baker. Went to Brooks\u2019 livery stable, and saw some parties standing down by the south gate of the stable lot. I thought I recognized John Baker, and said, \u2018Is that you, Johnnie 1 \u2019 He says, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Isays, \u2018Come on and let\u2019s go home.\u2019 He says, \u2018All right.\u2019 He was with the defendant, Sam Hamblin, and Elzy Easter-wood. There was no one there except those three. We four then started across towards the Corrigan Hotel. Baker was leading his horse, and Sam Hamblin caught hold of the rope on the horse and said, \u2018Hold on; let\u2019s all have a drink.\u2019 And we all took a drink out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of a bottle. We went to the corner of the hotel, I in front. The others stopped at the corner of the hotel, and I went into the office to get my coat and gloves. Met Grant Harris in there, and he proposed that we go to Warren\u2019s and get something to eat. We started to Warren\u2019s, leaving Baker with Sam Hamblin and Elzy Easterwood, standing near the southeast corner of the hotel. I told John Baker to wait a few minutes for me; that I was going to get something to eat. Harris and I went to Warren\u2019s, about 100 yards, and had cut open and were eating some canned goods, when we heard two pistol shots. I got up, leaving Harris, and went out. When I got to Cravens\u2019 corner, across the street from the hotel, I heard a voice like the person was in pain, saying, \u2018O, Bob.\u2019 I could not locate the voice at first, so I ran up toward the livery stable, and stopped when I heard the voice call again, \u2018 O, Bob.\u2019 I thought the sound came from around the hotel, so I ran around the south side to the west side of the hotel, and there found John Baker lying on the ground. Just as I reached him, he said, \u2018Bob, they have killed me/ I said, \u2018Johnnie, who did if?\u2019 He says, \u2018Sam Hamblin and Elzy Easterwood.\u2019 I took him up and carried him to the west end of the gallery, and went in and got Grant Harris and Mr. Corrigan to help me take him into the house. When we got him into the house, I again asked John Baker who hurt him, and he said Sam Hamblin shot him and Elzy Easterwood cut him. That Sam Hamblin shot him twice and then ran off, and that Elzy Easterwood came to him and stooped down, and that he (Baker) said, \u2018Elzy, carry me on the porch,\u2019 and he said, \u2018All right.\u2019 He said Elzy Easterwood took him up and carried him around the vacant house and laid him down and commenced to cut him. It was not over ten or fifteen minutes from the time I left Hamblin, Easterwood, and Baker at the south side of the hotel until I heard the pistol shots. I found him about sixty feet from where I left them to go with Harris to get something to eat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-5\">G. W. Jernigan testified, that he was justice of peace, and as such magistrate he held an examining trial about the last of December, in a case wherein the defendant, Sam Hamblin, and Elzy Easterwood were charged with assault with intent to murder John Baker, on the 26th of December. Defendants were both present in person and by attorneys. That John Baker was not able to be brought to the court room, and that he (the justice), together with the defendants and their attorneys, went to the room of said Baker at the Corrigan Hotel, where Baker was sworn as a witness, and his testimony, both upon examination and cross-examination reduced to writing, and was read over to and was signed by the said John Baker. That said examining trial was for the same assault from the effects of which Baker after-wards died, and which is the basis of this prosecution for murder. That John Baker is dead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">The State then introduced the following as the testimony of John Baker: \u201cMy name is John Baker. On the night of the 26th of De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>cember, 1892, they had a dance up here at the hall. The dance broke about 11 or 12 o\u2019 clock. I came to the stable to get my horse\u2014the stable near Brooks\u2019 saloon. I went into the stable to get my saddle out. I saddled my horse, and went into the saloon to get the boys to go out home with me. Sam Hamblin caught me by the arm, and said, \u2018 Come in here and let\u2019s get a drink.\u2019 We, Sam Hamblin and myself, walked up to the bar. I told him I was broke, and had no money. Hamblin said, \u2018Brooks will credit you.\u2019 Brooks said, \u2018Ho; I can\u2019t credit him.\u2019 He kept on, and Brooks said, \u2018 I will credit him with one drink for the whole house.\u2019 Here awhile back the county officers of Hol\u00e1n County had me up before the grand jury about a steer case, a D B steer that Bill Barbee took from Dulaney, that did not belong to Bar-bee. Hamblin commenced cursing me about going to Sweetwater and swearing a lie against Bill Barbee. He (Hamblin) said if I did go up there and swear that Bill Barbee stole a steer from Dulaney, that it was a God-damn son of a bitch of a lie. He also called me a son of a bitch. He struck me a time or two in the breast, and hit me on the jaw once. I believe I started to put my hands in the waist of my pants, and Hamblin drew his pistol on me and made me put my hands upon the counter. This occurred after I treated the crowd. I told Hamblin to let me go home, as the other boys I was with had gone. I told him I wanted to catch them. Hamblin said, \u2018Ho, damn you; I want you to drink some more.\u2019 Elzy Easterwood was in the saloon at the time I was in there. Easterwood went into the saloon with me and Sam Hamblin. I did not resent any of the abuse Hamblin gave me. We came out of the saloon. I mean by we, Sam Hamblin, Elzy Easterwood, and myself, and we came down the street on the east side of the Corrigan Hotel. We stood in front of the Corrigan Hotel, facing the railroad, and talked awhile. Sam Hamblin said, \u2018Let\u2019s go in between these houses and have something to drink.\u2019 He grabbed me by the arm, and said, \u2018 Come on.\u2019 We went on the west side of the Corrigan Hotel and all took a drink, and then I said, .\u2018Fellows, I must go, sure.\u2019 I started on ahead, leading my horse. I heard Sam Hamblin cock his pistol, and I \u2018sorter\u2019 turned my head. About the time I turned my head, Sam Hamblin fired. I saw the flash of the pistol. I recognized Hamblin. Easterwood was standing by his side. The ball hit me in the small of the back. Then I fell backward. My head was pointing towards the north. When I fell, Sam Hamblin ran around to the right of me and got about south of me and shot again, but did not hit me. They ran in at a gate north of the hotel, at the northwest corner of the hotel. My horse broke loose, and I was trying to scramble around to get on the front porch of hotel, and the first thing I knew, Elzy Easterwood ran right up to the side of me. I said, \u2018Elzy, carry me around here on the front porch.\u2019 He said, \u2018All right,\u2019 and picked me up and went carrying me back the other way to the end of the other house, west of the hotel\u2014to the north end of the old house. He tried to put me inside the door of the old house. I pushed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>on the door and pushed myself back, and he (Blzy Basterwood) pulled out his knife and went to cutting me. He cut me several times around the neck, and then ran away and went right northwest. When Blzy Basterwood carried me to the north end of the old house, he caught me under the arms, and my feet dragged on the ground. When I fell down at the north end of the old house, Blzy Basterwood stooped to his knees and began sticking me with his knife. I knocked off th\u00e9 blows all I could with my hands. I was lying on my back when Basterwood left me. When Basterwood left me I was not able to resist him. I then began to call Bob Martin, and he came and carried m\u00e9 to Corrigan\u2019s Hotel. Ho one helped Martin carry me to the hotel. I was lying out at the old house about a minute when Martin came to me. My horse was tied close to the saloon, to the fence near the livery stable. He was tied to the livery stable fence. At the time Hamblin shot me we had no hard words. My back was turned to him when he shot me. I suppose it was about fifteen minutes after we left the saloon till I was shot. I had only taken one or two drinks when I was shot. I had been drinking but little. I had never had any diffir culty with either one of the parties before. The best of my recollection is, that I was at the end of the old house when Bob Martin found me. Hamblin pointed his pistol to the south when he shot at me the second time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Cross-examined, by the defendants: \u201cI think I am in a condition to remember everything that took place that night; my recollection seems to be as good now as it was before I was hurt. I got in town that evening about 4 o\u2019 clock. I saw Hamblin and Basterwood about ten minutes after I got in town. We met and spoke friendly. I attended the ball in Merkel that night. Basterwood and Hamblin were at the ball. They both took part in the ball. I think both danced, but am not sure. The ball broke up about 11 or 12 o\u2019clock. I don\u2019t remember saying anything to Basterwood and Hamblin at the ball, but I passed them several times in the hall. They seemed friendly all during the dancing. I came down to the saloon from the hall by myself. I believe some men were in front of me and some behind me. I went in the saloon by myself. Bob Martin and George Burch were all the men in the saloon when I first went in. I think I staid in and around the saloon about an hour or more. I think Hamblin and Basterwood came to the saloon about a minute after I came. Heither one spoke to me when they first came in; it was twenty-five minutes I guess before they spoke to me. Sam Hamblin first spoke to me and wanted me to treat, and commenced about the steer. He said, \u2018John, treat. God damn you, what is the matter with you?\u2019 I told him that I was broke; I had no money. He spoke \u2018sorter\u2019 short, like he was mad. I had had no difficulty with him up to that t\u00edme. I don\u2019t remember that Basterwood said anything up to that time. I treated the first time. Hamblin and Basterwood drank with me; five or six drank when I treated. Hamblin and Basterwood drank with me. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Hamblin then began to swear out about that beef. The brand on the steer was D B, and located on the left hip. Hamblin said it was the D B steer that Barbee was accused of stealing. I don\u2019t remember whether he said it was Dulaney\u2019s or not. Hamblin, in talking about the steer, talked like he was mad. Hamblin called me a son of a bitch. Up to that time, as far as I know, our relations were friendly. At the time Hamblin was talking about the steer, I do not remember Easterwood saying anything about the steer. Easterwood and I were friendly up to that time. Sam Hamblin had a pistol in the saloon. I got a glimpse of his pistol in the saloon, but I don\u2019t know what the caliber was. Hamblin had it in his right hand when I saw it. He did not attempt to shoot off his pistol in the saloon. I don\u2019t remember all who were in the saloon at the time. Elzy Easterwood, Grant Harris, Bill Barbee, and several others were in the saloon. At the time I went down to the saloon by myself, and Hamblin abused me, I reckon I was there about twenty-five minutes. This was the last time I was at the saloon that night. I went up to the Corrigan Hotel, as I told you before, and then we went around the house. We came down on the east side of the hotel. The hotel is about southeast of the saloon. The saloon is about seventy-five yards from the hotel. Ho one was with me when I went to the hotel, except Hamblin and Easter-wood. My horse was hitched near the saloon to the livery stable fence. I led my horse as we came to the h'otel. We stopped five or ten or fifteen minutes in front of the hotel. I don\u2019t remember exactly \u25a0how long on the south side of the hotel. We talked about the steer, and first one thing and then another. I don\u2019t remember that Easter-wood said anything about the steer as we were standing in front of the hotel. In the conversation, Easterwood and Hamblin sometimes talked friendly and then they talked mad. We talked and laughed some. We took a drink while we were there, and Hamblin furnished the whisky. Hamblin invited me to drink with him. Hamblin did not go back into the saloon the last time. I was in the saloon with Hamblin and Easterwood twice that night. Sam Hamblin suggested that we take a walk down to the hotel. I don\u2019t know the time we left the hotel that night, whether it was before or after 12 o\u2019 clock. I think it was as late as 11 o\u2019clock. I could not say whether it was as late as 12 o\u2019clock or not. I stood and held my horse in front of Corrigan\u2019s Hotel. I drank once in front of the hotel. I don\u2019t think I drank any more. I made an effort to start home, and Hamblin said, \u2018Hold on; let\u2019s have another drink;\u2019 and he caught hold of my arm and led me around the house, and we took another drink. Then I said, \u2018Boys, I must pull home,\u2019 and I started off. I heard Hamblin cock his pistol, and as I looked around he shot. I went, I reckon, about five steps from where we took the first drink before I was shot. I don\u2019t think the moon was shining; it was a starlight night. Hamblin was about five steps from me when he shot. Easterwood was standing beside Hamblin when Hamblin shot me. I am positive Ham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>blin shot me. He shot me with a pistol. I saw the glimpse of the pistol. He shot at me twice. He only hit me once\u2014the first shot. It was not overly dark when he shot me. I was between Corrigan\u2019s Hotel and the old house when Hamblin shot me. He walked to my right, shot at me again, and then went through a gate at the corner of the hotel, and that was the last I saw of him. The last time Hamblin shot at me, he was four Or five steps from me. He was standing on the north side when he first shot, and on the south side when he shot again. Easterwood was still on the north side of me when Hamblin shot the second time. He never ran around with Hamblin. The second time Hamblin shot they both went northeast in the direction of the gate at the corner of the hotel. I saw Hamblin no more that night. Easterwood came back, and I asked him to carry me to the front of the hotel, and he picked me up and dragged me the other way, behind the old house. Easterwood came back in a minute or a half a minute. I was shot along about 11 or 12 o\u2019clock, or maybe after 12. I can\u2019t say for certain. It was five, ten, or fifteen minutes, somewhere along there, after I left the saloon before I was shot. Elzy Easterwood cut me about the face and neck. He cut me with a knife. I saw the knife; it was a long knife, but not very large. It was a slender blade. I don\u2019t know the color of the handle. I am positive it was a pocket knife he cut me with. I was at the north end of the old house when Easterwood cut me. He cut me five or six times. He never said a word while he was cutting me. I could tell men I knew well, that night, five or ten steps. I could tell them by their figures and by their faces. The man that shot me had on a dark striped suit of clothes. He had on a black hat and a light overcoat, and I think it was a ducking overcoat. The overcoat was not buttoned at the time he shot me. The man that cut me had on a dark suit of clothes; I think he had on a black hat, but don\u2019t know for sure. The man that cut me would weigh about 165 or 170. The man that cut me had no beard on his face, but was shaved all but his mustache. His mustache was light; he did not have a heavy mustache. I think the one that cut me has blue eyes; I ain\u2019t sure, but I think he has. The man that shot me had a beard on his face. He had a chin beard. Bob Martin was the first to come to me after Easterwood left. He took me into Corrigan\u2019s Hotel. Nobody helped Bob to carry me into the hotel. I have known Sam Hamblin about two years. I first met him in Abilene, Texas. Nobody introduced us. We were at the court house steps. I have seen him frequently since that time. I have known Elzy Easterwood about five years. We, Easterwood, Hamblin, and myself, have always been on good terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-3\">HIS</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">[Signed] \u201cJohn x Baker.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">MARK</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">George Hunter testified, that he was at the ball; that it broke up between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock; that he went to Brooks\u2019 saloon, where he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>saw Elzy Easterwood, Sam Hamblin, and John Baker. In a few minutes after he got there, these parties left the saloon. About five minutes afterwards, Hamblin returned and whispered something to Brooks, and Brooks handed Hamblin a bottle of whisky, and Hamblin went out. Soon thereafter he and Jim Feazor started home, and at Cravens\u2019 corner saw several persons at the south side of Brooks\u2019 livery stable, near the gate to the fence. At Cravens\u2019 corner saw Elzy Easter wood, who said to witness, \u201cI must lope over there,\u201d and he went over to Corrigan\u2019s Hotel. Witness then went home and went to bed, and just as he got in bed he heard two shots fired. This was between twenty and twenty-five minutes after he had met Baker and Hamblin at the saloon. When he last saw Easterwood, after they parted, he (Easterwood) was going in the direction of the old vacant house, near which Baker was shot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">George Baggett testified, that he was at the ball, arid after it broke up went down to Cravens\u2019 corner, and while there heard some shooting-near the saloon, and heard some women scream over at the hotel. After this, saw some men and women leave the hotel and go northwest. He then went to Brooks\u2019 saloon to get Boyet, who was drunk, and there saw Baker, Hamblin, Elzy Easterwood, and others. Got Boyet and came back as far as Cravens\u2019 corner, where Boyet left him, and went back to the saloon. He says: \u201cI went again for him, and as I came back saw Hamblin and John Baker on the south side of the livery stable. At the corner of the stable I met Elzy Easterwood coming- from the direction of the hotel. I asked him to help me with Boyet. He said, \u2018I have a man of my own to look after.\u2019 This was after I had seen the women leave the hotel. I had made one trip to the saloon, carried Boyet off, and had gone back after him the second time. Boyet left me and went to the saloon again, and I went after him the third time, and on this trip I saw Hamblin, Easterwood, and John Baker on the south side of the livery stable. I carried Boyet to his barber shop. A few minutes after I got to the shop, Lem Jeffries came to the shop and handed me Boyet\u2019s pistol. This was after I had made the last and third trip to the saloon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">Will Hamner testified, that he and John Baker had come to town together, and after the ball they went to the stable to get their horses, as they were going the same road home. He went in the stable for his saddle, and when he came out Baker was gone. He went to the hotel, hitched his horse, and waited about ten minutes for Baber. He then went out to where he had hitched his horse, and found the horse gone. He went after the horse, and finding him about a quarter of a mile west, started on home. A short distance from the railroad tank, which was about two or two and one-half miles from Merkel, Baker\u2019s horse, which was running rapidly, passed witness, and witness, thinking something was wrong, went back to town and found Baker shot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-8\">Jim Corrigan testified: Was keeping a hotel in Merkel the night of the 26th of December, 1892. After the ball broke up, Hendrix and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>wife, Barbee and wife, and Elzy Esterwo'od and wife, came to the hotel, remained sometime, and then left. About twenty minutes after they left, witness heard two shots fired west of his hotel, and soon after Bob Martin came in and said John Baker was shot. Bob Martin, Grant Harris, and myself carried Baker into my house, where, in answer to a question as to who hurt him, Baker said, \u201cSam Hamblin shot me, and Elzy Easterwood cut me.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">H. C. Hayter testified, that the morning after Baker was shot he examined the ground very early.

Boyett, that after said examining trial, and on the night before said John Baker died, he, the said John Baker, stated to the said witnesses that he, the said Baker, was not certain that Elzy Basterwood was one of the parties who committed the assault on him, the said Baker, and which assault subsequently resulted in his death. * * * It was expressly stated by counsel for defendant at the time, that the declarations were not offered as dying declarations.\u201d This was objected to by the State\u2019s counsel, because not made as dying declarations, because no proper predicate had been laid, and the statement was hearsay. This evidence was not objectionable as hearsay. 1 Phil. Ev., 177, 318. As set forth in the bill, the evidence should have been admitted. The State having introduced the evidence of the deceased witness, it was not necessary for appellant to lay the usual predicate for the introduction of impeaching testimony. It was impossible to do so. Upon this question the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>cisions may be divided, but it would seem to us that justice would demand that such evidence should be admitted where the State introduces the evidence of a deceased witness. The rule that it is unfair to attack the credit of such a witness without affording an opportunity to explain should be subordinated to the rights of the accused, whose life is sought, as well as the higher interests of society. The law which is seeking the life and liberty of the citizen for an alleged infraction of its provisions has thrown around that citizen the presumption of innocence, and the reasonable doubt of guilt, under the evidence; and it would be a harsh rule, indeed, to admit the evidence of a witness given on another trial, and make this evidence absolutely true by eliminating all opportunity of discrediting it. This would seem to obliterate the hope of eliciting the truthfulness of such testimony, and leave the accused at the mercy of the evidence of a witness who may have admitted the falsity of his statements and his corrupt motives for so testifying. If the rule be a sound one that the evidence of a dead witness can. be reproduced, then it should follow that his testimony could be attacked in any way that any other witness may be impeached. In his work on Evidence, Mr. Stephens says: \u201cWhenever any declaration or statement made by a deceased person relevant, or deemed to be relevant, under articles 25-33, both inclusive, or any deposition, is proved, all matters may be proved in order to contradict it, or in order to impeach or confirm the credit of the person by whom it was made which might have been proved if that person had been called as a witness, and had denied upon cross-examination the truth of the matter suggested.\u201d Steph. Dig. Ev., p. 191, art. 135. See same work, article 32, and note 22 in appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The writer is unable to perceive the distinction between impeachment of dying declarations, by proving contradictory statements, and thus attacking the reproduced testimony of the witness taken on an examining trial, whether the same reason would or would not operate to authorize the introduction of such dying declarations or examining trial evidence as original testimony. That dying declarations maj thus be impeached is well settled, we think, and correctly so. For discussion of these questions, see Felder v. The State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 477; Morelock v. The State (Tenn.), 18 S. W. Rep., 258; Steele v. The State, 7 S. W. Rep., 40; Patterson v. Dushane (Pa. Sup.), 20 Atl. Rep., 538. The life and liberty of the citizen is worth more than the supposed fairness or unfairness of the treatment of a witness. To our minds the doctrine is too harsh for toleration, that the life of the accused may be taken on such evidence, and yet he be denied the right to impeach the veracity of the witness who gives such testimony. Such impeachment evidence, however, may be so weak or remote as not to require a reversal; or the evidence of guilt may be so strong and conclusive, independently of such testimony, as to render harmless the rejection of such impeachment. In such state of case it would not be required to reverse the judgment or grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>new trial in the first instance. Such we believe to be the case before us. The evidence of guilt is so conclusive against appellant and Basterwood, that no jury seeking to do their duty would or ought to have honestly returned a verdict otherwise than of murder, if the proposed evidence had been received. If the proposed evidence had been admitted, it tended to raise a doubt only as to the presence of Elzy Basterwood at the homicide, but none as to appellant. The deceased\u2019s testimony taken at the examining trial, as well as his statements at the time and place of the shooting, are clear, strong, and unequivocal that appellant and Elzy Basterwood acted together in committing the homicide; and it may be admitted that the State\u2019s case hinged largely upon the fact that these two parties acted together in slaying deceased. If doubt could be thrown upon the presence of Basterwood at the homicide, it would tend to impair the strength of the State\u2019s case against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">While we think the offered testimony was admissible, yet, in view of this record and cogency of the criminative evidence against appellant, its rejection is not of sufficient importance to require a reversal of this judgment. We are unable to see how any other conclusion could have been reached than that of guilt; that the killing was murder in the first degree\u2014murder upon express malice. Bor is there reasonable doubt that appellant fired the fatal shot terminating the life of the deceased. We can not preceive from this record how a more favorable verdict could have been rendered by an honest jury. The evidence is clear and conclusive that the two parties acted together; that appellant shot deceased in the back, and Elzy Basterwood cut his neck several times, in an attempt to cut his throat, after he was shot down and helpless, and this, too, while the deceased was begging his kind offices and friendship. The killing was a cold-blooded and heartless one, and assassination solely for the purpose of destroying the testimony of deceased in a cattle-stealing case, coolly composed and boldly executed. The remaining questions are not of sufficient merit to require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Finding n*o errors of sufficient importance to require a reversal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b402-8\">Henderson, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A95\">concurs in the conclusion reached, but expresses no opinion as to the admissibility of the proposed impeaching testimony in the absence of a predicate.
