It certainly charged the oifense of slander, and the meaning of the language used is sufficiently stated by innuendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-10\">2. There is no error in the general charge of the court. It is sufficiently comprehensive, and, with the special charges requested and given, presented the case to the jury as favorably to appellant as he could ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-11\">3. The appellant complains that the court erred in permitting the county attorney to ask the witness what appellant meant by saying that \u201cEd Henry was monkeying with July Chambliess,\u201d and in permitting the witness to answer that \u201csaid Henry was having carnal knowledge of her,\u201d because the question called for the opinion of the witness, who should state only what was said, and not what was meant, that being a question for the jury. The complaint alleges that appellant used the language, and, by innuendo, stated it meant \u201cHenry was having carnal knowledge of her, the said July Chambliess.\u201d Can the matter alleged by innuendo be proven? It is held in this State, that the truth of an innuendo may be proven. In Riddle\u2019s case, 30 Texas Criminal Appeals, 426, Judge White says, that having alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>the slanderous words with an innuendo which would go to establish an offense, if proved, it was necessary to prove the innuendo as substantially as the slanderous words themselves. See also Berry\u2019s case, 27 Texas Crim. App., 484; 2 Whart. Crim. Law, 8 ed., sec. 1661. It is true, Mr. Bishop says an innuendo does not admit of being sustained by proof. Bish. Grim. Proe., 793; Townsh. Sland. and L., secs. 335, 342. This is where, under the rules of criminal pleading, the circumstances necessary to explain the meaning of slanderous words are stated in the indictment by way of inducement, and the only office of the innuendo is to refer the libelous words to the facts so set forth. 13 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, p. 501, sec. 4; Townsh. Sland. and L., secs. 129, 308, and notes 1, 2; Id., secs. 335-337. With us, the office of the innuendo is enlarged to explain the meaning of the language spoken, and we dispense with the inducement or colloquium, and the innuendo may be proven. How, where the words are obviously defamatory, or are clear and unambiguous, whether defamatory or not, the court and jury, and not the witnesses, construe the words; and a witness can not be asked how he understood the words, nor what impression was produced oh his mind on hearing them, and the words are to be construed in their ordinary and usual sense. When, on the other hand, the language is ambiguous as to its import or signification, and the words used are not ordinary, but are local, technical, or slang terms, evidence is admissible to explain their meaning, and the testimony of hearers is admissible as to how they understood the words. The question is in what sense the hearer understood the words, for slander and damage consist not in the intent of the speaker, but in the apprehension of the hearers. Townsh. Sland. and L., secs. 127, 384; Dorland v. Patterson, 23 Wend., 424; Demarest v. Haring, 6 Cow., 76; Smart v. Blanchard, 42 N. H., 137; Barton v. Holmes, 16 Iowa, 252; Smith v. Miles, 15 Vt., 245; .13 Am. and Eng. Encyc. of Law, 385. But such testimony, which is admitted to show what meaning hearers of common understanding would and did ascribe to the words, is not conclusive on the jury. Nelson v. Borchenius, 52 111., 236; Vanderlip v. Roe, 23 Pa. St., 82; Wimer v. Allbaugh (Iowa), 42 N. W. Rep., 587.

The appellant in his motion contends, that the indictment is defective as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the charge \u201cthat appellant did falsely and maliciously impute a want of chastity to July Chambliess, by saying that one Ed Henry was monkeying with said July Chambliess, and doing what he pleased with her, meaning that the said Henry was having carnal knowledge of her, the said July Chambliess.\u201d We think the indictment is unquestionably good. <em>Nor, in </em>our opinion, is there any variance between the names \u201cJuly Chambliess,\u201d as alleged in the indictment, and \u201cJulia Chambliess,\u201d as proven, \u201cJuly\u201d and \u201cJulia\u201d being idem sonans. In the opinion heretofore rendered in this case, this court held that it was competent to prove by a witness who heard the slanderous words what he understood them to mean. We have re-examined the question, and in our opinion, this is not the correct doctrine in criminal cases. In civil cases, where the words spoken are ambiguous, some of the authorities allow this; but they are by no means uniform. See Barton v. Holmes, 15 Iowa, 252. In that case it was said: \u201cSuch testimony is received not to ascertain the words, for they are directly proved, nor to learn the sense in which the speaker intended to be understood, for his intentions are immaterial, since they can not limit the injury or atone for the wrong, nor is it to ascertain the correct definition of the words used, but simply to determine how the hearers understood them.\u201d It will be noticed that one of the grounds assigned is with reference to the intentions of the party uttering the words, and it is stated that these are immaterial. This may be true in a civil case, as to proof of an element of damage, but in a criminal case the intention of a party uttering the words is the very gist of the offense. Mr. Bishop, than whom there is no higher authority in all questions of criminal law (2 Bish. Grim. Proc., sec. 793), says: \u201cAn innuendo is an explanatory averment of the meaning. It charges no fact, and it does not admit of being sustained by evidence; the pleader, having in the colloquium and elsewhere stated all the extrinsic and other facts desired, introduces into his recitation of the libelous words, when necessary, the expression \u2018meaning so and so,\u2019 and this is called an \u2018innuendo.\u2019 Alleging nothing, it neither adds to nor qualifies any previous allegation; but if, for example, a word has two significations, and the preceding averments have laid the foundation for the one claimed, the innuendo may say that this is the one meant.\u201d \u201cStill the jury, to convict, must be satisfied that the meaning of the libelous words is what they allege it to be. This is a question for them, not for the court.\u201d Id., sec. 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-7\">It will be observed in this case that the words charged in the indictment were not only the words \u201cmonkeying with her,\u201d but in the same connection, and a part of the same sentence, \u201cand doing with her as he pleased;\u201d and the evidence of the witness not only shows the use of such words in that connection, but witness also stated that, as apart of the expression of the defendant, and in connection with said words, the defendant said that the party spoken of was \u201cramming it to her.\u201d In our opinion, the words spoken were not ambiguous, and could, to the ordinary understanding, have but one signification, and required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>no explanation. They were actionable per se in a civil suit. Elam v. Badger, 23 Ill., 498; Townsh. Sland. and L., sec. 172. According to Mr. Bishop (section 799): \u201cIt is the duty of the jury to construe plain words and clear allusions to matters of universal notoriety according to their obvious meaning, and as everybody else who reads them must understand them.\u201d In order to enable the jury to arrive at the meaning of a local phrase not well defined and in general use, an innuendo may become necessary; and in such case witnesses may testify as to the signification or meaning of such words in the locality. Commonwealth v. Morgan, 107 Mass., 202. And, moreover, the courts all agree that it is competent to prove facts and circumstances attending the speaking of the words, the situation of the parties, and their relations to the subject matter or occasion of the slander, and any other portions or all of the same conversations. This testimony is admitted in order to enable the jury to correctly determine the ultimate fact, to wit, in what sense the words were uttered. In this case, while we hold that it was not proper for the court to have admitted the testimony of the witness as to what he understood the defendant to mean by the words used, yet we fail to see how the defendant suffered any prejudice thereby, as the words themselves clearly and unequivocally indicated the meaning appellant intended to convey; and the jury trying the case could have arrived at no other conclusion in regard to the defendant\u2019s meaning in using such language. Barton v. Holmes, 16 Iowa, 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The motion for rehearing in this case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
