B. Short, I killed the hog about 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the evening. I skinned the hog; would have scalded it, but had nothing to scald it in. When I skinned the hog I took the skin and hid it, to keep the said A. B. Short from finding it. I hid the hide near the river in a drift. I took the meat of the hog and hid it in the brush in a hollow. I had the meat covered up with rocks. The meat that Henry Piper brought to my camp I think was the same that I hid in the hollow. I threw the head in the hollow, about 300 yards from where I hid the meat. I shot the hog in the head, and it came out below the shoulder. The drag and blood we saw this morning is not the drag of one I killed. My father told me that he had about ten head of hogs in the woods, and some unmarked; told me if I saw any of them to kill them. I didn\u2019t know that the hog was A. B. Short\u2019s until he came and drove them off.

The said statement was made while said Henry Tabor was under arrest, and was not fully and fairly made without compulsion or persuasion; all of which objections the court overruled and permitted said statement to be used in evidence to the jury, and to the action of the court in so doing defendant tenders this bill of exception and asks that the same be signed, sealed, and made a part of the record in this cause, which is done.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-8\">This bill is given with the following qualification: \u201cSaid statement was not introduced by the State in evidence until defendant had, on cross-examination of State witnesses, introduced oral statements made by the defendant in regard to what was said at said time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-9\">The judge ruled, that he would not allow the statement to go in evidence as a judicial instrument proving itself, but would permit the statement to go to the jury with the other testimony in the case as to whether or not it was the true statement of defendant, and upon this ruling of the judge the State attempted to prove up and establish the statement as it was, and the defendant by cross-examination attempted to show it was not the statement of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b649-10\">The witness A. B. Short being upon the stand and testifying for the State, having been fully examined by the State as to what he said and and those with him said and did to defendant after arresting him, and from the date of the arrest until and including the examining trial before said A. B. Short, the said A. B. Short was turned over by the State to be cross-examined by the defendant\u2019s counsel, and so being turned over to be cross-examined, defendant\u2019s counsel proposed to ask said A. B. Short if- he did not have malice against the family of defendant, including him, and if it had not originated because of said witness having taken a sow from the father of defendant and had cut the ears off, and that the father of defendant stated to said A. B. Short, that the said sow was his sow and that he was certain of it, but that he would let her go, though it was his sow; and that at another time the said A. B. Short had taken some 200 cedar posts, the property of the father of defendant, without his consent, and the father of defendant had charged said A. B. Short with the theft of the sain\u00e9; and that each and all of these occurrences were about a year before the date defendant is alleged to have taken said hog, and that for these things malice existed against defendant on the part of said A. B. Short; that the district attorney objected to the introduction of this testimony as irrelevant and immaterial, and the court sustained the said objection,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>and ruled the same out as irrelevant and immaterial evidence in the case. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-3\">Defendant\u2019s seventh ground of error is as follows: \u201cThe witness A. B. Short being upon the witness stand and testifying for the State, having been fully examined by the State as to what he said and did from the arrest of defendant up to and including the trial, and after having fully stated the same, he was turned over by the State to the defendant to be cross-examined, and upon such cross-examination the defendant asked the said A. B. Short the following question: \u2018Did you or those with you drink any wine or intoxicating liquors at the time you had the defendant under arrest, and at the time you are testifying about?\u2019 to which question the said A. B. Short replied, yes, they drank Texas wine. Defendant\u2019s counsel then asked, \u2018How much did you drink?\u2019 The district attorney objected to this question and the answer sought to be elicited thereby, because the same was irrelevant and immaterial. The court sustained such objection, and refused to permit said witness to answer; to all of which the defendant objected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b650-6\">Defendant\u2019s eleventh ground for error is as follows: \u201cThe testimony of the State being in, and the State having rested on its evidence, the defendant moved the court to require the district attorney to select which one of the two hogs developed in the testimony\u2014the one whose skin had been found by Frank Covey on Tuesday, that had been killed a day or two before, or the one killed on Friday thereafter\u2014as the State could not try him on both cases on the indictment alleging the theft of only one hog.

The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment. Article 748, title 17, chapter 11, of Willson\u2019s Criminal Laws, is as follows: \u201cTheft of Sheep, Hogs, etc.\u2014How Punished.\u2014If any person shall steal any sheep, hog, or goat, he shall, if the value of the property is twenty dollars or over, be punished by confinement in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years.

The State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 391; Stone v. Brown, 54 Texas, 342; The State v. McCracken, 42 Texas, 383; Hasselmeyer v. The State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 690; Giddings v. San Antonio, 47 Texas, 548; Breen v. Railway, 44 Texas, 302; Austin v. Railway, 45 Texas, 267; Day Co. v. The State, 68 Texas, 542; Gunter v. Land and Cattle Co., 82 Texas, 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b651-9\">It is contended, under the caption of the amendatory act of the Twenty-third Legislature, set out above, that only in article 748, where it was in the original article, could the Legislature treat of or legislate on the subject matter\u2014\u201chog;\u201d that this subject matter was in the original articles, in article 748, and not in article 747, as in act of amendment. That in an amendatory act amending only by numbers of title, chapter, and articles, the caption does not give notice of the introduction of any new foreign subject matter in either article, but contemplates dealing with the subject matters as they are in the articles. In taking out of article 748 the subject matter hog, and leaving it out entirely, the Legislature, under the caption of the amendatory act, had the right so to do; but it did not have the right to insert it in article 747, because it was foreign subject matter to any subject matter in that article, and the caption of the amendatory act did not authorize such. A proper caption to this amendatory act, worded to authorize the Legislature to take the subject matter hog out of article 748 and insert it in article 747, would be as follows: \u201cAn act to amend articles 747 and 748, chapter 11, title 17, of the Penal Code, by taking the subject matter hog out of article 748 and inserting it in article 747, after the word cattle,\u201d or words to this effect, that indicate the taking of the subject matter hog out of one article, where the caption places it, and putting it in another. It is contended, that under the caption of this amendatory act the Legislature, in violation of it, took the subject matter hog out of article 748 and inserted it in article 747, and in consequence of which the article, as to that sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>ject matter, is void. Under this caption the Legislature could, letting the subject matter remain in each article as it was, deal with it as it saw fit, but not otherwise; and having done otherwise, the act, as to the subject matter hog, to deal with is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-5\">The law making the theft of a hog a felony is unconstitutional and void, in that the object of inserting the subject matter hog in article 747, embracing only cattle, is unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-6\">The law making the theft of a hog a felony is unconstitutional, in that the said act is not enacted and passed by the Legislature in accordance with the Constitution of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-7\">The indictment in this cause is not a legal and valid indictment, and does not charge an offense against the Constitution and laws of the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-8\">2. The court erred in admitting as evidence the written statement of the defendant, made before A. B. Short, justice of the peace of precinct number 3 of Kendall County, Texas, for any purpose whatever, as the same was not freely and fairly made, without compulsion or persuasion, voluntarily, and after defendant had been cautioned that it might be used against him; and further, the said A. B. Short being the owner of the hog defendant is alleged to have stolen, and the said A. B. Short, sitting as a justice of the peace in a case in which he was thus interested, and the said statement being made in and to him as an examining magistrate sitting in judgment upon defendant and requiring him to plead and to give such evidence, the same was inadmissible for any purpose whatever. Const. 1876, art. 5, sec. 11; 4 Sayles\u2019 Civ. Stats., p. 541; Code Crim. Proc., arts. 749, 750; Wills. Crim. Stats., p. 224; Code Crim. Proc., art. 569; Wills. Crim. Stats., p. 161; Code of Crim.

Stats, secs. 2469, 2470, 2465, 2466, 2477, 2471, p. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-9\">This statement was not admissible for any purpose; the statement does not of itself show the case in which it was taken. A. B. Short was, in the language of the Constitution, interested in the case in which he was sitting as an examining magistrate, and was also the injured party. Article 5 of section 11 of the Constitution, cited above, states, if he is interested in the case he shall not sit as judge; and article 569 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states, that if he is the injured party he is likewise subject to the same disqualification. A. B. Short sitting as justice of the peace, and trying this man for the theft of his own hog, was a nullity, an illegality ab initio; the evidence he proposed to take was a farce, and this statement is a rank contraband of the law, and good for nothing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b652-10\">In addition to A. B. Short being disqualified from holding this court by virtue of the law, the statement was not freely and fairly made. Appellant was a prisoner, was brought into this quondam court, and was told that, a legal and valid case was against him, and that the trial was on, and that he could make a statement if he wished. Kow, if the court was illegal and fraudulent, the practices of the judge on ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>pellant, by which he operated upon appellant\u2019s mind and obtained the statement, are the basest of undue influences, and a prostitution of the powers of the court and the uses of the law to deceive and cheat. This statement, if not good as a judicial document, is worthless as a free and voluntary act of appellant without persuasion or compulsion. Code Crim. Proc., art 751; Wills. Crim. Laws, pp. 227, 228; Davis v. The State, 3 Texas Grim. App., 91; Stockman v. The State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 387; Massey v. The State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 563.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-5\">3. The court erred in excluding evidence of ill will and previous quarrels and difficulties between A. B. Short and defendant. Defendant was entitled to prove the difficulties by the prosecutor Short in order to show his animus and malice, or in case he denied them, then to impeach him in regard to them. Wilburn v. The State, 41 Texas, 237; Cesure v. The State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 19; Persons v. The State, 3 Texas Crim. App., 241; Fore v. The State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 251; Rosborough v.

App., 332.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-6\">4. The court erred in holding that it was inadmissible to ask the prosecutor, Short, if, on the night before the trial, he (the witness) and others having defendant in charge, were not engaged in drinking-wine and playing cards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-7\">Defendant expected to show by said witness, that while defendant was under arrest on the night before the trial before said A. B. Short, as magistrate, and while and when some of the important things that said Short had testified about were happening, he, the said Short, and those with him were playing cards and drinking wine, and at that identical time said Short and those with him were posing and pretending to act as officers of the law and conservators of the peace; and also to show by said Short what effect said wine had on them. The district attorney objected to said questions and such evidence as irrelevant and immaterial, and the court excluded the same, and would not permit said questions to be asked or said evidence to go to the jury. Stevens v. The State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 39; Thompson v. The State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 51; Daffin v. The State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 76; Blunt v. The State, 9 Texas Crim. App., 234; Sims v.

App., 361.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b653-8\">The testimony of the State being in, and the State having rested on its evidence, the defendant moved the court to require the district attorney to select which one of the two hogs developed in the testimony \u2014the one whose skin had been found by Frank Covey on Tuesday, that had been killed a day or two before, or the one killed on Friday thereafter\u2014as the State could not try him on both cases on the indictment alleging the theft of only one hog. This the court declined to do, and permitted the State to go to the jury on the evidence as it was.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>Mann Trice, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b654-5\">HENDERSON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_L\">The appellent was tried and convicted for theft of a hog, and his punishment assessed at two years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary, and from the judgment and sentence of the lower court he prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The appellant contends, that the court-erred in refusing to quash the indictment in this case, the grounds of his contention being that the caption of the Act of March 15, 1893, amending articles 747 and 748 of the Criminal Code, is obnoxious to section 35, article 3, of the Constitution, because said caption does not embrace the subject matter contained in the amendments of said acts. It has been held by the Supreme Court and by this court, that our Penal Code can be amended by reference to the articles thereof. The State v. McCracken, 42 Texas, 383; Nichols v. The State, 32 Texas Criminal Reports, 391. The caption of the act in question embraces and refers to these two articles of the Penal Code, and the two articles set out in full, as amended. But it is contended that the word \u201chog\u201d could not be transposed and legislated on in article 747. No tangible reason is afforded us why this could not be done. The object of the amendment, as declared in the title of the act, was to amend said two articles of the Penal Code, and in our opinion it was entirely competent for the Legislature to insert the word \u201chog\u201d in article 747, taking it out of 748, and making it a felony; and we fail to discern how this could be construed as-violative of the provision of the Constitution alluded to under the caption in question. There is no incongruity in uniting the animals \u201ccattle\u201d and \u201chogs\u201d in the same article of the statute, and making both felonies, and the making, by this legislation, theft of hogs a felony, regardless of their value, could not operate a surprise and fraud upon the public and the Legislature which enacted the bill, and, as we understand, the purposes of the constitutional provision was merely to prescribe a rule which would put the Legislature on notice of the essential elements of the law to be enacted; and, ordinarily, when the Legislature has acted in the selection of a title, their power to do so and to embrace legislation within .such caption is construed liberally in favor of the constitutionality of the enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Appellant assigns as error the admitting as evidence of the written statement of the defendant, made before A. B. Short, justice of the peace of precinct number 3, of Kendall County, on the ground that A. B. Short, the justice of the peace, was the owner of the hogs, and that he was not authorized to preside at the examining trial of defendant, and that the statement made by defendant before him as an examining magistrate was invalid, and could not be taken as a judicial confession; and moreover, that the said appellant, before making his statement, was not cautioned as the law requires. The bill of exceptions, as explained by the court, shows that said statement was not admitted as a statement made in judicial proceedings, but was merely made as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the statement of appellant to any person, after having been duly warned, according to the statute; and besides, the court, at the instance of the defendant, fully charged the jury that same was not admitted as the statement of defendant, made in a judicial proceeding, and authorized the jury to wholly disregard the said confession, unless they believed from all the evidence that same was established beyond a reasonable doubt; and the defendant himself, having testified that the same was not freely made, the court submitted that issue to the jury. In our opinion, it would have been entirely proper for the court to have treated said confession as made by the defendant in the course of a judicial proceeding, inasmuch as the justice of the peace was qualified to try the case against appellant, although the charge against him was for theft of the hog of the justice of the peace who tried him. Code Grim. Proc., art. 569; Davis v. The State, 44 Texas, 523. As before stated, the appellant, according to the evidence offered by the State, was legally cautioned before he made the statement, and while this was controverted by the defendant, the issue as to this matter was submitted to the jury in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The court did not err in refusing to permit the defendant\u2019s counsel, on the cross-examination of the witness A. B. Short, to go into the details of family quarrels between his family and the defendant\u2019s, nor between himself and defendant. He gave him full latitude to prove the state of feeling between himself and the defendant, which it seems the defendant did not take advantage of, but insisted on proving certain quarrels and altercations between the parties, not connected in anywise with this transaction, but antedating same a year or more. The defendant says he expected to prove these altercations by said Short, or have him deny them, and then, after having laid the predicate, introduce evidence to impeach and contradict him. If this were permissible, the trial of a criminal case, if such a course should be pursued, would be interminable, and would raise issues which were not material to the case, and, if denied, would not afford the basis for impeaching testimony. \u00a1Nor, in our opinion, was the refusal of the court to permit testimony that the witness Short and others, who had the defendant in charge the night before the trial, were drinking wine or playing cards, error. The same does not appear to us to be relevant or material. Said evidence does not purport to be connected with any fact having the remotest bearing upon any issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The appellant also assigns as error that on the trial of this cause, there being evidence tending to show on the part of defendant a theft of two hogs, at the conclusion of the testimony the appellant asked the court to have the district attorney elect as to which of said hogs he would insist on a conviction of the defendant. The court declined to do this, assigning as a reason that there was no sufficient testimony showing the taking of two hogs, such as would require an election by the district attorney. There is testimony in the record showing that the prosecutor Short lost two shoats out of his bunch of hogs within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>short-time of each other, and some testimony with reference to the finding of the hide taken from a hog. The meat of the hog found in the possession of defendant appeared to be too fresh for the hog to have belonged to the hide in question. All of this testimony was admitted without objection, and no charge was asked in relation thereto. At most, the testimony was exceedingly-meager connecting defendant with the taking of more than one hog, and he was only found in possession of the meat of one hog, and he only admitted the killing of one hog. If the testimony regarding the other hog had been objected to at the proper time, it might have been the duty of the court to have sustained the objection; or if there appeared from the record in this case a danger of conviction for another hog, not charged in the indictment, then it would have been the duty of the court to have controlled the testimony as to such other hog by a proper charge, even though not requested; but the record fails to disclose any such danger, and in our opinion the court did not err in refusing to require the district attorney to elect as to which hog he would insist on convicting the defendant for the theft of.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The evidence in this case, though of a circumstantial character, is ample to sustain the conviction. The court gave a charge on circumstantial evidence, and gave the defendant the full benefit of all his defenses in the case. The jury found against him, and we are not inclined to disturb their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The judgment of the lower court is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
