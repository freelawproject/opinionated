The complaint alleged the date to be April 28, 1894, the information the 30th day of May, 1894. Upon motion of the county attorney, resisted by appellant, the court permitted the information to be so amended as to conform to the time alleged in the complaint, and the trial proceeded to appellant\u2019s conviction. This was directly in violation of article 550 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides, that \u201cany matter in an indictment or information may be amended at any time before an announcement of ready for trial upon the-merits by both parties, but not afterward. Ho matter of substance can be amended.\u201d The amendment was as to \u201c matter of form,\u201d but it came too late,, after announcement of ready for trial by both parties. For authorities collated, see Will-son\u2019s Criminal Procedure, section 2154. Inasmuch as the complaint furnishes the basis of a proper information, the judgment will be reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">\n<em>Beversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-11\">Judges all present and concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
