Change of Venue\u2014\u201cPrejudice\u201d\u2014\u201cPair and Impartial Trial\u201d\u2014Construction of Statutes.\u2014The first statutory ground for change of venue, on application of the accused, as provided by article 578, Code of Criminal Procedure, is, that there exists)in the county where the prosecution is commenced, so great a prejudice against him that he can not obtain a fair and impartial trial. <em>Held:</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-7\">1. The single and only purpose of this statute is to secure to the accused the right to \u201ca fair and impartial trial\u201d\u2014which is the \u201cfair trial by an impartial jury\u201d guarantied by the Bill of Eights. Const., art. 1, sec. 10.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-8\">2. This article, 578, is wholly independent of and has no connection with or reference to article 579, which provides for a change of venue after \u201can unsuccessful effort\u201d has been once made to obtain a jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-9\">3. The \u201cprejudice\u201d mentioned above is such prejudice against the accused himself, or a prejudgment of his particular case or crime; it may be both combined. And if there is such a prejudice existing against the accused that he can not obtain \u201ca fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d in the county, it is immaterial from what source this prejudice comes, or what cause or causes produced it, he is entitled to a change of venue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-10\">2. Same.\u2014\u201cPrejudice\u201d against the case of the defendant, and prejudgment of the same, may constitute \u201cprejudice,\u201d such as is meant by the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-11\">3. Same.\u2014Where such prejudice is shown, the accused can not be deprived of his right to a change of venue, because the \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d of the jurors summoned to try him is required to be tested by provisions of subdivisions 12 and 13 of article 636, Code of Criminal Procedure.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-12\">4. Jury Law\u2014Testing Qualification of Jurors\u2014Questions as to Formed Opinion, and Bias and Prejudice.\u2014On a trial for murder, in testing the qualification of jurors on their voir dire examination, it is error for the court to deny the accused the right to ask the particular juror if he had not formed an opinion that the accused was guilty, and if he did not <em>then </em>(while being examined) believe the accused was guilty, and ought to be hanged?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b59-13\">5. Same.\u2014On a trial for murder, where a juror, who had fully qualified himself on his voir dire examination in chief, was asked, on cross-examination by defendant, if he had not formed the opinion that defendant was guilty, and if he did not then believe defendant was guilty and ought to be hanged ? Which questions the court refused to allow to be put and answered, and the defendant was compelled to exhaust a peremptory challenge upon said juror; and said juror having made affidavit, before the completion of the jury, that had he been permitted to do so he would have answered the questions in the affirmative, and stated further in said affidavit, that \u201cdefendant would have to produce good strong testimony before I would change my opinion, and would have to prove himself innocent before I would acquit him;\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the juror showed himself not only disqualified but corrupt, and that the court upon presentation of said affidavit, before the completion of the jury, should have set aside defendant's peremptory challenge as to said juror.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b59-14\">Appeal from, the Criminal District Court of Dallas. Tried below before Hon. Charles F. Clint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-15\">This appeal is from a conviction for murder of the second degree, the punishment being assessed at a term of twenty years in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-16\">Appellant was indicted in the District Court of Dallas County, at the January Term, 1893, for the murder of E. S. Randall. The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>dictment was found by the grand jury, and was returned and presented in and to the District Court of the Forty-fourth Judicial District in and for the county of Dallas. As originally presented, the indictment did not show that it was presented \u201cin the District Court of the.Forty-fourth Judicial District.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-5\">By act approved May 4, 1893, the Legislature created the \u201cDallas Criminal District Court,\u201d said act to take immediate effect, under an emergency clause, from and after its passage. Gen. Laws 23d Leg., p. 118, et seq. By section 8 of this act it was provided, that the criminal cases pending in the District Courts of Dallas County, together with all records and papers relating thereto, should be immediately transferred to said Criminal District Court. \u2022 Under provision^ of said act, this case was transferred to said Criminal District Court. In this latter court the county attorney filed a motion to amend the indictment, so that it might show upon its face that it had been returned by the grand jury into \u201cthe District Court of the Forty-fourth Judicial District of Texas.\u201d Defendant filed a demurrer and exceptions to this motion, which were overruled, and the indictment was permitted, over objection of defendant, to be so amended; and defendant also filed three motions to quash the indictment after it was so amended, which motions were overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">Defendant filed a motion to quash the special venire in the case, because it was not drawn in open court and in the presence of the judge. \u2022But as this matter is not discussed nor passed upon in the opinion, it is unnecessary to further state the matters pertaining thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">Defendant\u2019s motion for change of venue was based upon both the statutory grounds named in article 578, Code of Criminal Procedure. \u25a0In support of both grounds there were ten compurgators. In support of the first ground alone, viz., as to prejudice against the defendant, there were thirty-one compurgators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">The county attorney filed a counter-affidavit, contesting the affidavit of said compurgators and their means of knowledge as to the matters deposed to by them, and denying the existence of facts which would sustain either ground of said motion for change of venue. Defendant filed a demurrer and special exceptions to this controverting affidavit, upon the ground that the same was too general, indefinite, and insufficient, which was overruled, the court holding, that such contesting affidavit is sufficient if it states matter which \u201crequires the defendant to introduce proof of the truth of his affidavit.\u201d Upon the issue the court limited the number of witnesses to be examined on each side to fifteen, with the understanding that others might be introduced, if necessary, as to matters not cumulative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">Defendant\u2019s bill of exception shows the evidence of the witnesses pro and con adduced on the application, and after some thirteen had .been examined for the defendant and nine by the State, the court stated that he had heard enough testimony. As stated in said bill of exceptions, the language of the court in overruling the motion is as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201cThe court does not care to have further evidence on this motion. The defendant, in support of it, has introduced a number of witnesses who have testified to a certain condition of the public mind towards this issue; and the State has also introduced evidence to show what the state of mind of the people towards this case was. On this issue the testimony of the State and the defendant is substantially the same. If there is any difference, it is that the State\u2019s evidence was perhaps more explicit. The evidence does not support the truth of the allegations of the motion. It does not show, or tend to show, the truth of the ground of the motion as to prejudice or combination of influential persons, etc., such as under article 578, Code of Criminal Procedure, would warrant the court in granting a change of venue. The evidence as a whole shows, that in this county a great many people have formed and expressed an opinion as to defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence; that as a rule, when the case has been talked about, it was as to the merits of the case, as to whether it was murder or not, and the opinion, as far as it was expressed, was, that the defendant was guilty of murder, etc. In other words, many people have prejudged the case from what they have heard or read of it. There is no evidence, or at best but little evidence, of feeling against I. G. Bandle or against the case. Under my view of the law, the evidence as a whole shows there is no such prejudice as is contemplated by article 578, Code of Criminal Procedure; but on the other hand, it does show that many people have the opinion that defendant is, under the facts, guilty of murder. Bow, I take it, that under the facts in support of this motion a change of venue could only be had under article 579 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and in order to warrant a change of venue under that article, the proper practice would be, before granting a change of venue, to first endeavor to procure a jury from the body of the people who know nothing of the case. The defendant is under our laws guarantied the right to challenge for cause any man who has prejudged his case, and until an effort has been made to procure a jury from the body of the people who have not so prejudged the case, I do not believe this court would be warranted in granting a change of venue in this case. The motion to change the venue is overruled.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The bill of exceptions further shows, that \u201cthereupon the defendant stated that he had present in the court room and offered to call other witnesses in support of his motion, and by whom he would and could prove the grounds set forth in his said motion for a change of venue and in support thereof; and stated to the court, that the witnesses then present would testify in support of his said motion that the people of Dallas County were prejudiced against the case of the defendant, and had prejudged the same, thereby preventing a fair and impartial trial of his cause in said county.\u201d But the court refused, over the objection of defendant, to hear further testimony on the matter of the change of venue, and overruled the motion for a change of venue, and stated that the court construed the\"statute to mean, and would hold, that the prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>udice must be against the defendant personally, and not against his cause; and the court further stated, \u201cthat if prejudice against the case of the defendant and prejudgment of the sanie constituted prejudice such as is meant by the statute, then the defendant would be entitled to a change of venue.\u201d But the court was of opinion that the prejudice, the existence of which entitled a defendant to a change of venue, must be against him as an individual, and not against his case; that the mere prejudgment of his guilt or innocence of the charge pending against him was not such prejudice as would entitle defendant to a change of venue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">The matters complained of pertaining to the impaneling of the jury, and to the overruling of his supplemental motion for change of venue, after the jury was completed, are thus shown by defendant\u2019s bills of exception, as follows, to wit;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">Bill of Exceptions hTo. 7: \u201cBe it remembered, that on the trial of the above numbered and entitled cause, and during the organization and impaneling of the jury therein, and while each of the jurors, after the first seven jurors who tried the case had been accepted, was being examined upon his voir dire touching his qualifications to act as a juror in this cause, the defendant then and there by his counsel sought to elicit from each of said jurors the fact that he had frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged therefor; and the further fact, that it was the belief of the juror at the time he was being examined that the defendant was guilty of murder, and should be hanged. Whereupon the court stated to defendant\u2019s counsel that they would not be permitted to propound either of said questions, nor to elicit an answer thereto from any of the jurors; whereupon counsel for the defendant stated to the court that they could prove, and then offered to prove, by each of the jurors being examined, that he had frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged, and that it was the belief of each of the jurors at the time he was thus being examined that the defendant was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged. Whereupon the court stated to counsel for the defendant, while denying the defendant the right to make this proof by each of the jurors, that said questions would be considered as having been asked of each and every juror examined, and that counsel\u2019s statement, that they believed and expected to prove the above by each of said jurors, be incorporated in their bill. To which ruling and action of the court the defendant then and there excepted, for the reason that under such ruling, in the face of the fact that he could establish by each of the jurors that he had frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and should be hanged, and that it was then the belief of each juror that the defendant was guilty of murder and ought to be hanged, and to compel him to accept such jurors as his triers, or to exhaust upon them his peremptory challenges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>would thereby compel the defendant to accept as his triers a jury of jurors who had prejudged his cause, and who then and there believed him guilty of murder, and that he ought to be hanged for said crime; and for the further reason, that such a juror could not, in the nature of things, be fair and impartial, as the law required him to be before he could be justly and legally impaneled to try the case; and for the further reason, that as defendant only had twenty peremptory challenges, he would, under the rulings of the court, be compelled to submit to such jurors as his triers, or exhaust upon them his peremptory challenges, when in fact he was entitled to challenge said jurors for cause, and that with this alternative thus placed before him by the rulings of the court, the defendant would be prevented from obtaining a fair and impartial jury. But the court overruled the objections thus made, and denied the defendant the right to inquire of and to prove by each of the jurors that he had expressed the opinion and entertained the belief above stated, to which action and ruling of the court the defendant then and there excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">\u201cAnd be it further remembered, that the defendant by his counsel desired to ask each of the jurors, as they were being thus examined, whether they were not prejudiced against the defendant. But the court objected to said question, and held that counsel for defendant must propound the question in the language of subdivision 12 of article 636 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to wit, 'Whether or not he had any bias or prejudice in favor of or against defendant.\u2019 Whereupon counsel for defendant stated to the court that the defendant desired to separate the question, and to ask each juror if he was not prejudiced against the defendant; but the court denied the defendant the right to thus put the question and to elicit an answer thereto from each juror as he was being examined. And the court stated to defendant\u2019s counsel that they would not be permitted to put said question to any other juror, but that the question thus framed, to wit, 'If the juror was not prejudiced against the defendant,\u2019 would be considered as having been asked, and the statement that defendant said he could show by their answers that they were prejudiced be incorporated in support of this bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">\u25a0 \u201cTo which ruling of the court the defendant then and there excepted, for the reason that the defendant had a right to prove, and could prove, by the answers to said question, that each of the jurors was prejudiced against the defendant, and by reason of which the defendant was entitled to challenge the jurors for cause. But the court also overruled said objection, and compelled the defendant to proceed with impaneling the jury, in the face of the affirmative proof offered by them; but that notwithstanding this fact the court would not, for the above reasons, hold the jurors incompetent, and the defendant would be compelled to exhaust upon them his peremptory challenges, or submit to them as triers of his cause. The defendant then and there excepted, and reserved this bill of exceptions in each and every in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>stance where a juror was being thus examined; and tenders this bill of exceptions to the action and rulings of the court in the premises stated, and prays that the same be approved and filed as a part of the record in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">\u201cAnd be it further remembered, that during the organization and impaneling of said jury the defendant exhausted all of his peremptory challenges, and three jurors, to wit, Juror J. B. Leake, Juror C. P. Metcalfe, and Juror Ed McCarroll, were forced upon him after his said peremptory challenges were exhausted, and by each of which three jurors the defendant expected and offered to prove, had he been permitted to do so, affirmatively, the questions herein before stated in this bill of exceptions, and sought to be proved by all of the jurors in said cause; but this the court denied. To which ruling of the court defendant then and there excepted, and tenders this his bill of exceptions to said ruling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">\u201cAnd be it farther remembered, that in the impaneling and organization of said jury the defendant exhausted his twenty peremptory challenges upon the following named jurors, to wit, J. B. Stancell, T. F. Graham, M. A. Ward, Wesley Owens, B. B. Cole, Sr., I. J. Willingham, C. B. Jones, S. T. Capps, W. S. Jobson, J. K. Bange, J. G. Mathis, J. L. Hix, L. F. Bogers, F. H. Goodnight, L. F. Skiles, J. M. Jones, George B. Willis, B. A. Hammond, Dan Henry, and H. P. Moore; and by each of said jurors, except the first named sixteen persons, whom he was thus compelled to challenge peremptorily, he expected to and offered to prove that each of them had frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged; and that at the time they were being thus exam' ined on their voir dire, they each believed that the defendant was guilty of murder, and should be hanged for his crime; but this proof, as is herein before stated, was denied by the court. Yet notwithstanding these reasons, the court held said jurors competent, and defendant was compelled to exhaust his peremptory challenges upon them at a time when only seven jurors had been selected in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">\u201cAnd be it further remembered, that in the case of the person L. F. Skiles, who was tendered as a juror, and who was challenged peremptorily, as above stated, by defendant, the said Skiles upon his voir dire examination was held to be competent by the court, at which time defendant offered to prove by said Skiles that he had frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty of murder, and should be hanged; and the court refused the counsel of defendant the right to make such proof, but stated to defendant\u2019s counsel that they could inquire of said Skiles, after he had left the stand, what his opinion was as to that he believed the defendant guilty; when the defendant\u2019s counsel protested, and stated that they could ascertain the opinion of the juror at this time, and thereby enable them to challenge him for cause, and that they should not be forced by the court to exhaust a peremptory challenge upon said juror.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u201cAll of which the court refused to permit counsel to do, and counsel was thereby compelled to peremptorily challenge said juror.

Whereupon defendant\u2019s counsel then craved permission of the court to ask this juror if he had not frequently expressed the opinion that the defendant was guilty- of murder and ought to be hanged, and did not at this time believe the defendant guilty of murder and ought to be hanged. And the court remarked that the juror had qualified; but the defendant\u2019s counsel requested to let said question be put to the juror and get an answer from this particular juror, when the court replied that he would grant the request in this instance\u2014the defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge being exhausted\u2014and thereupon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the defendant\u2019s counsel put said questions to said juror, and he answered both of them in the affirmative; whereupon the court of its own motion excused the juror, and remarked that he would not allow said question'to be put to any more of the jurors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">\u201cTo which action and rulings of the court in holding said jurors competent, while refusing affirmative proof to the aforesaid questions to the jurors while being examined as aforesaid, and forcing defendant to either accept said jurors or peremptorily challenge them, the defendant then and there excepted, and tenders this his bill of exceptions to all of the same, and prays that it be filed and approved as a part of the record in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">\u201cApproved March 30,1894. \u201cCharles F.

And which said lists containing the names of the veniremen, served upon him as shown in his motion, shows opposite each name the cause why said jurors (excepting those impaneled in the case) were excused from service. Which said first supplemental motion for a change of venue shows, that out of the 297 men summoned on the original special venire of 350, 210 of the same disqualified themselves on the ground that they had such an opinion as would influence their action in finding a verdict in this cause, and that such opinion, defendant expected to prove and offered to prove, was a prejudgment of the cause against the defendant; that of the remaining eighty-seven names summoned on the original venire, forty-six persons were absent from sickness and other causes unknown to the defendant, and were not brought into court at any time during the examination of said special venire; and from the remaining forty-one names the State exhausted four of its peremptory challenges and the defendant exhausted nine of his peremptory challenges, and six veniremen were accepted as jurymen in this cause, leaving twenty-two out of the forty-one disqualifying themselves for cause\u2014said cause being conscientious scruples against the infliction of the death penalty as a punishment for crime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">\u201cSaid special venire being exhausted on Friday afternoon, March 9th, the court, on Saturday morning, March 10th, proceeded to have examined on their voir dire the six jurors of the regular panel of the week, and being thus examined, said six jurors disqualified themselves by reason of the fact that their opinions were such as would influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>their action in finding a verdict; and in each of said instances the defendant proposed and could have proved by each of said jurors that they had expressed the opinion that he was guilty as charged, and that they then believed that he was guilty of murder, and should be hanged for said crime; which proof the court forbade the defendant to make.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">\u201cWhereupon the court ordered the sheriff to summon a venire of talesmen of forty men, and the court adjourned until Monday morning, March 12, to complete the panel. And the defendant says, that from said forty-one men who were summoned, instead of forty who were ordered to be served, twenty-three of said talesmen disqualified themselves on the ground of opinion such as would influence their action in finding a verdict; and the defendant offered to show and prove, but was denied by the court so to do, that said twenty-three men not only frequently expressed the opinion that he was guilty of murder, but then believed that he was guilty and should be hanged for his crime.

We submit:</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-13\">1. That the motion presents the first and second grounds stated in article 578, Code of Criminal Procedure, and that both are supported by the affidavit of the appellant and that of ten compurgators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-14\">2. That the first ground in said article 578, as to the existence of prejudice in Dallas County, etc., is supported not only by the compurgators who have sworn to both grounds, but by twenty-one other compurgators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-15\">3. Thattheevidence of the witnesses who were permitted by the court to testify shows such prejudice on the part of the people of Dallas county as would make it highly improbable for appellant to obtain a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>4. That the statements of the ten compurgators who swore to the existence of both grounds named in the statute have not been attacked by the evidence of any witness called, pro or con, on said motion, only in so far as was stated by some, that they did not know of a dangerous combination, instigated by influential persons, etc.; but which testimony, being purely negative, can not and does not affect that which was stated positively to be true by the compurgators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-5\">5. The editorials in the various newspapers in Dallas County, in connection with the testimony of several of the editors thereof, tend strongly to support the compurgators who have sworn to the second ground named in the statute, and absolutely corroborate the existence of the prejudice as sworn to by thirty-one compurgators under the first ground.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-6\">6. The honorable trial judge, when acting upon the motion, and in overruling the same, admitted that the evidence showed a prejudice against and a prejudgment of the cause of the defendant by the people of Dallas County; but inasmuch as it does not show a prejudice personal against appellant, the prejudice stated in the statute has not been established by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-7\">7. Our contention is, in answer to this, that if the evidence shows a prejudice, by reason of which he can not obtain a fair and impartial trial, the statute has been complied with, and the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-8\">8. The purpose of the statute is to obtain a fair and impartial trial of the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-9\">9. Absolute ignorance may exist as to the defendant personally.' and at the same time there may exist a knowledge of his case or of the act charged against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-10\">10. If the defendant is personally unknown, but the act charged against him is well known, and there exists such a prejudice against that act as to prevent a fair and impartial investigation of it, to the end that the law would be fairly and impartially administered\u2014 and it is the act by which he is alone to be judged\u2014how is it possible to separate the crime from the man, or hold the man innocent but the crime infamous ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-11\">11. The issue is : can a fair and impartial trial be had on the presentment made by the indictment? If the defendant was personally disliked, and the act charged against him was unknown, the statute would be available. If he was personally liked, and there was a total absence of all knowledge of him that could create personal prejudice, but the act he committed, and circumstances causing him to commit it, were so understood by the people of the county as to cause them to prejudge the act, this would certainly be a prejudgment of him, by reason of the fact that he caused the very things to be done that were condemned and prejudged. It is the act that is to be tried, but it is the defendant that is affected by the result, and so if the act is condemned, the accused is the sufferer. There could be no effect without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>a cause; and if the effect is hurtful, or is odious, and therefore condemned, does not this include a condemnation of the cause\"? And the only way to get rid of the effect is to remove the cause. The actor and the act are inseparable; so is the cause and the effect, and the prejudice against one includes both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-5\">12. Following the reasoning of the trial court in holding that the statute means that the prejudice must exist against I. G. Bandle personally, and that the prejudice against, and prejudgment of his cause, are not what is meant, and that the crime can be separated from the criminal committing it, is to our minds on a par with reasoning such as this: that perjury could be hated, and the perjurer not; that treason could be abhorred, and the traitor not; that the lie could be denounced, and the liar applauded; that hypocrisy could be condemned, and the hypocrite commended; that the case could be tried and a verdict of guilty rendered, and the case hung, but the accused making the case, go \u201cscot free.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-6\">13. Prejudice means prejudgment, and a prejudgment of the act is a prejudgment of the actor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-7\">14. The evidence in support of this motion adduced by the appellant and the State establishes the fact, that the people of Dallas County had passed judgment upon this cause, and that that judgment was against the defendant; and in further support of this contention we ask the court to consider in connection herewith the ninth assignment of error, as reserved in bill of exceptions number 8, and which sets forth an additional motion made by appellant, and sworn to by him, and which was so made and sworn to by him after the jury had been impaneled in this cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-8\">15. By reference to the motion found on page 785 of the transcript, it will be seen that the defendant offered to make proof by the jurors who had just been impaneled, that they believed at that time that he was guilty of murder, and should be hanged for his crime; and that they were prejudiced against him. But it was denied him by the court, as shown by his bill number 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-9\">16. We cite this action upon the supplemental motion, and the further fact, as shown by said bill number 8, that from a total venire of 421 names, 282 were excused because of their prejudgment of this case, forty-six were absent, and fifty-one were excused for conscientious scruples\u2014as the actual temper and condition of mind upon the part of the jurors towards appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-10\">17. We refer the court to bill of exceptions number 7, which in our judgment fully establishes the fact, by a careful reading of the same, that a jury, fair and impartial, could not be obtained in Dallas County; that in order to get a jury to try this defendant, over his motion for a change of venue, it was necessary to make him accept as his triers jurors by whom he could have proven, at the time that they were impaneled, that they had not only frequently expressed the opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>he was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged for the crime, but that they \u201cbelieved at the time, when being examined, that he was guilty of murder, and ought to be hanged;\u201d and by whom it could have been further proven, and the offer was made, that they not only had such belief, \u201cbut that they were prejudiced against the defendant,\u201d which proof the court denied the appellant the right to make.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-5\">18. Appellant protested that the jurors were prejudiced against him, and that they solemnly believed at the time that he was guilty of murder and ought to suffer an ignominious death, yet such proof was in every instance denied him, until the juror O. H. McComas was reached. Although this juror had apparently qualified, the court, upon being absolutely begged by defendant\u2019s counsel, consented for appellant to make the proof if he could by McComas\u2014that he believed him guilty of murder, and should be hanged for his crime\u2014which offer to make such proof was successful; and the court then refused any further proof of a like character. We cite this in support of the fifth assignment of error, as going to show the animus of the public mind towards appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">19. We also refer the court to bill of exceptions number 7, not only showing the action of the court in impaneling the jury in this case; and its action upon the venireman McComas; and its action in compelling the appellant to exhaust his peremptory challenges upon men who believed that he was guilty of murder and should be hanged, and were prejudiced against him; and of its action after appellant\u2019s challenges had been exhausted, in forcing upon him as his triers, jurors thus prejudiced and thus believing; but we also call the attention of this court to the affidavit of L. F. Skiles, shown in bill of exceptions number 7, and to the action of the trial court in compelling appellant to exhaust a peremptory challenge upon him, and the refusal of the court, after such affidavit had been made, to set aside said peremptory challenge as a charge against appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-7\">20. In support of both of the grounds named in the motion, the affidavits of the compurgators were admitted in evidence by the trial court, and by reference to them it will be seen that ten compurgators swore to the existence of both grounds stated in the motion and the statute. The State failed to show that there did not exist a dangerous combination instigated by influential persons. The proof offered by the State as against this special ground is purely negative, and in no sense denies the fact deposed to by ten compurgators, yet the court . found that no such combination of dangerous men, etc., existed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-8\"><em>Harry P. </em>Lawtlier,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEa\">Assistant County Attorney of Dallas County, for the State, filed a most interesting and able printed brief and argument, which we regret that want of space forbids us from publishing at length, and which can not well be condensed into a synopsis without doing great injustice to its merits.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>DAVIDSOB, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">Appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree, his punishment being assessed at confinement in the penitentiary for a term of twenty years; hence this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">When the case was called for trial appellant moved a change of venue, upon both grounds set forth in the statute. In support of both grounds there were ten compurgators; and in support of the first ground, to wit, prejudice, there were thirty-one. The contesting affidavit for the State was signed by the county attorney. The court, before the evidence began upon the issues involved in the motion, limited the number of witnesses to each side at fifteen, and of its own motion stopped the testimony, denied appellant the right to introduce further proof in support of the motion, overruled it, and put him upon his trial. The reasons for prohibiting the introduction of further evidence on the motion were: first, the evidence for and against it showed a prejudice in the county against the cause, and not the person of appellant; second, that this character of prejudice is not .contemplated by article 578 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the prejudice there meant must be limited to the individual, and does not extend to the supposed crime or the case. Seasoning from these premises, the court concluded that the change of venue should be granted, if at all, under the provisions of article 579 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and that all such prejudice could be reached by testing the veniremen in regard thereto, under the provisions of subdivision 13 of article 636 of said code. That such was the view of the law entertained by the court is rendered certain by his language, set out in the bill of exceptions, to wit: \u201cIf prejudice against the case of the defendant and prejudgment of same constituted prejudice, such as is meant by the statute, then the defendant would be entitled to a change of venue. Bow, I take it, that under the facts in support of this motion, a change of venue could only be had under article 579 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. And in order to warrant a change of venue under that article, the proper practice would be, before granting a change of venue, to first endeavor to procure a jury from the body of the people who know nothing of the cause. The defendant is, under our laws, guarantied the right to challenge for cause any man who has prej udged his case; and, until an effort has been made to procure a jury from the body of the people who have not so prejudged the case, I do not believe this court would be warranted in granting, a change of venue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The question here presented for our decision is, What is meant by the \u201cprejudice \u201d mentioned in article 578 of the Code of Criminal Procedure? Does it mean to prejudge the case? Or does it mean, antipathy, dislike, or hatred against the accused, separate and distinct from his crime? Or does it mean prejudice against the accused and his case? In our view of the law, it means either. If there is such a prejudice existing against the accused that he can not obtain a \u201cfair trial by an impartial jury\u201d in the county from which the venue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>sought to be changed, it is immaterial from what source this prejudice comes, or what cause or causes produced it. We think the correctness of this position can be demonstrated. Our Bill of Rights provides, that the accused in all criminal prosecutions \u201cshall have a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Art. 1, sec. 10. This language is of no doubtful significance. The trial shall be \u201cfair,\u201d and the jury \u201cimpartial.\u201d \u201cImpartial\u201d means \u201cnot partial; not favoring one party more than another; unprejudiced; disinterested; equitable; just. Jove is impartial, and to both the same.\u201d . Webst. Diet. As thus defined, \u201cimpartial\u201d evidently means not favoring a party or an individual because of the emotions of the human mind, heart, or affections. It means that, to be impartial, the party, his cause, or the issues involved in his cause, should not, must not be prejudged. The accused in this State, under our Constitution and laws, is entitled to a \u201cfair trial by an impartial jury; \u201d and there is no other method provided by which an accused can be tried and punished. Looking to this supreme end, the Constitution has farther ordained, that \u201cthe power to change the venue in civil and criminal cases shall be vested in the courts, to be exercised in such manner as shall be provided by law; and the Legislature shall pass laws for that purpose.\u201d Const., art. 3, sec. 45. This provision of the Constitution, when applied to criminal causes, could have been ordained but for the purpose of guarantying \u201ca fair trial by an impartial jury,\u201d provided for by the Bill of Rights. Any other interpretation would render it meaningless, useless, \u201cas sounding brass or tinkling cymbal.\u201d In pursuance of and in obedience to these high commands of the Constitution, the Legislature enacted, that \u201ca change of venue may be granted on the written application of the defendant, supported by his own affidavit and the affidavit of at least two credible persons, residents of the county where the prosecution is instituted, for either of the following causes, the truth and sufficiency of which the court shall determine: (1) That there exists in the county where the prosecution is commenced so great a prejudice against him that he can not obtain a fair and impartial trial; (2) that there is a dangerous combination against him instigated by influential persons, by reason of which he can not expect a fair trial.\u201d Code Crim. Proc., art. 578. The single and only purpose for which this law was enacted was to secure the accused the right to a \u201cfair and an impartial trial,\u201d which is the \u201cfair trial by an impartial jury\u201d guarantied by the Bill of Rights. This statute realizes and is based upon the fact that there may be \u201cso great a prejudice\u201d or such-\u201ca dangerous combination\u201d against the accused existing in the county in which .the prosecution is instituted that he can not obtain, or will be deprived of, \u201ca fair and an impartial trial.\u201d The Legislature, as a cause for challenge, has also provided, \u201cthat the jury has a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant,\u201d or \u201cthat, from hearsay or otherwise, there is established in the mind of the juror such a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>ant as will influence him in his action in finding a verdict.\u201d Code Grim. Proc., art. 636, subdivs. 12, 13. These provisions were enacted for the purpose of securing a fair and impartial trial, and apply as well to the State as to the accused. Construing them together, the word \u201cprejudice,\u201d mentioned in subdivision 12, refers only to the person of the accused, and means hatred, ill will, dislike, antipathy, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The law authorizing a change of venue proceeds upon the fact, that notwithstanding the most searching questions may be applied to the juror in regard to his bias or prejudice for or against the accused, or whether there is formed in his mind such a conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused as will influence him in finding a verdict, still there may be in the county such a prejudice existing as to render it improbable that the defendant could receive a fair and impartial trial. If it be conceded that all obnoxious jurors could be kept off the jury by being questioned in regard to causes for challenge, then it would seem the law providing for a change of venue would be useless, and should have no place in our procedure, and the provisions of the Constitution would be without purpose, reason, or object\u2014\u201cunto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness.\u201d If the juror who has formed an opinion\u2014prejudged the case\u2014can be detected and rejected, under the provisions of subdivision 13 of article 636, why can not the juror who has bias or prejudice in favor of or against the individual be detected in the same manner?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">But it is contended, that if the accused is entitled to a change of venue, it is by reason of the provisions of article 579 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is as follows: \u201cWhen an unsuccessful effort has been once made in any county to procure a jury for the trial of a felony, and all reasonable means have been used, if it be made to appear to the court, by the written affidavit of the attorney for the State or any other credible person, that no jury can probably be had in that county, the court may order a change of venue, and cause the reasons therefor to be placed upon the minutes of the proceedings.\u201d This article has no reference to or connection with article 578, and provides for a case in which the application for the change of venue may or may not have been made. It refers to that status of case \u201cwhen an unsuccessful effort\u201d has been made to obtain a jury. The danger in such cases is, that the effort will not be unsuccessful. The prejudice in the county may be such that jurors will qualify themselves who are not impartial, and a jury obtained, composed in whole or in part of such jurors. This is demonstrated by the record in this case. Veniremen O. H. McComas and L. P. Skiles, when tested on their voir dire, qualified themselves thoroughly by deliberately swearing they had formed no such conclusion as would influence them in finding their verdict. Appellant offered to prove by both that they had frequently expressed their belief that he was guilty, and should be hanged. He further proposed to prove by them that they then believed him guilty, and ought to be hanged. The court refused appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>lant permission to ask Skiles these questions, but permitted them to be asked of MoComas, making this exception to his rule, with the remark, that he would not allow other jurors to be thus interrogated on their voir dire, and accordingly, with the utmost strictness, enforced such ruling. When thus questioned, McComas replied that he had frequently expressed the opinion that appellant was guilty of murder, and should be hanged, and that he then so believed. He was challenged for cause, and the challenge was sustained. Appellant was not permitted to thus test Skiles, but he, however, obtained and filed his affidavit, in which he states, under oath, that he had expressed the opinion, and then entertained it, that appellant was guilty, and ought to be hanged, unless he could prove his innocence. How, these instances show beyond question, that notwithstanding these tests, there may be such prejudice in the county that jurors will qualify who have deliberately formed a conclusion that the accused is guilty, and should be punished. If the accused is required to rely upon the provisions of article 579 for changing the venue, it must be made to appear that he could not obtain in the county a jury in any event, prejudiced or unprejudiced. But even should a jury be obtained, it would not follow that it did not contain prejudiced jurors. Again, it is conceded by the trial judge that there may be a prejudice against the individual which would authorize the change of venue. How, why can not this prejudice be detected by pursuing the provisions of said subdivision 12 of article 636?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Let us view the question from another standpoint. The object of the Constitution, and laws enacted in accordance therewith, is to secure the accused a \u201cfair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d When the juror has formed such an opinion in regard to the guilt or innocence of the accused as will influence his verdict, he is to be rejected; he is not impartial. If he is impartial, because he has formed an opinion against the cause of the accused, such impartiality would be as harmful, if not more so, than prejudice against him as an individual, separate and apart from- the crime. The juror may dislike the accused, may be prejudiced against him as an individual, and yet rise superior to such feeling, and do him justice on the trial. But if he has formed an opinion that the accused is guilty\u2014that is, such an opinion as will influence his verdict\u2014the juror would much more likely do injustice than if only he is prejudiced against him as an individual, apart from his crime. Both are legal causes for challenge. How, then, if there is as much, if not more, danger from a juror who has formed such opinion as to the guilt of the accused as there is from one who is prejudiced against him apart from his crime, with equal if not greater reason should such prejudice\u2014prejudgment of the cause\u2014be a ground for a change of venue. The distinction sought to be drawn by the learned trial judge, when viewed in the light of the Constitution, legislation upon the subject, and the history of this question, is to our minds a novel one indeed. We are cited to no authority in the support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>it, and we are of opinion that none is to be found. It is sui generis, at variance with our laws, organic and statutory, and we think subversive of our criminal jurisprudence. The learned trial judge admits, and so states in the bill of exceptions, that if prejudice means a prejudgment of the case, then such prejudice so pervades the county of Dallas that it would entitle appellant to a change of venue. He further states, that the testimony is not conflicting on this point; that the evidence introduced by both parties concurs in establishing the fact that such prejudice does exist in the county; and that that adduced on the part of the State was more explicit than that shown for the appellant. The assistant county attorney of Dallas County, in his argument upon the submission, contended, that nowithstanding the judge so held, and that his views may have been erroneous, yet if the evidence did not authorize the change of venue, the judgment upon this point should not be reversed. In this view of the question we can not concur. If the change of venue was not demanded under the facts of this case, then article 578 would seem to be a dead letter upon the statute book, and should be expunged from the code, as the ruling of the trial court, if correct, would certainly do. We think the lower court eminently correct in holding that, if prejudice meant a prejudgment of the case, the appellant was entitled to a change of venue, and we are of opinion he should have granted the motion and changed the venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In doubtful cases, or where there is a conflict in the testimony in regard to the issues involved in such motions, great deference is paid by this court, and indeed should be, to the judgment of the trial court refusing to change the venue of cases. Such is the uniform and harmonious line of decision in this State. The discretion of the court in this case has been exercised favorably to the accused in so far as the facts are concerned, but adversely to him upon the law applicable to the question. If in error as to the law, as the court evidently was, the appellant was clearly entitled to the change of venue. We will not pursue this line of discussion further, but desire to say, in regard to change of venue, that it frequently occurs that good men, honest citizens, swear that the accused can not obtain a fair trial because of prejudice in the county. Ignorant people, persons uninformed as to legal methods provided for obtaining juries, become apparently astonished at such affidavits, and inquire if it be true that twelve honest, fair men can not be found in a county with whom to try the accused. Such questions, by their frequency of occurrence, have almost ceased to cause surprise, but evidence a wonderful degree of ignorance. If the accused be accorded the right to select his friends, or those by whom he is willing to be tried as jurors, from the county, independently of the right of the State to participate in such selection, then it might be safely asserted that motions for change of venue, as a matter of fact, would be unknown to the practice in this State. But this is not true, and should not be; hence the jury must be selected under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>rules and by the methods prescribed by law, and all laws in regard to changes of venue are enacted with a view to this fact. As has been forcefully said by the Supreme Court of Iowa, in The State v. Hash, 7 Iowa, 371: \u2022 \u201cThe right to speedy and public trial by an impartial jury is guarantied by the Constitution of .this State to all persons accused of crime. It becomes us not to place a light estimate upon a right secured to us by such high authority. It is important, to maintain the usefulness of our whole judicial system, that no suspicion of popular excitement in the administration of the law should be allowed to impair the public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of judicial proceedings. An excited state of public feeling and opinion is always the most unfavorable for the investigation of truth. Hot only should the mind of the juror be wholly without bias and prejudice, it should not only be free from all undue feeling and excitement in itself, but it should be as far as possible removed from the influence of prejudice and feeling and excitement in others. A circumstance of small importance in itself may often, in the midst of a community stirred by passion and excitement, serve to turn the scales of justice. It is \u00e1 difficult matter for a court in all cases to draw the true line of distinction, and to say when there is and when there is not such a state of popular feeling and prejudice as to prevent a fair and impartial trial. Every case must be judged by its own circumstances. * * * There is, however, to be guarded against, a feeling and a prejudice not only within but without the jury box; and a jury, however right their intentions, are not always proof against the sympathies of the crowd. Influence of popular excitement and prejudice is too strong for the strongest resolution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We are of opinion, that appellant should have been permitted to ask jurors if they had formed the opinion that he was guilty, and then believed he was guilty and ought to be hanged. He was placed on his trial for murder\u2014for murder in the first degree. Many questions had been propounded them to ascertain if they had formed an opinion which would influence their verdict. Hone had elicited such answer, or had the desired effect, it seems, but this question. The touchstone and keynote was thus discovered which probed and unlocked the consciences of the jurors McOomas and Skiles, and the court, perceiving this, closed the door, and prohibited the question being asked the other jurors. This was a travesty on justice, and an infringement of the rules of justice, which should pervade every trial and overshadow every seat of judgment. Appellant was entitled to, and had been wrongfully deprived of, a challenge for cause to the juror Skiles, who, under his affidavit, was incompetent to sit as a juror on appellant\u2019s trial. He had thoroughly qualified himself by answering all questions propounded to him, yet, when tested by his own affidavit, disqualified himself completely. He not only shows and swears that he was prejudiced, that he believed appellant guilty, and ought to be hanged, but shows a degree of moral turpitude which should have operated to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>qualify him as a juror generally. Prom his affidavit it is conclusively shown not only that he thought, believed, that appellant was guilty and ought to be hanged, and that he would so find, but it is further shown therein that he would so say by his verdict, unless appellant proved his innocence. \u00a1No question propounded to him had developed this condition of his mind, although he had been asked if he had formed such a conclusion as would influence him in finding a verdict. The question asked by appellant, but excluded by the' court, would have done so, if the statements in his affidavit are to be credited.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The indictment was sufficient, independent of and without the amendment; therefore it was not affected by it. We deem it unnecessary to enter into a discussion of this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The questions suggested in regard to the supposed irregularities incident to the special venire will not likely arise upon another trial, and that question is not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The constitutional question in regard to the admission of the testimony of Plummer will be treated in another pending appeal; therefore it is here pretermitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The judgment is reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Simkins, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
