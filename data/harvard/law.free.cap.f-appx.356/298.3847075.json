On appeal, Sapsin argues that her sentence was unreasonable because the district court: failed to explain it reasons for the sentence, failed to take into account the Sentencing Guidelines policy statements and mandatory sentencing considerations at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and impermissibly considered a factor not expressly listed in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">We review a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). Out reasonableness review is deferential, and the party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006), citing <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). In considering the reasonableness of a sentence, we employ an abuse-of-diseretion standard \u201c[r]e-gardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review <em>de novo, </em>as a question of law, whether a factor considered by the district court in sentencing is impermissible. <em>Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252. (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">When revoking a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) instructs courts to consider certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine an appropriate sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>tence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(e). Specifically, courts are directed to consider: \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; the need for the sentence imposed to \u201cafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct\u201d and \u201cprotect the public from further crimes [committed by] the defendant\u201d; the need for the sentence to \u201cprovide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner\u201d; applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; any pertinent policy statements; the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(e), citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7). The district court need not discuss or explicitly state each factor on the record, but an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We will vacate a sentence if we are left \u201cwith the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). If the sentence imposed lies outside of the guideline range, the degree of the variance is relevant to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and, in general, \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Nonetheless, in reviewing such a sentence, the appellate court \u201cmay not apply a presumption of unreasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in deciding whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance, and it need not provide \u201cextraordinary justification\u201d for a sentence that lies outside the guideline range. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230,1238 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and careful consideration of the record, we affirm. The district court specifically advised Sapsin that, although the advisory guideline range for her sentence was six to 12 months, she could potentially receive up to 24 months in prison. The court found that a variance was warranted. The court based its decision on a consideration of the policy statements, the \u00a7 3553(a) mandatory sentencing factors, and Sapsin\u2019s own admission that she committed violations of the conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">There is no basis on which to conclude that the district court made a clear error in judgment in weighing the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors against the undisputed record. <em>See Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237-1238; <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (the reviewing court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d). The district court did not abuse its discretion. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
