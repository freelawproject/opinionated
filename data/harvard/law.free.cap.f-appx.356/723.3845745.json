Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Villatoro\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2. Villatoro\u2019s request to proceed pro se on appeal is DENIED. <em>See United States v.
