Layton argues that his prior conviction for fleeing and attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3), is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of the career offender enhancement set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). He also argues that his 120-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">In July 2007, a confidential source informed the Naples, Florida Police Department that Layton sold crack cocaine. In August 2007, Layton twice met with an undercover detective (\u201cUC\u201d) and provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the UC with crack cocaine in exchange for money. Layton was eventually arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) classified Layton as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, because he had two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. These prior felonies were listed as \u201cFlee/Attempted Elude High Speed and Reckless (Fla.Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3)),\u201d and \u201cBurglary of an Occupied Dwelling.\u201d With regard to the Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) violation, the PSI explained that deputies attempted to arrest Zachary Williams, who was trespassing at an apartment complex, but before deputies could arrest Williams, he fled the scene in a vehicle driven by Layton. Deputies followed Layton\u2019s vehicle in a marked police car with overhead lights activated. Layton \u201cfailed to stop at stop signs, spe[ ]d, cross[ed] over lanes, hit a parked vehicle, and continue[d] traveling recklessly.\u201d Layton eventually stopped the vehicle after almost hitting a deputy\u2019s vehicle. Layton then exited the vehicle and fled on foot, but was soon apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C), Layton\u2019s total offense level as a career offender was enhanced to 32, although he received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in an enhanced offense level of 29. Because Lay-ton was a career offender, his criminal history category was enhanced to category VI, which combined with his offense level to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Layton filed objections to the PSI, two of which are relevant to the instant appeal. First, Layton objected that he should not be considered a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, because his conviction for fleeing/attempting to elude under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) did not qualify as a crime of violence. Layton also argued that he should receive a downward departure, because the career offender enhancement overrepresented his criminal history. Layton did not object to the description of the conduct underlying the fleeing and eluding offense listed in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">At the sentencing hearing, Layton renewed his two previous objections and also argued for a below-guideline sentence, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), noting that his mother had died when he was 11 years old, at which time he was sent to live with his father, who he did not really know and with whom he did not get along. He noted that he had a learning disability and had dropped out of school and experimented with marijuana and cocaine, which he began smoking at age 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The district court overruled Layton\u2019s objection to the application of the career offender enhancement, finding that binding precedent held that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) constituted a crime of violence. The court granted a departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, finding that criminal history category VI significantly overrepresented Layton\u2019s criminal history. Thus, Layton\u2019s criminal history category was reduced to V, and his guideline sentencing range was reduced to 140 to 175 months. The court stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, granted Layton\u2019s request for a variance, and sentenced Layton to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 3 years\u2019 supervised release. Layton objected to the court\u2019s application of the career offender enhancement and the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">\n<em>Career Offender Enhancement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) provides that: Any person who willfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle, with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed on the vehicle, with siren and lights activated, and during the course of the fleeing or attempted eluding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">(a) Drives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, commits a felony of the second degree....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">(B) Drives at high speed, or in any manner which demonstrates a wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, and causes serious bodily injury or death to another person ... commits a felony of the first degree....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The career offender guideline defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arv\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <em>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">The analysis we use to determine whether an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline is the same analysis we use to determine whether an offense is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008) (noting that \u201c[t]his [Cjourt has repeatedly read the definition of a \u2018violent felony\u2019 under \u00a7 924(e) of the Armed Career Criminal Act as \u2018virtually identical\u2019 to the definition of a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2\u201d and applying ACCA analysis to examine whether an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the career offender guideline); <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) is identical to the ACCA\u2019s residual clause in all material respects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">We have previously determined that the specific offense at issue in this case \u2014 willful fleeing and eluding under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) \u2014 constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1183 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Polynice v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 1049, 128 S.Ct. 673, 169 L.Ed.2d 527 (2007). In <em>Orisnord, </em>we determined that \u201cthe \u2018potential risk\u2019 of injury, rather than actual violence or actual injury, is the touchstone of a \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c[t]he dangerous circumstances surrounding a person\u2019s attempt to flee from law enforcement coupled with the person\u2019s operation of a motor vehicle most assuredly presents a \u2018potential risk of physical injury\u2019 to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\"><em>Orisnord, </em>however, was decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which established a three-step inquiry for determining whether an offense qualifies as a violent felony under the residual clause of the ACCA and, therefore, as a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See id. </em>at 142-48, 128 S.Ct. at 1585-88. We have summarized <em>Begay\u2019s </em>three-step approach as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>First, what is the relevant category of crime, determined by looking to how the crime is ordinarily committed? Second, does that crime pose a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d that is similar in degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes? Third, is that crime similar in kind to the enumerated crimes?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1287. With regard to the first step, courts should \u201cconsider the offense as defined by the law, rather than considering the facts of the specific violation.\u201d <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1350. With respect to the third step, the Supreme Court noted that the enumerated crimes \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and the use of explosives \u2014 \u201call typically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct,\u201d as opposed to \u201ccrimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After <em>Begay </em>was decided, we were confronted with the issue of whether a defendant\u2019s conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) constituted a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1284. In contrast to \u00a7 316.1935(3), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) does not require, as an element of the offense, that the offender travel at a high rate of speed or exhibit a wanton disregard for persons or property. <em>See id. </em>at 1293; <em>compare </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2) <em>with </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3). We specifically noted that \u201c[t]he dangerous conduct ordinarily underlying a violation of \u00a7 316.1935(3) ... presents a serious potential risk of injury.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1284. In holding that \u00a7 316.1935(2) is not a violent felony, we determined that \u201cthe willful decision not to follow a police officer\u2019s signal is \u2018purposeful;\u2019 \u201d however, \u201cwithout high speed or reckless conduct, [disobeying an officer\u2019s signal] is not sufficiently aggressive and violent enough to be like the enumerated ACCA crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Our court recently reviewed Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3) in the context of deciding whether or not a conviction under that section of the statute would qualify as a crime of violence for Sentencing Guideline purposes and under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2 and 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). We analyzed such a conviction by following the steps set forth in <em>Begay </em>and concluded that: \u201cFleeing at high speed or with wanton disregard for safety amounts to holding a finger on the trigger of a deadly weapon, without care for whom the bullet may strike.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th cir.2009). Thus, we have resolved any doubt and answered in the affirmative. The ruling of the district court in applying the career offender enhancement was proper and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\n<em>Reasonableness of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">We may review a sentence for procedural or substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In considering the substantive reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the totality of the circumstances, and apply an abuse of discretion standard, under which we reverse only if we find \u201cthat the district court has made a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both th[e] record and the factors in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u201c[T]he district judge should then consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596. The factors in \u00a7 3553(a) that the court must consider are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201cWe may find that a district court has abused its considerable discretion if it has weighed the factors in a manner that demonstrably yields an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191. Normally, however, the decision of how much weight to accord particular factors in devising a sentence is within the discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The record in this case shows neither procedural nor substantive error. The correct guideline range was 151-188 months. The sentencing judge departed downward to 120 months. In light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Layton\u2019s 120-month sentence is substantively reasonable. In sentencing Layton, the court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that a 120-month sentence was reasonable. Layton benefited from a \u00a7 4A1.3 departure as well as a variance, which the court granted after hearing about Layton\u2019s problems as a child. In light of Layton\u2019s prior criminal history, the court did not err in refusing to grant a greater departure. Layton\u2019s criminal history began at age seven and the crimes he committed increased in severity over time. Although Layton expressed remorse for his actions, his failure to cease criminal activity in the past indicated that a significant sentence was necessary to deter him from committing future crimes. Furthermore, the fact that Layton may have received lenient sentences in the past does not entitle him to a further reduction in the present case. Layton\u2019s sentence was well below the low end of his applicable guideline range and, in light of his criminal history of drug abuse, was not substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">.
