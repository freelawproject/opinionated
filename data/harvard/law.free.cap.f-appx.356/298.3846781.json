Andrews asserts the district court erred in denying him qualified immunity by relying on \u201cstray comments\u201d from various individuals, which were too attenuated to be attributed to his decision. Andrews further contends his subjective reasons for not promoting Carl \u2014 that Carl performed poorly in the interview and the other individual was the best qualified and performed well during her interview\u2014 were not discriminatory and were objectively reasonable, such that he was entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-18\">The district court concluded there were disputed issues of material fact regarding whether Andrews\u2019 reasons for failing to promote Carl were pretextual, and denied summary judgment and qualified immunity to Andrews. After a thorough review of the record, and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
