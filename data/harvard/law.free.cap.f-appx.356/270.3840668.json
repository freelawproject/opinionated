After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o)....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); see also U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">Here, Plair\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. However, at his original sentencing, Plair was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum term of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), in light of his prior felony drug conviction. Thus, Plair\u2019s sentencing range was not based on the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c), but on the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b). As such, Amendment 706 had no effect on Plair\u2019s sentencing range of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-17\">Plair argues that the district court erred at his original sentencing when it imposed the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum because his prior conviction was not final when he commenced this federal drug offense. This argument cannot be raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the issue relates to an original sentencing determination and not to a guideline amendment that has subsequently lowered Plair\u2019s sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding all original sentencing determinations remain the same except the guideline range that has since been amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Plair\u2019s argument that his sentence is unreasonable based on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir.2009) (concluding that <em>Kimbrough </em>does not \u201cprohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission\u201d), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>United States v.
