The question in this case is how to determine whether a defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because of Amendment 706 when there was \u00a7 5K1.1 departure in the original sentence. After review, we conclude that Amendment 706 must lower the sentencing range before the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure in order for a defendant to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the defendant was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">A. Smiley\u2019s 2005 Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b330-23\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Smiley pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii) and 846. At a 2005 sentencing hearing, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>assigned Smiley a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2004), because Smiley\u2019s offense involved 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. The district court calculated a total offense level of 39 based on: (1) a four-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), for Smiley\u2019s leadership role in the offense; and (2) a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (a) and (b), for Smiley\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. With a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history category of VI based on 23 criminal history points, Smiley\u2019s guideline range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The district court then granted the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Smiley\u2019s substantial assistance. The district court stated that it would \u201cdepart downward five levels to a level 34, which gives us a range of 262 to 327 months.\u201d The district court sentenced Smiley to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">B. Smiley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In March 2008, Smiley filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered by two levels the base offense levels for certain crack cocaine offenses. The district court denied Smiley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, concluding Smiley was ineligible for a sentence reduction. Smiley\u2019s base offense level of 38, with the three-level role adjustment and two-level acceptance reduction, yielded a total offense level of 39. Smiley\u2019s criminal history category of VI and total offense level of 39 yielded a guideline range of 360 to life imprisonment before the \u00a7 5K1.1 departure. Amendment 706 did lower Smiley\u2019s offense level by two levels from 38 to 36, which with the role and acceptance adjustments resulted in a total offense level of 37. However, a total offense level of 37, with a criminal history category VI, yielded the same guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Thus, the district court determined Smiley\u2019s sentencing range was not lowered by Amendment 706 as required to be eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">In a motion for reconsideration, Smiley argued that the district court should have assessed the impact of Amendment 706 by looking at his \u201ctotal offense level\u201d after his \u00a7 5K1.1 departure was taken into account, which he said was 34 before Amendment 706 and 32 after Amendment 706. Smiley argued that an offense level 32 and a criminal history category VI would yield a lower sentencing range of 210 to 262 months. The district court denied Smiley\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Smiley appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a), similarly provides that where \u201cthe guideline range applicable to that defendant\u201d has subsequently been lowered by an amendment to the Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>lines, the district court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) (2008). However, \u00a7 1B1.10(a) provides that a sentence reduction \u201cis not authorized\u201d if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2). Thus, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Smiley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was based on Amendment 706, which reduced certain base offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)\u2019s drug quantity table applicable to crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713 (2007). In Smiley\u2019s case, Amendment 706 applies to his particular crack cocaine offense and reduced the base offense level for his drug offense from 38 to 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2). And, after the four-level increase for his leadership role and three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Smiley\u2019s amended total offense level would be 37 (as opposed to his original total offense level of 39). Even after Amendment 706, any offense level above 36 yields the same sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment if, like Smiley, the defendant has a criminal history category of VI. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A, Sentencing Table.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For this reason, Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Smiley\u2019s applicable guideline range. And, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B), a sentence reduction is not authorized if Amendment 706 \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that it lacked authority to grant Smiley a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Smiley argues that the district court should have assessed the impact of Amendment 706 on his sentencing range using only Smiley\u2019s offense level after the \u00a7 5K1.1 five-level downward departure. In other words, Smiley wants his offense level calculated using both the two-level reduction in Amendment 706 and the five-level departure under \u00a7 5K1.1. Smiley points out that a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of VI results in a lower sentencing range of 210 to 262 months.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smiley\u2019s argument lacks merit for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>First, Smiley misapprehends the nature of \u00a7 5K1.1 departures. Section 5K1.1 provides that, upon the government\u2019s motion stating that the defendant provided substantial assistance, \u201cthe court may depart from the guidelines\u201d and \u201c[t]he appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court\u201d based on considerations such as the significance, usefulness, timeliness, nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. The overall structure of the Sentencing Guidelines contemplates that the \u201capplicable guideline range\u201d is calculated first and that \u00a7 5K1.1 is a departure from the guideline range, not a guideline range of its own. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 (providing the order to be followed in applying the provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Second and more specifically, in applying the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court first calculates the offense level under Chapters 2 and 3 and the criminal history category under Chapter 4. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(a)-(f). As outlined above, Amendment 706 lowered Smiley\u2019s base offense level from 38 to 36, but due to the role and acceptance adjustments, Smiley\u2019s total offense level was 37. The district court then uses the total offense level and criminal history category it has calculated to determine the applicable guidelines range in the Sentencing Table in Part A of Chapter 5. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(g). After calculating the applicable guideline range, the district court may consider departures in Part K of Chapter 5. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.l(i). Part K of Chapter 5 authorizes the district court to \u201cdepart from the guidelines,\u201d based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. In other words, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 \u201cdoes not provide a Guidelines range of its own, but rather [is] a departure from the Guidelines range, made after the applicable Guidelines range has been calculated.\u201d <em>United States v. Lindsey, </em>556 F.3d 238, 245 (4th Cir.2009) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that, to determine whether the applicable guideline range has been lowered, the district court should apply Amendment 706\u2019s two-level offense level reduction after a nine-level downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 182,175 L.Ed.2d 114 (2009). Indeed, the application notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 define \u201cdownward departure\u201d as a \u201cdeparture that effects a sentence less than a sentence that could be imposed under the <em>applicable guideline range </em>or a sentence that is otherwise less than the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(E) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">In short, the \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure did not change Smiley\u2019s applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>guideline range; rather, it is an authorized departure from the applicable guideline range based on Smiley\u2019s substantial assistance. That the district court in Smiley\u2019s case quantified its \u00a7 5K1.1 discretionary departure in terms of five offense levels as opposed to percentages, does not change the fact that a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure is <em>from </em>the calculated guideline range. We agree with the Fourth Circuit in <em>Lindsey </em>that the fact that the district court quantified the downward departure in offense-level terms \u201cdid not amount to the application of a \u2018sentencing range\u2019 authorized and made applicable by the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d 556 F.3d at 246. As the <em>Lindsey </em>court pointed out, \u00a7 5K1.1 merely instructs the district court to determine an \u201cappropriate reduction,\u201d leaving the district court free to express that reduction as a percentage, a flat number of months or a number of offense levels. <em>Id. </em>at 245-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Third, the language of \u00a7 lB1.10(b) also supports this conclusion. Section lB1.10(b) provides that, while the district court may consider previously-given departures in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2), the district court does so only <em>after </em>it has determined that a departure is warranted in \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) &amp; (2). Furthermore, \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) describes a sentence imposed pursuant to a downward departure as a term of imprisonment that is \u201cless than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B), <em>see Lindsey, </em>556 F.3d at 245 (explaining that \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2) \u201cdirects that only after it is determined that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is warranted via the calculation in \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1), a downward departure may be made from the amended sentence\u201d). Thus, \u00a7 1B1.10(b) recognizes that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d does not include downward departures.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Here, based on his total offense level of 39 and criminal history category of VI, Smiley\u2019s applicable guideline range, within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.10(a), was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The district court\u2019s subsequent \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure was a departure <em>from </em>that applicable guideline range and did not provide a new guideline range. As discussed above, even after Amendment 706 reduced his base offense level and in turn his total offense level, Smiley\u2019s applicable guideline range remained the same because of his criminal history category VI. Thus, Smiley was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. Although Smiley qualified for career-offender status, the district court did not apply the career offender guideline because Smiley\u2019s total offense level applicable to the underlying drug offense, 39, was greater than his career offender offense level, 37. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) (providing that the greater offense level, as between the career offender offense level and the otherwise applicable offense level, shall apply).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court's legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. The government incorrectly asserts that, after Amendment 706, the career offender offense level becomes the relevant offense level because it is greater than the offense level derived from Smiley\u2019s drug quantity. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) (noting that, in comparing the two offense levels, the career offender offense level is adjusted for acceptance of responsibility). Smiley\u2019s offense level would be 34 under the career offender provision after a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which is less than offense level of 37 derived from \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) as amended by Amendment 706.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\">.Smiley cites <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756 (11th Cir.1998), but that case involved Amendment 516 and the narrow issue of whether the court that granted a prior downward departure was required to honor its original downward departure. Vautier argued that after substituting the new base offense level under Amendment 516 for his marijuana conviction, the district court was required to reduce his sentence and to grant a substantial assistance downward departure again. 144 F.3d at 758-60. <em>Vautier </em>rejected this claim concluding that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>had discretion whether to reapply a downward departure for substantial assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In any event, <em>Vautier </em>does not address the threshold question of eligibility and is not on point. As U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a) makes clear, a district court considering a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion first must address whether it has the \u2018\u2018authority\u201d to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence, i.e. whether the defendant is eligible for a sentence reduction. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a) &amp; cmt. n. 1(A). If the district court determines that the amendment did indeed lower the applicable guidelines range, the defendant is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction and the district court \"may\u201d reduce his sentence, but is not required to do so. Only after eligibility is established does \u00a7 lBI.10(b)\u2019s two-step process, described in <em>Vautier, </em>comes into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">In Smiley's case, the district court concluded, under \u00a7 IB 1.10(a), that Smiley was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction and that it did not have the authority to grant Smiley's \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Therefore, the district court never reached the sentence recalculation required by \u00a7 IB 1.10(b) or the question of whether to re-apply the five-level downward departure. Instead, the only question the district court addressed was the question presented on appeal \u2014 whether Smiley's \"applicable guideline range\u201d was lowered by Amendment 706 within the meaning of \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b334-7\">. Because Smiley is ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, the district court had no authority to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and impose a new sentence. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that, because the defendant\u2019s sentencing range did not change and the district court did not have authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court did not need to examine the \u00a7 3553(a) factors). Smiley's argument that his original 262-month sentence is unreasonable is outside the scope of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (limiting proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to cases in which a retroactive amendment affects the applicable guidelines range); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not \"grant to the court jurisdiction to consider extraneous resentencing issues\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
