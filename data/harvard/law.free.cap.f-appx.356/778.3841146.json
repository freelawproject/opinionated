Specifically, Franklin argues that the district court erred in its calculation of his sentence reduction, in failing to reference the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its sentence reduction order, and in failing to give Franklin an opportunity to respond to public safety considerations raised by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">In 2005, Franklin, a convicted felon, pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm, one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d cocaine), and one count of marijuana possession. Franklin\u2019s presentence report recommended 70 to 87 months imprisonment, based on his total offense level of 25 and his level III criminal history category. The district court sentenced Franklin to 87 months, noting that a sentence at the upper end of the Guidelines range was appropriate given his past offenses and the nature of his present offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">In 2008, based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s retroactive reduction in the offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>filed a notice of motion to determine Franklin\u2019s potential eligibility for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The probation officer\u2019s retroactive Guidelines report reduced Franklin\u2019s new offense level two levels to 23, which, with a criminal history category of III, yielded a Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months imprisonment. The district court summarily granted the motion but reduced Franklin\u2019s offense level by only one level to 24, or a Guidelines range of 63 to 78 months imprisonment. The court resentenced Franklin to 78 months. The court checked the box on the order noting that the reduced sentence was \u201cwithin the amended guideline range,\u201d and added as an additional comment that the \u201c[ijnstant offense involved the presence of a firearm.\u201d Franklin now appeals, arguing that the district court incorrectly calculated his sentence by reducing Franklin\u2019s offense level by only one level rather than two, as required by the amended Guidelines. He also argues that the court failed to mention the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in his resentencing order and failed to give him an opportunity to respond to or contest any public safety considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-15\">We review the decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995). We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Franklin contends that the district court was obligated to determine his offense level as if amended Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(8) had been in effect at the time of his original sentencing hearing, and that therefore the district court\u2019s reduction of his offense level by one rather than two levels was improper. Sentence \u201creductions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory; this section merely gives the district court discretion to reduce a sentence under limited circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009); see <em>also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (stating that \u201cthe court <em>may </em>reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\u201d) (emphasis added). Indeed, courts are under no obligation to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See, e.g., Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010 (affirming a district court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Guideline \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l) states that in determining whether a sentencing reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is warranted, \u201cthe court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendments) to the guidelines ... had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.\u201d Here, the district court erroneously noted on the resentencing order that \u201c[t]he reduced sentence is within the guideline range\u201d when, in fact, it was not. The retroactive Guidelines report correctly found that Franklin\u2019s new offense level was 23, with a criminal history category of III and a sentence range of 57 to 71 months. Instead of conforming its decision to the report, the district court indicated that Franklin\u2019s new offense level was 24, with a criminal history category of III and a sentence range of 63 to 78 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The Government argues that the court was entitled to vary upward from Franklin\u2019s Guidelines sentence in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Government points to the district court\u2019s notation on the order that the \u201c[i]nstant offense involved possession of a firearm\u201d to show the court\u2019s consideration of \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and to support its upward departure from the new Guidelines range. However, if the district court were departing from the Guidelines based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it should have indicated that it was sentencing outside the amended Guidelines range by checking \u201cOther\u201d under \u201cSentence Relative to Amended Guideline Range\u201d on the sentence reduction order. Instead, the district court incorrectly stated that Franklin\u2019s sentence reduction to 78 months was \u201cwithin the amended guideline range,\u201d when it plainly was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s sentence reduction order and REMAND this case for re-sentencing pursuant to the correct amended sentencing range for Franklin\u2019s convictions. As we are vacating and remanding on other grounds, we decline to reach Franklin\u2019s arguments that the district court improperly failed to mention the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in his sentencing reduction order and failed to give him an opportunity to respond to or contest any public safety considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b807-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
