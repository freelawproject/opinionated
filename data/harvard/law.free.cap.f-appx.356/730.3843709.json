Because Clarke did not present any argument before the BIA challenging the IJ\u2019s determination that he was removable pursuant to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i), no such argument may be considered now. <em>See Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 554 (5th Cir.1997). Section \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 provided an alternate basis for his removability, and, therefore, any challenges to his removability now are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">Clarke contends that the BIA erred in finding that he had committed an aggravated felony such that he was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. Clarke was convicted in New York in 2006 of criminal possession of crack cocaine in the seventh degree after he had been convicted in New York in 1995 of criminal possession of cocaine in the seventh degree. The BIA did not err in concluding that Clarke had committed an aggravated felony for immigration law purposes. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 266-68 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1012, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2009); <em>Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 284, 290-91 (5th Cir.2007). Clarke also claims that several due process violations occurred with respect to his removal proceedings. Because those claims were not exhausted before the BIA, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider them. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-21\">Clarke has also filed a petition for review (PFR) of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. The argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>merits involved in that PFR are identical to arguments raised with respect to Clarke\u2019s PFR from the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal. Accordingly, Clarke\u2019s PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration lacks merit for same reasons above. The Government moves to dismiss Clarke\u2019s PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">For the reasons stated above, Clarke\u2019s PFR from the dismissal of his appeal is DENIED, his PFR from the denial of his motion for reconsideration is DENIED, and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
