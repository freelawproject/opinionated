The district court denied leave to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) and Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). By moving to proceed IFP in this court, Porter is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Porter asserts that the search of his vehicle violated his constitutional rights because no search warrant was issued and because he was no longer near the vehicle when it was searched. Porter, who alleged that the defendants were negligent, fails to show that the district court erred in dismissing his civil rights action. <em>See Adames v. Perez, </em>331 F.3d 508, 514 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Porter also contends that he was a pretrial detainee rather than a prisoner and that the district court therefore erred in determining that his claim should be dismissed on grounds that Mississippi provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy for the confiscation of prisoner property. Porter\u2019s argument fails to show that the district court erred in dismissing his action. <em>See Nickens v. Melton, </em>38 F.3d 183, 185-86 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">Porter has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. His appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Porter\u2019s complaint as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba, v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir. 1996). Porter is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
