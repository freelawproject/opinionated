On the same day, Hughes refiled his Involuntary Petition in Bankruptcy Case No. 08-28319-JKO (\u201cCase 2\u201d). The district court granted Ap-pellee\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158, district courts have jurisdiction to hear bankruptcy appeals from \u201cfinal judgments, orders, and decrees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). \u201cAs with other types of cases, a final order in a bankruptcy proceeding is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute its judgment.\u201d <em>In </em>re <em>Culton, </em>111 F.3d 92, 93 (11th Cir.1997). The fact that Hughes concurrently appealed the decision in Case 1 and refiled essentially the same petition in Case 2 reveals that the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice in Case 1 did not end the litigation on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-18\">Moreover, the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in this case would violate the general prohibition against two courts entertaining duplicative litigation. <em>Cf. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 402, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982). This prohibition is meant to \u201cpromote judicial economy and avoid the confusion and inefficiency that might flow from putting the same issue before two courts at the same time.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>20-303 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice: Civil \u00a7 303.32[1] (3d ed.2009); <em>Shewchun v. United States, </em>797 F.2d 941, 943 (11th Cir.1986) (noting that the prohibition against a district court exercising jurisdiction over a case properly before the court of appeals prevents parties from \u201cfight[ing] a \u2018two front war\u2019 for no good reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-19\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-20\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\">.
