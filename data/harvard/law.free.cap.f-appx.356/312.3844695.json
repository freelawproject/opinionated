Skendaj argues that (1) the BIA erred in finding that the government rebutted the presumption of his well-founded fear of future persecution by showing changed conditions in Albania, and (2) he suffered from atrocious forms of persecution in Albania so that he is entitled to asylum based on humanitarian or other compelling reasons, even if conditions in the country have changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">I. Withholding of Removal and CAT Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Skendaj does not argue on his appeal to this Court that we should grant him withholding of removal or relief under CAT. Instead, he argues that asylum is his preferred form of relief. Although Sken-daj, in the conclusion to his brief, requests that we grant him withholding of removal, he does not sufficiently argue this issue in his brief. He also does not request relief under CAT. Therefore, he abandons his petition for withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228-29 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (holding that \u201c[wjhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned,\u201d and that \u201cpassing references to issues are insufficient to raise a claim for appeal, and such issues are deemed abandoned\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">II. Changed Country Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">Skendaj argues that he established that he was entitled to asylum based upon his political opinion. He contends that the IJ never shifted the burden to the government to rebut the presumed well-founded fear of future persecution. Rather, he contends the IJ relied solely upon the fact that the Democratic Party recently won Albania\u2019s national elections to conclude that country conditions had changed. Skendaj relies on various country reports to contend that Albania\u2019s conditions have not changed to such an extent as to eviscerate the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. He argues that nothing in the evidence indicates that his persecutors are no longer officers in the State Intelligence Service. Furthermore, Skendaj argues that the IJ erred by taking administrative notice of Albania\u2019s changed conditions because these were adjudicative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>facts to which he had no opportunity to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review factual determinations by the BIA \u201cunder the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283. Under the highly deferential substantial evidence test, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation and eitation omitted). Therefore, to reverse a credibility determination, \u201cwe must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). The fact that the record could support a contrary conclusion is not sufficient to justify a reversal of the BIA\u2019s findings. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">To qualify for asylum, an alien must be a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), INA \u00a7 208(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d includes any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country or to avail himself of that country\u2019s protection \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i), INA \u00a7 208(b)(l)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The applicant satisfies this burden by showing, with credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily-listed factor (such as political opinion), or (2) a well-founded fear that his statutorily-listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">An applicant who has demonstrated past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). To rebut the presumption of future persecution, the government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that \u201c[tjhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution\u201d or that the \u201capplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The record demonstrates that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions in Albania negated the presumption that Skendaj had a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania based upon his past persecution. Skendaj\u2019s entire asylum claim focused on the persecution that Skendaj suffered from the Socialist Party because he was a member of the Democratic Party. However, the BIA found that \u201con September 3, 2005, the Democratic Party and its allies took control of Parliament with 81 of the 140 seats, and following a smooth transition of power the new government was sworn in on September 11, with Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha as the new Prime Minister.\u201d A.R. at 3 (citing U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, <em>Albania: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions </em>(Mar. 2006)). Because the Democratic Party is now in power, it is unlikely that Skendaj\u2019s fellow party members will persecute him. This \u201cfundamental change in circumstances\u201d suggests that Skendaj \u201cno longer has a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). While he argues that his Socialist Party persecutors may still be in power, despite the fact that the Democratic Party won the 2005 election, he fails to support his contention with evidence from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Skendaj fails to provide legal support for his contention that the IJ erred by not shifting the burden to the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to rebut Skendaj\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. An IJ may find that a petitioner\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution has been rebutted by a change in country conditions. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). The law does not explicitly state that an IJ must express that he has shifted the burden to the government, nor does it state that an IJ may not independently find that a petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution has been rebutted. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i) (giving discretion to an IJ to deny an application if changed conditions are \u201cfound by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d). Here, the IJ considered the country report that was admitted into evidence, and found that it rebutted Sken-daj\u2019s presumption of well-founded fear of persecution. Because an IJ may make such a finding, the IJ did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Skendaj argues that the BIA erred by taking administrative notice of Albania\u2019s country report. However, the BIA is entitled to \u201crely heavily\u201d on the State Department\u2019s country reports because the \u201cState Department is the most appropriate and perhaps the best resource the [BIA] could look to in order to obtain information on political situations in foreign nations.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation and citation omitted); <em>see also Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199, 1200 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (finding that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion that conditions had changed in Albania, even though the IJ solely relied on State Department reports); <em>Bregu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>\u2014 F.3d-, at <em>*2, </em>2009 WL 38879 (11th Cir.2009) (finding substantial evidence supported changed conditions in Albania). Thus, the BIA did not err by considering the country report to determine that Albania\u2019s country conditions had changed. In sum, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions rebutted Sken-daj\u2019s presumption of well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">III. Humanitarian Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Skendaj argues that the IJ and BIA erred by failing to grant \u201chumanitarian asylum.\u201d Even if a petitioner does not establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, the IJ may grant an applicant humanitarian asylum on a discretionary basis if the applicant demonstrates \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(iii)(A); <em>see also Mehmeti, </em>572 F.3d at 1200. Skendaj concludes that, even if we hold that Albania\u2019s conditions have sufficiently changed to negate the well-founded fear of future persecution, we should remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether he had compelling circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">However, Skendaj only quoted the standard for humanitarian relief stated above in his appeal to the BIA and did not go on to discuss it further. <em>See </em>A.R. at 13 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii)(A)). Instead, his appeal to the BIA only centered on whether he had established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Furthermore, his request for humanitarian relief was not raised at all to the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">We cannot review Skendaj\u2019s claim that he should receive asylum based on humanitarian or other compelling reasons because this claim was not raised before the IJ or the BIA and, therefore, is unex-hausted. We lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition for review where the petitioner did not exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>have not been raised before the BIA). Therefore, we dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we deny Sken-daj\u2019s petition, in part, and dismiss his petition, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">PETITION DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
