Westine, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas corpus petition, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court for the Northern District of Georgia dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction because Westine did not file it in the judicial district where he was incarcerated. On appeal, Westine does not address the district court\u2019s order, but rather contends that he properly brought this action pursuant to \u00a7 2241 because he satisfied the criteria necessary to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cThe availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that this [Cjourt reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cTypically, a petitioner collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1365. However, \u201c[u]nder the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). We have held that a petitioner may use the \u201csavings clause\u201d to \u201copen the portal\u201d to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">1) [his] claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\"><em>Wofford v. Scott, 177 </em>F.3d 1236, 1244 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">In this case, we conclude from the record that the district court correctly determined that Westine was required to file his \u00a7 2241 petition in the judicial district where he was incarcerated. <em>See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 447, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 2724-25, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004); <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1495 (11th Cir.1991). Because it is undisputed that Westine was not incarcerated in the Northern District of Georgia, we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Hajduk v. United States, </em>764 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1985). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of dismissal and do not address whether Westine could proceed under the savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. Because Westine seeks to proceed under \u00a7 2241, not \u00a7 2255, he is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability before filing this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
