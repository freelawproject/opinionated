Peltier is currently serving a sentence of 262 months for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-19\">In his challenge to the district court\u2019s judgment, Peltier argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applies to proceedings involving sentencing reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as it does in original sentencing proceedings. He argues that although he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court had discretion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-20\">We review Peltier\u2019s arguments de novo. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014- U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2009). Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence where the sentencing range is later lowered by the Sentencing Commission, \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with the policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Eligibility for consideration under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is triggered only by an amendment that lowers the applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-23\">Peltier\u2019s guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status. The district court thus was correct in concluding that a reduction was not permitted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A). We have rejected Peltier\u2019s <em>Booker </em>arguments. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238-39. \u201c[T]he concerns at issue in <em>Booker </em>do not apply in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. Although the Guidelines must be treated as advisory in an original sentencing proceeding, <em>Booker </em>does not prevent Congress from incorporating a Guideline provision \u201cas a means of defining and limiting a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
