After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-20\">In 2004, the government issued a notice to appear charging petitioners as removable for overstaying their visitor visas. Petitioners conceded removability and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture alleging political persecution by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d). After a hearing, the Immigration Judge denied all relief, finding that Daniel Hernandez, the sole witness, lacked credibility. The BIA dismissed petitioners\u2019 appeal, agreeing with the IJ\u2019s credibility finding and finding that petitioners had failed to establish eligibility for relief. On May 15, 2008, this Court denied in part and dismissed in part the petition for review of the final removal order. <em>See Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>277 Fed.Appx. 933 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-21\">On March 17, 2008, while that appeal was still pending before this Court, petitioners filed a motion to reopen in the BIA, asserting changed country conditions in Colombia. Petitioners attached affidavits from three people in Colombia recounting recent threats from the FARC against Daniel Hernandez. On July 15, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>2008, the BIA denied the motion to reopen, finding that petitioners had not shown changed country conditions. Specifically, the BIA concluded that the threats described in the affidavits were \u201cmerely cumulative of the [petitioners\u2019] claim raised at [the] hearing,\u201d the denial of which had been based in part on Hernandez\u2019s lack of credibility, which remained unaffected by the affidavits. Petitioners did not appeal the BIA\u2019s July 15, 2008 denial of their motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Instead, on August 6, 2008, petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to reopen. On March 23, 2009, the BIA denied the motion for reconsideration, finding that it had not \u201cerred in [its] assessment of the evidence supporting the motion, particularly in light of the adverse credibility determination made in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On April 21, 2009, petitioners filed this petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 23, 2009 denial of the motion for reconsideration. However, petitioners\u2019 appellate brief before this Court does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion for reconsideration. Instead, the brief is devoted entirely to challenging the BIA\u2019s denial of their underlying motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s July 15, 2008 order denying the motion to reopen because the April 21, 2009 petition for review was not filed within thirty days of the entry of that order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), INA \u00a7 242(b)(1) (providing that an alien seeking review of a final order of the BIA must file a petition for review within thirty days of the issuance of the final order); <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that the period for filing a petition for review \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, [and] it is not subject to equitable tolling\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, the petition is dismissed to the extent petitioners challenge the denial of their motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The petition for review is timely as to the BIA\u2019s March 23, 2009 order denying petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration. However, petitioners failed to proffer any argument as to why the BIA erred in denying this motion. For this reason, petitioners have abandoned any argument regarding the BIA denial of their motion for reconsideration. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d). Therefore, the petition is denied as to the denial of the petitioners\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>our own subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Avila v.
