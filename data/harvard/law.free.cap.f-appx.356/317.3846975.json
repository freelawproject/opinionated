He argues that he should receive a further \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 706, because the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) has a new position on the disparity between sentences of crack cocaine and powder cocaine, and his amended sentence is therefore unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">We review <em>\u201cde novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision whether to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>duce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>n. 1. A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce sentence does not provide the basis for a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We find no merit in Smith\u2019s claim that he should receive an additional \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction to his sentence under Amendment 706, based on a statement that Lanny A. Breuer, a DOJ Assistant Attorney General, made before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs on April 29, 2009, that would reduce the severity of Smith\u2019s crack cocaine offense. Importantly, the law of the case doctrine applies here, since the district court previously granted Smith a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction in this case, which this Court affirmed, upon finding that the district court had adequately weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Smith accordingly to the high-end of his guideline range. Under the law of the ease doctrine, we are \u201cbound by findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d that we previously made in the same case unless \u201c(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">None of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine apply here. First, Breuer\u2019s statement does not constitute new evidence or controlling authority under the first exception, because it was not produced in a subsequent trial. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, controlling authority has not made Breuer\u2019s statement \u201ca contrary decision of law applicable to that issue,\u201d so it does not satisfy the second exception. <em>See id. </em>To the contrary, Breuer\u2019s statement was merely a policy statement that he made to a Senate Committee with the hope that the sentencing disparity would be eliminated between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. Lastly, under the law, our prior decision was not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d and would not \u201cwork manifest injustice.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Smith\u2019s second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because he was not entitled to a further reduction. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that a court need not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors if a defendant is not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
