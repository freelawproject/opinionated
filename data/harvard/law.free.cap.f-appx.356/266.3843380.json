We granted a certificate of appealability to determine whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992) (en bane), when it failed to address his substantive claims regarding prosecutorial misconduct and the state court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\"><em>Clisby </em>requires district courts \u201cto resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, regardless whether ha-beas relief is granted or denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. Thus, when a district court fails to address all of the claims presented in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-16\">In his \u00a7 2254 petition and supporting-memorandum of law, Rivera asserted under ground four that there was misconduct at trial because the prosecution improperly referred to communications that Rivera had with the elders of his church. Under ground six, Rivera claimed his confession should have been suppressed because his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated. Rivera did not argue his counsel was ineffective for either ground. In response, the State addressed grounds four and six as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. The state asserted that Rivera had raised these claims in a state post-conviction motion as ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to argue prosecutorial misconduct on direct appeal and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise the suppression issue on direct appeal. In Rivera\u2019s reply to the State, he introduced both grounds four and six as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, asserting his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was both deficient and prejudicial for each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">In the report and recommendation, which the district court adopted, the magistrate judge identified Rivera\u2019s grounds for relief as whether: \u201c4) [t]here was procedural misconduct in the improper admission of privilege communication ... [and] 6)[t]he confession should have been suppressed.\u201d However, when the magistrate judge addressed both of these grounds for relief, he addressed them as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The district court did not comply with the dictates of <em>Clisby </em>because it failed to address Rivera\u2019s substantive claims regarding prosecutorial misconduct and the denial of his motion to suppress. The district court\u2019s violation of <em>Clisby </em>is understandable, however, because the State appeared to make an assumption that Rivera intended to raise the two claims in the same manner that he raised them in state court. Further, Rivera\u2019s reply to the State\u2019s brief framed the claims as ineffective-assistance-of-counsel arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Thus, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand the two remaining claims for consideration by the district court. We make no determination whether these claims were properly exhausted in state court. We merely instruct the court to resolve these two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
