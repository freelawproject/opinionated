Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-21\">Jackson contends that the dismissal of his lawsuit was error because the magistrate judge failed to accept the allegations in his pleadings as true. He contends that he did not challenge the validity of the prison storage policy under Administrative Directive 03.72 but the improper use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>smaller sized bin by Eastham Unit officials conducting property searches under the policy. Jackson now complains that the use of the inappropriate bin is intended to frustrate his right of access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Even if Jackson\u2019s allegation that officials used smaller bins than allowed under the policy to measure his property is taken as true, he has not stated a constitutional claim for the denial of access to the courts because he briefs no argument that his position as a litigant has been prejudiced as a result. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>see also Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Jackson has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. His appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jackson\u2019s suit as frivolous and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jackson is cautioned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b757-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
