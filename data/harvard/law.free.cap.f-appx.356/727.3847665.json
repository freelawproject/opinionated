He pleaded guilty to possessing more than 50 kilograms of marijuana intending to distribute it and impersonating a federal officer, and the district court sentenced him to a 31-month prison term. On appeal, Tul-los argues that the factual basis was insufficient to support his guilty plea on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>impersonation charge because, he contends, it did not establish that he committed every element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Tullos did not object to the factual basis in the district court; thus, we review for plain error the decision that the factual basis was adequate. <em>See United States v. London, </em>568 F.3d 553, 558 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 11, 2009) (No. 09-5844). Before a district court may accept a guilty plea, it must determine that there is a sufficient factual basis to support it. Fed.R.CRim.P. 11(b)(3); <em>United States v. Hildenbrand, </em>527 F.3d 466, 474 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 437, 172 L.Ed.2d 290 (2008). The factual basis for the guilty plea must be specific enough to allow the court to determine that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a crime. <em>See United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir.2006). In assessing whether the factual basis is sufficient, we may examine the entire record of the proceedings, <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 74, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002), including the facts adduced in the plea agreement and during the colloquy, <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 489 (5th Cir.2006), the factual findings in the presentence report (PSR) if the court explicitly relies on it, and \u201cfairly drawn\u201d inferences from evidence presented after the plea but before or at sentencing. <em>Hildenbrand, </em>527 F.3d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">A person is guilty of impersonating a federal officer if, as relevant here, he (1) falsely pretends to be a federal officer and (2) acts as such. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 912; <em>United States v. Randolph, </em>460 F.2d 367, 368 (5th Cir.1972). The second prong is satisfied where the defendant engages in \u201cany overt act consistent with the assumed character.\u201d <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>631 F.2d 1223, 1224 (5th Cir.1980). Furthermore, this court requires proof of a third element \u2014 that the impersonator act with fraudulent intent, that is, intent to deceive another to act differently than he would have acted absent the deception. <em>Randolph, </em>460 F.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">The plea colloquy, the PSR findings, and the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing sufficiently support the determination that Tullos\u2019s conduct met all of the elements of the impersonation offense. During the plea colloquy, Tullos admitted misrepresenting to border patrol agents that he was a member of the Coast Guard. He also conceded that he placed clothing with the Coast Guard insignia in the front seat of the ear and told the agents that he was traveling on official orders from the Coast Guard. The PSR, which the district court adopted, reaffirmed these facts and noted that Tullos pretended to be a Coast Guard serviceman so that he \u201cwould not be closely scrutinized\u201d by border patrol agents. Tullos did not object the PSR\u2019s factual findings. Furthermore, the district court noted at sentencing that Tullos\u2019s motive for impersonating a serviceman was to enable him \u201cto run drugs.\u201d Thus, contrary to Tullos\u2019s assertions, the record supports the conclusion that he did more than merely misrepresent that he was a member of the Coast Guard. There is a factual basis for all three elements of the offense \u2014 that Tullos pretended to be a federal officer when he told agents that he was a member of the Coast Guard, that he acted as a member of the Coast Guard when he prominently displayed clothing bearing the Coast Guard insignia in the front seat of his truck and told agents that he was traveling on official orders from the Coast Guard, and that he intended to deceive the border agents so that they would be less likely to inspect his cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b755-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
