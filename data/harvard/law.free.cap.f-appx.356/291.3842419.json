However, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, our review is <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">The district court\u2019s order denying Wells\u2019 motion for a sentence reduction stated that the court had considered the <em>pro se </em>motions filed by Wells, the motions filed by Wells\u2019 counsel, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Wells contends that the district court did not adequately explain its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">Wells is not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was originally sentenced to the statutory minimum of 120 months, even though his guidelines range was 360 months to life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(viii) (providing for \u201ca term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years\u201d). Regardless of whether Amendment 706 reduced Wells\u2019 applicable guideline range, he could not be sentenced below the statutory mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>mum. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf </em>126 F.Sd 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cRegardless of the guideline amendment, the language of the statutory minimum is clear and has been unaltered by Congress. The statute controls in the event of a conflict between the guideline and the statute.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cEven after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.\u201d). Because the district court was bound by the statutory minimum, even if it did not provide any detail explaining why it denied Wells\u2019 \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, any conceivable error in that regard was utterly harmless. <em>Cf. United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that because \u201cthe district court correctly imposed the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, any error in the guidelines calculations is harmless\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-12\">. Based on our jurisdictional order issued on August 7, 2009, we have jurisdiction to consider only Wells' appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his successive \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. We lack jurisdiction to consider any of his contentions about the district court\u2019s denial of his initial \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
