The Airpark argues the trial court erred in determining that the damages it sought to repair an airplane hangar and taxiways that deteriorated after Passero allegedly failed to meet its obligations under a construction contract were consequential damages, which were excluded by the parties' contract. We affirm but certify a question of great public importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Airpark brought causes of action against Passero, an engineering firm, for breach of contract and negligence. The Airpark entered into an agreement with a contractor to construct airplane hangars and taxiways, and it contracted separately with Passero to provide engineering services that included \"part-time resident engineering and inspection, [and] material testing.\" Specifically, the contract required Passero to \"inspect,\" \"observe\" and \"monitor\" the construction work to ensure compliance with the plans and to ascertain the need for correction or rejection of the work, including determining the suitability of materials used by the contractor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Observe the work to determine conformance to the contract documents and to ascertain the need for correction or rejection of the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Arrange for, conduct, or witness field, laboratory or shop tests of construction materials as required by the plans and specifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Determine the suitability of materials on the site, and brought to the site, to be used in construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Interpret the contract plans and specifications and monitor the construction activities to maintain compliance with the intent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Prepare and submit inspection reports of construction activity and problems encountered ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [M]onitor[ ] periodic construction activities on the project and document[ ] their observations in a formal project record ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Airpark alleged that the contractor used substandard material for stabilization underneath the structures, which Passero failed to detect, causing the concrete hangar slabs and asphalt taxiways to prematurely deteriorate. The Airpark sought to recover from Passero the cost to remove, repair, and replace the hangars, taxiways, and underlying subgrade. It sought the same relief from the contractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Passero moved for summary judgment, arguing the damages the Airpark sought to recover were not a direct result of Passero's alleged failure to perform under the contract. Instead, Passero argued the need for repair resulted from a combination of Passero's alleged failure to perform construction inspection services under the contract and the contractor preparing the subgrade improperly. Thus, Passero argued the repair costs were not direct or general damages, but instead were consequential damages, which were excluded by a provision in the parties' contract that stated, \"Passero shall have no liability for indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind.\" Passero argued the only direct or general damages that the Airpark could seek to recover against Passero were the costs of the services provided by Passero. The trial court agreed and entered partial final summary judgment in favor of Passero.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Airpark argues the cost of repair to the hangars and taxiways constitutes general damages and not consequential damages because those damages were foreseeable. It relies on an English case from 1854 called\n   <em>\n    Hadley v. Baxendale\n   </em>\n   , 9 Exch. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854), which defined the general measure of damages as those damages \"arising naturally ... from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties, at the time they made the contract.\" However, if there were \"special circumstances\" that were \"communicated by the plaintiffs to the defendants, and thus known to both parties,\" the plaintiff could recover for \"injury which would ordinarily follow from a breach of contract under these special circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the Airpark argues it was foreseeable that Passero's failure to perform under the contract could have resulted in construction defects going undetected, which could later require repair. It reasons these damages arose naturally from the breach of its contract with Passero and did not involve special circumstances about which it would have been required to give Passero actual notice. Thus, the Airpark argues these damages are general and not special or consequential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Foreseeability is not at issue here. Passero does not dispute it was foreseeable that if it failed to perform its duties under the contract, that could result in the need for repairs. It is thus necessary for us to explore the definition of general, special, and consequential damages and how the question of foreseeability affects the nature of the damages incurred in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"General damages are 'those damages which naturally and necessarily flow or result from the injuries alleged....' \"\n   <em>\n    Hardwick Properties, Inc. v.

The contract required Passero to inspect, observe and monitor the construction work, including determining the suitability of materials used by the contractor, and to report any problems. It cannot be said that repairs stemming from improperly inspected and monitored construction work are unlikely to occur in the usual course of business. The damages in this case were not particular to the Airpark and did not involve special circumstances for which the Airpark would have been required to give Passero actual notice. Instead, these types of damages would be expected to occur to other parties in similar circumstances. Thus, they were not special damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, the cost of repair here did not constitute general damages, either, because the damages were not the direct or necessary consequence of Passero's alleged failure to properly inspect, observe, monitor, and report problems with the construction work. The contractor could have completed the job correctly without Passero performing its duties under the contract. Thus, the need for repair did not arise within the scope of the immediate transaction between Passero and the Airpark. Instead, the need for repair stemmed from loss incurred by the Airpark in its dealings with a third party - the contractor. While these damages \"were reasonably foreseeable,\" they are consequential and not general or direct damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties agree there is no case law directly on point involving damages stemming from the failure to inspect and monitor construction work; however, we find this case is analogous to others that have found the cost to repair or replace property damaged following deficient inspections or other services constituted consequential damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Urling v.
