(collectively \"Darden\") appeal a final judgment that vacated the Value Adjustment Board's (\"VAB\") rulings and reinstated the Orange County Property Appraiser's (\"Property Appraiser\") 2013 and 2014 tax assessments on tangible personal property (\"TPP\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   located in Darden's corporate headquarters. In accepting the Property Appraiser's assessments, the trial court determined that the Property Appraiser was not required to present competent, substantial evidence that its appraisal methodology complied with professionally accepted appraisal practices. Rather, in setting forth the legal standards governing \"fair market value determination\" in its final judgment, the trial court cited to language from\n   <em>\n    Mazourek v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319381\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/831/85/#p89\">\n    831 So.2d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89 (Fla. 2002), that \"[t]he property appraiser's determination of assessment value is an exercise of administrative discretion within the officer's field of expertise.\" The\n   <em>\n    Mazourek\n   </em>\n   decision preceded the 2009 amendment to section 194.301, Florida Statutes, where the Legislature articulated that the value of property must be determined by an appraisal methodology that met the criteria of section 193.011 and professionally accepted appraisal practices. Because the trial court did not comply with section 194.301(2)(b)'s requirement that its assessment must be based on \"competent, substantial evidence of value in the record which cumulatively meets the criteria of s. 193.011 and professionally accepted appraisal practices,\" we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Darden constructed a new corporate headquarters facility in Orange County. The three-story, 469,000 square foot facility employed over one thousand people providing support for Darden's restaurants throughout the country. The facility contains a large amount of TPP, including computers, office furniture, fitness center equipment, test kitchen equipment, solar panels, signage, an alarm system, and a music system. The value of the TPP for 2013 and 2014 is the subject of the parties' litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, Darden filed a TPP tax return estimating the current fair market value of its TPP to be $20,503,172. However, the Property Appraiser valued Darden's TPP for 2013 at $29,033,332, or $8,530,160 more than Darden's estimate. In 2014, Darden filed a TPP tax return estimating the current\n   fair market value of its TPP to be $18,217,701, while the Property Appraiser valued it at $27,424,505 or $9,206,804 more than Darden's estimate. Darden timely challenged the Property Appraiser's valuations for both years by filing petitions with the VAB. In each case, the VAB sided with Darden and reduced the Property Appraiser's assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Property Appraiser timely challenged the VAB's decisions by filing complaints in the circuit court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two actions were consolidated and a multi-day, nonjury, trial took place, in which both sides presented expert witness testimony. During the trial, the trial court expressly rejected Darden's argument that the Property Appraiser was required to show that its appraisal methodology complied with professionally accepted appraisal practices. Subsequently, the trial court entered a final judgment reinstating the Property Appraiser's original assessments for both years. After the denial of Darden's motion for rehearing, this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Article VII, section 4 of the Florida Constitution directs the Legislature, subject to certain provisos and exceptions, to prescribe regulations \"which shall secure a just valuation of all property for ad valorem taxation.\" The phrase \"just valuation\" has been construed to mean \"fair market value.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mazourek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9319381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/831/85/#p89\">\n    831 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   88 (citing\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

In the instant case, Darden and the Property Appraiser agreed that the income approach was not appropriate for valuing Darden's TPP. Darden's valuation expert utilized the market or sales-comparison approach in arriving at his valuation. By contrast,\n    the Property Appraiser utilized a cost approach. Notably, Darden does not dispute that the use of a cost approach in the instant case was permissible under DOR Guidelines.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    DOR Guidelines, which were admitted into evidence, recite that the \"cost approach to value\" involves the consideration of the reproduction or replacement cost of the subject TPP less the extent to which the value has been reduced by deterioration and obsolescence:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     The\n     <strong>\n      Cost Approach\n     </strong>\n     to value involves consideration of\n    </em>\n    :\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    (A) The reproduction or\n    <em>\n     replacement cost is the cost of replacing reproducible property with new property of similar utility, or of reproducing the property at its present site and at present price level, less the extent to which the value has been reduced by deterioration and obsolescence.\n    </em>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n    (B) The historical or original cost is sometimes used as a starting point to the calculation of value.\n    <em>\n     An appropriate appraisal depreciation rate reflecting economic, physical, and functional obsolescence must be determined and applied, as well as an appropriate trending factor to capture price changes from date of acquisition.\n    </em>\n    (This approach may not apply to all assets. See Section G, Replacement Cost New Less Depreciation Calculation.)\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    (C)\n    <em>\n     The appraiser should consider the cost of any asset at the appropriate level of trade-the manufacturing level, the wholesale level, and the retail level-and value the property according to the trade level for which it is utilized.\n    </em>\n    Property normally increases in value as it progresses from the manufacturers' level (the lowest market value) to the retail level of trade (the highest level of trade). At each level a value is added to calculate a selling price which recovers for the current owner all direct costs to manufacture and install and indirect costs of overhead and profit. For example, the trade level concept must be considered when a manufacturer, who is operating at more than one trade level, transfers property to a subsidiary without the normal profit and costs. In order to maintain equity and uniformity in assessments of comparable property, the asset should be valued at a cost had the asset been acquired in an arm's length transaction from an outside supplier.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Fla. Dep't of Rev., S\n    <em>\n     tandard Measures of Value: Tangible Personal Property Appraisal Guidelines\n    </em>\n    40 (1997) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Here, the Property Appraiser presented sufficient evidence that its determination of (1) the reproduction or replacement cost of Darden's TPP, and (2) the extent which its value has been reduced by deterioration, was consistent with DOR Guidelines. Thus, our focus is on the Property Appraiser's calculation of the reduction of value of Darden's TPP resulting from obsolescence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The DOR Guidelines reflect that obsolescence should be considered when appraising any type of property. Obsolescence is defined as the reduction in value due to technological changes or innovation, changes in demand for a product, or other causes:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n    When the loss in value is due to technological change or innovation, it is usually referred to as\n    <em>\n     functional obsolescence\n    </em>\n    . It can be recognized by a lack of utility in the property, the location of the property, or inadequate capacity in use. Functional obsolescence can sometimes be overcome by remodeling or reconditioning.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    When the loss in value is due to change in product, demand, or location, it is customarily referred to as\n    <em>\n     economic\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     obsolescence\n    </em>\n    . This type of obsolescence is brought about by external factors and cannot be overcome. Obsolescence of personal property is not too difficult to recognize, but it is difficult to accurately measure. Adequate market data to measure obsolescence cannot always be found for all types of personal property.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 41 (emphasis added). DOR Guidelines direct the Property Appraiser to \"look to the market\" for any change of value resulting from obsolescence, and specifically recite that \"[t]he appraiser should always consider what an informed purchaser would be willing to pay for the property as an installed operating unit when employed at its highest and best use.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Significantly, the DOR Guidelines do not specify the manner in which obsolescence is to be calculated so as to ultimately determine just valuation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    At trial, the Property Appraiser presented evidence that it made continuous efforts to \"look to the market\" for changing values in TPP from obsolescence by having weekly meetings of appraisers and auditors, going into the field, studying sales and life years of assets, utilizing its own Life Assignment Guide and Present Worth Table, and making constant adjustments to those tables. Critically, the Property Appraiser did not present testimony that the methodology it utilized in calculating obsolescence complied with professionally accepted appraisal practices.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In rebuttal, Darden presented expert testimony that the Property Appraiser's methodology was not consistent with professionally accepted appraisal practices. Darden's expert suggested, inter alia, that the Property Appraiser had failed to sufficiently examine comparable sales when \"looking to the market.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Pursuant to section 194.301(2)(a), the Property Appraiser, as the party challenging the VAB assessment, had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the VAB's assessed value did not represent the just value of Darden's TPP. We conclude that there was competent, substantial evidence to support the trial court's determination that the VAB's valuations of Darden's TPP for 2013 and 2014, respectively, were incorrect and less than the just or fair market value.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    However, because the Property Appraiser failed to present evidence that it calculated obsolescence in accordance with professionally accepted appraisal practices, we conclude that the Property Appraiser failed to meet its additional burden, set forth in section 194.301(2)(b), of showing that there was competent, substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court's valuation of Darden's TPP for 2013 and 2014.
