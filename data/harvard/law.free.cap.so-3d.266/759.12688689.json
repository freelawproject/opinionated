Hall's case was scheduled to begin on December 9, 2013. The record indicates that Hall appeared in court for voir dire but that he did not, however, appear at his trial. On appeal, Hall, who does not dispute the facts of his case, raises two claims-that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel and that the trial court, when it sentenced him, erroneously departed from the presumptive sentencing standards,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-25-34.2, Ala.Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following discussion occurred immediately before the trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE COURT: All right. Okay. Obviously, Mr. Hall is not present. How would the State like to proceed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[THE STATE]: The State would like to go ahead and try this case. He did make himself present at the jury selection and has apparently voluntarily absented himself from these proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"THE COURT: Okay. [Defense counsel]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We would like to ask for a continuance because my defense was based on two witnesses he was supposed to bring, and now my-I don't know how to proceed because now my whole defense strategy is blown out of the water. So I, basically, don't have a defense without those witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[THE STATE]: Well, just because those witnesses aren't here, even if the defendant was here and they didn't show up-as far as I know, they weren't served with subpoenas, so that's not the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, that's what I-they guaranteed me they would be here; they didn't need a subpoena.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"THE COURT: So they have told you they would be here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"THE COURT: Okay. Well, let's just go ahead and proceed. I find that he has voluntar[il]y absented himself from the proceedings. We've already selected a jury. He was here on Monday. He knew when we were to start, and we will just try him in absentia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, I would like to-I don't know what has happened to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"THE COURT: Have you tried to call him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, I have tried to call him. But I don't know, you know, if he's got involved in a wreck or something, in the hospital. But I have tried to call numerous times because he was to be at my office at eight o'clock. Okay? And it would be unfair to him to have a trial without a proper defense, because he has the right to be present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"THE COURT: Well, I don't think we have a choice but to have to go forward. Y'all help me write up something that you want-everybody can agree on the preliminary instruction. I don't think there is any kind of standard instruction for that. So-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Probably because it's not supposed to be done.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"THE COURT: Yes. Pursuant to the rule they can voluntar[il]y absen[t] themselves from a trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (R. 4-8.) Butler County Sheriff Kenny Harden informed the trial court that there had not been any recent reports of accidents involving Hall and that Hall was not present at either of his two known addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The parties discussed a preliminary jury instruction regarding Hall's absence, and Hall's trial counsel stated her concern that the jury, regardless of an instruction to the contrary, would improperly presume that Hall was guilty if the trial continued in his absence. Ultimately, Hall's trial counsel objected \"to the proceedings continuing\" but did not object to the instruction itself. The trial court then found that Hall had \"voluntarily absented himself from the proceeding,\" elected to try Hall in absentia, and issued a bench warrant for his arrest. (R. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court gave the following instruction to the jury before commencing the trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"A defendant does have the right to be present at every stage of the trial, pursuant to Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant may waive the right to be present at any proceeding if the Court finds that his absence from the proceeding was voluntary and constitutes an understanding and voluntary waiver of the right to be present and that the defendant had notice of the time and place of the proceeding and was informed of the right to be present. The proceeding may then proceed and the defendant is tried in absentia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"You may draw no inference or make any assumptions to the guilt or innocence of the defendant by his absence. And his absence is not evidence. Your verdict is to be based on the testimony and evidence presented during the trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (R. 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hall's defense counsel, when given the opportunity to make opening and closing arguments and to cross-examine the State's witnesses, repeatedly stated: \"Defendant through his counsel objects to these proceedings occurring without the defendant because a proper defense cannot be presented because the defendant is absent and request[s] a continuance.\" (R. 27, 40, 48, 54, 62, 63-64, 70.) The trial court overruled each objection and denied each motion to continue, and the case proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The evidence at trial indicated that Hall sold crack cocaine to a confidential informant who was working with the Greenville Police Department. Officer Lionel Davidson, Lieutenant Byron Russell, and the confidential informant all testified that the informant purchased two white rocks from Hall during a controlled buy conducted under the supervision of Lt. Russell and Officer Davidson. Lt. Russell also testified that the transaction occurred within three miles of a school and within three miles of a public housing community. John Bruner, a drug chemist with the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, testified that Officer Davidson delivered the white rocks to him for scientific analysis. Bruner stated that he determined the rocks to be \"cocaine-based, known as crack cocaine.\" (R. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After the State rested, Hall's counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that \"the State did not present [a prima facie case of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance] beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (R. 64.) Hall's counsel made no other objections during the trial and did not call any witnesses in Hall's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After the jury returned the guilty verdict, the trial court determined that it would set Hall's sentencing hearing upon his arrest. Hall was eventually arrested, and the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing on February 20, 2014. At that hearing, the State presented evidence indicating that Hall had more than three prior felony convictions and recommended that the trial court sentence Hall to life imprisonment. Hall's counsel objected to \"having [had] the trial in the first place\" and also to the State's sentencing recommendation. (R. 97.) Hall himself objected to the State's sentencing recommendation, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"As far as the presumptive sentence, the aggravating factors are part of the presumptive sentence. They're not part of the aggravating factors. They're encompassed inside of the presumptive sentencing; therefore, a proper sentence should be within the guidelines. The aggravating factors are not part of the prior felony conviction, are part of presumptive sentencing. The five and five-no sentence enhancement is supposed to depart outside of the guidelines. They're encompassed in the new sentencing guidelines.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (R. 97-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court sentenced Hall as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"All right. Mr. Hall, I am departing from the presumptive sentencing recommendations, and I will be sentencing you under the Habitual Felony Offender Act within that sentencing scheme of 20 years to life. So I hereby sentence you to life imprisonment in the penitentiary in the State of Alabama. I'm also giving you five years for Section 13A-12-250, for being within a three mile radius of a school, and five years for Section 13A-12-270, for being within three miles of a housing project.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (R. 100-01.) The trial court memorialized its sentence in a written order issued the same day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Hall's appointed trial counsel was permitted to withdraw on February 21, 2014. On March 10, 2014, appellate counsel was appointed for Hall, and counsel filed a motion for a new trial that requested simply that the trial court \"reconsider the matter and order a new trial.\" (C. 107.) On March 12, 2014, Hall retained counsel who filed a notice of appearance and, on March 13, 2014, filed an amended motion for a new trial. The amended motion alleged, among other issues, that Hall was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial and requested that the trial court \"vacate [his] sentence under [the Habitual Felony Offender Act, \u00a7 13A-5-9, Ala.Code 1975,] and resentence him pursuant to the presumptive sentencing [standards].\" (C. 112-19.) Hall also incorporated a motion for sentence reconsideration into his amended motion for a new trial in which he made the following claims: (1) that the trial court \"committed a procedural error when it used ... 'aggravating circumstances' to depart from the sentencing [standards]\" (R. 123); (2) that the trial court \"committed substantive error by using these 'aggravating circumstances' to depart from the presumptive [standards]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (R. 124); and (3) that, \"[b]ecause the sentencing [standards] say that departures should be rare and because [his] case is not an extraordinary case, [the trial court] should not have departed from the presumptive [standards].\" (R. 125.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On March 20, 2014, the trial court allowed Hall's appointed appellate counsel to withdraw, and the trial court set a hearing on Hall's amended motion for a new trial for April 4, 2014. The record, however, does not indicate that a hearing was held on that motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the motion was denied by operation of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hall timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Hall, in his initial brief on appeal, contended that he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel and that the trial court erred when it failed to sentence him pursuant to the presumptive sentencing standards. On May 18, 2015, this Court, by unpublished order, remanded this matter to the trial court instructing that court to hold \"an evidentiary hearing regarding Hall's assertions of ineffectiveness of trial counsel\" presented in his amended motion for a new trial and, on return of such action, to \"include written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a transcript of the proceedings.\" (Record on Return to Remand, C. 15.) The trial court complied with our order and held an evidentiary hearing on June 18, 2015. Following the hearing, the trial court issued a written order, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"To prevail the defendant must satisfy the two-prong test established by the U.S. Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). At the hearing the defendant offered no evidence to support a claim of ineffective assistance, only argument that trial counsel did nothing. The first prong which the defendant must satisfy is that counsel's performance was deficient. The defendant must present evidence that the specific facts or omissions were not the result of reasonable professional judgment based on the circumstances at the time of trial. Trial counsel had filed pretrial motions to exclude the State's evidence, conducted voir dire, and moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State's case and then renewed that motion after resting. At trial, faced with the defendant's voluntary absence, counsel objected to the proceeding in absentia and repeatedly moved this Court for a mistrial. The defendant has presented no evidence to this Court that trial counsel's repeated objections to the continuance of the trial in defendant's absence, aimed at obtaining a mistrial, and her decision not to reemphasize the State's evidence by cross-examination was not reasonable defense strategy given the circumstances in which the defendant's actions had placed her. Based on the Court's observance of counsel's actions at trial and the lack\n   of evidence by defendant to overcome the presumption that counsel performed effectively, the Court finds the defendant has failed to satisfy the first prong established under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"Having determined that counsel's limited action at trial was the exercise of reasonable professional judgment under the circumstances and was not inadequate as a defense strategy, the Court will briefly address the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , wherein the defendant must prove that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for trial counsel's ineffective assistance. The defendant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for trial counsel's actions, he would not have been convicted. The direct testimony of the drug task force agent, the confidential informant who made the drug buy, and the forensic analyst who tested the controlled substance, coupled with the audio/video recording of the drug buy and still photographs from that video, was overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"The defendant has failed to present any evidence to support the claim of ineffective assistance and satisfy his burden as set out in\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . It is therefore ORDERED that defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and request for relief is hereby DENIED.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Record on Return to Remand C. 18-19.) Following the trial court's order, Hall filed a motion to reconsider the denial of his amended motion for a new trial. In that motion, Hall claimed: (1) that the trial court \"erred in not considering that [he] is entitled to relief under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cronic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204502\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/648/\">\n    466 U.S. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984)\" (Record on Return to Remand C. 21); (2) that the trial court \"impermissibly rested on the strength of the State of Alabama's case against [him] to defeat concerns that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated\" (Record on Return to Remand C. 22); and (3) that the trial court \"impermissibly concluded that trial counsel's actions were 'strategy' under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   .\" (Record on Return to Remand C. 23). The trial court denied Hall's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On return to remand, this Court granted Hall's motion to submit a brief on return to remand. In his brief, Hall raised the same arguments he raised in his motion for a new trial and in his initial brief on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Hall contends that he \"was denied the effective assistance of counsel required by the Sixth Amendment [of the United States Constitution] when his attorney refused to participate in his trial.\" (Hall's brief, p. 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With respect to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, this Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \"In\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

A defendant has the burden of proving (1) that his counsel's performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance actually prejudiced the defense. 'To meet the first prong of the test, the petitioner must show that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.

It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel's assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \"might be considered sound trial strategy.\" There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case.

Although the conduct described in \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-250 and -270 is not specifically included in the above list, the list includes a \"catchall\" provision authorizing a departure based on \"any other 'aggravating factor' reasonably related to the purposes of sentencing.\" On appeal, Hall raises three central challenges to the trial court's decision to depart from the sentencing standards. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   states that \"a\n   <em>\n    necessary element\n   </em>\n   of the most serious offense may not be used as an aggravating factor for the sentencing event.\"\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   24 (emphasis added). Hall contends that the trial court's reliance on the facts establishing the applicability of the sentencing enhancements in \u00a7 13A-12-250 and \u00a7 13-12-270 was an \"impermissibl[e] use [ ] [of] 'elements' of [his] offense as aggravating factors in order to depart from the presumptive sentencing [standards].\" (Hall's brief, p. 24.)

Section 13A-12-211(a) provides that \"[a] person commits the crime of unlawful distribution of controlled substances if, except as otherwise authorized, he or she sells, furnishes, gives away, delivers, or distributes a controlled substance enumerated in Schedules I through V.\" Thus, neither of the enhancements provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-250 and -270 is a\n   <em>\n    necessary element\n   </em>\n   of the offense of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-12-211(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Contrary to Hall's assertion, the decisions he cites-\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   -do not transform the sentencing enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-250 and -270 into \"necessary elements\" the\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   prohibits from being used as \"aggravating factors.\" Rather, those decisions establish that, for purposes of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \"a fact increasing either end of the sentencing range (the minimum or the maximum) produces a new\n   penalty, constitutes an element of the offense, and must be found by the jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received had a different range been applicable.\"\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904352\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/445/\">\n    152 So.3d at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words,\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   stand for the proposition that, to increase a defendant's sentence pursuant to aggravating factors, the Sixth Amendment requires the government to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that, in addition to committing the acts establishing the elements of the underlying offense, the defendant committed acts that qualify as aggravating factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   do not transform such aggravating factors into \"necessary elements\" of the underlying offense for purposes of a circuit court's decision to depart from the presumptive sentencing standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, Hall's arguments in this regard are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In addition to prohibiting the use of a \"necessary element\" as an aggravating factor, the\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   prohibits the use of \"[w]orksheet scoring factors for the most serious offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   24. Hall argues that this prohibition applies to the enhancements provided in \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-250 and -270. Hall cites \u00a7 12-25-34(c), Ala.Code 1975, which provides that the proposed sentencing ranges for the\n   <em>\n    voluntary\n   </em>\n   guidelines (which preceded the presumptive sentencing standards) were to include \"historically based sentence ranges, including all applicable statutory minimums and sentence enhancement provisions, including the Habitual Felony Offender Act, with adjustments made to reflect current sentencing policies.\" In Hall's view, \u00a7 12-25-34(c) makes the enhancements under \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-250 and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   -270 \"worksheet scoring factors\" and, therefore, excludes those provisions from being used as aggravating factors under the presumptive standards. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   does not specifically define \"worksheet scoring factor,\" but the two worksheets applicable to Hall's conviction-the \"Drug Prison In/Out Worksheet\" and the \"Drug Prison Sentence Length Worksheet\"-have a section entitled \"sentencing factors section.\" Within each \"sentencing factors section\" on those worksheets are categories with certain \"scores\" applicable to specifically delineated factors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither of those worksheets includes the enhancements found in \u00a7 13A-12-250 or \u00a7 13A-12-270. Thus, nothing on the worksheets or in the\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   indicates that either of these enhancements is used as a \"worksheet scoring factor.\" Accordingly, Hall's\n   arguments in this regard are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Finally, Hall contends that the trial court's departure from the sentencing standards is in conflict with the statement in the\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   that \"[d]eparture sentences should be rare.\"\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   24. Placed in context, the statement cited by Hall is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \"The Standards are designed to provide appropriate recommendations for sentences in covered cases and are presumptive for non-violent covered offenses as defined in Ala.Code [1975,] \u00a7 12-25-32. However, in exceptional cases, upon a finding of aggravating and/or mitigating factors, the sentencing court may depart from either a dispositional or durational sentence recommendation or from both. Departure sentences should be rare, with the court following the presumptive recommendation in the vast majority of sentenced cases.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As noted above, \"the decision to depart from the presumptive sentence recommendation\n   <em>\n    is in the discretion of the court\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904352\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/445/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). There is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court's decision to depart from the presumptive sentencing standards when it sentenced Hall was based on an erroneous conclusion of law or that the record contains no evidence upon which the court rationally could have based its decision. Likewise, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court's departure in Hall's case violated the general admonition in the\n   <em>\n    Standards Manual\n   </em>\n   that \"[d]eparture sentences should be rare.\" Accordingly, Hall has not demonstrated that the trial court abused its discretion in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   WINDOM, P.J., and WELCH, KELLUM, and BURKE, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    The jury unanimously found that Hall had committed the offense \"within a three-mile radius of a public or private school, college, university, or other educational institution\" and \"within a three-mile radius of a public housing project owned by a housing authority.\" (R. 92.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The trial court also ordered Hall to pay a $1,000 fine, a $2,000 drug-demand-reduction assessment, a $100 crime-victims-compensation assessment, a $700 bail-bond fee, $40 in restitution, court costs, and, following a remand from this Court by unpublished order, a $100 forensic-services-trust-fund assessment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Hall, citing the case-action summary, contends in his reply brief that a hearing on his amended motion for a new trial was held on April 4, 2014.
