The Hinds County Chancery Court entered an order naming Roshida Nelson and her minor daughter Tina\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the sole heirs at law and wrongful death beneficiaries of Delvyn Nelson. The appellants now appeal, arguing the following assignments of error: (1) the chancellor erred in determining that Robert Perkins and his natural children were not wrongful death beneficiaries, (2) the chancellor erred by adjudicating Tina as a wrongful death beneficiary, (3) the wrongful death statute is unconstitutional, and (4) the chancellor erred by failing to apply the doctrine of unclean hands sua sponte.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. Upon our review, we find that the chancellor erred in part in her determination of the wrongful death beneficiaries. Accordingly, we affirm in part, and reverse and render in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Delvyn Nelson was born to Roshida Nelson on January 26, 2012. Delvyn was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) in Jackson and died on June 2, 2012, while a patient at UMMC. The death certificate, dated July 3, 2012, stated that Delvyn's cause of death was \"sepsis, fungal\" due to or as a consequence of \"multiple organ system failure, cardiopulmonary disease, and congenital heart disease.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. After Delvyn was born, Roshida filed an action to determine paternity\n   against Robert Perkins in the District Court of Sumter County, Alabama. Roshida and Perkins were never married, and Perkins was not listed on Delvyn's birth certificate. After Roshida filed the paternity action, Perkins denied that he was Delvyn's natural father and requested genetic testing. Perkins further denied paternity when Roshida sought financial support from Perkins through the Social Security Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. Although Delvyn tragically died before the parties received the test results, the results revealed that Perkins was Delvyn's father. The results were filed with the Alabama court on June 18, 2012. On that same day, Roshida filed a motion to dismiss her action regarding paternity due to Delvyn's death, and the motion was granted without objection from Perkins. The Alabama court dismissed the action without an admission or adjudication of paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. In December 2013, Roshida, individually and on behalf of Delvyn's wrongful death beneficiaries, filed a medical malpractice suit against UMMC. The record reflects that Roshida did not name Perkins as a plaintiff and she did not notify him of the commencement of the action. The malpractice suit was settled, and the settlement proceeds were deposited in the registry of the circuit court pending the determination of Delvyn's wrong death beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. On February 26, 2014, Roshida filed a petition to adjudicate Delvyn's heirs at law and wrongful death beneficiaries in the Hinds County Chancery Court, and she published notice of the petition in\n   <em>\n    The Clarion Ledger\n   </em>\n   on April 14, 21, and 28, 2014. Perkins acknowledged notice of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. On February 10, 2015, nearly a year after Roshida filed her petition to adjudicate Delvyn's heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries, Perkins filed a motion asking the Alabama district court to amend its order dismissing the action regarding paternity and declare him Delvyn's father. The Alabama court granted Perkins's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9. Roshida subsequently filed a motion to set aside the adjudication of paternity, which the Alabama court granted on August 12, 2015. In setting aside the adjudication of paternity, the Alabama court ultimately held that Perkins was not the legal father of Delvyn. The Alabama court explained that after the original action regarding paternity was dismissed in 2012, no subsequent hearing appeared on the docket, \"nor was evidence of [Perkins's] admission of paternity presented to the [c]ourt, and [Perkins] did not admit paternity of [Delvyn] by statement in open [c]ourt nor by filing any document acknowledging paternity of [Delvyn].\" Perkins appealed to the Alabama Court of Appeals, which affirmed the district court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10. Perkins then filed an answer to Roshida's February 26, 2014 petition to adjudicate Delvyn's heirs and wrongful death beneficiaries. In his answer, Perkins alleged that as Delvyn's natural father, he and his other minor children, Lisa, Kim, and Alan, qualified as wrongful death beneficiaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. The chancellor in the instant case entered an order on December 16, 2016, finding that Roshida and Tina were Delvyn's sole heirs at law and wrongful death\n   beneficiaries. The chancellor held that neither Perkins nor his other minor children met the statutory requirements to be determined Delvyn's wrongful death beneficiaries and therefore they could not recover wrongful death benefits. It is from this order that Perkins, Lisa, Kim, and Alan appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Determination of Wrongful Death Beneficiaries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12. In this appeal, Perkins, Lisa, Kim, and Alan argue that the chancellor's determination of wrongful death beneficiaries was clearly erroneous. \"We apply a limited standard of review to appeals from chancery court.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Ivy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6998132\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/121/226/#p232\">\n    121 So.3d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (\u00b6 29) (Miss.

Mississippi's wrongful death statute, Mississippi Code Annotated section 11-7-13 (Rev. 2004), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Whenever the death of any person ... shall be caused by any real, wrongful or negligent act or omission ... as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured or damaged thereby to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof ... and such deceased person shall have left a ... father or mother, or sister, or brother, the person or corporation, or both that would have been liable if death had not ensued ... shall be liable for damages, notwithstanding the death, and the fact that death was instantaneous shall in no case affect the right of recovery.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 11-1-69, in such action the party or parties suing shall recover such damages allowable by law as the jury may determine to be just, taking into consideration all the damages of every kind to the decedent and all damages of every kind to any and all parties interested in the suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In an action brought pursuant to the provisions of this section by the ... father, mother, sister or brother of the deceased ... such party or parties may recover as damages property damages and funeral, medical or other related expenses incurred by or for the deceased as a result of such wrongful or negligent act or omission ..., whether an estate has been opened or not.

We now turn to review each wrongful-death beneficiary's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    A. Roshida (Delvyn's Mother)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15. In her order determining Delvyn's heirs at law and wrongful death beneficiaries, the chancellor interpreted section 11-7-13 and ruled that Roshida and her daughter, Tina, were the sole wrongful death beneficiaries and heirs at law of Delvyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16. The record reflects that Roshida was not married to Delvyn's natural father at the time of his birth. Accordingly, Delvyn would be considered an illegitimate child. Section 11-7-13 provides that, as to the mother of an illegitimate child, \"[t]he provisions of this section shall apply ... to the mother on account of the death of an illegitimate child ... and they shall have all the benefits, rights and remedies conferred by this section on legitimates.\" We therefore find that the chancellor properly determined Roshida to be a wrongful-death beneficiary of Delvyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    B. Tina (Delvyn's Half Sister)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 17. The Appellants challenge the chancellor's finding that Tina was a wrongful death beneficiary of Delvyn. The record reflects that the Appellants never raised this argument before the chancellor, nor did they object to Tina's status as a beneficiary. However, the record further reflects that Roshida did not raise the issue of waiver on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18. Section 11-7-13 provides that the wrongful death beneficiaries are the brothers and sisters \"as the deceased may have living at his or her death.\" Section 11-7-13 specifically provides that \"[t]here shall not be, in any case, a distinction between the kindred of the whole and half blood of equal degree.\" Delvyn was born on January 26, 2012, and he died on June 2, 2012. At trial, Roshida testified that at the time of Delvyn's death, she did not have any other living children, nor was she pregnant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19. On appeal, Roshida refutes the Appellants' argument that her daughter Tina is not entitled to wrongful death benefits. Roshida acknowledges that the record does not reflect when Tina was conceived, but she maintains that \"on about June 19, 2014, [Tina] was approximately one year old.\" The record shows that Delvyn died two years prior on June 2, 2012. At trial, Roshida did not claim that she was pregnant at the time of Delvyn's death. On appeal, Roshida's counsel argues that \"[t]he possibility still exists that [Tina] was conceived before [Delvyn's] death and [Roshida] was ignorant of such fact due to the tumultuous circumstances surrounding the death of her infant child, Delvyn[.]\" Roshida cites to\n   <em>\n    Fizer v. Davis (Estate of Davis)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862218\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/244/#p247\">\n    706 So.2d 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247 (\u00b6 13) (Miss. 1998), where the supreme court held that \"a preborn child who is viable at the time of a relative's death and is ultimately born alive, is 'living' such that he or she can be a wrongful death beneficiary under the law.\" Roshida argues that Tina \"was possibly in existence\" at the time of Delvyn's death, and, since Tina is living, she is entitled to wrongful death benefits. Contrary to Roshida's counsel's claims now on appeal, Roshida did not testify at trial that she was confused or ignorant regarding Tina's conception. Roshida testified that she was not pregnant at the time of Delvyn's death. The record also shows that on June 19, 2014, more than two years after Delvyn's death, Tina was approximately one year old. Accordingly, calculations show that Tina was not conceived or possibly in existence at the time of Delvyn's death on June 2, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20. In\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862218\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/244/#p247\">\n    706 So.2d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 13), the supreme court reviewed a chancery court's determination of whether an unborn fetus who was at six and one-half months gestation at the time of his brother's death could recover as a wrongful death beneficiary within the meaning of section 11-7-13. The supreme court reversed the chancellor's determination and held that the facts of that case \"clearly present a situation in which the preborn child ... was viable at the time of his brother's death\" and therefore it \"is among that class of persons defined as 'living' for purposes of the wrongful death statute such that he is a beneficiary under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862218\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/244/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862218\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/244/#p247\">\n    at 245, 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 17). The appellants submitted an affidavit from a doctor certified in the field of obstetrics and gynecology wherein the doctor stated that Rico Davis, the preborn child at issue, \"was approximately six and one-half months gestation\" on the day his brother died and estimated \"that the probabilities of Rico's survival at that point would have been better than ninety-five percent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11862218\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/706/244/#p247\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 15) (internal quotation mark omitted).

We find that the record before us contains no evidence to show that Tina was conceived and viable, and therefore \"living,\" at the time of Delvyn's death. Thus, under the statute, Tina is not a wrongful death beneficiary. Accordingly, we reverse and render regarding the chancellor's finding that Tina was a wrongful death beneficiary and heir-at-law of Delvyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    C. Perkins (Delvyn's Natural Father)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22. The chancellor ruled that Perkins failed to meet the statutory requirements to be determined a wrongful death beneficiary or an heir-at-law under section 11-7-13 and Mississippi Code Annotated section 91-1-15(3)(a)-(c) (Rev. 2013). As a result, Perkins was not entitled to share in the proceeds from the wrongful death action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23. The record indicates that genetic testing confirmed that Perkins was Delvyn's natural father. In order to recover wrongful death benefits, section 11-7-13 requires the father of an illegitimate child to establish his right to inherit from the deceased pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated section 91-1-15, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   An illegitimate shall inherit from and through the illegitimate's natural father and his kindred, and the natural father of an illegitimate and his kindred shall inherit from and through the illegitimate according to the statutes of descent and distribution if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) The natural parents participated in a marriage ceremony before the birth of the child ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) There has been an adjudication of paternity or legitimacy before the death of the intestate; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (c) There has been an adjudication of paternity after the death of the intestate, based upon clear and convincing evidence, in an heirship proceeding under Sections 91-1-27 and 91-1-29. However, no such claim of inheritance shall be recognized unless the action seeking an adjudication of paternity is filed within one (1) year after the death of the intestate or within ninety (90) days after the first publication of notice to creditors to present their claims, whichever is less; and such time period shall run notwithstanding the minority of a child. This one year limitation shall be self-executing and may not be tolled for any reason, including lack of notice ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (d) The natural father of an illegitimate and his kindred shall not inherit:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (i) From or through the child unless the father has openly treated the child as his, and has not refused or neglected to support the child ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 24. It was undisputed that Perkins and Roshida were never married.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record contains no adjudication of paternity or legitimacy before Delvyn's death\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or after his death,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the Alabama court set aside its prior adjudication of paternity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 25. In reviewing the requirements set forth in section 91-1-15(3)(d)(i), the record contains no evidence to show that Perkins \"openly treated the child as his, and has not refused or neglected to support the child.\" Rather, the evidence shows that Perkins never actually met Delvyn or introduced Delvyn to his family. Perkins was not listed on Delvyn's birth certificate. Moreover, Perkins neglected to support Delvyn. He failed to provide food or clothing for Delvyn and did not help with the birth expenses. When Roshida attempted to obtain child support and social security benefits from Perkins, Perkins denied paternity and challenged her efforts. Perkins did not inquire about Delvyn's condition or offer to help with Delvyn's medical or funeral expenses. Instead, he allowed the paternity action against him to be dismissed. We agree with the chancellor's determination that Perkins failed to establish\n   the requirements of section 91-1-15. We therefore find no error in the chancellor's determination Perkins could not recover wrongful death benefits from Delvyn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    D. Lisa, Kim, and Alan (Delvyn's Half Siblings)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 26. Regarding the status of Lisa, Kim, and Alan as wrongful death beneficiaries, the chancellor held that \"Perkins's other children cannot recover wrongful death benefits through the deceased child, Delvyn, because [Perkins] does not meet the requirements of section 91-1-15 (3)(a)-(c).\" In her order, the chancellor explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The Mississippi Supreme Court has recognized the absolute necessity of meeting requirements of section 91-1-15 in order for a father and his kindred to claim wrongful death benefits through a deceased illegitimate child.

This lack of evidence would require us to reverse and remand for further proceedings if the factual issue remained material to the outcome of the case. However, the issue is moot in light of our conclusion that Lisa, Kim, and Alan are not Delvyn's wrongful death beneficiaries even assuming that they are his half-siblings.

Evidence Regarding Lisa, Kim, and Alan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 62. I cannot ignore one final problem with the appellants' case. The appellant's brief on appeal asserts that \"there is no dispute that [Lisa, Kim, and Alan] are Robert's natural children, and thus, half-siblings to Baby Delvyn, who were living at the time of Baby Delvyn's death.\" In support of this claim, the appellants cite to a passage in Nelson's testimony on cross-examination. In the cited testimony, the appellants' attorney questioned Nelson about only two of the three children:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Q Do you dispute that [Kim and Lisa] are Robert Perkins' natural children?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   A I mean, I don't really know them. I know them through Keyona. You know, she have brought them around me maybe once or twice, but I don't know them. Atlay Phillips is the neighbor of my sister; Sheretta Nelson, who lives with Michael Cosby. So, I mean, if they're his kids, you know, I have no proof that they're his kids.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Q And you don't contest that they are, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   A Well, I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Q You don't contest that they're his children if it were established?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   A Well, from what I hear, yeah, they're his kids.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 63. The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   testimony about the third child (Alan) was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Q Okay. Isn't it true that you told Nykeshia Green that you didn't know who Delvyn's father was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   A I don't know a Nykeshia Green.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Q Do you know [Alan]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   A No, I don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Q Okay.

Thus, in context, Nelson merely testified that she had \"no proof\" that Kim and Lisa were Perkins's children, although she had \"hear[d]\" that they were. Nelson did not even know Alan. Nelson was the only witness who testified in the chancery court, and there is no other evidence in the record concerning these children. Neither Perkins, nor the children, nor the children's mothers testified. It does not appear that they even attended the hearing. Nor did they submit birth certificates, DNA tests, or any other proof of paternity. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that Alan exists, let alone that he is Delvyn's half-brother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 65.

On appeal, our Supreme Court emphasized that \"[i]n order to be declared heirs, the illegitimate children of ...

This case is different from\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   in that a formal hearing was held; however, it is similar to\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   in that there was no \"proof of paternity.\" There is literally no evidence pertaining to Alan, and there is only Nelson's testimony about what she had \"hear[d]\" about Lisa and Kim. If this factual issue was still material to the outcome of the case, I would reverse and remand for a hearing on the issue, as the Supreme Court did in\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   . However, I concur with the lead opinion that Lisa, Kim, and Alan do not qualify as wrongful death beneficiaries even assuming that they are Delvyn's half-siblings.

The lead opinion makes two conclusions that I find are fundamentally flawed. First, the lead opinion agrees that \"Perkins's other children cannot recover wrongful death benefits through the deceased child, Delvyn, because Perkins does not meet the requirements of section 91-1-15 (3)(a)-(c).\"\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26. Second, the lead opinion concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   As acknowledged by the chancellor, the Mississippi Supreme Court has established that the natural father of an illegitimate child, as well as the father's \"kindred,\" can inherit under the wrongful death statute only if the father meets the requirements of section 91-1-15.\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , 798 So.2d at 350 (\u00b6 17) (\"The wrongful death statute provides for illegitimates to inherit, but that right is tied to [ section] 91-1-15.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 74. Neither of these conclusions are supported by section 11-7-13. Instead, the chancellor and the lead opinion rely on\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   . The question is whether the decision in\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   should govern this case, when it is contrary to the clear and unambiguous language of section 11-7-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 75. Every wrongful death case, and the consideration of section 11-7-13, must start with\n   <em>\n    Long v.

There, the supreme court criticized its earlier decisions in wrongful death cases, which included\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , and ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No area of the law has historically provided more muddled, misquoted and misunderstood procedural rules, than civil claims for wrongful death.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The blame for the perennial scrap over the rules can be traced to at least two sources.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   First, although the issue has been debated, the American judiciary - federal and state - has failed to squarely address the question of whether substantive claims for wrongful death originated in the common law, rendering them subject to substantial judicial discretion; or are creatures of statute, requiring strict, statutory construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Secondly, it appears that in the waning years of the Nineteenth Century, our own wrongful death statute (the \"Statute\") took a wrong turn into procedural territory where it had no license to travel. When one branch of government (well-intentioned though it may be) crosses the line into the purview of another, the balance of powers necessary for efficient and effective government is upset. So it was with the Statute. As a result,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     this Court has, for over a century, attempted to provide procedural guidance mislabeled as statutory interpretation; much like attempting to place a square peg into a round hole. Consequently, little progress has been made in settling many troubling issues related to wrongful death litigation.

Any review of section 11-7-13 begins with the supreme court's long held admonition that, \"[o]n appellate review, we\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     strictly construe\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Mississippi's wrongful death statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Pannell v.

Because Delvyn had \"no husband, nor wife, nor children,\" section 11-7-13 provides that \"the damages shall be distributed equally to [Delvyn's] father, mother, brothers and sisters, or such of them as the deceased may have living at his or her death.\" This sentence gives Delvyn's \"brothers and sisters\" - Lisa, Kim and Alan - equal right to the wrongful death damages as Delvyn's mother and father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    I. Mother\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   \u00b6 80. Roshida Nelson, as Delvyn's mother, is certainly a wrongful death beneficiary under section 11-7-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <em>\n    II. Father\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   \u00b6 81. Robert Perkins, as Delvyn's father, may be a wrongful death beneficiary. For Robert Perkins to take as a wrongful death beneficiary, section 11-7-13 says that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   The provisions of this section shall apply ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to the natural father\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   on account of the death of the illegitimate child ..., and they shall have all the benefits, rights and remedies conferred by this section on legitimates,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     if the survivor has or establishes the right to inherit from the deceased under Section 91-1-15.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6 82. Section 11-7-13 specifically incorporates section 91-1-15, but only in the analysis of the \"natural father.\" It clearly says that \"the provisions of this section shall apply ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     to the natural father on account of the death of the illegitimate child\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ... if the survivor has or establishes the right to inherit from the deceased under Section 91-1-15.\" (Emphasis added). This sentence only applies to Perkins, as\n   Delvyn's natural father. This sentence in section 11-7-13 cannot be read to require section 91-1-15 be applied to anyone but Delvyn's natural father.\n   <em>\n    This sentence simply does not apply\n   </em>\n   to Delvyn's mother or his brothers and sisters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6 83. Section 11-7-13 says that, for Perkins to be a wrongful death beneficiary as Delvyn's father, Perkins must also show that he has acted in a socially responsible manner. Thus, as the natural father of an illegitimate child, Perkins must establish that he can \"establish[ ] the right to inherit from the deceased under Section 91-1-15.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   \u00b6 84. Section 91-1-15 deals with the right to inherit from illegitimate children. It is in the title on \"Trusts and Estates,\" the chapter on \"Descent and Distribution,\" and is titled \"Descent among illegitimates; definitions.\" If section 11-7-13 was intended to be interpreted as the lead opinion has, the legislature could have simply incorporated the laws of descent and distribution to establish the wrongful death beneficiaries in a wrongful death action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is not what the legislature did. It is important that the Legislature, in section 11-7-13, chose not to treat the \"kindred\" of the natural father the same as it did in 91-1-15(3)(d)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6 85. Section 11-7-13 requires that the decedent's \"natural father\" be subject to an analysis of the right of inheritance under section 91-1-15. As a result, section 11-7-13\"addresses the inequity of a natural father of an illegitimate child benefitting from a wrongful-death action when he has failed to acknowledge and support his child.\"\n   <em>\n    LePori v. Welch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7004908\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/93/66/#p69\">\n    93 So.3d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 69 (\u00b6 9) (Miss. Ct. App. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6 86. I concur with the determination that, under section 11-7-13, the chancellor correctly considered Perkins's right to inherit from Delvyn under section 91-1-15. I agree that Perkins is not a proper wrongful death beneficiary of Delvyn under section 11-7-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <em>\n    III. Siblings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6 87. Section 11-7-13 requires that Delvyn's half siblings are his wrongful death beneficiaries. Because Lisa, Kim, and Alan share a biological father, they are Delvyn's half siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6 88. Section 11-7-13 requires that Delvyn's wrongful death damages \"shall be distributed\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     equally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to the father, mother,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     brothers and sisters\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , or such of them as the deceased may have living at his or her death.\" (Emphasis added). The next sentence provides that \"[t]here shall not be, in any case, a distinction between the kindred of the whole and half blood of equal degree.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2011-7-13\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 11-7-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Lisa, Kim, and Alan are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     required by the wrongful death statute\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to be treated no differently than Delvyn's mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   \u00b6 89. The lead opinion affirms the chancellor's ruling that \"Perkins's other children cannot recover wrongful death benefits through the deceased child, Delvyn, because [Perkins] does not meet the requirements of section 91-1-15 (3)(a)-(c).\" There is simply no authority in section 11-7-13 to support this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6 90. Here, Lisa, Kim, and Alan have been excluded as Delvyn's wrongful death beneficiaries simply because Perkins was excluded under section 91-1-15. Although there is specific statutory language that says Delvyn's natural father may be excluded pursuant to section 91-1-15, there is no language that would exclude Delvyn's siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   \u00b6 91. Lisa, Kim, and Alan are \"half blood\" siblings of Delvyn. Thus, they are Delvyn's\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     statutory\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   wrongful death beneficiaries as Delvyn's \"brothers and sisters.\" They obtained the status as his wrongful death beneficiaries due to their blood relationship with Delvyn. Section 11-7-13 clearly and specifically provides that \"[t]here shall not be, in any case, a distinction between the kindred of the whole and half blood of equal degree.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \u00b6 92. Section 11-7-13 provides that Delvyn's father may be excluded under section 91-1-15, but section 11-7-13 may not be read to exclude or condition Delvyn's half siblings' rights to their common parent's (the natural father's) status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   \u00b6 93. I am of the opinion that chancellor's exclusion of Lisa, Kim, and Alan was manifestly wrong and clearly erroneous. I would reverse the judgment that concludes Lisa, Kim, and Alan are not proper wrongful-death beneficiaries under section 11-7-13 and remand for a hearing on the issue of whether Lisa, Kim, and Alan were Delvyn's half siblings and are therefore entitled to a portion of the settlement proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   WESTBROOKS AND TINDELL, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION IN PART.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    For example, section 91-1-15(3)(d)(i) provides that \"\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      The natural father of an illegitimate and his kindred\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    shall not inherit: From or through the child unless the father has openly treated the child as his, and has not refused or neglected to support the child ....\" (Emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
