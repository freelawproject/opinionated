On May 5, 2012, Taylor was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-6-66, Ala. Code 1975, and was sentenced to serve 10 years' imprisonment; that sentence was split and Taylor was ordered to serve 1 year and 1 day followed by 3 years' supervised probation. Taylor was alleged to be delinquent in his probation for violating the residency requirements of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, \u00a7 15-20A-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975 (\"SORNA\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15-20A-11, Ala.

The delinquency report alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   \"On April 19, 2015, Mobile County Sheriff's Office, Sgt.

The informant was making a phone call to Sgt. Webster on behalf of the victim's mother, who resided next door. Sgt. Webster responded to the resident [sic] and placed Taylor under arrest for violation of the Alabama Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, Alabama Code 15-20A-11, Residency Restrictions.

At that hearing, Taylor's counsel admitted that Taylor had violated his probation and that Taylor had pleaded guilty to the SORNA violation. Taylor's counsel noted that Taylor was arrested in April 2015 and stated: \"[W]e're just asking for mercy on that being it's two years old and he has [already completed] the full sentence ... on the new charge that's the basis of the revocation.\" (Record on Return to Remand, R. 4.) The State requested that Taylor's probation be revoked because Taylor had pleaded guilty to the SORNA charge. The circuit court sua sponte continued Taylor's hearing because Taylor's defense counsel had been appointed on the day of the hearing, because the State could not explain why the revocation hearing had not been scheduled until more than two years after the violation had occurred, and because the amount of time remaining on Taylor's term of probation was unknown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 11, 2017, Taylor appeared with counsel for the continued probation-revocation hearing. The State and Taylor stipulated to continuing Taylor's probation for an additional year. The following discussion occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"THE COURT: I'm going to-here's-I'm going to explain why because it needs to be said.

During that week, he came and arrested me for being there because there was allegedly an 11-year-old child staying there. Now, I had made prearrangement for the child to stay with her-and her grandfather to stay at another\n   residence during that week. And that was the situation, Your Honor.

Thus,\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Rule 27.6(c) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \"(c) ADMISSIONS BY THE PROBATIONER. Before accepting an admission by a probationer that the probationer has violated a condition or regulation of probation or an instruction issued by the probation officer, the court shall address the probationer personally and shall determine that the probationer understands the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"(1) The nature of the violation to which an admission is offered;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"(2) The right under section (b) to be represented by counsel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"(3) The right to testify and present witnesses and other evidence on probationer's own behalf and to cross-examine adverse witnesses under subsection (d)(1) ....,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The court shall also determine that the probationer waives these rights, that the admission is voluntary and not the result of force, threats, coercion, or promises, and that there is a factual basis for the admission.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The transcripts of both hearings show that Taylor's defense counsel-not Taylor himself-admitted that Taylor had pleaded guilty to the SORNA charge. The transcripts do not show that the circuit court ever addressed Taylor personally during either hearing with respect to the provisions of Rule 27.6(c), Ala. R. Crim. P. The only time Taylor ever spoke directly to the court in his behalf was when he interrupted the court to argue that the charge to which he supposedly pleaded guilty and was the basis of his revocation was not the same charge to which he had pleaded guilty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (R. 7) (\"Your Honor, if I may ask, the report that's being read here was something I pled not guilty to. That would be another charge, Your Honor.\"). Therefore, it does not appear that Taylor was sufficiently apprised of the nature of the violation for which his admission was offered. In addition, the record does not show that the circuit court informed Taylor of his right to testify, to present witnesses on his behalf, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The record also fails to show that the court determined that Taylor waived those rights or that his admission-which, we stress again, came only from Taylor's counsel and not Taylor-was voluntary and not the result of force, threats, coercion, or promises. We also note that the circuit court's written order of revocation states that Taylor denied the allegations against him, therefore supporting the conclusion that Taylor did not admit to violating his probation in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, we cannot say that the circuit court complied with the requirements of Rule 27.6(c), Ala. R. Crim. P., or, therefore, that any admissions made by Taylor were properly accepted by the circuit court as a basis for the revocation of Taylor's probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The record supports Taylor's contention that the circuit court failed to conduct an adequate probation-revocation hearing. Accordingly, we reverse the order revoking Taylor's probation and remand this matter for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Burke, J., concurs. Welch and Kellum, JJ., concur in the result. Windom, P.J., dissents, with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    On March 5, 2018, we remanded this matter for the circuit court to supplement the record with any documents that affirmatively show the offense with which Taylor was charged, as well as the transcript of the hearing at which Taylor allegedly admitted to the new charge against him. In response, the circuit court complied with our instructions and submitted the delinquency report filed against Taylor and a transcript of the September 27, 2017, hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-58\">\n   WINDOM, Presiding Judge, dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   I believe that the majority's decision conflicts with the Supreme Court of Alabama's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.
