Dalton Trigg and his father, Dr. Stephen Trigg, sued Dalton's former criminal-defense attorney, Steven Farese Sr., alleging professional malpractice. The Lafayette County Circuit Court held that the claims were premature because Dalton had not yet secured postconviction relief from the underlying conviction, and it dismissed the complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. This case presents the question of whether a convicted criminal may sue his former defense attorney for negligently causing him to be convicted while that conviction still stands. We join the substantial majority of courts in holding that, because these allegations would entitle the plaintiff to relief from his underlying conviction, he must first pursue them through the criminal-justice process. In other words, a convict must \"exonerate\" himself by obtaining relief from his conviction or sentence before he may pursue a claim against his defense attorney for causing him to be convicted or sentenced more harshly than he should have been. To the extent prior decisions of this Court or the Court of Appeals suggest otherwise, they are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. But this holding extends only to claims that stem from allegations of professional malpractice. The Triggs' claim for an accounting of the substantial retainer paid to Dalton's attorney, to the extent it is just a fee dispute and does not depend on the quality of legal services rendered, should not have been dismissed. Finally, Dr. Trigg had standing to pursue the accounting claim because he claims he paid the retainer and is entitled to a refund of the unearned portion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. The following facts are drawn from the allegations in the Triggs' complaint, which, because of the procedural posture of this case, are taken as true. On September 10, 2011, Dalton drove his vehicle after drinking alcohol and collided with another vehicle. A fourteen-year-old passenger in the other vehicle suffered injuries to her lower extremities and a laceration to her eyebrow. She fully recovered, allegedly free of any permanent injuries or restrictions. Dalton, however, received life-threatening injuries. He suffered brain damage and was incapacitated for some period of time after the accident. When Dr. Trigg learned Dalton had been drinking before the accident, he approached Farese to discuss legal representation for his son. Farese demanded an up-front retainer of $50,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The Triggs further allege Farese warranted that Dalton would incur only a misdemeanor charge and would not be sentenced to any jail time. Dr. Trigg paid the retainer in reliance on this guarantee, and he believed the payment created an attorney-client relationship between him and Farese. But Dalton was eventually\n   indicted for aggravated DUI, a felony punishable by up to twenty-five years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Farese then allegedly advised that if Dalton pled guilty to the felony charge, it would somehow be reduced to a misdemeanor and he would receive no jail time. Following this advice, Dalton pled guilty to the felony-but he ultimately received a ten-year sentence, with six years suspended and four years to serve. The four years to serve would be reduced to five years' probation after Dalton completed a long-term drug and alcohol treatment program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. Dalton finished the treatment program and was released from prison in February 2014-he spent roughly nine months incarcerated. He claims that during his time in prison, he was beaten by other inmates and suffered serious injuries. Unsatisfied with Farese's representation, Dalton and Dr. Trigg filed suit against Farese and his firm on April 1, 2014. The Triggs alleged a variety of claims, all of which stemmed from Farese's representation of Dalton. Specifically, the Triggs styled their causes of action fraud, breach of contract, legal malpractice (negligence), accounting for money paid, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Because of certain allegations in the complaint, Farese successfully moved to have the file temporarily sealed. That seal remains intact to the present day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7. On April 14, 2014, the circuit-court judges for the Third Judicial District entered a sua sponte order of recusal. This Court then appointed Judge L. Breland Hilburn to preside as a special judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8. Farese then filed his answer, which also contained a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Farese argued the complaint should be dismissed because Dr. Trigg lacked standing and Dalton had failed to first seek postconviction relief. On August 25, 2014, the circuit court dismissed the Triggs' complaint pursuant to \"Rule 12 and/or Rule 56 of [the] Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure\" after reviewing \"all of the pleadings, responses, affidavits[,] and authorities of law filed by the parties.\" In response, the Triggs filed a posttrial motion seeking to vacate the order of dismissal and to reinstate their claims. At the hearing on the motion to vacate, the circuit judge explained that his intent was to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b). And on December 11, 2014, the circuit court entered an order denying the Triggs' motion to vacate, reaffirming its dismissal of their complaint without prejudice and denying all other pending motions. The Triggs timely perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9. \"The standard of review for a trial court's grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Long v.

Affidavits on Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10. As a threshold issue, the Triggs complain the circuit court erroneously dismissed their complaint because it failed to explicitly exclude two affidavits which the Triggs themselves attached to their responses to the motion to dismiss. The Triggs also rely on the circuit court's original order of dismissal, which was somewhat\n   unclear as to whether the complaint was dismissed under Rule 12 of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure or whether summary judgment was granted under Rule 56. The order states that dismissal was under \" Rule 12 and/or Rule 56 of [the] Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure\" and that the circuit court \"considered all of the pleadings, responses, affidavits[,] and authorities of law filed by the parties.\" At the hearing on the \"motion to vacate,\" the circuit judge clarified his ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [I]t's obvious that I may have generated some misconception about the order [of dismissal] .... It was the intent of the [c]ourt to enter an order of dismissal under Rule 12. That order obviously sits. There [were] undisputed facts set out in the pleadings as to whether or not a post-conviction relief had been sought by [Dalton]. It was also mentioned as being a Rule 56 summary judgment ruling by the [c]ourt. The [c]ourt will amend the order to reflect at this point in time it is a Rule 12 dismissal, and that there's really not a need for the [c]ourt to reach summary judgment at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The circuit court then entered an order denying the motion to vacate which returned to the merits of the motion to dismiss and omitted any mention of the affidavits or summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 11. The Triggs argue that since the first order recites that the circuit court reviewed affidavits, the court was required to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Farese responds by pointing out that the circuit court had to review affidavits in order to determine one of the asserted bases for dismissal, whether Dr. Trigg had standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 12. We agree that the circuit court was entitled to review Dr. Trigg's affidavit as it pertained to standing. The challenge was based on Rule 12(b)(1) of the Mississippi Rules of Civil Procedure. In\n   <em>\n    Schmidt v. Catholic Diocese of Biloxi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063934\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/18/814/#p822\">\n    18 So.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822 (Miss. 2009), this Court explained the difference between facial attacks on subject-matter jurisdiction versus factual attacks. Facial attacks allege the court lacks jurisdiction as a matter of law, while a factual attack \"requires resolution by the trial court of one or more factual disputes in order to determine subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063934\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/18/814/#p822\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Diocese v. Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050907\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/905/1213/#p1220\">\n    905 So.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1220 (Miss. 2005) ). \"In a factual attack, matters outside the pleadings, such as testimony and affidavits, are considered.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050907\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/905/1213/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the circuit court was faced with a factual attack as to Dr. Trigg's standing, it properly considered the affidavit submitted by Dr. Trigg on that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 13. There is a second affidavit, however, which was also filed by the Triggs. It was addressed to the underlying merits of the malpractice claim and clearly should have been excluded from consideration under Rule 12(b)(6). The Triggs contend that it was not excluded and that the circuit court was therefore required to convert the motion to one for summary judgment. They cite Rule 12(b), which provides that \"[i]f ... matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56.\" M.R.C.P. 12(b). Since the circuit court here was presented with an affidavit, which it did not expressly exclude, the Triggs argue it was error not to convert the motion to one for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 14. The Triggs misunderstand what it means for the circuit court to exclude the affidavit-the circuit court is required only to exclude the affidavit from controlling its resolution of the 12(b)(6) motion. As this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Delta MK, LLC v. Mississippi Transportation Commission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046229\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/57/1284/#p1290\">\n    57 So.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290 (Miss. 2011), conversion of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment is required when the circuit court\n   <em>\n    considers\n   </em>\n   matters outside the pleadings. And considered, as it used here, must mean more than simply reviewed or contemplated-for there to be any error in considering affidavits, the circuit court's judgment must depend on those affidavits. Or, as the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, construing the parallel federal rules, put it: any error in failing to convert the motion \"is harmless if the dismissal can be justified under [ Rule] 12(b)(6) standards without consideration of the matters outside the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Lowe v. Town of Fairland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"268540\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/143/1378/#p1381\">\n    143 F.3d 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1381 (10th Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 15. Here, the circuit court's reason for dismissing the complaint was Dalton Trigg's failure to allege he had secured postconviction relief-the circuit court accepted the allegations in the complaint as true. And the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, as it should have under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim; if the court had taken the motion as one for summary judgment, the decision would have been on the merits and the \"dismissal\" would have been a final judgment with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 56(c). Despite the rote recitations in the circuit court's first order, it is apparent to us that the affidavit had nothing to do with the court's decision. Thus, it was not really considered, and the circuit court was under no obligation to convert the 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delta MK\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7046229\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/57/1284/#p1290\">\n    57 So.3d at 1290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 16. Even if the circuit court had been required to convert the motion to one for summary judgment, it still could have dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. Under Rule 12(h)(2), the defendants were entitled to raise the defense of failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, not only in their responsive pleading, but also \"by motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.\" And under Rule 12(b)(6) itself, trial courts possess the authority to dismiss complaints which fail to state a claim-on the court's own motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sparling v. Hoffman Const. Co\n    <strong>\n     .\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530860\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/864/635/#p638\">\n    864 F.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 638 (9th Cir. 1988) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1357 (3d ed.), Westlaw (database updated Sept. 2018). The only limitation is that the court must proceed in a way that is fair to the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5B Wright &amp; Miller \u00a7 1357. Since the Triggs were on notice that the legal sufficiency of their complaint had been challenged and were given numerous opportunities to respond, we can find no unfairness in the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17. Finally, we reiterate that our standard of review is de novo. The record gives no reason to suspect the circuit court based its decision on anything other than a careful study of the pleadings and the law. But under our standard of review it does not matter why the circuit court reached the result it did; we consider the legal sufficiency of the complaint anew.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triplett v. S. Hens, Inc\n    <strong>\n     .\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663107\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/238/1128/#p1130\">\n    238 So.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1130 (Miss. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   M.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). If the circuit court reached the right result for the wrong reason, its judgment would be affirmed; if it reached the wrong result, the judgment would be reversed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Triplett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663107\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/238/1128/#p1130\">\n    238 So.3d at 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A circuit court is not even required to explain why it granted or denied a motion to dismiss. As the Court of Appeals has observed, the circuit court's explanation \"may be helpful ... to the parties and [the reviewing court],\" but its \"rationale is not controlling.\"\n   <em>\n    Satterfield v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6882874\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/158/380/#p382\">\n    158 So.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382 (Miss. Ct. App. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18. In summary, the issue of the legal sufficiency of the complaint is squarely before us on appeal. As we shall explain in due course, the trial court erred in dismissing one of the counts asserted in the complaint. But so far as the record reveals, any error in the circuit court's consideration of the affidavits was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Dr. Trigg's Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 19. As to Dr. Trigg, the circuit court held that \"[Dr.] Trigg's dissatisfaction in the performance of Farese [did] not create an attorney/client relationship.\" The circuit court further held that \"[Dr. Trigg] occupies no better position than his son, Dalton; a successful result of a [p]ost [c]onviction [r]elief petition must be obtained before [Dr. Trigg's] claim for legal malpractice against Farese will be actionable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 20. \"Standing is a jurisdictional issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Hotboxxx, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892261\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/21/#p27\">\n    154 So.3d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Standing depends on \"whether the plaintiff asserts a 'colorable interest in the subject-matter of the litigation or experience[s] an adverse effect from the conduct of the defendant, or as otherwise provided by law.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892261\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   So, \"while standing in federal court requires an 'injury in fact,' standing in Mississippi courts is more liberal and requires a 'colorable interest in the subject matter.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892261\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court has defined a colorable interest as \"whether the particular plaintiff had a right to judicial enforcement of a legal duty of the defendant or whether a party plaintiff can show in himself a present, existent actionable title or interest, and demonstrate that this right was complete at the time of the institution of the action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892261\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21. The complaint alleged five causes of action-fraud, breach of contract, legal malpractice (negligence), accounting for money paid, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As further explained below, four of these causes are essentially legal-malpractice allegations and were properly dismissed because Dalton failed to first secure postconviction relief. These counts were properly dismissed regardless of whether Dalton's father also had standing to pursue them, and thus the issue of his standing is moot. Any further discussion would be purely academic. But the request for an accounting-which is essentially a fee dispute-survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22. Dr. Trigg alleges he paid Farese's retainer and Farese failed to provide an accounting or refund the unearned portion of the fees. As explained below, a claim based on the quality of the representation is barred, but the accounting claim survives to the extent it alleges the Triggs paid for work that was just not done. No contract appears in the record, but Dr. Trigg alleges he paid the retainer and is entitled to a refund of the unearned portion. He has a colorable interest in the subject matter of the accounting claim, and he therefore has standing to pursue it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hotboxxx, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892261\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/154/21/#p27\">\n    154 So.3d at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Malpractice Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23. The Triggs asserted various causes of action in the complaint, but the circuit\n   court focused on the legal malpractice allegation, which it saw as the fountainhead from which all the other counts derived. The circuit court dismissed the complaint by holding that a criminal defendant must secure postconviction relief before pursuing a criminal-defense malpractice claim. For authority, the circuit court relied on a case from another jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    Gibson v. Trant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9459796\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/58/103/\">\n    58 S.W.3d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. 2001). We are not aware of any prior decisions of this Court or the Court of Appeals discussing whether a convicted criminal must first \"exonerate\" himself before pursuing a malpractice claim against his defense attorney. In fact, reported criminal-malpractice decisions appear to have been rare at common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiley v.

But malpractice suits against criminal-defense attorneys have exploded in recent years, and most states have responded by adopting some form of the exoneration rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20P.2d%20983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we take this as an issue of first impression in Mississippi, and after due consideration, we find the reasons for adopting an exoneration rule persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24. We begin our discussion with the traditional elements of a legal-malpractice claim: \"a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of a lawyer-client relationship, negligence on the part of the lawyer in handling his client's affairs entrusted to him, and some injury proximately caused by the lawyer's negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of St. Martin v.

Immediately resorting to the trial-within-a-trial test makes sense in an ordinary civil-malpractice allegation because there are generally no \"do overs\" for a client who has suffered a loss as a result of his own attorney's professional negligence.

The panoply of protections accorded to the criminally accused (including direct appeal and post-conviction relief) is so inclusive, and the significance of a conviction so important to vindication of the rule of law, that it would appear most unusual to permit a person to prosecute a legal malpractice action premised on some flaw in the process that led to that person's conviction at the same time that the person's conviction remained valid for all other purposes. In other words, while the conviction and sentence remain valid for all other purposes, it is inappropriate to treat a complaining convicted offender as having been \"harmed\" in a legally cognizable way by that conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Stevens v.

Another public-policy interest is in facilitating the practical and effective administration of the court system and the criminal justice process.

But if the prosecution is resumed after a malpractice suit has been filed, the trial court should stay the malpractice action until the underlying criminal proceedings are resolved.

These courts reason that the true proximate cause of a criminal-malpractice plaintiff's damages is his own guilt, that a guilty criminal has no legally protected interest in his liberty, and that any negligence by a defense attorney is legally superseded by the defendant's own criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823393\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/875/157/#p163\">\n    875 N.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   162-163 ;\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10353186\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/566/#p571\">\n    861 P.2d 566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 572.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 37. The procedural posture of today's case does not require this Court to decide whether or not to adopt a per se actual innocence rule. We leave that question for another day, but we observe, as the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   court did, that a malpractice plaintiff \"who was factually guilty of the crime for which he or she was convicted ... will likely confront significant causation issues\" even without a per se rule actual innocence rule.\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6823393\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/875/157/#p163\">\n    875 N.W.2d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 38. Next, we address the operation of the statute of limitations. In prior decisions, both this Court and the Court of Appeals have rejected the claims of successful postconviction relief claimants that the statute of limitations for a malpractice claim began to run upon their achieving postconviction relief. Instead, we adopted the Court of Appeals' prior holding that the statute begins to run when the plaintiff \"learns, or through reasonable diligence should have learned of his counsel's negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Bradley v. Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767480\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/439/#p441\">\n    182 So.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441 (Miss. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hymes v.

This statement was actually misleading, because our general statute of limitations is tolled only when the\n   <em>\n    injury\n   </em>\n   is latent, not its cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Angle v.

Thus it would have been more correct to have said in\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   that the statute begins to run at the time of conviction. But the distinction made no difference in\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Hymes\n   </em>\n   , as the real issue in those cases was whether the statute of limitations was tolled during appeals or postconviction proceedings; we held that it was not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6767480\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/182/439/#p441\">\n    182 So.3d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 39.\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hymes\n   </em>\n   are untenable after today's decision because they were premised on the assumption that exoneration was not an element of a criminal-defense malpractice claim. If\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   were paired with the exoneration rule, it would operate as de facto bar to many meritorious criminal-malpractice actions, as successful postconviction proceedings often take more than three years to work their way to a final disposition even if immediately pursued after conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 40. Most other courts with an exoneration rule have found that exoneration essentially becomes an element of the criminal-malpractice cause of action and that the cause of action accrues only after the malpractice plaintiff is exonerated of the underlying criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noske v.

The Kansas Supreme Court, in reaching this result, relied on its prior holdings that \"[a] cause of action accrues when the right to institute and maintain a suit arises, or when there is a demand capable of present enforcement\" and the \"true test of accrual determines point at which plaintiff could first have filed, prosecuted action to successful conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417991\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/302/625/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

Still, we acknowledge that a substantial minority of courts have taken a different tack, which is often called the \"two-track\" approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noske\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n    656 N.W.2d at 414-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (surveying cases). Under the two-track approach, the statute of limitations on the malpractice claim generally begins to run upon the underlying conviction. Since exoneration often cannot be obtained within the statute of limitations for the malpractice claim, the would-be malpractice plaintiff is allowed to file his malpractice suit averring that he is in the process of obtaining postconviction relief. The trial court then stays the malpractice case until the postconviction relief claim is disposed of.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 44. The two-track approach has the advantage of putting the defense attorney on notice of the claims against him, but it comes with substantial administrative and practical costs. It would \" require every convicted defendant who seeks relief from a conviction ... to also file a legal-malpractice action or risk later having the action be time-barred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <strong>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n      .\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </strong>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Considering the volume of criminal appeals and postconviction petitions, the burden on trial courts to administer these innumerable, speculative malpractice claims would obviously be substantial. And the two-track approach further creates this \"invitation to bring litigation, including the attendant burden and expense placed on finite judicial resources as well as on the parties, for cases in which no justiciable controversy currently exists or may ever exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328151\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/656/409/#p413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 45. We agree with the\n   <em>\n    Noske\n   </em>\n   court that the burdens of the two-track approach outweigh the benefits. We therefore overrule\n   <em>\n    Bradley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hymes\n   </em>\n   and adopt the majority rule that the criminal malpractice claim accrues and begins to run on the date of exoneration, as defined above. We recognize that this holding creates a somewhat unique situation in that the accrual of the cause of action-and the extent of the damages-depends on the plaintiff's diligence in pursuing his postconviction remedies. But we think these concerns can adequately be addressed by the application of two familiar principles of law. First, the plaintiff has a duty to mitigate his damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wall v. Swilley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7534334\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/562/1252/#p1258\">\n    562 So.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1258 (Miss. 1990). Any damages that can be shown by the defendant to result from the malpractice plaintiff's unreasonable delay in pursuing his exoneration from the underlying criminal charges cannot be said to have been caused by the defendant attorney. Second, the doctrine of laches bars suit when the plaintiff's unreasonable delay \"results in injustice or disadvantage to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Bolden v. Gatewood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831771\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/250/93/#p119\">\n    250 Miss. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 119,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831771\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/250/93/#p119\">\n    164 So.2d 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 732 (1964). While we have previously held that laches ordinarily has no application when the statute of limitations has not yet run,\n   <em>\n    Greenlee v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7475246\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/607/97/#p111\">\n    607 So.2d 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (Miss. 1992), that holding does not extend to the peculiar situation created today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 46. Finally, we turn to the specific causes of action asserted in the Triggs' complaint. Addressing these claims\n   under Rule 12(b)(6), the question is whether the complaint stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. To do so, the Triggs were required to provide (1) a short and plain statement of the claim for relief; and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which they claim entitlement. M.R.C.P. 8(a). In assessing the legal sufficiency of the complaint, all factual allegations must be taken as true, and dismissal is improper unless it \"appear[s] to a certainty that the plaintiff[s] [are] entitled to no relief under any set of facts that could be proved in support of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Crum v. City of Corinth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829203\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/847/#p850\">\n    183 So.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850-51 (Miss. 2016) (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 47. The complaint alleged five causes of action, which it labeled fraud, breach of contract, legal malpractice (negligence), accounting for money paid, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The malpractice and negligent-infliction-of-emotional-distress claims are clearly founded on allegations of professional malpractice. Despite the label, the breach-of-contract count also sounds in the tort of professional negligence: it alleges Farese breached the contract by negligently performing his duties as a defense attorney. Likewise, the claim of fraud is addressed to the correctness of Farese's legal judgment and is therefore just a malpractice claim couched as an intentional tort; this claim also requires exoneration before it may be pursued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greathouse v. McConnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11780215\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/982/165/#p172\">\n    982 S.W.2d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172 (Tex. App. 1998). All of these claims are barred by Dalton's failure to secure exoneration prior to filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 48. But the cause of action for an accounting is different. The Triggs allege Farese took a $50,000 retainer to defend Dalton, but that Farese never accounted for the money and did not actually earn it. To the extent this claim does not depend on the quality of the services rendered, it is a mere fee dispute and should not have been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labovitz v.Feinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480325\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/47/306/\">\n    47 Mass.App.Ct. 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=713%20N.E.2d%20379\">\n    713 N.E.2d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 49. In summary, we hold that a convicted criminal must first \"exonerate\" himself through the criminal-justice process before suing his defense attorney for professional negligence in causing his conviction. Here, Dalton Trigg admits he did not secure relief from his conviction, and thus the malpractice-based claims against his attorney were properly dismissed. But to the extent the Triggs allege they were charged for work not actually performed, the claim should not have been dismissed. Thus, we affirm the judgment in part, reverse it in part, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 50.\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   RANDOLPH AND KITCHENS, P.JJ., KING, COLEMAN, MAXWELL AND BEAM, JJ., CONCUR.
