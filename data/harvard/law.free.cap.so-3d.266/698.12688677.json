Beddingfield (\"Rebecca\"), and their adult son, James Cody Beddingfield (\"Cody\") (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"the Beddingfields\"), appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the defendants below, Mullins Insurance Company, Mullins &amp; Company Insurance, Rand Mullins, and David Mullins (hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Mullins\"), on the Beddingfields' claims stemming from Mullins's alleged failure to properly procure insurance coverage. We affirm the trial court's judgment in part, reverse it in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mullins Insurance Company and Mullins &amp; Company Insurance are \"licensed insurance brokerage[s] or agenc[ies]\" operating in Huntsville; Rand Mullins and David Mullins are licensed insurance or brokerage agents employed by those entities. In 1997, Larry and Rebecca purchased a $300,000 homeowners' liability-insurance\n   policy from Rand Mullins that protected Larry and Rebecca's primary residence. In 2001, Larry and Rebecca purchased a second liability-insurance policy in the amount of $100,000 that provided coverage for a rental house located in Florence; they later constructed another house in Guntersville and, in 2003, purchased an additional $100,000 liability-insurance policy from Rand Mullins for that property. All three policies Rand Mullins procured for Larry and Rebecca were initially obtained from Vesta Insurance Corporation; they were later replaced by policies issued by The Shelby Insurance Company (\"SIC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2003, Mullins canceled the insurance policy on the Florence house allegedly based on a belief that \"the policy was issued in duplicate.\" Allegedly unbeknownst to Larry and Rebecca, however, the requested cancellation left the Florence house uninsured. One month later, pursuant to a mortgage refinance on the Beddingfields' residence, Larry and Rebecca paid $1,629 to Mullins, representing one year's insurance premium on that residence; the check was endorsed and deposited into Mullins's account. In March 2004, the policy on the Beddingfields' residence was canceled because of nonpayment of the premium; neither Larry nor Rebecca, however, was able to recall receiving notice of the cancellation. After those two events, Larry and Rebecca were without insurance on their residence and the Florence house, leaving them with liability insurance only on their Guntersville house in the amount of $100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In July 2004, a minor guest at the Beddingfields' Guntersville house, Trace Rex Linam, suffered a serious eye injury in a fireworks-related incident. In 2008, Linam and his father, Charles Gary Linam, sued the Beddingfields, alleging that they, and particularly Cody, who was a minor at the time, were responsible for the injury (this action is hereinafter referred to as \"the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation\"). Because SIC had been placed into receivership in Texas in 2006, the Alabama Insurance Guaranty Association (\"AIGA\") covered the Beddingfields' legal-defense costs in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation; however, the maximum amount of liability coverage available was limited to $100,000-the amount of the liability-insurance policy Larry and Rebecca had obtained from Mullins to insure that property-and not $500,000, the amount they say would have been available had the other two policies not been canceled. See \u00a7 27-42-8(a)(1), Ala. Code 1975 (obligating AIGA to cover \"claims existing prior to the determination of [an insurer's] insolvency and arising within 30 days after the determination of insolvency, or before the policy expiration date if less than 30 days after the determination\" but limiting AIGA's obligation to the amount of \"the obligation of the insolvent insurer under the policy from which the claim arises\"). In February 2011, a judgment was entered on a $600,000 jury verdict against the Beddingfields in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation. The Beddingfields appealed that decision to this Court. Because, however, AIGA did not post the requisite supersedeas bond-allegedly because SIC was in receivership-and the Beddingfields were allegedly unable to obtain a bond, execution of the judgment was not stayed during the pendency of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In July 2011, while their appeal was pending, the Beddingfields sued Mullins in the Madison Circuit Court. The complaint alleged numerous counts of negligence and wantonness with relation to Mullins's handling of the various insurance policies. Specifically, Counts I and II, which related to the Florence house, alleged that Mullins had negligently and/or wantonly \"failed to reasonably review coverages provided by\" the insurance policy on that property. More specifically, it alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[Mullins] negligently cancelled the insurance policy which provided liability insurance coverage in the amount of $100,000.00, and instead continued in force and effect an insurance policy providing no liability insurance coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"... Had said coverage been in force and effect it would have provided additional insurance monies for settlement on behalf of the Beddingfields, or payment of a judgment against the Beddingfields [in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Counts III and IV of the complaint, which related to the Beddingfields' residence, alleged that Mullins had negligently and/or wantonly failed to pay the premium for the homeowners' insurance coverage despite having received the premium and that, as a result, the policy had been canceled, resulting in alleged mental anguish and property loss. Counts V and VI related to Mullins's decision to procure the Beddingfields' coverage from SIC and alleged that Mullins had negligently and/or wantonly failed to warn the Beddingfields of SIC's precarious financial situation, its poor risk rating, and the potential consequences of obtaining insurance from such an insurance company. Counts VII and VIII alleged that Mullins had negligently and/or wantonly \"appropriated the insurance premiums provided by the Beddingfields for their residence,\" resulting in the lapse of the Beddingfields' homeowners' policy and a corresponding reduction in available liability-insurance coverage. Finally, Counts IX and X of the complaint alleged that Mullins had negligently and/or wantonly \"failed to advise the Beddingfields of their need to obtain personal umbrella liability insurance coverage to protect their substantial assets from potential risks of loss.\" The Beddingfields sought unspecified damages in connection with each of the above-described claims. Mullins filed an initial answer generally denying liability and asserting numerous affirmative defenses to the Beddingfields' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2013, this Court issued its decision in the appeal in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation. See\n   <em>\n    Beddingfield v. Linam\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002118\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/1178/\">\n    127 So.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2013). Specifically, this Court reversed the trial court's judgment and, as to the Linams' claims of negligent entrustment, negligent supervision, and wanton supervision, rendered a judgment in favor of Larry and Rebecca.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002118\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/1178/\">\n    127 So.3d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus the claims against Larry and Rebecca in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation were concluded in their favor. The Court also rendered judgment in favor of Cody on the Linams' strict-liability claim, but remanded the matter for a new trial on their negligence, wantonness, and assault claims against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002118\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/127/1178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following that remand, the remaining claims were apparently settled and the action was ultimately dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, Mullins filed a motion for a summary judgment. Mullins attached to its motion, among other things, a notice dated March 4, 2004, which reflected the cancellation of the liability policy on the Beddingfields' residence effective March 19, 2004, and which was allegedly mailed to Larry and Rebecca at the address of their residence. Also attached was a follow-up \"confirmation of cancellation,\" which was allegedly mailed to Larry and Rebecca on March 31, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its motion, Mullins argued that it was entitled to a summary judgment on all of the Beddingfields' claims, both because the claims were allegedly filed after the expiration of the applicable two-year limitations period\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and because the Beddingfields had allegedly \"sustained no damages.\" More specifically, Mullins alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"1. The Beddingfields knew as early as at least 2008, that there were potential coverage gaps in their insurance because the AIGA, and not [SIC], provided the[ir] defense. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"2. Following an appeal by the Beddingfields ... [in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation], the Alabama Supreme Court on March 8, 2013 reversed and rendered the verdict as to [Larry and Rebecca] and remanded the claims against Cody back to the trial court for a retrial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"3. In April 2016, all of [the] remaining claims against Cody [in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation] were settled and there is no longer any threat of any Judgement against [any of the Beddingfields].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"4. ...[T]he Beddingfields ... have [not] had to pay or will have to pay any of their own personal money for defense or settlement costs of the [\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation]....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Mullins's summary-judgment motion, under Alabama law, all claims arising from the alleged failure to procure insurance coverage accrue when a loss triggering coverage occurs and the insurer refuses to cover the loss. Thus, Mullins argued, the Beddingfields' claims against Mullins accrued\n   <em>\n    at the very latest\n   </em>\n   at the time of-but arguably well before-the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation in May 2008 when the Beddingfields learned that AIGA, not SIC, was providing a defense; therefore, according to Mullins, the statute of limitations for the Beddingfields' current action expired in May 2010, before their initiation of the action in July 2011. Mullins further argued that the Beddingfields, in their respective depositions, admitted that their damages would be only those resulting from liability in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation. Because, Mullins alleges, the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation settled without the Beddingfields actually having incurred any related out-of-pocket expenses, Mullins contended that they were not in fact damaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Beddingfields moved to strike the cancellation notices attached as exhibits to Mullins's summary-judgment motion, which request the trial court granted. In further opposition to Mullins's motion, the Beddingfields attempted to demonstrate the existence of a question of material fact precluding summary judgment. Specifically, relying on certain exhibits, including affidavit and deposition testimony from the Beddingfields and their counsel in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation, they argued that there remained a question as to when their causes of action accrued. Contrary to Mullins's assertions, they contended that their negligent-procurement claims did not accrue until a claim for insurance benefits was denied-an event they asserted never actually occurred in this case. The Beddingfields subsequently filed an additional response disputing that knowledge of SIC's receivership alerted them to Mullins's alleged breach of duty and arguing that their first legal injury instead occurred either when the plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   litigation initially refused a policy-limits settlement offer in October 2009 or when the jury, in February 2011, returned its verdict, which exceeded available policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Beddingfields also contended that, under Alabama law, a tort-based cause of action accrues only when actual damage is sustained. They argued alternatively that they suffered legal injury either when the Linams refused to settle for the limits of the policy or when the jury returned its verdict. Thus, according to the Beddingfields, their July 11, 2011, filing was clearly within the two-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In their motion and accompanying exhibits, the Beddingfields conceded a complete \"lack of damage[ ] prior to the verdict rendered against them in the\n   <em>\n    Linam\n   </em>\n   suit.\" They explained, however, that, during their appeal of the resulting judgment and based on the absence of a supersedeas bond, the Linams undertook efforts to seize their personal assets, which required them to hire outside legal counsel and to incur approximately $15,000 in legal fees and expenses. The Beddingfields further testified that, as a result of the garnishment efforts and the related damage to his credit, Larry was unable to pay for liability insurance and other expenses necessary to maintain his general contractor's license. Affidavit testimony from an economist retained by the Beddingfields estimated Larry's lost business income at $795,223.71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Subsequent to a hearing, the trial court, without indicating the findings on which its ruling was based, entered an order granting Mullins's summary-judgment motion. The Beddingfields appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \" ' \"This Court's review of a summary judgment is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Some courts have said that legal injury has not occurred until the insured actually suffers the unprotected loss. ... In those actions in negligence, the requirement that the plaintiff sustain appreciable harm was met when the plaintiff incurred expenses, most often associated with employing a new lawyer to prosecute or defend against an action which would not have occurred but for the defendant-attorney's negligence. ... It might be supposed that [the] consciousness of contingent liability was damage enough, but the authorities are chary of treating the threat of future harm without realization of some tangible harm, like out-of-pocket payments, as the basis for concluding that damage has occurred and the cause of action has accrued. ...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    International Mobiles Corp. v.
