Code 1975, and first-degree sexual abuse,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-6-66, Ala. Code 1975. Pursuant to \u00a7 13A-5-6(d), Ala. Code 1975, E.L.Y. was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the sodomy conviction because the victim was 6 years of age or less and E.L.Y. was 21 years of age or older when the offense was committed. He was also sentenced to a concurrent term of 20 years' imprisonment for the sexual-abuse conviction. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The evidence presented at trial revealed the following. E.L.Y., his wife, E.Y., and their four children lived in Thailand from October 2013 until February 2014. E.L.Y. and his wife worked as missionaries. In January 2014, E.Y. walked into a room in their house and saw their six-year-old daughter, C.Y., sitting on the bed with her skirt pulled up and her underwear around her ankles. (R. 531.) E.Y. stated that she became upset and began asking \"what is going on\" over and over again. (R. 533.) E.L.Y. then came out of the bathroom with shaving cream on his face and said that he did not know what she was talking about. E.L.Y. then explained to E.Y. that he had been cuddling with C.Y. when C.Y. complained that his facial hair bothered her. Therefore, E.L.Y. said, he had gone into the bathroom to shave. E.Y. testified that C.Y. would not respond when she asked her what had happened. E.Y. testified that E.L.Y. became very upset when she continued to ask him about the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   E.Y. stated that she talked to C.Y. again later that evening. According to E.Y., C.Y. told her that E.L.Y. \"licked her private parts.\" (R. 541.) The next day, C.Y. disclosed to E.Y. that the incident in Thailand was not the first time E.L.Y. had had inappropriate interactions with her. C.Y. told her mother that E.L.Y. licked her private parts when the family lived in \"the brick house\" and when they had traveled to Indiana. E.Y. testified that C.Y. referred to their house in Calhoun County, Alabama, as \"the brick house.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 543.) E.Y. then contacted their missionary team leader, Mark Bosje, and explained the situation to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bosje testified that, after speaking with E.Y., he contacted E.L.Y. and asked to speak with him about the allegations. Bosje stated that E.L.Y. came to his house and that E.L.Y. initially denied everything. However, Bosje testified that \"as the conversation carried on, there was a change in the direction of the conversation. [E.L.Y.] made statements such as: Well, I have been sick, and I have been on heavy medication. A little while later, [E.L.Y.] said, maybe I was half asleep and thought it was my wife.\" (R. 582.) Bosje testified that E.L.Y.'s responses convinced him that E.Y. and the children needed to be removed from E.L.Y.'s home and that E.L.Y. was disqualified from serving as a missionary. Bosje then took the appropriate steps to report the situation to his superiors, to place E.Y. and her children in a safe location, and to make arrangements for E.L.Y. to return to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   C.Y. testified\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that E.L.Y. was her father. According to C.Y., she and her family\n   had previously lived in Alabama, Indiana, and Thailand. C.Y. testified that she and her family had been missionaries in Thailand but had returned to the United States \"[b]ecause [E.L.Y.] did something bad.\" (R. 613.) When asked what those bad things were, C.Y. stated that E.L.Y. had touched her private parts underneath her clothing with \"[h]is hand, his tongue, and his private part.\" (R. 615.) C.Y. specifically identified the relevant body parts on an anatomical diagram. (R. 616.) In describing the events that occurred in Thailand, including her mother's discovery of the abuse, C.Y. essentially testified to the same order of events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   C.Y. went on to testify that the incident of abuse in Thailand was not the first time E.L.Y. had touched her inappropriately. C.Y. stated that E.L.Y. had also touched her inappropriately in Indiana and Alabama. When asked about the location of the incidents in Alabama, C.Y. testified that they occurred \"in Anniston at the brick house.\" (R. 620.) C.Y. described the abuse in Alabama as being similar to the abuse in Thailand. According to C.Y., E.L.Y. touched her \"front and back\" private parts underneath her clothing with his hand, tongue, and his private part. (R. 621-22.) C.Y. testified that E.L.Y. would then hold her and walk up and down the hallway praying. According to C.Y., she was six years old when the abuse occurred in Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   E.L.Y. testified in his own defense and admitted to touching and sodomizing C.Y. in Thailand. E.L.Y. stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"And for reasons I can't really tell you, I pulled [C.Y.'s] skirt down. And eventually while we were snuggling, not just her skirt but her underwear. And I touched her with my hands. And just touched her with my hands. I touched her in the private area with my hands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"And then eventually for reasons I can't tell you, it escalated. And I actually-I did put my mouth on her private area.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (R. 710.) E.L.Y. also testified that he inappropriately touched C.Y. with his hands when they lived in Alabama. E.L.Y. stated that he and C.Y. were playing \"the tickle game\" and that he began tickling C.Y. on her thigh. He then stated: \"And I tickled her, and I actually tickled her in her private area. I am ashamed to tell you that. I wish I could tell you why .... And I wish I could just say I only tickled her one time .... I don't remember when, but I did tickle her again more than once.\" (R. 726-28.) However, despite these admissions, E.L.Y. maintained that he did not put his mouth on C.Y.'s genitals when they lived in Alabama. E.L.Y. stated: \"this is the crux of my whole defense of what I am saying. I did not put my mouth on my daughter at Bynum Acres Drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That did not happen. I tickled her in between her legs. I did do that.\" (R. 729.) E.L.Y. testified that his daughter was \"not a little lying girl\" but that she was mistaken about where they lived when he put his mouth on her genitals. (R. 729-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   E.L.Y. raises numerous issues on appeal.

Those additional \"\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   factors\" require the court to examine the punishment imposed on other offenders in the same jurisdiction and the punishment the offender would have received had the crime been committed in another jurisdiction. The\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the mandatory life-imprisonment-without-parole sentence was grossly disproportionate to the specific acts that constituted Wilson's crime.

The United States Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   that no single factor determines when a sentence is grossly disproportionate, and it offered a nonexhaustive list of factors to be considered when a court is assessing the severity of a crime. These factors include consideration of the circumstances of the crime, the harm caused to the victim or to society, the culpability of the offender, and the offender's motive in committing the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    at 290-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194264\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/277/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9316172\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/830/765/\">\n    830 So.2d at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Turning to the factors set out in\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   , we find that the circumstances of the crime here are extremely grave. As noted, E.L.Y. was convicted of engaging in deviate sexual conduct with his daughter when she was six years of age and younger. E.L.Y. even admitted to some of the incidents but denied that they occurred in Alabama. Such acts have been determined to be among the most serious and grave offenses that can be committed in the State of Alabama. This is evidenced by the legislature's decision to classify first-degree sodomy as a Class A felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-6-63(b), Ala. Code 1975, the same classification given to crimes such as murder, rape, and first-degree robbery. The circumstances of E.L.Y.'s offense are even more grievous in that the crime was perpetrated against his young daughter in their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This Court also finds that the harm caused to C.Y. was especially severe for several reasons. First, the crimes were committed by her father, a person C.Y. should have been able to look to for support and protection. The crimes were also committed on more than one occasion and in multiple locations. Based on C.Y.'s age at the time the offenses were committed, it is likely that she has no memory of a home in which she was not sexually abused. E.L.Y. claims in his brief that \"it is questionable what,\n   <em>\n    if any\n   </em>\n   , long term effects will be to the child victim.\" (E.L.Y.'s brief, at 37 (emphasis added).) We find this assertion wholly absurd. E.L.Y. states in his brief that the sexual abuse he experienced as a child was a factor in his eventual decision to abuse his child. To then argue that his abuse of C.Y. may not have long-term effects on her is disingenuous at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   E.L.Y. also attempts to diminish his culpability for the offense by asserting that he has no criminal history, that his conduct was not violent, and that he was sexually abused as a child. (E.L.Y.'s brief, at 32-33.) E.L.Y. cites cases such as\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010),\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

However, those cases are inapposite.\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Roper\n   </em>\n   involved issues regarding the culpability of juveniles, and\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   dealt with issues surrounding the culpability of intellectually disabled defendants. E.L.Y. was an adult when he committed the charged crimes, and he was not intellectually disabled. In fact, E.L.Y. testified that he was the valedictorian of his high-school class, that he graduated near the top of his class in college, and that he studied at a Bible college before becoming a missionary. While we recognize that E.L.Y. had no criminal history and that he was affected by the abuse he endured as a child, we do not find that his culpability was diminished in any significant way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, E.L.Y. points to the expert testimony he presented at trial regarding different types of sex offenders and their prospects of rehabilitation. E.L.Y.'s expert,\n   Dr. Frankie Preston, testified that E.L.Y. fell into a class of sex offenders who were susceptible to rehabilitation and less likely to re-offend compared to other types of sex offenders. Dr. Preston also testified that there was no scientific basis for the legislature's age classifications in \u00a7 13A-5-6(d). This Court has considered that testimony and does not find it to be persuasive. For these reasons, we do not conclude that E.L.Y.'s sentence is grossly disproportionate to his crime. Accordingly, we need not examine the remaining\n   <em>\n    Solem\n   </em>\n   factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . The legislature was within its rights to determine that offenders such as E.L.Y., who commit sex crimes against very young children, are deserving of one of the harshest punishments meted out by the State. Thus, we hold that E.L.Y.'s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is not unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Next, E.L.Y. argues that the act that amended \u00a7 13A-5-6, Ala. Code 1975, to add subsection (d) was unconstitutional \"in that it violated Article IV, Section 63 of the Alabama Constitution of 1901, which requires a bill to be read three (3) different days.\" (E.L.Y.'s brief, at 42.) E.L.Y. also argues that the bill violated \u00a7 45 of Art. IV because, he says, the subject of the bill was not clearly stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Article IV, \u00a7 63, of the Alabama Constitution, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Every bill shall be read on three different days in each house, and no bill shall become a law, unless on its final passage it be read at length, and the vote be taken by yeas and nays, the names of the members voting for and against the same be entered upon the journals, and a majority of each house be recorded thereon as voting in its favor, except as otherwise provided in this Constitution.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   E.L.Y. asserts in his brief that the original bill that was introduced during the 2011 legislative session sought to amend \u00a7 13A-5-40, Ala. Code 1975, to make first-degree rape, first-degree sodomy, and first-degree sexual torture, when the victim was a young child, capital offenses. The house judiciary committee amended the bill and presented a substitute version removing the possibility of a death sentence and instead amending \u00a7 13A-5-6, Ala. Code 1975, to provide for a mandatory life-imprisonment-without-parole sentence upon conviction of any of the above-mentioned offenses. E.L.Y. claims that this substitute bill was not read on three different days and, therefore, violates the three-readings requirement of the Alabama Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Magee v.

However, we hold that an amended bill or a substitute bill, if germane to and not inconsistent with the general purpose of the original bill, does not have to be read three times on three different days to comply with \u00a7 63. The legislature complies with the three-readings requirement if the three readings include the version before the substitution was made. On their face, the legislative journals indicate three readings of HB 84 in both houses even though the substitute version was read only once in each house. This practice complies with\n   \u00a7 63 so long as the original bill and the amended or substitute bill are not vitally altered so that there is no longer a common purpose or relationship between the original bill and the amended or substitute bill.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   E.L.Y. argues that, because the substitute bill amended a different section of the criminal code, the substitute \"varies substantially\" from the original bill and consequently failed to comply with the three-readings requirement. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As noted, the original bill sought to make certain sex crimes perpetrated against very young children capital offenses punishable by death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, while the substitute version merely removed the possibility of a death sentence. It is clear that the legislative intent behind the original bill was to create a certain class of offenders deserving of the most serious punishments available. The substitute bill was not inconsistent with that purpose. Thus, we do not find that the bill was so \"vitally altered so that there [was] no longer a common purpose or relationship\" between the two bills.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6839312\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/175/79/#p114\">\n    175 So.3d at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the act creating \u00a7 13A-5-6(d), Ala. Code 1975, satisfied the three-readings requirement of the Alabama Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   E.L.Y. also asserts that the act in question violated Art. IV, \u00a7 45, of the Alabama Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that \"[e]ach law shall contain but one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.\" According to E.L.Y., the subject of the bill was not clearly stated because, he says, the synopsis of both the original bill and the substitute bill sought to punish offenders whose victims were \"under six (6) years of age\" while the body of the substitute bill identified the relevant victims as being \"six (6) years of age and under.\" (E.L.Y.'s brief, at 44.) E.L.Y. argues that this ambiguity renders the statute unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although the ambiguity appears in both the synopsis and the body of both the original bill and the substitute bill, the ambiguity does not appear in the\n   <em>\n    title\n   </em>\n   and body of the substitute bill. The title of the substitute bill states: \"A BILL TO BE ENTITLED AN ACT [t]o amend Section 13A-5-6, Code of Alabama 1975; to provide that certain defendants convicted of certain sex offenses would be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole ....\" (C. 133.) The body of the substitute bill then provides that the mandatory life-imprisonment-without-parole sentence applies \"when the defendant was 21 years of age or older and the victim was six years of age or less at the time the offense was committed.\" (C. 135.) The title of a bill and the synopsis of a bill are not the same thing. Section 45 of Art. IV of the Alabama Constitution speaks only to the titles of bills and not their synopses. E.L.Y. has cited no authority for the proposition that a small disparity or ambiguity between the synopsis of a bill and its body renders it unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R. App. P. Accordingly, E.L.Y. is due no relief on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, E.L.Y. argues that his sentence violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitutions as well as Art. I, \u00a7 6, of the Alabama Constitution. The crux of E.L.Y.'s argument is his contention that there is no rational basis for classifying offenders based on the age of the victim. In support of that proposition, E.L.Y. cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015279\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/91/724/#p731\">\n    91 So.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. Crim.

Code 1975, were\n   unconstitutional because they created a de facto classification of sex offenders based solely on their economic status. (\"The statute the legislature enacted, however, unconstitutionally subjects indigent homeless sex offenders to a denial of their liberty based solely on their inability to pay.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   However, \u00a7 13A-5-6(d), Ala.

Officer Price testified that he interviewed E.L.Y. on January 31, 2014, at the Anniston police station. According to Officer Price, he first made contact with E.L.Y. at a hotel E.L.Y. was staying in. When Price told E.L.Y. that he wanted to discuss the allegations that had been made against him, Price stated that E.L.Y. \"immediately began attempting to ... defend his actions.\" (R. 127.) Officer Price testified that he stopped E.L.Y. from making any further statements and told him that he needed to read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and to conduct the interview at the police station so that it could be videotaped. According to Officer Price, E.L.Y. agreed and voluntarily accompanied him to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Once they arrived, Officer Price stated, he read the standard\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver form to E.L.Y. and E.L.Y. signed the form, indicating that he understood his rights and that he wished to speak with police. A copy of that form was admitted into evidence. (C. 117.) Officer Price testified that E.L.Y. did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol; that he did not appear fatigued; and that nothing about E.L.Y.'s demeanor or the manner in which he answered questions indicated that E.L.Y. was impaired in any way. Officer Price also testified that E.L.Y. never asked to stop the interview for any reason and never asked to speak with an attorney. Finally, Officer Price stated that he did not use any threats, violence, or other coercive techniques to procure E.L.Y.'s waiver or subsequent statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   On appeal, E.L.Y. asks this Court to consider E.L.Y.'s alleged fatigue and his lack of understanding regarding the legal consequences of confessing to crimes in multiple jurisdictions. However, as noted above, the State presented uncontested evidence establishing that E.L.Y. was not impaired when he waived his rights and that he was not coerced to do so in any way. During cross-examination, defense counsel implied that E.L.Y. had been awake for two days when he gave his statement to Officer Price. However, E.L.Y. offered no testimony or additional evidence to establish that he had been awake for two days or that he was impaired in any other way when he waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Accordingly, we find that the trial court's decision to deny E.L.Y.'s motion to suppress was supported\n   by the record and was not contrary to the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   E.L.Y. next asserts that his convictions are due to be reversed because, he says, the indictments charging him with first-degree sodomy and first-degree sexual abuse were fatally defective.
