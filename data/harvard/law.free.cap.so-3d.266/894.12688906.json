The City of Harahan is not an instrumentality of the Parish of Jefferson for purposes of the three-year prescriptive period in La. R.S. 9:5625(C).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slowinski v. England Economic and Industrial Develop.

Rather, the City of Harahan is properly classified as a municipality, which is governed by the five-year prescriptive period set forth in La. R.S. 9:5625(A)(3). Applying this statute, the reconventional demand filed by the City of Harahan is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeal, which affirmed the district court's judgment granting the exception of prescription, is reversed. The exception of prescription is denied, and the case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   GUIDRY, J., recused\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   HUGHES, J., would deny the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   GENOVESE, J., would deny.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Guidry, J. recused.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
