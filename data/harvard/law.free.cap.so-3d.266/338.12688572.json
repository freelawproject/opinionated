Kavanagh (Kavanagh), on his request for injunctive relief regarding whether Hebron could take or hold public office under newly enacted La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1 with a felony conviction in 2011 and a sentence ending in December 2017. Finding no legal error or abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, we affirm the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We must decide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) whether the trial court erred in applying La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1 ; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting the injunction requested by Kavanagh to prevent Hebron from taking and holding public office in January 2019.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kavanagh, Mayor of Ball, Louisiana, along with Hebron and Gene Decker, were opposing candidates in the November 6, 2018 mayoral election in Ball. Hebron won the election with 56% of the 1450 votes cast, and Kavanagh came in second. Also on November 6, 2018, Louisiana citizens voted statewide to approve a new constitutional amendment, La. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, which prohibits a convicted felon from holding public office until more than five years have elapsed since the completion of his sentence. The amendment was approved with over a million Louisiana citizens voting in favor of its enactment into law. In Ball, Louisiana, the amendment passed with 60% of the electorate voting it into law. Pursuant to La.Const. art 13, \u00a7 1 (C), the effective date of the new constitutional amendment was twenty days after the Governor proclaimed it law, which occurred in this case on November 21, 2018. The parties stipulated that the effective date of La. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, was December 12, 2018. Kavanagh filed suit against Hebron on December 17, 2018, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction to prevent Hebron from taking or holding office in January 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court heard the matter on December 21, 2018. The record reveals that in 2011, while Hebron was the sitting Mayor of Ball, he was convicted of conspiracy to defraud The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the town's application for disaster relief funds. Hebron served four years in prison and three years of probation, all of which were completed on December 18, 2017. Thus, when the new law became effective on December 12, 2018, less than one year had elapsed since the completion of Hebron's sentence for the felony conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the end of the hearing on December 21, 2018, the trial judge found that the new amendment, La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, applied to Hebron. She indicated that proceedings for a declaratory judgment would be held separately at a later time. The trial court then signed a judgment in open court granting Kavanagh's injunction to prevent Hebron from taking and holding public office in January 2019. The December 21, 2018 judgment also denied Hebron's motion to strike and his exceptions of prematurity, no cause of action, no right of action, improper cumulation of actions, non-joinder of parties, and unauthorized use of summary proceedings. The trial court's judgment also ordered Kavanagh to remain in office as mayor, pursuant to La.R.S. 42:2, until further order of the court and/or further proceedings in accordance\n   with law. While Kavanagh and the trial court agreed that this suit did not fall under the Election Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hebron's appeal requested an expedited hearing, which we granted.

He not only asserts that Louisiana must have a statute making it a state crime to violate the FEMA statutes, he also asserts that the state statute must have the exact same elements as the FEMA statute. We disagree. The amendment contains no such language nor the standard asserted by Hebron. More specifically, La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1 (A)(2) states that the crime must be \"a crime which, if committed in this state, would be a felony.\" The new amendment is almost identical in language to its predecessor, La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10, entitled\n   <strong>\n    \"\n   </strong>\n   Right to Vote; Disqualification from Seeking or Holding an Elective Office,\" which otherwise provided a longer waiting period for convicted felons, as follows (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (A) Right to Vote.

There, Touchet, a qualified elector of Abbeville, filed a petition under La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10, challenging the candidacy of Broussard for a city council position and asserting that Broussard had a felony conviction for aiding and abetting an illegal gambling business in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201955\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (2). Touchet further asserted that Broussard had not been pardoned by the governor, nor had fifteen years passed since his federal conviction. The trial court found that in Broussard's federal plea agreement he had admitted guilt to the Louisiana felony offense of gambling as defined in La.R.S. 14:90, but a panel of this court of appeal reversed, finding that the Louisiana statute was not equivalent to the federal statute. Overturning the third circuit, the supreme court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The court of appeal concluded that \"Louisiana law does not contain an aiding and abetting statute comparable to the federal statute, and Mr. Touchet has pointed the court to no comparable Louisiana felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the court of appeal's ruling ignores a basic principle of Louisiana statutory criminal law that all persons who aid and abet in the commission of a crime are principals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.

R.S. 14:2(A)(4), a felony in Louisiana is any crime for which an offender may be sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor. Thus, it is disingenuous to contend that the fraud perpetrated upon FEMA by Hebron would not be a felony if perpetrated upon the State of Louisiana in an application for government benefits. In addition to serving the four-year imprisonment and three-year probationary terms, Hebron was required to pay $25,000 in fines and $105,556 in restitution in connection with the federal offenses. He was also required to resign his position as mayor. He did not complete serving his probationary period until December 18, 2017, less than one year from the effective date of La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, on December 12, 2018, and slightly over one year from the date in January 2019 that Hebron would be required to assume and hold the office of mayor, well under the five-year limitation established by the new amendment. Therefore, under La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, Hebron was prohibited from assuming and holding the office of Mayor of Ball in January 2019, and the trial court did not err in so finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Injunctive Relief and Standing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Hebron contends that the Election Code in Title 18 provides detailed procedures for elections and for contesting elections, but that it contains no provision allowing for an injunction against a successful candidate to prevent that candidate from taking office. Therefore, Hebron contends, Kavanagh did not have standing or a right of action to bring the suit. Kavanagh asserts and has always asserted that his request for an injunction does not fall under the Election Code. He correctly points out that the Election Code provides registered voters with time-sensitive procedures for challenging a candidate's qualifications to run, and for contesting the election after the fact due to fraud or irregularity in the conduct of the election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.R.S. 18:491 -93, and La.R.S. 18:1401 -06, respectively. But as repeatedly asserted by Kavanagh, the Election Code does not provide the basis for his suit, as the constitutional amendment at issue did not become effective until December 12, 2018, and did not bar Hebron from qualifying to run back in July 2018. Nor did Kavanagh bring suit to challenge the election for fraud or irregularity in the election process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Rather, Kavanagh, a registered voter, citizen, and current Mayor of Ball, sought a preliminary injunction on December 17, 2018, to restrain Hebron from illegally holding office in January 2019, and to prevent infringement on Kavanagh's statutory duty to continue to discharge the duties of his office until a lawful successor was inducted into that office.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.R.S. 42:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Code of Civil Procedure states, \"An injunction shall be issued in cases where irreparable injury, loss, or damage may otherwise result to the applicant, or in other cases specifically provided by law....\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 3601(A). However:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   A petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief without the requisite showing of irreparable injury when the conduct sought to be restrained is unconstitutional or unlawful,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   when the conduct sought to be enjoined constitutes a direct violation of a prohibitory law and/or a violation of a constitutional right. Once a plaintiff has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the conduct to be enjoined is reprobated by law, the petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief without the necessity of showing that no other adequate legal remedy exists.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Jurisich v. Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , 99-76, p. 4 (La. 10/19/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11485562\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/597/#p599\">\n    749 So.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 599 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In spite of the above law, and in furtherance of his argument that the\n   <em>\n    Election Code\n   </em>\n   provides no remedy for Kavanagh to seek an injunction, and he therefore has no remedy, Hebron points to\n   <em>\n    State v. Gibson\n   </em>\n   , 12-1145 (La. 1/29/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005548\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/107/574/\">\n    107 So.3d 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a case decided during the effective period of the predecessor amendment, La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10. There, where the State brought suit against a convicted felon after the election but before he was sworn into office, the Louisiana Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   The prohibition contained in Art. I, \u00a7 10 is two-fold. Article I, \u00a7 10 not only sets forth qualifications for office by prohibiting a felon from qualifying for public office unless certain conditions are met, but it goes further by expressly prohibiting such a felon from taking office. Although the provisions of the Election Code do not directly provide a method or cause of action for the State to prevent Mr. Gibson from taking office in violation of Art. I, \u00a7 10, we find the State can bring a direct action pursuant to that constitutional provision. A cause of action arises when Art. I, \u00a7 10 is violated because the constitutional prohibition\n   contained therein is self-executing. A constitutional provision is self-executing when it can be given effect without the aid of legislation, and there is nothing to indicate that legislation is intended to make it operative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005548\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/107/574/\">\n    107 So.3d at 581-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   After analyzing numerous statutes in the Election Code, the\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   court found that it provided no remedy for the State to bring suit under La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10 after a certain time frame, but that the State was not confined to traditional challenges under the Election Code. One of the statutes analyzed by the Court in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , was La.R.S. 18:495. Paragraph (A) of La. R.S. 18:495 gave the State standing to immediately bring suit under La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10, if it learned that a convicted felon filed a notice of candidacy, but Paragraph (B) of La.R.S. 18:495 required the State to file suit within the seven-day period after the close of the qualifying period. Thus, the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   was that the State was not bound by the Election Code in enforcing a constitutional amendment. Similarly, Paragraph (D) of La.R.S. 18:495 gives standing to registered voters to bring suit under the same constitutional amendment, again couching it in terms of candidacy. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   , there must be a remedy outside the Election Code for citizens to protect their interests in the face of constitutional violations. While Hebron characterizes the holding in\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   as applying only to the State's plenary power,\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   does not make that power exclusive to the State, nor does it foreclose a right of action by a voter to seek injunctive relief in the face of a violation of La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1 in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Here, the constitutional amendment which became effective on December 12, 2018, prohibits a person with a past felony conviction from holding public office until more than five years have elapsed from the date he completed his sentence. Hebron completed his sentence on December 18, 2017, thus he would not be able to lawfully hold the office when required to do so in January 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we find that Kavanagh made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing under\n   <em>\n    Jurisich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11485562\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/749/597/#p599\">\n    749 So.2d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that Hebron's taking the oath of public office and holding the position of mayor in January 2019 is unconstitutional and reprobated by law under La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 10.1, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's granting of injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.
