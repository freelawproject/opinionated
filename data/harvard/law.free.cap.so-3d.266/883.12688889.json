We affirm the judgment and sentence but remand for the correction of several scrivener's errors. For Count 1, the trial court is instructed to amend the judgment\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      and sentence to reflect that Appellant pled guilty to a second-degree felony. For Count 2, the trial court is instructed to enter an order of probation that more clearly reflects what portion of the prison sentence is to be withheld or stayed during the five-year probationary period; however, the probationary period cannot be served concurrently with the incarceration portion of the sentence imposed under Count 1. Finally, for Count 4, the court must amend the sentence to read 364 days instead of 365 days so as to conform to the orally pronounced sentence.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF SCRIVENER'S ERRORS.\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
