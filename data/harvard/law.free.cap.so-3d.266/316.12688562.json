MCKAY III, CHIEF JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this child custody case, the father, Rye G. Cooper (\"Mr. Cooper\"), appeals the February 27, 2018 judgment allowing the mother, Elizabeth L. Chamberlain (\"Ms. Chamberlain\"), to relocate with their minor son to Nashville, Tennessee. Mr. Cooper also appeals the April 20, 2018 judgment, which was rendered in connection with the granting of his motion for new trial. We affirm both judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties were married on January 3, 2012. Their son was born on April 29, 2012. On June 9, 2017, Mr. Cooper filed a petition for divorce. A consent judgment for interim custody was issued on November 2, 2017, wherein the parties agreed to exercise shared, joint legal custody of the minor child. On November 13, 2017, Ms. Chamberlain filed a motion for relocation of the minor child to Nashville, Tennessee, where she was offered a post-doctoral fellowship at Vanderbilt University. Ms. Chamberlain has a Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Science, specializing in luminescence dating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Cooper objected to the relocation, and the matter was tried on January 8, 29 and 30, 2018. A judgment and separate reasons for judgment was rendered on February 27, 2018, granting Ms. Chamberlain's motion for relocation. The judgment further awarded joint custody, with Ms. Chamberlain designated as the domiciliary parent. A summer visitation schedule was also established, with Mr. Cooper receiving a block of time with his son. Finally, the judgment ordered Mr. Cooper to submit to random drug and alcohol screenings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following a hearing on Mr. Cooper's motion for new trial, the trial court rendered a judgment on April 20, 2018, amending the February 27, 2018 judgment to provide for a more specific plan of implementation/visitation schedule, and to address other ancillary matters in connection with the relocation of the minor child. All other aspects of the February 27, 2018 judgment remained in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Cooper's appeal from the February 27, 2018 judgment and the April 20, 2018 judgment followed. He asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The trial court erred in denying Mr. Cooper's motion to apply the uncalled witness rule when Ms. Chamberlain failed to call her mother, whom she listed as a witness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The trial court erred in denying Mr. Cooper's motion for involuntary dismissal at the conclusion of Ms. Chamberlain's case;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3.

Louisiana jurisprudence has held that the trial court's failure to apply the negative inference is not an abuse of discretion under any one of these circumstances: where the witness's testimony would be cumulative; where the party seeking to avail itself of the negative inference has the burden of proof on the issue that would be addressed by the witness's testimony;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   and where the witness is equally available to the opposing party. As all of these circumstances are present here, and any one would have been sufficient to justify the trial court's refusal to apply the presumption, we cannot say that the court's failure to do so was an abuse of discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Upon review of the record in the present case, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's failure to apply the uncalled witness rule. The trial court made a credibility determination based on Ms. Chamberlain's testimony that her mother would accompany her to Nashville. Furthermore, the record reflects that Ms. Chamberlain's mother was present in New Orleans during part of the trial, and Mr. Cooper could have issued a subpoena to ensure her testimony. In sum, we find that the facts presented here do not warrant the application of the uncalled witness rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 2: Denial of the Motion for Involuntary Dismissal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Cooper argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for involuntary dismissal. Mr. Cooper made the motion at the close of Ms. Chamberlain's case, asserting that she failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that relocation was in the child's best interest. We find no merit in this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Crescent City Cabinets &amp; Flooring, L.L.C. v. Grace Tama Develop.

Clearly, the record establishes a factual basis for the trial court's ruling in denying the motion for involuntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 3 : Granting the Motion to Relocate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mr. Cooper argues that it is not in the child's best interest to relocate given the short-term nature of the relocation and the fact that the child has stability and consistency in New Orleans in his school, friends and extended family network. Mr. Cooper further argues that Ms. Chamberlain failed to present any evidence as to how the child's life would be enhanced by the move.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"The person proposing relocation has the burden of proof that the proposed relocation is made in good faith\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is in the best interest of the child.\" La. R.S. 9:355.10. La. R.S. 9:355.14(A) provides twelve factors that courts are to consider in ruling on whether a contested relocation is in the best interest of a child, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) The nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the relationship of the child with the person proposing relocation and with the non-relocating person, siblings, and other significant persons in the child's life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) The age, developmental stage, needs of the child, and the likely impact the relocation will have on the child's physical, educational, and emotional development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (3) The feasibility of preserving a good relationship between the non-relocating person and the child through suitable physical custody or visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (4) The child's views about the proposed relocation, taking into consideration the age and maturity of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (5) Whether there is an established pattern of conduct by either the person seeking or the person opposing the relocation, either to promote or thwart the relationship of the child and the other party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (6) How the relocation of the child will affect the general quality of life for the child, including but not limited to financial or emotional benefit and educational opportunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (7) The reasons of each person for seeking or opposing the relocation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (8) The current employment and economic circumstances of each person and how the proposed relocation may affect the circumstances of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (9) The extent to which the objecting person has fulfilled his financial obligations to the person seeking relocation, including child support, spousal support, and community property, and alimentary obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (10) The feasibility of a relocation by the objecting person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (11) Any history of substance abuse, harassment, or violence by either the person seeking or the person opposing relocation, including a consideration of the severity of the conduct and the failure or success of any attempts at rehabilitation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (12) Any other factors affecting the best interest of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Over the course of three days, the trial court heard testimony from Ms. Chamberlain, Mr. Cooper, Mr. Cooper's mother, Bliss Higgins, and his stepsister, Danica Gerrity. As explained in the reasons for judgment, the trial court analyzed each of the above twelve factors, finding in favor of relocation. We will address each factor as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (1) The nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the relationship of the child with the person proposing relocation and with the non-relocating person, siblings, and other significant persons in the child's life.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The trial court found this factor to be neutral. More specifically, the trial court noted that both parents were active in the child's life and that Mr. Cooper and Ms. Chamberlain received help from both of their families. These findings were supported by the record. It is evident from the testimony that the minor child has more regular contact with his extended family members (grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins) on Mr. Cooper's side, as they reside in Louisiana. However, while Ms. Chamberlain does not have family residing here, the child has had frequent and ongoing contact with his maternal grandparents. The record also reflects that Ms. Chamberlain and the child (not Mr. Cooper) traveled and vacationed quite often together with Ms. Chamberlain's parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) The age, developmental stage, needs of the child, and the likely impact the relocation will have on the child's physical, educational, and emotional development.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This factor was determined to be in favor of Ms. Chamberlain. The trial court considered the parties' testimony in finding that the proposed school in Nashville (a ten minute walk from Vanderbilt University) had a similarly excellent reputation to the child's current school (Luscher Charter School). Furthermore, the trial court noted that Ms. Chamberlain has a significant history of being involved in the child's education, while Mr. Cooper neglected to attend school activities and brought the child late to school on several occasions. Ms. Chamberlain testified that her position at Vanderbilt and the close proximity of the child's school will allow her continued involvement in the child's education and school activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The record reflects that Mr. Cooper was unable to attend many school functions at school due to his work schedule. He testified, however, that he could have altered his work schedule on occasion but chose not to attend some school functions if he knew Ms. Chamberlain would be attending. He thought that was best given their toxic relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (3) The feasibility of preserving a good relationship between the non-relocating person and the child through suitable physical custody or visitation arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The trial court determined that this factor favored Ms. Chamberlain, finding that she appeared committed to facilitating Mr. Cooper's visitation with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As she testified, Ms. Chamberlain proposed that Mr. Cooper have eight weeks of visitation during the summer, along with school holidays and one weekend each month. She further stated that she would transport the child from Nashville to New Orleans for the visits. Additionally, Ms. Chamberlain was open to allowing Mr. Cooper to communicate with the child via Skype.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (4) The child's views about the proposed relocation, taking into consideration the age and maturity of the child.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   This factor was determined to be inapplicable given the child's age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (5) Whether there is an established pattern of conduct by either the person seeking or the person opposing the relocation, either to promote or thwart the relationship of the child and the other party.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This factor was determined to be neutral. The trial court concluded that both parents had a shared desire for the child to have a relationship with the other parent. We agree. Ms. Chamberlain and Mr. Cooper encouraged the child's relationship with the other parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (6) How the relocation of the child will affect the general quality of life for the child, including but not limited to financial or emotional benefit and educational opportunity.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The trial court found this factor to be in favor of Ms. Chamberlain. Here, the court determined that the relocation and post-doctoral fellowship allowed Ms. Chamberlain to advance her career. The court reasoned that the advancement would benefit the minor child financially.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Ms. Chamberlain testified that Vanderbilt offers reasonably priced comprehensive health insurance for herself and the child that she could not afford while working at Tulane University. She also testified that her field of study in geology has had a very positive influence on the child. Ms. Chamberlain introduced photographs showing how the child has been introduced to many different nature related activities, particularly while traveling with his mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (7) The reasons of each person for seeking or opposing the relocation.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This factor was also found to favor Ms. Chamberlain, given the prestigious opportunity offered in her unique field. Mr. Cooper believed that the relocation was only in Ms. Chamberlain's best interest, not the child's best interest. He stated that he saw no need for Ms. Chamberlain to obtain further schooling when she already had several degrees. The record before us demonstrates that Ms. Chamberlain's reasons for relocation were well-founded. Moreover, while Mr. Cooper does not agree with the relocation, he does not argue that the proposed relocation was necessarily made in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (8) The current employment and economic circumstances of each person and how the proposed relocation may affect the circumstances of the child.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The trial court found this factor to be in favor of Ms. Chamberlain. Mr. Cooper testified that he earns $55,000.00 annually, with the potential for performance bonuses, as a general manager for a custom clothing warehouse. Ms. Chamberlain was earning less than $30,000.00 per year at Tulane University. The position at Vanderbilt University pays more than $50,000.00 annually, and offers affordable health insurance. The trial court determined that the increase in Ms. Chamberlain's income will inherently benefit the minor child. Both parties testified that they received financial assistance from their respective families and that they were not always able to afford health insurance for the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (9) The extent to which the objecting person has fulfilled his financial obligations to the person seeking relocation, including child support, spousal support, and community property, and alimentary obligations.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This factor was determined to be inapplicable. The parties do not currently have\n   any obligations pertaining to child support, spousal support or community property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (10) The feasibility of a relocation by the objecting person.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The trial court determined that this factor favored Ms. Chamberlain, finding that is was not impossible for Mr. Cooper to find a job in Nashville given his wider array of possible employment opportunities in the clothing and restaurant industries. Ms. Chamberlain testified that Mr. Cooper considered moving to Nashville. Mr. Cooper denied this assertion, stating that he had no desire to leave Louisiana and his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (11) Any history of substance abuse, harassment, or violence by either the person seeking or the person opposing relocation, including a consideration of the severity of the conduct and the failure or success of any attempts at rehabilitation.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The trial court found this factor to \"significantly\" weigh in favor of Ms. Chamberlain. The record demonstrates that Mr. Cooper overdosed on heroine in 2012, just a few months after the minor child was born. Alcohol and cocaine were also found in his system at the time. As a result, he attended an outpatient rehabilitation center for six months. The record also demonstrates that Mr. Cooper was involved in two traffic stops, one in December 2014, and one in January 2016. In each instance, Mr. Cooper refused to use the breathalyzer and was arrested for DUI. The second arrest occurred while Ms. Chamberlain was traveling out of the country for two months and the minor child was in Mr. Cooper's care (with the help of his family). Mr. Cooper was ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In spite of attending the meetings, Mr. Cooper stated that he did not abstain from drinking alcohol one hundred percent of the time. Mr. Cooper's driver's license was reinstated less than one month before this trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (12) Any other factors affecting the best interest of the child.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Of concern to the court was Mr. Cooper's 10:00 a.m. to 7 p.m. work schedule. The court also expressed concern over Mr. Cooper's actions in coming home late or staying out all night along with his numerous ATM withdrawals at bars. Text messages and credit card/ATM receipts introduced into evidence confirmed Mr. Cooper's late night activities. Mr. Cooper testified that he only went out late after work or stayed at a friend's house overnight because of the toxic relationship with Ms. Chamberlain. He acknowledged that he does have drinks with friends after work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Our review of the record supports the trial court's determination that the relocation will have positive benefits for the child. We recognize that it is not ideal for the minor child to leave his home and his close family members to move to a new city. However, given the totality of the circumstances, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in finding that the proposed relocation was made in good faith and is in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No. 4 : In the Alternative, Failure to Provide an Adequate Plan of Implementation of Joint Custody.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Cooper makes four separate arguments within this assignment of error, which we discuss separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    The judgment should have set a termination date for the relocation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Mr. Cooper maintains that the February 27, 2018 judgment granted Ms. Chamberlain's motion to relocate, yet the reasons for judgment state that she was\n   granted the right to relocate for a period of one year. Mr. Cooper argued in his motion for new trial that the judgment and reasons for judgment should be consolidated. The April 20, 2018 judgment on the motion for new trial denied that request. We find no error in that ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The trial court properly rendered a judgment and separate reasons of judgment in accordance with La. C.C.P. art. 1918.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, it is well-established that appellate courts review judgments and not reasons for judgments.\n   <em>\n    Wooley v.

Unlike the case cited by Mr. Cooper,\n   <em>\n    LaGraize v. Filson\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1353, (La. App. 4 Cir. 6/3/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6867331\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/171/1047/\">\n    171 So.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the fellowship offered to Ms. Chamberlain was open ended. Ms. Chamberlain testified that she was granted the one-year fellowship with a verbal offer to extend her program pending funding. Thus, the trial court did not err in leaving the relocation open. Furthermore, the April 20, 2018 judgment provides that \"the Court retains the exclusive and ongoing jurisdiction of the custodial arrangement of the minor child.\" Thus, either party can seek modification of the custody arrangement in this jurisdiction if a change in circumstances so warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    The implementation plan does not provide Mr. Cooper frequent and continuing contact with the child.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Cooper argued in his motion for new trial that his summer visitation is insufficient, because out of the ten summer weeks, Ms. Chamberlain has four weeks and he has six. The trial court denied his request for additional summer visitation. However, the trial court awarded Mr. Cooper visitation in alternating years for Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. It further awarded him custody with the minor child in Nashville on any three-day weekend upon providing a 48-hour notice. Finally, Mr. Cooper was allowed to contact the minor child once per day before the child's bedtime via telephone, FaceTime or Skype.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   La. R.S. 9:355(2)(a) provides that \"[T]he implementation order shall allocate the time periods during which each parent shall have physical custody of the child so that the child is assured of frequent and continuing contact with both parents.\" As this Court has recognized, \"[T]he primary goal of joint custody is upheld so long as the non-domiciliary parent is assured of frequent and continuing contact with the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Moreau v.

It is further argued that Ms. Chamberlain should be required to make these trips with the child to ensure that the child has a continuing relationship with Mr. Cooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The implementation order in the present case sets forth the summer vacation and the holiday visitation schedules. The judgment further provides that the parties shall communicate with each other concerning the pick-up and drop-off for the major holidays. Based on the forgoing, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to include the specific details sought by Mr. Cooper. Moreover, the law is clear that Mr. Cooper can seek modification of the custody order if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   iv.\n   <em>\n    The trial court erred in ordering Mr. Cooper to submit to random drug and alcohol screening.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Mr. Cooper avers that he should not be made to submit to drug and alcohol screenings even during the school year when the child may not again be in his custody for months. Considering the record evidence of Mr. Cooper's past issues with drugs and his two prior DUI arrests, we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in rendering this order.

However,\n   <em>\n    Ganaway\n   </em>\n   is clearly inapposite to the present case, and does not support Mr. Cooper's argument. The Ganaways exercised a joint-domiciliary custody arrangement. Ms. Ganaway filed a motion to relocate with the minor child to Texas.

Additionally, for the reasons stated above, we find no error in the designation of Ms. Chamberlain as the domiciliary parent. Finally, we find no error in the trial court's implementation plan, as it provides Mr. Cooper with frequent and continuing contact with the child. Accordingly, we affirm the February 27, 2018 and April 20, 2018 judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   BELSOME, J., CONCURS WITH REASONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   I respectfully concur in the majority's opinion to affirm the trial court's judgment authorizing the relocation of the parties' minor child to Nashville, Tennessee with his mother, Ms. Elizabeth Chamberlain. However, while I hesitantly agree with the result reached in this case, I find that some of the relocation factors weighed heavily in favor of the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As correctly stated by the majority, there are twelve relocation factors to be considered. Eight of the factors were weighed in favor of Ms. Chamberlain; four were found to be either inapplicable or neutral; and none were found to be in favor of Mr. Cooper. Such an analysis belies the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The undisputed evidence reflects the child had a strong paternal family support\n   system in Louisiana, including his father, grandparents, aunts, cousins and extended family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, he also had an established network of school friends. Accordingly, at a minimum, the first two relocation factors concerning significant persons in the child's life and the impact on physical and emotional development weigh in favor of Mr. Cooper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Nevertheless, given the analysis of the other factors, I agree with the majority's finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in authorizing the relocation.
