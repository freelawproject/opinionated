For the reasons herein assigned, we affirm the convictions but vacate the sentences imposed and remand to the trial court for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant, Prince Record, was convicted by a unanimous jury verdict on May 11, 2017, of simple escape, a violation of La.R.S. 14:110, and transactions involving proceeds of drug offenses, a violation of La.R.S. 40:1041. Defendant was originally charged by way of a bill of information with seven counts. He proceeded to trial on only four of the original seven, being one count of distribution of cocaine, one count of possession with the intent to distribute marijuana, one count of simple escape, and one count of transactions involving proceeds from drug offenses. The State voluntarily dismissed the remaining three offenses prior to trial. Defendant was acquitted of the charges of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts leading to his convictions were detailed in his jury trial through multiple witnesses. The Allen Parish Narcotics Team sent an informant to the residence of Defendant on February 19, 2014, to make an illegal narcotics buy from Defendant in an undercover sting operation. The informant was given $ 15.00 in marked bills, a $ 10 bill and a $ 5 bill. The transaction was recorded via audio and video recording devices. Once completed, agents secured the cocaine purchased by the informant and secured a search warrant for the residence in which Defendant was known to stay and an arrest warrant for his arrest. The following day, on February 20, 2014, the agents executed the warrants. At the residence designated in the warrant, they apprehended Defendant and searched the residence. There, they found him in possession of $ 1,300 in cash, including the marked $ 10 bill used in the undercover buy operation. They also found marijuana, drug paraphernalia, and other indicia of involvement in illegal drug sales. Defendant was arrested and handcuffed during the search, but at some point, with handcuffs on, Defendant escaped and fled the scene. Officers could not catch him at the time. He was not apprehended until a year and a half later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the convictions but prior to sentencing, the State filed a multiple offender bill of information charging that Defendant was a third felony offender, having been previously convicted of two separate narcotics offenses. Defendant was adjudicated a third felony offender on September 13, 2017, and written reasons in support of the finding were signed on September 26, 2017, as per the provisions of La.R.S. 15:529.1(D)(3), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court finds that the State proved beyond a reasonable doubt that\n   <strong>\n    Prince Record\n   </strong>\n   was convicted in this Court on August 22, 2011 in the matter of State of Louisiana vs. Prince Record, criminal docket number 2008-3126, for the offenses of Possession with the Intent to Distribute Schedule II, to wit: Cocaine, La. R.S. 40:967(A)(1) and Obstruction of Justice, La. R.S. 14:130.1. Further, defendant was convicted on September 14, 20112 [sic] on September 14, 2012[sic], in this Court in the matter entitled State of Louisiana vs. Prince Record, criminal docket number 2012-1434, for Possession with Intent to Distribute a Schedule II\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Controlled Dangerous Substance, to wit: Cocaine, La. R.S. 40:967(A)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 13, 2017, after finding Defendant a third felony offender, the trial court sentenced Defendant to two and a half years for simple escape and to ten years for transactions involving proceeds from drug offenses, with the sentences to run consecutively to each other and consecutively to any other sentences Defendant was serving at the time. Defendant thereafter filed a pro se notice of appeal in docket number 18-85. This court issued an order on February 6, 2018, remanding the matter for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Defendant was entitled to court-appointed counsel or whether he had made an intelligent and voluntary waiver of counsel after an affirmative showing on the record that the trial court had informed him of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. The trial court found Defendant indigent and appointed counsel at a hearing on April 5, 2018. Defendant has now filed the present appeal, seeking to have his convictions vacated, a new trial ordered, or a remand for the purpose of reconsidering his sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant asserts on appeal three assignments of error, the first two of which are intertwined. Defendant first urges that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of a prospective juror, and alternatively, if the error was not preserved for appeal by objection of trial counsel, Defendant asserts that his convictions should be reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel. He also asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to reconsider his sentences as being untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find that there are errors patent, one involving the jury deliberation process that we will address first and the other involving sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Replacement of Primary Juror with Alternate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the jury retired to deliberate, one of the principal jurors, David Briscoe, became ill and requested to be excused. Because of the nature of the illness, the trial judge granted the request and designated the first alternate juror, Beverly Thomas, to replace Mr. Briscoe. The record does not reflect that the entire jury was brought back to the courtroom during the time of the release of juror Briscoe and the swearing and appointment of alternate juror Thomas to replace him, such that the jury could be instructed to begin its deliberations anew, as prescribed by La.Code Crim.P. art. 789, which states the following regarding the selection and use of alternate jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. The court may direct that not more than six jurors in addition to the regular panel be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors, in the order in which they are called, shall replace jurors who become unable to perform or disqualified from performing their duties. Alternate jurors shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination and challenges for cause, shall take the same oath, and shall have the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as the principal jurors. If the court determines that alternate jurors are desirable in the case, the court shall determine the number to be chosen. The regular peremptory challenges allowed by law shall not be used against the alternate jurors. The court shall determine how many additional peremptory challenges shall be allowed, and each defendant shall have\n   an equal number of such challenges. The state shall have as many peremptory challenges as the defense. The additional peremptory challenges may be used only against alternate jurors. Except in capital cases, an alternate juror who does not replace a principal juror may be discharged when the jury retires to consider its verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   C. If the court, as provided in Paragraph A, replaces a principal juror with an alternate juror after deliberations have begun, the court shall order the jury to begin deliberations anew.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record supports the trial court's finding that juror Briscoe was unable to serve after the jury retired to deliberate and thus the trial court was authorized by La.Code Crim.P. art. 789 to replace juror Briscoe with alternate juror Thomas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7642254\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/446/1197/\">\n    446 So.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1984). There is, however, no indication in the record that the trial court instructed the jury to begin deliberations anew as required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 789(C). Although it appears the alternate juror was appointed near the beginning of the deliberation process, the record is unclear as to whether the jury had already begun deliberating as reflected by the trial courts' following statements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Let the record reflect we will go back into criminal session. We'll continue with the trial in State of Louisiana versus Prince Record, CR-2015-3272. The Court has been advised from the bailiff that Mr. Briscoe, juror number 31, when he was leaving the Courtroom he fell ill and this is just for the record and he was vomiting and was escorted. He tried to continue with deliberations or I guess to begin deliberation and so he was escorted to the restroom by one of the bailiffs. He has continued to throw up, he has soiled his clothes and he's feeling very faint and ill and he does not think that he can continue with deliberations although he tried. So he is requested [sic] from the COURT that he be excused and the COURT will grant that request and order that Alternate # 1, Beverly Thomas, be seated and so we will go ahead and bring Ms. Thomas in and swear her in as a juror and then send her to the jury room for deliberations. Could you bring Ms. Thomas in? ... Okay, Ms. Thomas, please come over here. And you were previously sworn in as an alternate juror. Now we have to swear you in as a juror because you're going to have to go in and participate in deliberations because that other gentlemen [sic] is not able to continue. So please raise your right hand and the clerk will give you your jurors['] oath.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The fourth circuit addressed a similar error in\n   <em>\n    State v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97-1757%20%28La.App.%204%20Cir.%204/7/99%29\">\n    97-1757 (La.App. 4 Cir. 4/7/99)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11607662\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/138/\">\n    732 So.2d 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At some point after the jury retired for deliberations in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , it was discovered that a person chosen for the jury (Ms. Reed) had mistakenly been excused, and a person who had been excused (Ms. Brown) had been seated as a juror.\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11607662\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/732/138/\">\n    732 So.2d at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant was convicted by a margin of 10-2. In a per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court stated: \"The alternate juror's participation in the jury deliberations (as opposed to the alternate juror's mere presence in the jury room) constituted an extraneous influence on the jury. Evidence of this participation established a prima facie case of prejudice to the defendant.\" The Supreme Court reversed the defendant's conviction and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Duplissey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7535393\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/550/590/\">\n    550 So.2d 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1989), the Louisiana Court held that an unauthorized communication to the jury by the bailiff was presumed to be prejudicial when it was about a matter pending before the trial court. The bailiff communicated with the jurors concerning the proper manner for the jurors to conduct deliberations where one juror could not read or write. The Supreme Court found that the State did not show that the unauthorized communication was not prejudicial. The conviction and sentence were reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   In the present case, the incorrect juror who was seated was a juror who was excused by the State. When the defendant moved for a mistrial, the State argued that there was no prejudice to the defendant because the juror had been excused by the State and was acceptable to the defense. Defense counsel, however, pointed out that he did not have an opportunity to object to that prospective juror because the State had already excused her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The record does not indicate how long after the jury retired that it discovered the discrepancy in the verdict slips. The minute entry indicates only that the jury retired at 4:30 p.m. and returned with a verdict at 5:20 p.m. It does not reflect that a juror was replaced. The record does not show that the incorrectly seated juror did not participate in the deliberations until the error was found. The outside influence of the incorrectly seated juror on the jury is presumed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of prejudice to the defendant. However, the State may rebut the presumption by showing\n   the defendant was not harmed. Under the circumstances, the State failed to meet its burden of proving that there was no outside influence of the incorrect juror on the jury during deliberations, and that any outside influence was not prejudicial to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, when the incorrect juror was replaced by the alternate juror, the record does not establish that the trial court ordered the jury to begin the deliberations\n   <strong>\n    anew\n   </strong>\n   as mandated by La.C.Cr.P. art. 789. The only reference in the trial transcript is the statement by the court to the sheriff that he was to replace Ms. Brown with the alternate juror, and once the alternate juror was in place, \"then you can tell the jurors to commence deliberations.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the defendant's conviction and sentence are reversed. The case is remanded for a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   , the instant case does not involve any unauthorized communication with the jury as Mr. Briscoe was properly chosen as a juror and became unable to continue to serve only as a result of an illness. According to the record, Ms. Thomas did not participate in deliberations until she was sworn in as a juror. Thus, this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   in that the only error that occurred in the present case was the trial court's failure to instruct the jurors to begin deliberations anew. Further, the error in the present case has not been directly raised on appeal, and no motion for mistrial was made in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While we can find no case where this error has been recognized as an error patent, this court has, however, addressed a comparable error patent in the trial court's failure to sequester the jury. In\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, Defendant did not object at trial for failure to sequester, and he did not assign this issue on appeal. Nevertheless, this court has recognized this error as an error patent and applied the harmless error analysis. [\n   <em>\n    State v.

Additionally, Defendant fails to assign this error in his appeal, and he fails to allege or prove any prejudice suffered by this possible error. Accordingly, we conclude that this error is harmless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Likewise, Defendant in the present case did not assert any objection as to the alternate juror in the trial court, does not assign any such issue on appeal, and does not allege any prejudice resulting from the\n   issue. Further, we find no prejudice to Defendant here. The minutes of court from May 11, 2018, reflect that the jury retired to deliberate at 6:02 p.m. and that at 6:10 p.m. the court was advised that primary juror Briscoe \"fell ill, began to vomit, could not continue with deliberations, and has requested to be excused\" which request was granted. The trial court thereafter swore alternate juror Thomas in and sent her to deliberate with the remaining jurors, also at 6:10 p.m. Thus, the original jury had only been in the jury room to begin deliberations for a total of eight minutes during which time juror Briscoe was ill, vomiting, and could not continue. Alternate juror Thomas was not in the jury room participating during those eight minutes. At 7:26 p.m. the jury returned its verdict of not guilty of counts one and two, and guilty of count three, simple escape, and count four, transactions involving proceeds from drug offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We find that any error that occurred by the failure to instruct the jury to begin deliberations anew to be harmless error. This court has previously determined that the improper replacement of a primary juror with an alternate juror, for reasons unrelated to illness, disability, or death, was structural in nature and not subject to a harmless error analysis.

However, on appeal, Defendant further complains of Ms. Monk's association to law enforcement in addition to her friendship with the Johnsons. As per the rational set forth in\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364728\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/220/583/#p663\">\n    220 So.3d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Defendant did not preserve any argument about Ms. Monk's association with law enforcement at trial.

Applying this penalty provision to the offense of a transaction involving drug proceeds, third habitual offender, Defendant would have faced a mandatory life sentence - both the sentence being enhanced (transaction involving drug proceeds) and the two prior felonies (possession with the intent to distribute cocaine committed on January 30, 2007 and possession with the intent to distribute cocaine committed on May 11, 2010) were violations of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Law punishable by ten years or more. Thus, under the habitual offender penalty provision in effect at the time Defendant committed a transaction involving drug proceeds, Defendant's sentence of 10 years would be illegally lenient.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Under the amended version, Defendant's sentence for simple escape, third habitual offender, is subject to a minimum term of imprisonment of 2.5 years and a maximum term of imprisonment of 5 years. Thus, Defendant's sentence of 2.5 years is legal. As for Defendant's sentence for a transaction involving drug proceeds, third habitual offender, the November 1, 2017 amendment drastically reduced Defendant's sentencing exposure by removing persons with a current and prior felony conviction under the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance law from the group of persons subject to a life sentence. Under the amended version, Defendant's sentence for a transaction involving drug proceeds, third habitual offender, is subject to a minimum term of imprisonment of five years and a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Thus, Defendant's sentence of 10 years for a transaction involving drug proceeds, third habitual offender, is a legal sentence under the November 2017 amendment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
