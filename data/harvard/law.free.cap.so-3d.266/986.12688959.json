Richard Gerald Jordan was sentenced to death following his conviction on charges of kidnapping and murdering Edwina Marter in 1976. In his Second Successive Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, Jordan challenges the Mississippi Department of Corrections' (MDOC) using midazolam as the first drug in its three-drug lethal-injection protocol. According to Jordan, midazolam does not meet the requirements set forth in Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51(1) (Supp. 2018), which directs MDOC to use \"an appropriate anesthetic or sedative\" as the first drug. Because Jordan failed to provide sufficient support to warrant an evidentiary hearing, his petition is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In January 1976, Jordan traveled to Gulfport, contacted a local bank, and asked to speak with a loan officer. After Jordan spoke with Charles Marter, the loan officer, Jordan found Marter's home address in a phone book and went to Marter's home. Pretending to be a phone-company employee, Jordan entered Marter's home. Marter's wife, Edwina Marter, and their three-year-old child were home. Jordan abducted\n   Edwina from the home and forced her to drive to a secluded area in the DeSoto National Forest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Jordan fatally shot Edwina in the back of the head. He then called Charles, informed Charles that he had kidnapped Edwina, and requested $25,000 in ransom. Jordan assured Charles that Edwina was alive and concerned for her children. After multiple attempts, Jordan retrieved the ransom money. He was arrested the following day. Jordan confessed to the crime and told investigators where to find Edwina's body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. A jury convicted Jordan of capital murder in 1976. Shortly thereafter, the law of capital trials changed, requiring separate trials for the guilt and sentence phases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregg v.

He raised two issues: (1) whether the State's use of midazolam as part of the three-drug lethal-injection protocol violated Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51 because it is not an \"ultra-short acting barbiturate or other similar drug,\" and (2) whether execution of an inmate more than forty years after he was first sentenced to death violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. At the time Jordan filed his petition, Section 99-19-51 required MDOC to use an \"ultra-short acting barbiturate or other similar drug\" as the first drug of the lethal-injection protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11. While the petition was pending before this Court, the Mississippi Legislature amended Section 99-19-51.

Code Ann. 99-19-51(1) (Supp. 2018). Due to the amendment, this Court concluded that Jordan's statutory-based challenge was moot and \"decline[d] to address whether midazolam is or is not a permissible drug under the current statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12384592\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/224/1252/\">\n    224 So.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although it did not address the state-law-based challenge presented here, the Supreme Court rejected squarely the substance of Jordan's argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2741-42 (low doses of midazolam are sufficient to induce unconsciousness and are even sometimes used as the sole relevant drug in certain medical procedures). The Court reasoned,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Petitioners emphasize that midazolam is not recommended or approved for use as the sole anesthetic during painful surgery, but there are two reasons why this is not dispositive. First, as the District Court found, the 500-milligram dose at issue here \"is many times higher than a normal therapeutic dose of midazolam.\" The effect of a small dose of midazolam has minimal probative value about the effect of a 500-milligram dose. Second, the fact that a low dose of midazolam is not the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   drug for maintaining unconsciousness during surgery says little about whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is\n   <em>\n    constitutionally adequate\n   </em>\n   for purposes of conducting an execution. We recognized this point in\n   <em>\n    Baze\n   </em>\n   , where we concluded that although the medical standard of care might require the use of a blood pressure cuff and an electrocardiogram during surgeries, this does not mean those procedures are required for an execution to pass Eighth Amendment scrutiny.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2742 (emphasis in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20. Moreover, the Court also rejected the Oklahoma petitioners' argument based on midazolam's\"ceiling effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2742-44. In sum, the petitioners argued \"that midazolam has a 'ceiling' above which any increase in dosage produces no effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2743. The Supreme Court concluded that \"the mere fact that midazolam has such a ceiling cannot be dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, \"[t]he relevant question here is whether midazolam's ceiling effect occurs below the level of a 500-mg dose and at a point at which the drug does not have the effect of rendering a person insensate to pain caused by the second and third drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court found the petitioners provided little probative evidence and that the evidence they did present was speculative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For example, one of the petitioners' experts conceded that he \"was unable to determine the midazolam dose for a ceiling effect on unconsciousness because there is no literature in which such testing has been done.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 21. Here, Dr. Stevens sets forth the same assertion in his affidavit. And, like the evidence presented in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Stevens does not cite probative support for his conclusion. Instead, he relies on non-human studies and calculations that admittedly cannot be confirmed in human trials. Further, Dr. Stevens focuses his complaint about midazolam, in part, on the fact that it is an not an \"anesthetic.\" The statute clearly calls for an \"appropriate anesthetic\n   <em>\n    or sedative\n   </em>\n   \" in phase one of the lethal-injection protocol.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-51\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 99-19-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (emphasis added). As pointed out by Dr. Antognini, \"midazolam can result in unconsciousness, coma, respiratory arrest, and death, ... especially at greater doses.\" The dose prescribed in MDOC's lethal-injection protocol-500-milligrams of midazolam-is about one hundred to two hundred times the normal therapeutic dose. According to Dr. Antognini, \"a person given 500 mg midazolam would be rendered completely unconscious and insensate to pain and noxious stimuli.\" Thus, \"there is only an exceedingly small risk that a person administered a 500 mg dose of midazolam would experience any pain ... as a result of ... the administration of\n   drug, including vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 22. Finally, Mississippi's lethal-injection statute and protocol are comparable with other states' protocols.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2739-40 (\"numerous courts have concluded that the use of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug protocol is likely to render an inmate insensate to pain that might result from administration of the paralytic agent and potassium chloride\"). As the Fifth Circuit recognized in Jordan's \u00a7 1983 action,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Mississippi's statutory requirements and the associated lethal injection protocol are not \"atypical ... in relation to the ordinary\" in comparison with other states' execution protocols. The three-drug protocol and the particular drugs Mississippi proposes to use (midazolam, a paralytic, and potassium chloride ) are typical for those states that use lethal injection and were recently upheld in the face of a constitutional challenge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919349\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/805/\">\n    823 F.3d at 811-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2735 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23. After considering Jordan's petition and Dr. Stevens's supporting affidavits, along with\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , we find that Jordan has failed to set forth sufficient evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing. Jordan has failed to provide credible evidence to support the contention that midazolam does not meet the statutory requirements in Mississippi Code Section 99-19-51(1). Therefore, Jordan's Second Successive Petition for Post-Conviction Relief is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24.\n   <strong>\n    SECOND SUCCESSIVE PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF IS DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   RANDOLPH, P.J., COLEMAN, MAXWELL, BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND ISHEE, JJ., CONCUR.

The sole issue in this case is whether Richard Jordan is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his petition for post-conviction relief. This Court need not and should not reach the merits of his petition, because he is entitled to an evidentiary hearing in the trial court. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 26. As the majority acknowledges, the parties disagree about whether a 500-milligram dose of midazolam is an \"appropriate anaesthetic or sedative\" that will render Jordan \"unconscious, so that the execution process should not entail a substantial risk of severe pain\" pursuant to state statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2099-19-51\">\n    Miss.

Jordan presents two affidavits from Dr. Craig Stevens to support his argument that midazolam is incapable of rendering an inmate unconscious and insensate to pain. The State presents Dr. Richard Antognini's affidavit, in which he opines that 500 milligrams of midazolam will render an inmate \"completely unconscious and insensate to pain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 27.

Jordan frames the issue as a \"simple matter of enforcing the statutory command.\" He clarifies that the instant petition does not raise an Eighth Amendment method-of-execution challenge, but that it is grounded solely in state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 29. The majority of cases that discuss midazolam address constitutional arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glossip v. Gross\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2739-40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Here, the majority argues that\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   is instructive to the state-law claim at issue. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , however, was not presented with a state-law based claim; instead, it considered whether midazolam violates the Eighth Amendment. The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   were on death row in Oklahoma.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591161\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2726/\">\n    at 2735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast to section 99-19-51's requirement that the State of Mississippi use \"an appropriate anesthetic or sedative[,]\" Oklahoma's statute does not contain a specific directive. Oklahoma's statute provides, \"The punishment of death shall be carried out by the administration of a lethal quantity of a drug or drugs until death is pronounced by a licensed physician according to accepted standards of medical practice.\" Okla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1014. Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   was not dispositive regarding midazolam; the district court found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction because their claims did not have a substantial likelihood of success; the Supreme Court affirmed this decision, but did not rule that the plaintiffs also should lose the substantive case.\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2736, 2746. And, importantly, the Supreme Court was reviewing a more developed record including testimony and documents, not simply affidavits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2735. It did not itself weight the expert opinions, as the majority inappropriately does; rather, it found that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in its conclusion regarding midazolam after the trial court held a three-day evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2739. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   is not dispositive regarding whether an evidentiary hearing is warranted on a state-law claim. Indeed, a thorough evidentiary hearing did occur in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , providing the Supreme Court with an adequate record and allowing the district court to decide evidentiary matters and\n   matters of credibility. The majority even goes so far as to chastise Dr. Stevens for failing to cite \"probative support\" for his conclusion that he was unable to determine the ceiling effect for midazolam. Maj. Op. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. However, the majority denies Jordan the very evidentiary hearing in which he would have the opportunity to present \"probative support.\" Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court specifically held that the lack of research on non-therapeutic doses of midazolam applies equally to both parties' cases, noting that \"because a 500-milligram dose is never administered for a therapeutic purpose, extrapolation was reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Glossip\n   </em>\n   , 135 S.Ct. at 2741.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30. Jordan provides a Montana case which addresses a similar deviation-from-state-law challenge, and distinguishes such a claim from a constitutional challenge.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.
