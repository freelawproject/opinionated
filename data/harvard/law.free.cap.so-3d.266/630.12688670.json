During the early morning hours of September 19, 2010, N.B., a sophomore at the University of Southern Mississippi, was kidnapped and brutally raped by Howard Payton, a/k/a \"Lil Dank,\" a/k/a \"Supreme.\" N.B. testified that Payton ran up to her vehicle, put a box cutter or knife to her throat, and said, \"where is the [expletive] money?\" N.B. told Payton that she did not have any money. Payton told her, \"quit [expletive] lying. Where is the money?\" Payton grabbed N.B.'s neck, pushed her head down, and shoved her over to the passenger's seat. Payton sat in the driver's seat of N.B.'s vehicle and drove her to a remote location. Payton then forced N.B. to perform oral sex. N.B. began to cry and begged Payton to let her go, but he told her to stop complaining and to \"just do it.\" Payton then pulled N.B. out of the car and\n   forced her to perform oral sex until she vomited on him. Payton forced N.B. to lick her vomit off of him. Payton then put on a condom and raped N.B. vaginally. Payton attempted to rape N.B. anally, but again penetrated her vaginally. After that, Payton removed the condom and forced N.B. to perform oral sex again. Payton ejaculated in N.B.'s mouth and forced her to swallow his ejaculate, \"because he didn't want any proof.\" He then forced her to remove her clothing and to lie on the ground. Payton told N.B. that if she told anyone about what he had just done, he would kill her. Payton then took N.B.'s tank top and her glasses, got back into N.B.'s car, and left. N.B. was left alone in the dark in an unfamiliar location. N.B. found a nearby road and walked to a stoplight. She was able to flag down two women who were driving by. The women drove N.B. to the hospital. On the way to the hospital, N.B. called 911 to report what had just occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62. At the June 2014 term, a duly empaneled, sworn, and charged grand jury comprised of citizens of Lamar County returned an indictment\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   charging Payton for the kidnapping and rape of N.B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63. At trial,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the State presented definitive scientific evidence of guilt. Payton's DNA matched the DNA sample obtained from N.B.'s rape kit so closely that the probability of finding someone other than Payton with the same DNA profile was less than one in 999 trillion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   A petit jury comprised of twelve citizens of Lamar County found Payton guilty as charged. Upon his conviction, a duly elected circuit judge sentenced Payton as a habitual offender\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a thirty-year term for kidnapping and three forty-year (less one day) terms for each rape count. The order of conviction, which was signed by the trial judge and filed on January 7, 2016, provided that the sentences were to be served consecutively. The same day, the trial judge signed an order transporting Payton to the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections in Rankin County immediately. According to Uniform Rule of Circuit and County Court Practice 10.05, which was in place at that time, any post-trial motion for a new trial was to be filed within ten days. URCCC 10.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64. It was not until January 25, 2016, that Payton filed a twelve-page pro se motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), or, in the alternative, a new trial. The State did not raise the untimeliness of the motion. In fact, the State did not respond to the motion. The trial judge considered the substantive issues raised in the motion and, finding no merit, denied Payton's requests for relief one week later on February 1, 2016. However, the order was not file stamped until February 4, 2016. Upon entry of that order, Payton's notice of appeal was to be filed within thirty days. Miss. R. App. P. 4(e). On the same day that the trial judge signed the order denying Payton's post-trial\n   motion, Payton signed a request for a copy of the trial court transcript. However, Payton's request was not file stamped until February 5, 2016. Payton's request for the trial transcript was granted by the trial court without contest by the State on February 12, 2016. It was not file stamped until February 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65. The record reflects five filings by Payton on Monday, February 29, 2016: (1) notice of appeal; (2) application to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   ; (3) designation of the record; (4) certificate of compliance; and (5) motion for appointment of counsel. Each of these filings included its own certificate of service to the circuit clerk of Lamar County, the Lamar County District Attorney's Office, and the Lamar County circuit judge certifying that they were mailed on February 29, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Payton's application for\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status was sworn and subscribed before notary Jessica Pearl Sellers on February 29, 2016. Without explanation, these filings were not file stamped by the circuit clerk until Wednesday, March 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66. On March 9, 2016, the trial court granted Payton\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   status for this appeal. It was not file stamped until March 10, 2016. The trial judge also signed an order on March 9, 2016 appointing Payton counsel. That order was not file stamped until March 14, 2016. The State did not contest either filing. Under the trial court's order, the State provided Payton counsel via the Indigent Appeals Division of the Office of the State Public Defender. George T. Holmes entered an appearance on Payton's behalf. A few days before Payton's appeal brief was due, Payton died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67. Holmes then filed a suggestion of death. Holmes subsequently pleaded that no substitution of parties had been requested and that Payton had no known personal representative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holmes then moved for abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . He asked that the Court allow a thirty-day period or other reasonable amount of time to allow any personal representative of Payton to come forward and to move for a substitution for the deceased appellant. Holmes requested, if no such motion was made, that the Court enter an order of abatement voiding the entire criminal proceeding against Payton from its inception, nullifying the petit jury's verdict and the circuit judge's judgment of conviction and remanding the case back to the same trial court with instructions to dismiss the grand jury's indictment, all without notice to the victim, N.B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68. No response was filed either to the suggestion of death or to the motion for abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . A single-justice order was entered staying briefing for a period of thirty days to allow any personal representative of Payton to move for substitution. No attempt to substitute was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69. The Court considered the motion for abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   en banc on February 8, 2018, and authorized the issuance of a single-justice order requiring supplemental briefing \"[d]ue to the uniqueness of the petition, the seeking of extraordinary relief\n   and the development of constitutional and statutory law since this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Gollott v.

Moreover, we find that the policies undergirding stare decisis-consistency and definiteness in the law-are not served by continued application of the abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine.

To be clear, today's decision does not minimize the rights exercised by Payton under the Mississippi Constitution. Article 3, section 26 provides that the accused shall have the right (1) to be heard by himself or counsel, or both; (2) to demand the nature and cause of the accusation; (3) to be confronted by the witnesses against him; (4) to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; (5) to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the county where the offense was committed; and (6) not to be compelled to give evidence against himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b630. In this case, over the course of the trial-court proceedings, the circuit judge appointed four different attorneys to represent Payton. Payton ultimately chose to proceed pro se, with two lawyers appointed to serve as his legal advisors. During trial, Payton was confronted by the victim, and Payton personally cross-examined her. Payton was granted the right to send the DNA evidence to a lab of his own choosing, at the State's expense, to retest his own DNA. Payton was additionally appointed his own DNA expert, paid for by the citizens of Lamar County. The trial court accommodated Payton's every request concerning DNA testing, until Payton ultimately refused to provide another DNA sample.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Payton additionally received his right to a speedy trial and an impartial jury, and he was not compelled to give evidence against himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b631. Payton was accorded each and every right guaranteed him under the Constitution. Yet now, we are asked to ignore N.B.'s constitutional right \"to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect ....\" Miss. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 26A. We decline to do so. Because our Constitution balances the rights of the accused with the rights of the victim, we-as guardians of the Constitution-can do no less.

Two states have unique approaches; Alabama places a particular notation in the deceased defendants record, while Oregon gives judges discretion both to dismiss the appeal and to vacate the judgment. Eight states allow some mechanism for the appeal to continue with substitution; if no substitution occurs some of those states abate the conviction while others allow it to stand.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    <em>\n     Carlin v.

This appeal should be dismissed as untimely; but because this Court reaches the merits of the issue of what procedure to employ when a convicted defendant dies while the appeal is pending and no one moves to substitute, I believe that this Court should address each appeal on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b636. Payton filed an untimely notice of appeal. The Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that \"[a]n appeal\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be dismissed if the notice of appeal was not timely filed pursuant to Rules 4 or 5.\" Miss. R. App. P. 2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In criminal cases, this Court may suspend that rule \"[i]n the interest of expediting decision, or for other good cause shown[.]\" Miss. R. App. P. 2(c). Because dismissing this appeal accomplishes the same result as the majority reaches on the merits, I do not find any \"good cause shown\" for suspending the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure and allowing this untimely appeal. Nor does allowing the untimely appeal expedite any decision, as dismissing the appeal would be the more expeditious procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b637. Alternatively, because the Court does reach the merits, I disagree with the all-or-nothing approach the majority and our caselaw employ. The majority bases its decision to overrule\n   <em>\n    Gollott\n   </em>\n   and the abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine primarily on a recognition of crime victims' rights. While I completely agree with the majority that crime victims' rights should certainly be part of our analysis in these cases, I do not agree that those rights\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   mandate dismissing an appeal as moot when a defendant has died and no substitution has been made. For example, how do crime victims' rights outweigh a defendants' rights in the case of a victimless crime such as possession of a small amount of marijuana? The majority fails to address how victims' rights\n   <em>\n    automatically\n   </em>\n   outweigh those of the defendant and/or his heirs in a victimless crime. For this reason, I believe we should determine the appropriate course in the rare instance when a convicted defendant dies pending appeal and no substitution is made on a case-by-case basis. A case-by-case approach would strike the appropriate balance between the rights of victims and defendants, instead of automatically applying either abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   or dismissing the appeal as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b638. Rule 43(a) of our Rules of Appellate Procedure provides for substitution when a party dies pending appeal. Miss. R. App. P. 43(a). However, \"[i]f the deceased party has no representative, any party may suggest the death on the record and proceedings\n   shall then be had\n   <em>\n    as the appropriate appellate court may direct\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6990039\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/249/752/#p754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). This Court need not adopt a bright line rule for these cases; our Rules allow us to make an appropriate determination in each case. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Gollott\n   </em>\n   correctly observed that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [T]here are valid policy considerations in favor of both the abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   doctrine and our present law in the area [dismissing the appeal as moot and leaving the conviction intact], as well as problems with each. Upon the death of a defendant pending appeal, it is no more reasonable to deem the appeal moot and let the conviction stand, acting as though we have heard the appellant's arguments and found them meritless, than it is to automatically follow the abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   rule and pretend the defendant was never indicted, tried and found guilty.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Gollott v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468889\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/646/1297/#p1299\">\n    646 So.2d 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1303-04 (Miss. 1994). Our rules do not demand an all-or-nothing approach, nor does justice require that we adopt an all-or-nothing approach in these uncommon situations. This Court should determine whether abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   or dismissing the appeal as moot is the appropriate action in each individual case. In doing so, this Court should consider, and the parties should present, relevant arguments describing with particularity the rights of the victim or victims impacted, the defendant's constitutional rights impacted, the collateral effects on the defendant's estate or heirs, and any other relevant issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b639. I believe that this Court should exercise judicial restraint and dismiss this appeal as untimely under Mississippi Rule of Appellate Procedure 2(a)(1). However, because this Court reaches the merits of the abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   issue, I believe we should abandon the bright line rules of\n   <em>\n    Gollott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haines\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , and adopt a measured case-by-case analysis regarding whether dismissing a case as moot or abatement\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the present case, I agree that dismissing the appeal as moot is appropriate; given that Payton did not timely file his post-trial motions or his appeal, I fail to see how dismissing his appeal as moot would infringe upon his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   KITCHENS, P.J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Of course, to avoid such a case-by-case review, the State or the attorney for the defendant may move for substitution.
