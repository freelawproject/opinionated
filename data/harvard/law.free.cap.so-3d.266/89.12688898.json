R. Crim. P. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 23, 1998, Acklin was convicted of one count of capital murder for killing Charles Lamar Hemphill, Michael A. Beaudette, Johnny Couch, and Brian Carter pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(10), Ala. Code 1975, and two counts of attempted murder as to Ashley Rutherford and Michelle Hayden,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13A-6-2 and \u00a7 13A-4-2, Ala. Code 1975. The trial court sentenced Acklin to consecutive sentences of 20 years' imprisonment for his convictions for attempted murder. As to his conviction for capital murder, the jury recommended, by a vote of 10-2, that Acklin be sentenced to death; the trial court accepted that recommendation and sentenced Acklin to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In Acklin's direct appeal, we quoted the following relevant facts of the underlying crimes from the trial court's sentencing order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \" 'Late on the night of September 25, 1996, Nicholas Bernard Acklin and two companions, all heavily armed, entered the home of Ashley Rutherford on University Drive in Huntsville, Madison County, Alabama. Acklin, Joseph Wilson, and Corey Johnson held seven people at gunpoint in a 13' x 18' room and, for nearly two hours, assaulted, tortured, and humiliated them. Then, shortly before midnight, Acklin and Wilson fired 19 rounds of 9mm ammunition, shooting 6 of the 7 victims in or about the head. Four of the six victims died, two survived the shooting, and one victim escaped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \" 'The events giving rise to these slayings occurred approximately one week before the murders took place. At this time, Joseph (\"Joey\") Wilson and Corey\n   Johnson, while visiting the home of Ashley Rutherford, stole a cellular telephone and a small bag of marijuana. The theft of the cellular telephone prompted Rutherford and the owner of the phone, Lamar Hemphill, to file a police report with the Huntsville Police Department. As a result of the police report being filed, Wilson was questioned by the police regarding the theft of the phone. Once Wilson learned that a police report had been filed, he became angry. On the night of September 25, 1996, Wilson, Acklin, and Johnson went to Ashley Rutherford's home seeking revenge against those persons they deemed responsible for filing the report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \" 'Early in the evening of September 25, 1996, Ashley Rutherford's fiancee (Michelle Hayden) and two of his friends (Brian Carter and Lamar Hemphill) sat in Rutherford's garage apartment watching television and awaiting Rutherford's return from work. Later, Michael Beaudette, another friend of Ashley Rutherford, arrived and joined Hayden, Carter, and Hemphill in watching television and socializing. At approximately 10:00 p.m., Mike Skirchak and Johnny Couch, while driving past Rutherford's home on University Drive, noticed Michael Beaudette's car and decided to stop and talk for awhile with Beaudette and the others. At approximately 10:05 p.m., Skirchak and Couch decided to leave. As the two young men exited Rutherford's home, they were met by Nicholas Acklin, Joey Wilson, and Corey Johnson, who forced them back inside the garage apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \" 'Once inside the apartment, Acklin, Wilson, and Johnson began asking repeatedly, \"Who filled out the warrant?\" When no one would give them a satisfactory answer, they brandished handguns and began physically assaulting Skirchak, Couch, Beaudette, Carter, and Hemphill. Specifically, these five young men were kicked, slapped, punched, spat on, and beaten with a whiskey bottle by Wilson and Johnson. A few times during these assaults, Acklin took Michelle Hayden outside and made sexual advances towards her. Acklin fondled Hayden's breasts and repeatedly asked her to pull down her pants. After approximately an hour of the aforementioned behavior, Ashley Rutherford arrived home from work and he was immediately confronted by Johnson, who forced him into the apartment. Once inside, Rutherford was also interrogated about the police report. He, too, was beaten and threatened. In fact, as the night progressed, two of the three assailants, Nicholas Acklin and Joey Wilson, grew increasingly violent and more demeaning. For example, Acklin placed a .357 magnum revolver in Rutherford's mouth and shoved it into his throat until Rutherford gagged. Acklin also placed Michael Beaudette in a headlock and placed the same .357 magnum revolver under his chin. Wilson kicked and stomped Johnny Couch until he was almost unconscious and then cut his ponytail off with a pair of scissors. A short while after this incident, Acklin made Michelle Hayden accompany him outside while he stole Brian Carter's car stereo from Carter's car. When Acklin returned to the overcrowded apartment, he threw a pocket-knife at Brian Carter's feet. Then, Acklin turned to Wilson, who was holding a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic handgun and proclaimed, \"Look, he has a knife!\" Both Acklin and Wilson continued humiliating the victims by making them do self-degrading things, such as take off their pants and sit exposed in their underwear. At one point in the evening, Wilson placed his handgun on a dresser and dared anyone\n   to try and grab it. Furthermore, following one of the several occasions that Acklin took Michelle Hayden outside, Acklin went back inside the apartment and told her fiance, Ashley Rutherford, that his girlfriend had just performed oral sex on him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \" 'As the night progressed, all seven victims asserted that they did not know anything about a warrant being filed against Wilson. However, Rutherford and Hemphill did admit to their attackers that a police report had been filed for the stolen cellular phone, but no one had sworn out a warrant. Despite the assertions by Rutherford and Hemphill, as well as from the others, the anger of both Acklin and Wilson rose to a dangerous crescendo. Just before midnight, Acklin and Wilson made all seven victims give them their driver's licenses and identification cards. At this point, Corey Johnson tried to calm Acklin and Wilson down by telling them that the victims were not going to talk and that they didn't have to shoot anyone. Unfortunately, Acklin and Wilson ignored Johnson and began shouting for someone to go and start the car. After yelling back and forth to each other to go start the car, Acklin finally left Wilson inside and went to start Wilson's car. At this point, Wilson was holding the seven victims at gunpoint and demanding that someone tell him who filed what he claimed was a warrant against him. When Acklin returned from outside, he was holding one of the two Lorcin 9mm handguns that had been tucked in his waistband earlier that night. As Wilson continued to demand answers to his questions, Acklin proclaimed, \"Fuck it,\" and placed the Lorcin 9mm against the back of Ashley Rutherford's head and fired. Then, in a methodical manner, as each of the other victims sat and watched, Acklin shot Lamar Hemphill once in the head, shot Johnny Couch twice in the head, shot Michael Beaudette once in the head and once in the upper leg, and shot Michelle Hayden in the side of her face, in her arm, and in her abdomen.... Joey Wilson shot Brian Carter six times in the neck and chest.... Mike Skirchak ran out of the back door of the apartment without any gunshot wounds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \" 'After having fired 19 rounds of ammunition inside the apartment, Acklin, Wilson, and Johnson fled. Ashley Rutherford, the first person shot by Acklin, laid in a pool of his own blood and pretended to be dead until he was sure that his attackers had left the apartment. Once he knew that they were gone, Rutherford left the garage apartment and went into the main part of the house to get help from his grandmother. After he told his grandmother to call an ambulance, Rutherford went back to assist his fiancee Hayden, who was lying in the doorway leading to the main part of the house. At approximately 12:30 a.m., Madison County emergency medical technicians arrived on the scene and determined that Michael Beaudette, Brian Carter, and Johnny Couch were already dead. Michelle Hayden was alive, but critically wounded, and Lamar Hemphill died minutes after medical technicians arrived.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Acklin v.

It is almost impossible to contemplate the fear and indeed the stark terror experienced by all of these victims on the night of September 25, 1996. After being repeatedly threatened, taunted, beaten and (in Hayden's case) sexually assaulted, Acklin and Wilson began shouting for someone to go and start the car.

Most killers are typically the products of poverty, a dysfunctional family, physical or sexual abuse and/or social deprivation. Acklin was the product of a loving middle-class family. Acklin was exposed to all of the values that are central to an ordered society; however, he chose to reject them.

Acklin even had a half-smile or smirk on his face when the Court was sentencing him to death. The defendant glared at each of the witnesses with a gaze that was devoid of emotion.

Acklin does not address any claims that were summarily dismissed, nor does he raise all the claims that were designated for the evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, we address only those issues Acklin raises on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Acklin's primary claim is that his trial counsel were ineffective due to an alleged financial conflict of interest. (Acklin's brief, p. 13.) To examine this claim, a brief background is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Acklin was represented at his trial by Behrouz Rahmati and Kevin Gray.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence at the Rule 32 hearing indicated that Rahmati agreed to represent Acklin after he met with Acklin's mother, Velma Acklin Evans (\"Velma\"), and Acklin's father, Theodis Acklin (\"Theodis\"), in September 1996, a few days after the offenses occurred. Velma signed an agreement with Rahmati providing for a $25,000 retainer and an hourly rate of $150 per hour. At that time, Rahmati and Gray were not partners, but Gray eventually began assisting Rahmati on the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At the time Rahmati was retained, he knew that Velma and Theodis were divorced. Regarding his $25,000 retainer and Velma's ability to pay him, Rahmati testified that it was \"obvious from Day 1\" that Velma was in \"financial distress\" and Rahmati\n   \"suspected strongly [that he and Gray] were never going to get paid.\" (R. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   During Rahmati's testimony, Acklin introduced billing statements and \"monthly billing\" letters from Rahmati's law firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That evidence, along with Rahmati's testimony, indicated that Velma paid several monthly payments of around $100 toward the retainer, for a total of about $1,900. Regarding these monthly payments, Rahmati testified that in his experience, when a parent of a client makes monthly payments of $100 to $200, \"that's a very strong signal they can't afford paying.\" (R. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The evidence also indicated that by the time of Acklin's October 1998 trial, Theodis had made three sporadic payments totaling $2,900. (R. 80.) Those three payments of $700, $2,000, and $200 occurred in March 1998, September 1998, and October 1998, respectively. Rahmati testified that he did not know what convinced Theodis to pay toward the retainer, but he said that based on his interactions with Theodis, Velma, and Acklin, he did not think Theodis was \"really trying as hard\" as Velma to help with Acklin's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The record indicates that, based on billing statements, trial counsel spent more than 400 hours preparing for Acklin's trial. On June 1, 1998, Rahmati submitted a letter to the trial judge, along with an affidavit indicating that Acklin was indigent, in which Rahmati sought to be appointed as counsel. A few days later, Rahmati withdrew the request, in part because Gray, who had not been practicing law for five years, could not have been appointed to assist with Acklin's defense. Rahmati testified that, at the time, Alabama law imposed a statutory cap on the amount of money an appointed attorney could be paid in a capital case. Rahmati also testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \"A. I consciously decided to withdraw my request for appointment for various reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Q. But on that June 1st, 1998 request to be appointed, you weren't seeking to have all counsel removed entirely, new counsel to be appointed to Mr. Acklin, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \"A. No. It would have been a situation of me staying in as counsel and asking the Court to appoint a co-counsel of my choosing. Thank God, Judge Smith was kind enough, if I recall-if I recall, I think he would have appointed whoever I asked to be appointed. But then I withdrew my request to be appointed because, truly, I would have rather have Kevin Gray to stay as my co-counsel because of-I just knew how much he was putting into the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \"And furthermore, [Acklin] himself specifically requested that Kevin and I stay in the case, and I want to say perhaps his mom did as well, but I can't remember. I can't remember about his father. You have to understand, sir, at that point it wasn't necessarily about the money anymore.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (R. 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In preparing for Acklin's trial, both Rahmati and Gray testified that they felt relatively certain they would need to be prepared for a penalty phase, and they began preparing for that phase in advance of the trial. Trial counsel were in consistent contact with Acklin and his family, and they interviewed several potential character witnesses, many of whom testified during the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The record indicates that trial counsel knew Acklin allegedly had used alcohol\n   and marijuana at the time of the crimes. Counsel consulted experts about the possible effects those substances could have had on Acklin, particularly because he was a diabetic. Counsel also examined a report of a forensic psychological evaluation performed on Acklin. Ultimately, however, counsel determined that, in their opinion, none of the information from the experts or the evaluation would have been beneficial to Acklin in either the guilt phase or the penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Counsel also testified that they asked Acklin and his parents about Acklin's childhood but that they were not told anything remarkable or out of the ordinary. On October 17, 1998-two days before Acklin's trial was to begin-Velma met alone with Rahmati, however, and told Rahmati that Theodis had perpetrated severe abuse against her and their children, including Acklin. This abuse, according to Velma's testimony at the evidentiary hearing, became very intense when Velma told Theodis she had had an affair. In 1982, within a year of the disclosure of the affair, Velma and Theodis were divorced, and Theodis was given full custody of the couple's three sons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, Velma and her son Steve Acklin testified about the abuse. The abuse included multiple allegations of Theodis threatening Velma and the children with a gun. Velma testified that Theodis \"would have a gun in his hand, and he would be shaking it, and he would just shove it down [her] mouth.\" (R. 219.) Acklin and his brothers \"would be screaming, telling their dad not to hurt their mom.\" (R. 220.) Velma also testified that she once fell from a second-floor window during a fight with Theodis over a rifle, which resulted in her being hospitalized. (R. 225-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Rahmati testified that, when he first learned of the abuse two days before Acklin's trial, he \"was very surprised that they never disclosed those details to us, even though we had discussed, with the whole family that we could talk to, with the exception of the brothers [who, Rahmati thought, were incarcerated].\" Once he learned of the abuse, Rahmati talked to Theodis. Rahmati testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \"Q. What did you say to [Theodis] after Velma told you about the abuse?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \"A. I told [Theodis] that I had learned about the-or that [Velma] had told us about the physical and the mental abuse, more or less at his hands to paraphrase, that he had put [Acklin] through and [Velma] through and the brothers through. And obviously, at that point, you know, I had a different opinion and vision of [Theodis].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \"... [And] I asked him if he would consider testifying regarding that so we could at least-you know, first I wanted to see if he was willing to talk to me about it to see if, in fact, it was true, (one); (two), if it was true, what his reasons were as to why he may have been like this towards his kids or towards his wife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \"Q. Right. Then if he had told you that information, would you have then talked to him about possibly getting on the stand at the trial and relating this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \"A. Sure. Yes, that's what I did, and he wasn't happy about that idea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \"Q. What do you mean, 'He wasn't happy'?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   \"A. He wasn't happy. He didn't appreciate the idea that his ex-spouse, [Velma], had disclosed these facts to me. I can't remember what he specifically said. It was as if, 'It's all not true.' I told him, 'Look, this is critical. You can help your son possibly, possibly. We've got a stacked deck against us as it is.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"In my opinion, if the father truly-even if the father was abusive, if he truly loved his son, he would appear in court, if needed, to help. He took a very aggressive posture with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \"Q. What does that mean?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \"A. He wasn't happy. As I recall, we were in [the] office, and I can't remember if [Velma] was there or not. He literally got up as he started hearing what I was saying about what [Velma] had said. He literally stood up, and he was like, 'I can't believe they are doing this,' or 'They are going there,' something to that effect. Visibly, he was angry, and he said, 'You tell [Acklin] if he wants to go down this road, I'm done with him,' to that extent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"Q. 'I'm done with him'?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \"A. More or less. If I recall, that was the verbiage he used. He got up and walked out of my office. And if I recall, as he was walking out, I told him, '[Theodis], I will do whatever I need to, to get you to this sentencing phase; I just want you to know that,' and I don't think he even said anything. I was talking to the back of his head as he was walking out. He left, and that was it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (R. 110-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As to whether Rahmati considered putting this evidence on during the penalty phase, Rahmati said that he did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rahmati testified that he believed that the allegations were true and that, when he went to talk to Acklin the next day, Acklin confirmed that they were true. Rahmati's testimony on his interaction with Acklin was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \"Q. You said ... that you got confirmation from Nick Acklin about what Velma said, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"Q. You honestly told Nick everything that happened with Velma, right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \"Q. You were open with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \"A. Sure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \"Q. Told him everything-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \"A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Q. -as to Velma?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \"A. As to what his mother told me, yes, and about discussions with his father as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \"Q. So discussions with the father; you told him everything that the father said? ... The father getting up and leaving your office? ... And what the father told you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (R. 131-32.) According to Rahmati's records, he consulted with Acklin for two hours at this time. Counsel Gray also met with Acklin the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Rahmati explained to Acklin that Velma, Theodis, and Acklin's brothers could be called to testify about the abuse and that\n   the jury could consider that testimony as mitigating. Acklin, however, steadfastly refused to permit Rahmati to introduce the evidence. Rahmati testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   \"A.... [Acklin] admitted that the physical and mental abuse took place, but he specifically stated he did not want me to introduce that evidence into the case because he didn't want to put his father in that position, or to really put his family in that position. I urged him that this was important. How much impact would it have, if any, I wasn't sure, but I felt certainly that we would need to try to introduce it. He didn't want to-if I recall, he said they didn't-if I recall, [Acklin] said something to the effect of, 'That didn't cause me to be here. I don't want to ruin their lives or have anything like this to come out on them.' So he specifically required us not to-instructed us not to subpoena his father or introduce this evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   \"Q. As a result of what your client told you, did you ask him to memorialize his instructions in any specific way?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   \"A. Yes, sir. Because we felt so strong about the need to try to introduce this evidence and the fact that he had instructed us not to, I felt the need to memorialize it in the form of a writing that we asked [Acklin] to sign, which he signed, just for me to have in my file.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   \"Q.

Such behavior included, but was not limited to, my father pointing guns at me. My above-mentioned attorneys have advised me that this evidence could possibly be considered by a jury in mitigation of any aggravating circumstances argued by the State at my trial.

A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action 'might be considered sound trial strategy.'

After asking Theodis to state his name for the record and whether Theodis was Acklin's father, Rahmati asked Theodis nine questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Acklin's characterization of those questions as \"enabl[ing] Theodis to mislead the jury and the court\" is inaccurate. Illustrative of Acklin's mischaracterization of those questions is his description of the question-\"Q. Let me ask you this, did you ever see Nick to be disrespectful to anyone and if so, did you ever discipline him for anything?\" Acklin suggests that Theodis's response to this question-i.e., \"We didn't have that problem\" and Acklin \"was easily disciplined\"-was false in light of the allegations of abuse. Acklin also asserts that Theodis's additional comments in response to that question-e.g., that Theodis was an \"overly protective [parent], really a father who loves his children\"-were false in light of the allegations of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Contrary to Acklin's assertions, Rahmati's question about discipline may fairly be seen as an attempt to elicit Theodis's assessment of Acklin's character-not as an affirmative attempt to get Theodis to mislead the court and the jury as to whether Theodis himself was a \"good\" parent. As to whether Rahmati had an obligation to inform the court as to parts of Theodis's testimony that he thought might be untrue, Acklin has not demonstrated either (1) that Rahmati thought the testimony was \"untrue\" or (2) that Rahmati had an obligation to inform the court of his thoughts about the veracity of that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As to what occurred at the sentencing hearing, we note that Acklin mischaracterizes Theodis's participation at that hearing. The statements made by Theodis at that hearing before the sentencing judge followed this statement from Rahmati: \"This is not going to be testimony\n   <em>\n    and I am not going to ask [Theodis] Acklin questions\n   </em>\n   . As my client's father, he simply has something\n   that he would like to tell the Court.\" (Trial R. 1025.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Acklin directs this Court to that part of the sentencing order, also quoted above, in which the sentencing court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   \"The Court was impressed with the sincerity of the testimony by the defendant's mother and father. They are clearly good people and tried to do the right thing in raising him. However, the Court does not find this to be a mitigating circumstance. Most killers are typically the products of poverty, a dysfunctional family, physical or sexual abuse and/or social deprivation. Acklin was the product of a loving middle-class family. Acklin was exposed to all of the values that are central to an ordered society; however, he chose to reject them. Acklin made a conscious choice to become a killer; he was not born to it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   (Trial C. 294.) According to Acklin, Rahmati knew that the trial court's statements here were incorrect, and, Acklin says, Rahmati should have objected to them or at least brought the trial court's attention to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Rule 32 court rejected this argument, however-finding, again, that the responsibility for Rahmati's failure to tell the sentencing court about the abuse is because Acklin had expressly prohibited Rahmati from doing so. The circuit court noted, again, that a \"defendant cannot intentionally prevent his trial counsel from presenting evidence during trial and then, years later, attempt to profit from trial counsel's failure\" to present that evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adkins v.

We agree with the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Acklin's refusal to permit Rahmati to introduce evidence of the abuse left trial counsel with the task of presenting a mitigation case without the ability to present evidence of the abuse. Trial counsel chose a strategy of presenting evidence of Acklin's pleasant disposition and his remorse over the murders. That strategy included attempting to portray Acklin and his family \"in the best light [they] possibly could for both Judge Smith and for the jury.\" (R. 151.) Counsel presented testimony from eight witnesses, including Acklin's parents, his aunt, his grandmother, a retired police officer, an employee at a youth organization, and two reverends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   As noted above, we do not agree with Acklin's characterization of Rahmati's efforts during the penalty phase and the sentencing phase. Acklin has not shown that Rahmati intentionally elicited false evidence or failed to draw the court's attention to evidence Rahmati knew to be false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Rahmati knew about the allegations of abuse, he had also been told by Velma that the alleged abuse was most intense during the year before Velma and\n   Theodis divorced-which occurred when Acklin was 11 (he was 24 at the time of the crimes). At the time of the trial, Theodis had remarried and had been a reverend for some time. There was testimony that Acklin had regularly attended church and had participated in the youth choir at his church. Theodis had paid some of Acklin's legal bills, and he made an impassioned plea for mercy to the jury and to the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if Rahmati believed that the allegations about the abuse were accurate, Theodis's comments about loving his children and raising them in a \"Christian\" home were not necessarily untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Nor do we agree with Acklin's suggestion that, if the jury or the trial court had known about the abuse-or at least had not heard some evidence that Acklin was raised in a \"loving middle-class family\"-the outcome might have been different. The sentencing court did not expressly rely on Acklin's home environment as a basis for imposing the death sentence-rather, the court rejected his home environment as a mitigating circumstance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   After hearing much of the evidence that Acklin argues should have been introduced, the Rule 32 court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   \"While Acklin presented evidence his father was abusive to him, his mother and siblings, he completely failed to prove why his exposure to abuse would have been considered a mitigating factor by the jury and the trial court. This is especially true given Acklin's age at the time of the offenses. The abuse Acklin endured at the hands of his father clearly had no effect on Acklin's ability to work, maintain relationships, or to function in society to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law if he chose to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

Acklin asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   \"Three days before trial, the Madison County Jail began giving Nicholas Acklin Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug with sedative effects. As pharmacologist Dr. Pamela Sims explained at the Rule 32 hearing, Xanax is used primarily to treat anxiety and cause sedation: 'The purpose of Xanax is to remove emotion from [the patient].' R. 555. Acklin was receiving a 'significant dose' of the drug, R. 549, such that it would be expected to have sedative effects, moving a person toward sleep even if he were in a highly emotional situation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-211\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   \"Although Rahmati knew that the jail had begun giving Acklin a new drug shortly before trial 'to help him calm down,' R. 145, he did not take any steps to inquire about the drug or its effects. Accordingly, Rahmati did not request a jury instruction on the ways in which the drug might affect Acklin's demeanor. He also did not inform the court about the drug, even when the court specifically relied on Acklin's lack of remorse-displayed by his 'gaze that was devoid of emotion,' [Trial C. 294]-as a reason for imposing the death penalty.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   (Acklin's brief, pp. 34-35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The circuit court rejected this claim. It found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   \"Mr. Rahmati also testified at the evidentiary hearing that he was aware that Acklin was given additional medication at the Madison County Jail during his trial, but Mr. Rahmati could not recall specifically what Acklin was given. At the time of Acklin's trial Mr. Rahmati and Mr Gray had represented him for more than two years. During Acklin's trial, neither Mr. Rahmati nor Mr. Gray noticed his affect or demeanor was any different than at any other time during their representation. Mr. Rahmati also testified that Acklin's demeanor at the Rule 32 evidentiary hearing was the same as it was during his capital murder trial years before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   \"This Court notes that there is nothing in the trial record, and Acklin presented no evidence at the evidentiary hearing, indicating that Acklin ever complained to Mr. Rahmati or Mr. Gray that the medication he was prescribed during his trial affected his ability to assist[ ] in his defense. Furthermore, in observing Acklin during the course of the evidentiary hearing, the Court notes that Acklin displayed a flat and subdued demeanor, which appeared to be consistent within his demeanor at trial based upon descriptions of same in the record. Acklin also presented no evidence proving that anyone that observed him during his trial informed Mr. Rahmati or Mr. Gray that Acklin's appearance or demeanor was anything other than normal. Acklin also failed to present any evidence\n   establishing that he objected to being administered Xanax during his trial or that he or anyone reported to Mr. Rahmati, Mr. Gray, or to any jail personnel that he was experiencing side effects from the drug.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   (C. 4001-02.) The findings of the circuit court are supported by the record, and Acklin has not demonstrated that he is entitled to relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Acklin next argues that his \"counsel's deficient performance prejudiced\" him. (Acklin's brief, p. 37.) Acklin again cites (1) the sentencing court's alleged \"misunderstanding of the facts\" regarding Acklin's childhood and (2) the sentencing order's statements about Acklin's \"demeanor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   We have already held that counsel did not perform deficiently as to either of those aspects of the sentencing court's order. Acklin expressly prohibited his counsel from introducing evidence of the alleged abuse in his childhood, and counsel did not mislead the court or have an obligation to ignore Acklin's instructions and tell the court about the allegations of abuse. Further, counsel's failure to notify the court or the jury about Acklin's taking Xanax during the trial was not deficient performance. Accordingly, a discussion of whether counsel's representation prejudiced Acklin is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Regardless, Acklin has not demonstrated that counsel's allegedly deficient performance prejudiced him. First, Acklin's statement that \"the two main factors the trial court weighed against Acklin were his positive upbringing and his unemotional demeanor in court\" is incorrect. The sentencing order is clear that the two main factors the court weighed against Acklin were the two aggravating circumstances-which, the sentencing court said, would have\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   independently outweighed the mitigating circumstances.

Acklin argues: \"As such, the trial court failed to make clear that the jury should vote for life if the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were in equipoise.\" (Acklin's brief, p. 45.) Acklin cites decisions such as\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8325264\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/724/\">\n    951 So.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2002).
