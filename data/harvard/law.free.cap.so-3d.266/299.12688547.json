We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 16, 2014, Hernandez was injured while working at a plant in Donaldsonville. Hernandez, represented by counsel, filed a disputed claim for compensation against his employer, ASAP Employment Services, Inc., and ASAP's insurer, Louisiana Construction and Industry Self Insurers Fund (\"LCI\"). The parties negotiated a settlement, which was approved by the workers' compensation judge (WCJ), and Hernandez's claim was dismissed with prejudice on May 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Four months later, on September 15, 2016, Hernandez, appearing in proper person, filed another disputed claim for compensation based on the same accident, again naming ASAP and LCI as defendants, but also adding several new parties, including CF Industries. CF Industries responded with a peremptory exception of prescription, which, following a hearing, was granted. In a judgment signed on June 16, 2017, Hernandez's claims against CF Industries were dismissed with prejudice. Hernandez appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A claim for workers' compensation indemnity benefits prescribes one year from the date of the accident or, if benefits have been paid, one year from the last payment or, for a claim for supplemental earnings benefits, three years from the last payment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 23:1209A;\n   <em>\n    Putman v. Quality Distribution, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 11-0306 (La.

R.S. 23:1209C. Prescription is interrupted by filing a formal claim with the office of workers' compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 23:1209A(1) and B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hernandez's claim against CF Industries was filed about two years after the accident and does not allege the payment of any benefits. The claim is thus prescribed on its face. When a workers' compensation claim is prescribed on its face, the claimant bears the burden of showing prescription was suspended or interrupted in some manner.\n   <em>\n    Borja v. FARA\n   </em>\n   , 16-0055 (La. 10/19/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362461,12362470\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/1/\">\n    218 So.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11. When, as here, evidence is received at the hearing on the exception, the appellate court reviews the WCJ's factual findings under the manifest error-clearly wrong standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Theodore v. Iberville Parish School Board\n   </em>\n   , 12-0746 (La. App. 1 Cir. 1/8/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7001528\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/112/270/#p271\">\n    112 So.3d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 271.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The evidence introduced at the hearing by Hernandez is limited to three exhibits: a radiology report for a chest x-ray\n   taken shortly after the accident, a memorandum filed by Hernandez in opposition to the exception of prescription, and a letter from Hernandez's attorney in the original proceeding summarizing a mediation conducted in that proceeding. None of this evidence establishes an interruption or suspension of the prescriptive period applicable to Hernandez's claim against CF Industries. Having failed to satisfy his burden of proof, Hernandez's claim against CF Industries is prescribed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 23:1209A(1);\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

Although a timely-filed tort suit may, in some instances, interrupt prescription for a workers' compensation claim arising out of the same circumstances, the record contains no evidence of the filing date for the tort claim against CF Industries. Instead, the record contains only a copy of a petition filed against an unrelated party who was later dismissed from that proceeding. The record does not reveal when CF Industries was added as a party to that suit. Hernandez thus failed to prove he\n    <em>\n     timely\n    </em>\n    filed a tort suit against\n    <em>\n     CF Industries\n    </em>\n    that interrupted prescription for his workers' compensation claim.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Isaac v.

Louisiana Revised Statute 23:1317(A) provides that a workers' compensation judge is not bound by technical rules of evidence or procedure other than as provided by workers' compensation law. So while all findings of fact must be based upon competent evidence, the judge is to decide the merits of a controversy equitably, summarily, and simply. The jurisprudence states that the legislative intent behind La. R.S. 23:1317 is to materially relax evidentiary and procedural rules and subordinate procedural considerations to discovery of the truth and protection of substantial rights.\n   <em>\n    Peters v. Ruskin Manufacturing\n   </em>\n   , 39,535, p. 4 (La.

At the hearing on CF Industries Nitrogen's objection of prescription, it was acknowledged that Mr. Hernandez had a pending tort suit based on the September 16, 2014 accident. The record further reveals that CF Industries Nitrogen is one of several defendants named in the pending tort suit, which CF Industries Nitrogen acknowledged in motions it filed in the underlying proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Isaac v. Lathan\n   </em>\n   , 01-2639, p. 6 (La.
