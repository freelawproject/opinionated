The husband has petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to vacate orders entered on July 6 and July 24, 2017. The husband asserts that the trial court entered the orders without supporting evidence and in violation of his due-process rights. This court called for answers to the petition but received none; thus, we must accept as true the averments in the husband's mandamus petition. See\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9346028\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/840/132/#p134\">\n    840 So.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134-35 (Ala. 2002) (holding that when a respondent fails to challenge factual allegations contained in a petition for the writ of mandamus, the appellate court accepts as true the factual statements in the petition). Based on the materials before this court, and for the reasons discussed below, we deny the husband's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the materials submitted by the husband with his petition, a hearing was held in the trial court on September 26 and 27, 2016. Afterward, a pendente lite order was entered in October 2016 by Judge Patricia Stephens granting the husband sole physical custody of the child and granting the wife visitation pending the final hearing. The trial court also ordered the wife to pay child support in the amount of $78.07 each month to the husband, which was a deviation from the child-support guidelines. According to the husband's petition, Judge Stephens thereafter recused herself from the action, and, after the other circuit judges within the Jefferson Circuit recused themselves, Judge Tim Riley was appointed to preside over the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 17, 2017, Judge Riley set the case for a hearing \"on any pending motions and all pretrial matters on June 15, 2017.\" According to the husband, Judge Riley held a hearing on June 15, 2017, at which only the guardian ad litem for the child testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 6, 2017, Judge Riley entered an order. For purposes of this petition, the pertinent parts of the order provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"This case came on to be heard on all pending motions and testimony on June 15, 2017. Present were the [husband] with his attorney, Hon. Virginia Meigs, and [the wife] with her attorney, Hon.

On July 24, 2017, the trial court entered another order, amending the July 6 order, that, among other things, ordered that the certificate of divorce be amended to state \"incompatibility\" instead of \"adultery\" as the ground for divorce and ordered the husband to pay to the wife \"the sums previously ordered\" for temporary alimony and child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the husband filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court seeking to have the trial court's July 6 and July 24, 2017, orders vacated. The petition was filed within the presumptively reasonable time, as required by Rule 21(a)(3), Ala. R. App. P. See\n   <em>\n    Norman v.

A pendente lite order \"is effective only during the pendency of the litigation in an existing case and is usually replaced by the entry of a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    T.J.H. v.
