Ray James was convicted of burglary of a dwelling and four counts of aggravated assault against a police officer. Eleven years later, James filed a motion for a sentence reduction or, in the alternative, a new trial or permission to appeal. Finding that James's motion was time barred, the circuit court denied his motion. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In July 2005, James was convicted of burglary of a dwelling and four counts of aggravated assault against a police officer. In 2010, the officer, Tony Cooper, was later convicted and sentenced on unrelated charges in federal court. In 2016, James filed a motion for a sentence reduction or, in the alternative, a new trial or permission to appeal. The circuit court stated that James's motion was time barred and that it had no authority to grant his request of a sentence reduction, a new trial and/or an out of time appeal. James timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3. \"When reviewing a trial court's denial or dismissal of a [motion for postconviction\n   relief (PCR) ], we will only disturb the trial court's factual findings if they are clearly erroneous; however, we review the trial court's legal conclusions under a de novo standard of review.\"\n   <em>\n    Creppel v.

Ct. App. 2013). But, the Mississippi Supreme Court has held that \"errors affecting fundamental rights are exceptions to the rule that questions not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Rowland v.

While ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not traditionally categorized as a \"fundamental right\" under\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   , the Mississippi Supreme Court held that \"under the facts of a particular case, this Court might find that a lawyer's performance was so deficient, and so prejudicial to the defendant, that the defendant's fundamental constitutional rights were violated.

Here, James did not challenge his 2005 conviction until 2016, eleven years later; nor does his mere claim support any violations of his \"fundamental\" rights.\n   <em>\n    Rowland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7043906\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/42/503/#p506\">\n    42 So.3d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 10).

Notwithstanding the procedural bar, we will briefly address James's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7. Although James's pro se brief is extensive, at the crux of his claims is ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   James asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney (1) refused to file an appellant brief, (2) failed to notify the circuit court he wished to withdraw as counsel, (3) failed to inform James the circuit court had appointed him new counsel, (4) failed to render a notice of appeal, and (5) abandoned James and thereby created a conflict of interest. To succeed on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, James must demonstrate, \"(1) deficiency of counsel's performance (2) sufficient to constitute prejudice to the defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Here, James relies only on his assertions in his briefs to support his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 8. In his reply brief, James does request this Court to order the circuit court records to support his assertions, but\n   \"[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to designate the record pursuant to Rule 10(b) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure in a manner sufficient to allow this Court to review the appellant's issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Austin v.
