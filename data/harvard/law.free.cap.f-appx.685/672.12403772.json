Collins, </em>No. 15-3084. <em>Collins </em>was decided on February 14, 2017, and a petition for panel rehearing was granted on April 7, 2017 on a limited basis to issue a revised opinion. This matter is before us on Appellant Herman Gilkey\u2019s <em>Status Report </em>wherein .he states that the one issue he intended to raise on appeal\u2014whether the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for a subsequent revocation is measured by the penalties applicable to the first revocation instead of the penalties applicable to. the initial conviction\u2014was rejected by <em>Collins, </em>and he is, therefore, constrained to admit that this court should summarily affirm the district court. Upon consideration of Appellant\u2019s status report and in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Collins, </em>the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-20\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
