McHugh, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-J\">Clayton Andrew Schwers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his lawsuit as a sanction for untruthfulness during discovery. Mr. Schwers sued Albuquerque city police officers Christopher Kerlin and John Mings <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for using excessive force dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>ing Mr. Schwers\u2019s arrest. After the arrest, Mr. Schwers admitted to his emergency room physician that he struggled with the police and resisted restraint, and that this led to the police officers using a Taser on Mr. Schwers at least four times. He also admitted to biting one of the officers. The physician reported that Mr. Schwers was \u201cacutely intoxicated upon arrival with a blood alcohol level of [.]151.\u201d Mr. Schwers pled guilty to crimes incident to the arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">During discovery, however, Mr. Schwers denied having alcohol that day, denied biting the officer, and denied resisting arrest. His responses to interrogatories were either \u201cuntruthful or nonsensical,\u201d even after the magistrate judge ordered Mr. Schwers \u201cto provide complete answers and warned him that failure to comply with the order could lead to sanctions, including dismissal of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Accordingly, Officers Kerlin and Mings moved for dismissal as a sanction for Mr. Schwers\u2019s violation of the rules of discovery. In his response, Mr. Schwers \u201cdid not address the discrepancies between his sworn testimony and his statements to his medical doctor and his guilty plea related to the arrest.\u201d The district court meticulously analyzed each of the relevant factors we identified in <em>Ehrenhaus v. Reynolds, </em>965 F.2d 916, 921 (10th Cir. 1992), to conclude dismissal would be an appropriate sanction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">Mr. Schwers lied about his encounter with [Mr. Kerlin and Mr. Mings], and despite his guilty plea denied that he engaged in the activities leading to his arrest. He admitted to his treating physician that he bit an Officer, but subsequently denied this in the interrogatories and deposition. He also denied having consumed alcohol, but his medical records show otherwise. Given Mr. Schwers\u2019s repeated contradictions and lies and his failure to comply with the discovery process, the <em>Ehrenhaus </em>factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Mr. Schwers has flaunted the rules of civil procedure by failing to take the discovery process seriously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Mr. Schwers appeals the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. But Mr. Schwers has failed to present any argument as to how the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning him. <em>See Reed v. Bennett, </em>312 F.3d 1190, 1195 (10th Cir. 2002) (\u201cA district court undoubtedly has discretion to sanction a party ... for failing to comply with local or federal procedural rules. Such sanctions may include dismissing the party\u2019s case with prejudice or entering judgment against the party.\u201d). Instead, Mr. Schwers\u2019s appellate briefs rehash the allegations in his amended complaint, without even mentioning that the district court dismissed his case as a sanction for failing to comply with discovery requests. \u201cIt is insufficient merely to state in one\u2019s brief that one is appealing an adverse ruling below without advancing reasoned argument as to the grounds for the appeal.\u201d <em>Reedy v. Werholtz, </em>660 F.3d 1270, 1274 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-11\">We conclude Mr. Schwers has failed to present any reasoned, nonfrivolous arguments on appeal to explain how the district court abused its discretion in sanctioning him. Moreover, we agree with the district court\u2019s thorough analysis of the <em>Ehren-haus </em>factors and its conclusion that this case should be dismissed with prejudice. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision for substantially the same reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>set forth in its order dated October 26, 2016. We also deny Mr. Schwers\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">. Because Mr. Schwers is proceeding pro se, we construe his filings liberally. <em>See Ogden v. San Juan Cty., </em>32 F.3d 452, 455 (10th Cir. 1994). \"[T]his rule of liberal construction stops, however, at the point at which we begin to serve as his advocate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pinson, </em>584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-24\">. In addition, Mr. Schwers listed as defendants the City of Albuquerque, Mayor Richard Berry, and Chief of Policy Raymond Schultz. The district court dismissed these defendants after concluding Mr. Schwers failed to state a claim against them. Mr. Schwers did not appeal this order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. These crimes included (1) aggravated battery upon a peace officer; (2) criminal damage to property (over $1,000); (3) resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer; and (4) concealing identity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b696-16\">. Mr. Schwers filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied the motion because it found Mr. Schwers\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith when his '\u2018response to the \u2018issues on appeal' question ... [did] not reveal any argument of error regarding the Court\u2019s dismissal of his claims.\u201d Mr. Schwers renewed his IFP motion in this court, but we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
