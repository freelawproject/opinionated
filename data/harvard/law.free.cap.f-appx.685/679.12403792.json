McKay Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Plaintiffs Donny and Brenda Myers, proceeding pro se, appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint, which sought to void a state-foreclosure judgment and alleged several claims under Oklahoma tort law. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">In 2006, Defendant Wells Fargo filed a petition for foreclosure in Oklahoma state court after Plaintiffs failed to make mortgage payments. The state court entered judgment in favor of Wells Fargo in 2007. Subsequently, Plaintiffs filed numerous motions in state court to vacate the judgment, all of which were denied, arguing that Wells Fargo lacked standing to pursue the foreclosure and that Wells Fargo had committed fraud on the court. <em>(See </em>Appellee\u2019s Suppl. App. at 1-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">In 2016, after losing in state court, Plaintiffs filed a complaint against Wells Fargo in federal district court. The complaint, which invokes Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u2014the rule on requests for relief from a judgment or order\u2014asserts nine \u201ccauses of action\u201d including \u201cLack of Standing/Wrongful Foreclosure,\u201d \u201cFraud upon the Court/Fraud in the Concealment,\u201d and \u201cVoid Assignment of Note Mortgage &amp; Deed of Trust.\u201d (R. at 5.) Plaintiffs also allege their due process rights were violated during the course of the foreclosure proceedings and that Wells Fargo is liable under state tort law for intentional infliction of emotional distress and slander of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Wells Fargo moved to dismiss the complaint based on (1) the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine; (2) claim and issue preclusion; and (3) failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion and dismissed the case, holding that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. It also stated that, even if <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>did not apply, the claims \u201cwould still be barred under the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel.\u201d (R. at 1000.) Plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">\u201cAlthough we construe pro se filings liberally, [Plaintiffs\u2019] <em>pro se </em>status does not excuse [them] from complying with the fundamental requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure.\u201d <em>Russell v. Sherman &amp; Howard, LLC, </em>222 Fed.Appx. 698, 699 (10th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cA party, including a pro se litigant, waives an inadequately briefed issue, and \u2018mere conclusory allegations with no citations to the record or any legal authority for support\u2019 are inadequate to preserve an issue for review.\u201d <em>Krumm v. Holder, </em>594 Fed.Appx. 497, 501 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 841 (10th Cir. 2006)). Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpro se appellate brief is inadequate as [they do] not support [their] arguments with citations to the record or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>legal authorities and therefore fail[] to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(8)(A).\u201d <em>Moffett v. Colvin, </em>580 Fed.Appx. 688, 689 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Nor can Plaintiffs avoid the consequences of their inadequate briefing by incorporating their district court filings by reference. <em>(See </em>Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. at 4 (\u201cI could go into all of the claims listed in the Complaint but it would be easier to just read the Complaint rather than me double write it.\u201d).) Our rules do not allow parties to incorporate by reference the arguments they made in the district court. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 28.4 (\u201cIncorporating by reference portions of lower court ... briefs or pleadings is disapproved and does not satisfy the requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 28(a) and (b).\u201d) Plaintiffs\u2019 <em>\u201cpro se </em>status does not except [them] from such established rules.\u201d <em>Wardell v. Duncan, </em>470 F.3d 954, 964 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that a pro se appellant could not incorporate pleadings into his appellate brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">What\u2019s more, Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail on the merits. \u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine establishes, as a matter of subject-matter jurisdiction, that only the United States Supreme Court has appellate authority to review a state-court decision.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch Bus. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Nudell, </em>363 F.3d 1072, 1074-75 (10th Cir. 2004) (footnote omitted). It \u201cprecludes federal district courts from effectively exercising appellate jurisdiction over claims actually decided by a state court and claims inextricably intertwined with a prior state-court judgment.\u201d <em>Mo\u2019s Express, LLC v. Sopkin, </em>441 F.3d 1229, 1233 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Without citing any legal authority, Plaintiffs assert that the district court was wrong to dismiss the complaint under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>for two reasons: (1) <em>\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>does not apply where there [are] allegations [that] Extrinsic Fraud ha[s] been committed upon the state court\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe <em>[Rooker-Feldman] </em>doctrine does not apply if the Plaintiff had no reasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. at 4; <em>see also </em>Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. at 4.) But both arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent: Even if Plaintiffs could prove fraud, we do not recognize an \u201cextrinsic fraud\u201d exception to <em>Rooker-Feldman. See Tal v. Hogan, </em>453 F.3d 1244, 1256 (10th Cir. 2006) (noting that \u201cnew allegations of fraud might create grounds for appeal, but that appeal should be brought in the state courts\u201d); <em>see also, e.g., Bradshaw v. Gatterman, </em>658 Fed.Appx. 359, 362 (10th Cir. 2016) (rejecting the \u201cargument that extrinsic fraud can override <em>Rooker-Feldman\"). </em>Second, even if Plaintiffs could prove \u201cno reasonable opportunity\u201d to raise their federal claims in the state court proceedings, it is not the case that the state court \u201chad to actually hear every issue\u201d as Plaintiffs argue (Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. at 5). The doctrine applies \u201cregardless of whether the state-court proceeding afforded the federal-court plaintiff a full and fair opportunity to litigate her claims.\u201d <em>Kenmen Eng\u2019g v. City of Union, </em>314 F.3d 468, 478 (10th Cir. 2002), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291-92, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Smith v. Colo. Supreme Court (In re Smith), </em>287 Fed.Appx. 683, 685 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. We GRANT appellants\u2019 motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
