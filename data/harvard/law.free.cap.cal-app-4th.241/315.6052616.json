Proc., \u00a7 1858.) Adhering to these principles sometimes has us resolving issues contrary to our own views of policy and practicality. This case presents such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">The Penal Code provides for the right to a jury trial on factual issues underlying a plea of once in jeopardy. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1041, subd. 3, 1042.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, defendants entered pleas of once in jeopardy, based on their claim that the prosecutor at the first of their two trials intentionally goaded them into requesting a mistrial. (See generally <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 667 [72 L.Ed.2d 416, 102 S.Ct. 2083] <em>(Kennedy).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The Attorney General contends sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 apply to some, but not all, pleas of once in jeopardy. We conclude that interpretation is clearly foreclosed by the plain language of the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-14\">Several implications of this conclusion are regrettable. Double jeopardy claims predicated on prosecutorial goading claims do not seem particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>well suited for resolution by juries in several respects. And the interplay between <em>Kennedy </em>and section 1042 will require already overburdened trial judges to manage a new type of trial that will likely raise unique evidentiary and instructional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">But \u201cour hands are tied\u201d <em>(Oakes </em>v. <em>McCarthy Co. </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 231, 257 [73 Cal.Rptr. 127]), and we must adhere to \u201c \u2018the plain meaning of the actual words of the law, \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhatever may be thought of [its] wisdom, expediency, or policy <em>(People v. Loeun </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 1, 8-9 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 947 P.2d 1313].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is important to emphasize the nature of the issue we decide today. We would not, on a blank slate, create the right to a jury trial on pleas raising Kennedy-type<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> claims. But that is not the question we face. Instead, the question we address is whether the Penal Code requires a jury trial on -a once in jeopardy plea asserting a Kennedy-type claim. Both questions are important, but only one is ours to answer. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">We conditionally reverse the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">1. <em>Convictions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">Defendants Lynell Travon Lewis (Lewis), Deon Lavell Joseph (Joseph), Jujuan Robert Bell (Bell), and John Fitzgerald Williams (Williams) were each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>convicted of four counts of second degree robbery (counts 1-4; \u00a7 212.5, subd. (c)), six counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm (counts 5-7, 9-11; \u00a7 245, subd. (b)), five counts of assault with an assault weapon (counts 12-14, 16-17; \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(3)),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> two counts of transporting an assault weapon (counts 19, 24; former \u00a7 12280, subd. (a)(1); see \u00a7 30600), two counts of participating in a criminal street gang (counts 21, 28; \u00a7 186.22, subd. (a)), one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a semiautomatic firearm (count 22; \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)), one count of conspiracy to commit robbery (count 23; \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)), and one count of carrying a loaded firearm in public by a member of a criminal street gang (count 26; former \u00a7 12031, subd. (a)(2)(C)). Defendants Bell and Lewis were additionally convicted of two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon (counts 18, 27; former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">2. <em>Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The jury found that all of these crimes were committed for the benefit of, or in association with, a criminal street gang with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in criminal conduct by gang members (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)) as alleged in the indictment, except the active gang participation counts (counts 21, 28) and the single count of possessing a loaded firearm by an active street gang member (count 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The jury also found that, as to the robbery counts, each defendant was a principal and at least one principal personally used a firearm as alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Former \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (e)(1).) The jury further found that a principal was armed during the commission of the two conspiracy counts. (Former \u00a7 12022, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The jury found that Joseph, Lewis and Williams each personally used a firearm during the commission of the six counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and the two counts of active participation in a criminal street gang. (Former \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a).) The jury found it \u201cnot true\u201d that Bell personally used a firearm during the commission of those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The trial court found that the prior convictions alleged against Bell and Lewis were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">3. <em>Sentences</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The court sentenced Bell to prison for 79 years four months; Lewis for 71 years; Williams for 64 years; and Joseph for 55 years four months.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">I. <em>2007 Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In 2007 and 2008, defendants were each members of the Mona Park Compton Crips criminal street gang. Bell was an \u201cO.G.\u201d in the gang, which meant he was \u201chigher-ranking\u201d and \u201cdeserving of respect within the gang from his fellow gang members.\u201d Lewis and Joseph each had tattoos demonstrating respect for Bell. Joseph also had a tattoo demonstrating respect for Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">A. <em>Hours Preceding Robbery of Golden West Casino</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Bell had two children with Tameka Turner (Turner), his girlfriend of eight years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Turner testified under a grant of immunity, and this fact was made known to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">In September 2007, Turner lived in Palmdale, California, while Bell was living in Compton, California. On September 12, 2007, Bell told Turner over the phone that he had \u201csomething to do\u201d and would be coming to Palmdale.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">When Turner came home from work late that night, defendant Bell was at her home with three other men. In a pretrial interview admitted into evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Turner identified two of the men as Joseph and Lewis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> She was not sure if defendant Williams (also known as \u201cDoonie\u201d) was the third man. Outside her home was a red Pontiac Grand Am \u201cor something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Turner went to sleep around 2:00 or 2:30 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">B. <em>The Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">At approximately 4:00 a.m. on September 13, 2007, David Ahrens was standing outside of the Golden West Casino in Bakersfield, California, when he noticed a nearby car traveling the wrong way. The red, four-door car pulled up near Ahrens, and several men exited carrying firearms. The men pointed their weapons at Ahrens and said, \u201cGet up against the F\u2019ing wall and shut up.\u201d The men led Ahrens into the casino, pushing him in the back with the barrel of an assault rifle. The men told Ahrens to lie down.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Four assailants eventually entered the casino, each wearing a face covering.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> One of the assailants wore dark clothing that covered his entire body and carried a type of firearm called an \u201cSKS\u201d rifle. The People contend this assailant was defendant Joseph.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Another assailant, alleged to be defendant Lewis, wore a white face covering, and carried an \u201cAK-47-type\u201d weapon with a missing butt stock. A third assailant, alleged to be defendant Williams, wore dark clothing and carried a silver handgun. The last assailant, alleged to be defendant Bell, carried a bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Security guard Darren Forthman (Forthman) was standing near the door where defendants entered. Immediately after defendants entered the casino, Forthman dropped to his knees and put his hands behind his head. One of the card dealers at a nearby table, David Valle (Valle), also put his head down and hands up when the assailants entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Chris Akin was seated at the same table as Valle. Akin had a personal cell phone and a corporate cell phone placed on a nearby table. Akin was eventually ordered to get on the floor. When Akin eventually arose, he noticed both cell phones were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Melissa Gomez, a Golden West Casino employee, was standing near Forthman when defendants entered. Gomez testified that the men had \u201cbig\u201d guns and pointed them in her direction, though not directly at her. They told her to get on the floor, so she went behind a wall, got on the floor and covered her face. She was scared.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Lewis stayed near the door where he had entered the casino. Bell entered the casino shortly after the other three assailants and was escorting Ahrens and a man named Robert Goldfisher. On the surveillance video, Lewis appears to point his firearm towards Valle on several occasions, and at Goldfisher at least once.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">While Lewis stayed in the first area of the casino, Joseph and Williams proceeded farther, into a second card room. As Joseph entered the second card room, a man who had been sitting at a table began to run away. Joseph chased him and led him back at gunpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Shortly after Joseph entered the second card room, security officer Deion Chester (Chester) got under a nearby table. Chester saw the assailants come in with guns \u201clike AK-47s like you see on TV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">As Chester was ducking under the table, a woman named Becky Tam tried to leave the area. As she rounded a comer, she almost ran into Williams. Williams pointed his handgun towards Tam, and she got down onto the floor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">A voice is heard on the surveillance video saying, \u201cGotti, come on Gotti.\u201d \u201cGotti\u201d is Bell\u2019s gang moniker.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Bell then entered the second card room area and jumped over a nearby counter into the casino\u2019s cash cage. Casino employee Belinda Soto was crouched down on the other side of the counter. After climbing through the counter window, Bell told Soto to \u201copen the safe.\u201d Soto told him that \u201csecurity has the keys\u201d to the safe and that security was \u201cout front.\u201d Bell told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Soto to \u201cgo get\u201d the security guard. Soto began to walk away, presumably to get the security guard. Bell then proceeded to take money from the cash registers. Williams, apparently unaware of Bell\u2019s instruction to Soto, approached the cash cage window and said, \u201c[W]hat is she doing?\u201d Williams ran towards Soto and is heard saying, \u201clay [.sic] down.\u201d Williams and Bell then escorted the security guard, Forthman, into the cash cage. Forthman is heard telling the men that he did not have the code to the safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Defendants eventually left the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">C. <em>Postrobbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1. <em>Turner\u2019s House After the Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">At \u201cmaybe\u201d 4:00 a.m., or 5:00 a.m., or 6:00 a.m., on September 13, 2007, Turner was awakened at her home by several male voices, including Bell\u2019s. Turner also \u201cthought\u201d she heard Joseph\u2019s voice. She heard \u201csomebody\u201d laughing and \u201csaying something about [how] they had to chase somebody or something like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Bell came into Turner\u2019s room while counting money. After a few hours, Bell left the house but not before giving Turner $2,500 and telling her to dispose of a bag on the living room floor. Turner did not move the bag for two days, after which she moved it into the garage. She did not touch the items inside the bag until October 31, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">2. <em>Recovery of the Red Pontiac</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Near the casino, law enforcement located a red, four-door Pontiac. The vehicle engine was still hot, its passenger door was open, and there was a $100 bill on the road underneath the open door. The rearview mirror had a fingerprint that completely matched Williams\u2019s fingerprint. The vehicle had been stolen in Southgate, California, on September 2, 2007.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">3. <em>Interactions Between Lewis, Turner and Bell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Lewis and Turner slept together at her home \u201ca few weeks approximately after September 13th.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> After Lewis removed his clothing, Turner placed some of the clothing items in a hamper. Turner gave Lewis new clothes that \u201ccould have been\u201d Bell\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Prior to October 31, 2007, \u201cmaybe some time early in October,\u201d Turner was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that Bell had been cheating on her. In anger, Turner vandalized a car Bell was driving by pouring sugar in the engine block. Turner claimed she also took clothes out of that same vehicle and put them into the closet where the bag Bell had given her was being stored. In total, she took four or five shirts and a jacket from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">4. <em>Turner Empties the Contents of the Bag Bell Had Given Her Immediately After the Robbery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">On October 31, 2007, Turner took the bag Bell had given her out of the garage and dumped its contents on the floor. Inside the bag Turner found \u201cmoney wrappers,\u201d plastic bottle containers, another bag containing a magazine for a firearm, and \u201csome shirts.\u201d Turner contacted law enforcement, and several deputies responded to her home and took custody of the bag. A responding deputy observed a pile of items on the floor with half of the items in the bag, and the other half of the items in a pile on the ground near the bag. Among the items were the following: several money bags identical to those used by Golden West Casino; cash wrappers dated \u201c9/12/07\u201d that had been ripped; Akin\u2019s stolen corporate cell phone; several items of clothing, including a black shirt tied into a knot; 7.62-caliber ammunition capable of being fired by either an SKS rifle or AK-47; and pants with black Nike gloves in the back pocket. One of the cash wrappers had a fingerprint that matched Bell\u2019s right middle finger. A deputy sheriff transported the items in the trunk of his car to the technical investigations division.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Law enforcement also took custody of an SKS rifle with a foldable bayonet found in Turner\u2019s garage closet. The gun had not been in the home before Bell had arrived, and Turner believed Bell had placed the gun there.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The prosecution offered contested evidence that various DNA samples taken from the contents of the bag in Turner\u2019s home matched defendants. This evidence included the following: A single-source DNA profile that matched Williams was obtained from a short-sleeved black shirt. A single-source DNA profile that matched Bell was obtained from a long-sleeved black shirt. Another long-sleeved black shirt had a mixture of DNA, with the major contributor matching Joseph. A white shirt had a mixture of DNA, with the major contributor matching Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The defense offered the testimony of a DNA consultant, which indicated that the deputy sheriff should have packaged items of evidence separately to prevent cross-contamination, and that it was possible for DNA to be transferred by touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>II. <em>2008 Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A. <em>Facts Surrounding Alleged Conspiracy to Rob Golden West Casino in March 2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On March 27, 2008, Bell was at Turner\u2019s home, along with defendant Williams and a man named Michael Johnson. Bell told Turner he \u201cneeded another vehicle\u201d because he \u201chad something to do.\u201d Turner arranged for an acquaintance to give her a vehicle and report it stolen. Turner went with Williams to retrieve the car, then brought the vehicle back to her house. As she returned home, Turner saw Joseph and Lewis pulling up in another car.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Bell called a woman named Aleshia Grayson (Grayson) and told her to meet him in Bakersfield.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On March 29, 2008, Grayson drove to Bakersfield with a woman named Chan Mitchell, and rented two motel rooms at a Days Inn.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That night, Grayson, Mitchell, Bell, Williams and Michael Johnson visited the Golden West Casino, but did not stay long.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The next day, March 30, 2008, Mitchell told Grayson that she had heard Bell and Williams talking about \u201csomething\u201d that was \u201csupposed to be going down out there.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Mitchell believed the men planned to commit a robbery. Grayson spoke to Bell about his plans. Bell told Grayson that \u201cthey were gonna be robbing something that night.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Bell told Grayson that the robbery would happen at 2:00 a.m. and that \u201ceverybody has to go to one table.\u201d Grayson told Bell, \u201c[T]hat is so crazy.\u201d Bell was confident and told Grayson \u201che ha[d] done it before.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">B. <em>Phone Calls Placed on March 30, 2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">On the afternoon of March 30, 2008, Bell and Lewis spoke on the phone. Several slang words and phrases were used during the call and Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Lauro Cantu offered his opinion as to what those terms meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Lewis asked Williams whether he had \u201cscope[d] the scope\u201d which, according to Deputy Cantu, meant to conduct surveillance. Williams responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Lewis then asked whether Williams had their \u201cwhistles\u201d which, according to Deputy Cantu, meant \u201cguns.\u201d Williams responded affirmatively and then the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cLewis: You got that one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cWilliams: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cLewis: You got that one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">\u201cWilliams: Ah, three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201cLewis: I say you got that one? That one I . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201cWilliams: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">\u201cLewis: And then that one, huh, like uh Uzi shit that one time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">\u201cWilliams: That and uh some other shit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">Lewis told Williams, \u201cDon\u2019t make a move without me, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">Later on the call, Lewis told Bell: \u201c[G]ive me a low I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Deputy Cantu testified that \u201cgive me a low\u201d meant to acquire an inconspicuous vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-16\">Lewis also said he had his \u201cown tools\u201d and asked if Bell wanted him to bring \u201c2, 3, 4, or 5, 6, 7.\u201d Bell responded, \u201cNah, n[**]ga. Uno.\u201d Deputy Cantu testified that \u201ctools\u201d commonly refers to firearms and that the numbers meant that Bell was asking if he should bring up to seven firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">On a separate call later that evening, Williams asked Lewis if he was \u201cbringing a whistle?\u201d Lewis responded, \u201cHell yeah, what you think I\u2019m gonna do and shit? Just come empty handed?\u201d Later on the same call, Lewis asked Williams, \u201c[H]ow far is it from here?\u201d After confirming Lewis\u2019s question, Williams said, \u201cThe one. The same one.\u201d Lewis then said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a[]while man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-18\">At 8:20 p.m., Bell called Grayson. They discussed whether Bell should take a nap and for how long. The following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cGrayson: You can sleep longer than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cBELL: Yeah. N[**]ga uh, we got butterflies, n[**]ga ain\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cGrayson: (laughter) I do too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">\u201cBELL: For what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">\u201cGrayson: I\u2019m like, I am not gonna be able to go . . . cuz, what do you mean for what? Worried about you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cBELL: Play another song then silly. All Color Purple.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201cGrayson: Uh, my stomach gonna be turning, am gonna be in knots by the time two o\u2019clock comes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">C. <em>Law Enforcement\u2019s Surveillance Activities on March 30-31, 2008</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">About two hours later, still on March 30, 2008, law enforcement began visual surveillance of Turner\u2019s residence. Sergeant Downey took over surveillance duties at around 10:40 p.m. He observed Turner\u2019s residence from about four to six houses down.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">Sergeant Downey observed a dark-colored Camry back into Turner\u2019s garage. At around 11:15 or 11:20 p.m., three to five males exited Turner\u2019s house and drove away in a PT Cruiser. Lieutenant Kirkland followed the PT Cruiser to a Walmart. Inside the Walmart, Kirkland observed four males from the PT Cruiser purchase multiple items, including black gloves. Kirkland recognized one of the men as defendant Bell. The men then drove back to Turner\u2019s residence in the PT Cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">Later, Sergeant Downey observed a hatchback vehicle<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> back into the driveway at Turner\u2019s residence. Over the course of the next 20 minutes, three to five males went to and from the back of the hatchback. It appeared to Sergeant Downey that the men were \u201ceither taking items from the garage and putting them in the hatchback or taking items from the hatchback and putting them in the garage.\u201d Around midnight, the hatchback (i.e., the white Pacifica) and the dark-colored Camry left together.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>D. <em>Law Enforcement\u2019s Stop of Defendants\u2019 Vehicle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Law enforcement stopped the Camry and a Pacifica on Highway 58 near Towerline Road.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Williams and Michael Johnson were removed from the Camry. Johnson had a Days Inn motel key in his back pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Bell, Lewis and Joseph had been removed from the Pacifica. Several firearms were recovered from the Pacifica, including two shotguns, a silver nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, and an AK-47. The wooden butt of the AK-47 was missing, like the AK-47 used in the 2007 casino robbery. Various items of clothing were also recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">E. <em>Williams\u2019s Interview with Law Enforcement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Detectives interviewed Williams, and he denied knowing of any crime other than the theft of the stolen car in which he was stopped.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">While in a patrol car on the way to jail, Williams was read the charges against him. Williams paused for two to five minutes, and then said, \u201cWhen do you think they\u2019ll offer us a deal? Will it be our first court appearance or second or what?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Later, when a booking clerk read the charges, Williams made a comment. Williams said, \u201cKidnapping. It was only an attempted robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">I. <em>Defendants Had a Statutory Right to a Jury Trial on Their Plea of Once in Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">Defendants contend they were entitled to have a jury resolve their pleas of once in jeopardy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>A. <em>Background Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">1. <em>2010 Trial Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Defendants were initially tried in 2010, but that proceeding ended in a mistrial. Certain events from that first trial are pertinent to this issue and we recount them below.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Prior the first trial, the trial court ruled that the manner in which the Camry and Pacifica had been stopped will \u201cneed to [be] sanitize[d].\u201d To that effect, the court excluded all evidence that the Camry and Pacifica had been stopped by a SWAT team, and that officers were wearing raid gear and had \u201cM4\u201d weapons. The court then asked Prosecutor Chad Louie: \u201cMr. Louie, am I clear with you on how we\u2019re going to proceed at the scene of the stop on Towerline?\u201d The prosecutor responded, \u201cYou are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">On November 1, 2010, the court read the charges to the jury and gave preliminary instructions. As of that date, the prosecutor was apparently unable to locate witness Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">On November 4, 2010, the prosecutor informed the court that he had originally planned to call Deputy Derek Brannan to testify about observing Williams and Michael Johnson exiting the Camry. However, the prosecutor had learned that Brannan had not personally observed that event. Rather, Deputy Bill Starr had observed the event.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Consequently, the prosecutor asked that Starr be added to the witness list so that he could elicit direct observations rather than hearsay. The court asked if defense counsel had any objection to adding Starr to the witness list. No attorney objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Starr was eventually called as a witness and testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">\u201cQ. Can you describe the vehicle that you saw on that date and that time, at that location?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\u201cA. It was a dark blue Toyota Camry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">\u201cQ. And did you see any occupants of that vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">\u201cQ. Did you see the occupants exit that vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u201cA. I recall at least two occupants. I don\u2019t recall if there was [sic] more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cQ. At least two of the occupants exited?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cQ. Can you describe the occupants for us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">\u201cA. The only thing I recall is they were black male adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">\u201cQ. Do you remember where they exited from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">\u201cQ. Did you make \u2014 did you end up making contact with that vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">\u201cA. No. I was positioned in the turret of the armored personnel carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial based on the in limine ruling. The trial judge and all counsel had a chambers conference, which was not transcribed. The parties went back on the record outside the presence of the jury, and the court indicated it was leaning towards granting a mistrial. The prosecutor urged the court not to declare a mistrial \u201cnotwithstanding myself failing to inform this witness of that \u2014 because this is a last-minute witness.\u201d Defense counsel then recounted that during the chambers conference, the prosecutor \u201cadmitted that he failed completely to advise this witness of the Court\u2019s rulings regarding the SWAT [vie].\u201d The court granted a mistrial and discharged the jury.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">2. <em>Defendants\u2019 Plea and Motion Concerning Prior Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">After the mistrial was declared, defendants entered additional pleas of once in jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">Each defendant requested in writing for the issue to be resolved by way of a jury trial. Joseph also moved, in the alternative, to dismiss the indictment. The prosecution opposed these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Judge Brownlee, who had presided over the mistrial, held a hearing on the defense requests. Judge Brownlee concluded that because the prosecutor\u2019s intent concerned a procedural matter (i.e., double jeopardy) rather than an issue of guilt or innocence, it was a question of law to be decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Judge Brownlee observed that \u201cMr. Louie [the prior prosecutor] had been in my court several times prior to this trial on general felony-type cases. Did a competent job on those cases. Those cases were not complicated and straightforward.\u201d The court also observed that \u201cMr. Louie was overmatched against the four lawyers for the defense and needed additional assistance from his office. Though none was forthcoming. Nonetheless, he did the best he could.\u201d The court also noted its belief that if the first trial had gone to the jury, there was no reasonable prospect of acquittal. The court further observed that \u201c[Deputy] Starr provided [the offending] testimony not in response to a direct question, but offered it up on his own.\u201d The court ultimately concluded that \u201cMr. Louie\u2019s conduct was not intentionally done for the purpose of triggering a mistrial\u201d and denied the defense motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Defendants challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling in a writ petition to this court. We denied the petition summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">After we denied the writ petition, all defendants renewed their objection in the trial court as to proceeding without a jury trial on the once in jeopardy plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">B. <em>Double Jeopardy Claims Under </em>Kennedy</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">The double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution protects a criminal defendant from repeated prosecutions for the same offense. <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. at p. 671.) The double jeopardy clause also affords a defendant the right \u201cto have his trial completed before the first jury empaneled to try him . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>at p. 673.) Consequently, once a mistrial is declared over the defendant\u2019s objection, retrial will only be permitted if the mistrial was declared as the result of a \u201c \u2018manifest necessity,\u2019 \u201d such as a hung jury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 672.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">However, when the defendant requests the mistrial, \u201cdifferent principles come into play. . . .\u201d <em>(Kennedy, supra, </em>456 U.S. at p. 672.) When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>defendant requests and is granted a mistrial as the result of prosecutorial error, it is ordinarily assumed there is no barrier to retrial. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Jorn </em>(1971) 400 U.S. 470, 485 [27 L.Ed.2d 543, 91 S.Ct. 547].) However, there is a narrow exception to this rule that arises when \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s actions giving rise to the motion for mistrial were done \u2018in order to goad the [defendant] into requesting a mistrial.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Kennedy, <em>supra, 456 </em>U.S. at p. 673.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Retrial is barred in that circumstance because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s valued right to complete his trial before the first jury would be a hollow shell if the inevitable motion for mistrial were held to prevent a later invocation of the bar of double jeopardy in all circumstances. . . .\u201d (456 U.S. at pp. 673-674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The determination of whether a prosecutor intentionally goaded the defense into moving for a mistrial is one that necessarily \u201c \u2018requires making inferences ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Jacob </em>v. <em>Clarke </em>(8th Cir. 1995) 52 F.3d 178, 181-182.) The threshold issue in this case is whether a defendant who pleads once in jeopardy is entitled to have a jury make those inferences and ultimately determine the prosecutor\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">C. <em>Disputed Issues of Fact Underlying a Plea of Once in Jeopardy Must Be Tried to a Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Under California law, a defendant may not mount a double jeopardy defense of any kind under a plea of not guilty. (\u00a7 1020; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Leong Fook </em>(1928) 206 Cal. 64, 72 [273 P. 779].) In order to present a double jeopardy defense at trial, a defendant must first have entered a special plea of \u201cformer acquittal,\u201d \u201cformer conviction\u201d or \u201conce in jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>(Rebstock </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1905) 146 Cal. 308, 315 [80 P. 65]; see <em>In re Burns </em>(1947) 78 Cal.App.2d 294, 302 [177 P.2d 649].) These pleas are favored by the law due to the importance of the double jeopardy rights they are employed to protect. <em>(Gonzalez v. Municipal Court </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 706, 714 [108 Cal.Rptr. 612]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Preciado </em>(1916) 31 Cal.App. 519, 530 [160 P. 1090].)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Once the defense of former jeopardy has been raised by special plea, it is generally \u201can issue of fact. . . which the jury alone possessed] the power to pass upon.\u201d <em>(People v. Bennett </em>(1896) 114 Cal. 56, 59 [45 P. 1013].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Consequently, when a defendant asserts former jeopardy as a defense at trial, \u201che is entitled to a resolution by the jury of any material issues of fact raised by the claim. . . .\u201d <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 509, fn. 1 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809] [describing the holding of <em>People v. Greer </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 589 [184 P.2d 512] <em>(Greer)].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">This rule is enshrined in two adjacent provisions of the Penal Code: sections 1041 and 1042. Section 1041 provides that \u201c[a]n issue of fact arises: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] 3. [u]pon a plea of once in jeopardy.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In its very next section, the Penal Code provides that issues of fact \u201cshall be tried\u201d to a jury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1042; see <em>People v. Ramirez, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The relationship between these two provisions is clear: \u201cPenal Code, section 1041, specifies how an issue of fact arises and section 1042 sets forth how it shall be tried. . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Johns </em>(1959) 173 Cal.App.2d 38, 43 [343 P.2d 92].) Consequently, when these statutes are read together, they plainly require that issues of fact arising upon a plea of once in jeopardy be tried to a jury. (\u00a7\u00a7 1041, subd. 3, 1042; see <em>People v. Ramirez, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 670 [\u201cViewing the law in its literal terms, a plea of double jeopardy raises an issue of fact [citation]. The Penal Code also provides that all issues of fact in criminal cases are to be tried by a jury unless jury trial is waived [citations].\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">That a jury must resolve pleas of former jeopardy is also reflected in section 1151. That statute provides that pleas of once in jeopardy are to be resolved by way of a \u201cverdict.\u201d (\u00a71151; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Seneca Ins. Co. </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 954, 957 [129 Cal.Rptr.2d 842, 62 P.3d 81] [in general, the term \u201c \u2018verdict\u2019 \u201d means a \u201cjury verdict\u201d (italics omitted)].) Under section 1151, it is the trial court\u2019s \u201cduty ... to have the jury pass upon\u201d issues raised by a plea of once in jeopardy. <em>(People v. Hamberg </em>(1890) 84 Cal. 468, 472-473 [24 P. 298].) \u201cTo do otherwise [is] erroneous. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Not surprisingly, California courts have long observed that \u201cit undoubtedly is the law that where the issue of jeopardy is based on questions of fact, it is for the jury to decide [citations].\u201d <em>(People v. Hess </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 407, 426 [237 P.2d 568], italics omitted; see <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 509, fn. 1; <em>People v.

Lachuk </em>(1935) 5 Cal.App.2d 729, 731 [43 P.2d 579]; <em>People v. Frank </em>(1933) 134 Cal.App. 211, 214 [25 P.2d 486].)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">California courts have held that the determinative inquiry regarding the right to a jury trial on a plea of once in jeopardy is whether or not the plea raises an issue of fact. And, usually, a plea of once in jeopardy does present an issue of fact. <em>(People v. Mason </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 282, 285 [19 Cal.Rptr. 240]; see <em>People v. Bechtel </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 441, 445 [260 P.2d 31].) As a result, the issue of jeopardy is ordinarily submitted to the jury. (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (4th ed. 2012) Defenses, \u00a7 205(5), p. 681.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">However, like many other questions of fact, the jeopardy determination can become a question of law when (1) the underlying facts are undisputed and (2) there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from those undisputed facts. <em>(People v. Mason, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d at p. 285.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Such questions of law may be resolved by the court on a motion to strike the jeopardy plea. (200 Cal.App.2d at p. 285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The Supreme Court succinctly summarized the law on this issue in <em>Stone v. Superior Court, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d 503: \u201cThe determination of the <em>validity </em>of a claim of double jeopardy is a matter for the trial judge in the first instance. If there is no material issue of fact, the judge rules on the double jeopardy claim. If, however, a material issue of fact exists, then it is for the jury to resolve.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 509, fn. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>D. <em>Sections 1041, Subdivision 3 and 1042 Apply to Claims Asserted Under </em>Kennedy</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The Attorney General contends that sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 do not apply to pleas of once in jeopardy that assert Kennedy-type claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">1. <em>The Plain Language of Sections 1041, Subdivision 3 and 1042 Does Not Support the Distinction Urged by the Attorney General</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The Attorney General argues the cases discussing the right to a jury trial on jeopardy defenses are distinguishable because they involve jeopardy pleas that centered on \u201cwhether the defendant was previously tried for the same crime(s)\u201d whereas the jeopardy pleas in the present case are based on alleged \u201cprosecutorial goading to a mistrial.\u201d As we explain more fully below, we are unable to adopt this distinction in light of the undifferentiated language of section 1041, subdivision 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">When interpreting statutes, we must remain \u201c \u2018mindful of this court\u2019s limited role in the process of interpreting enactments from the political branches of our state government. In interpreting statutes, we follow the Legislature\u2019s intent, as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law, \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhatever may be thought of the wisdom, expediency, or policy of the act.\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2019[Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Loeun, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 8-9.) Consequently, when construing \u201cany statute, we may not broaden or narrow the scope of the provision by reading into it language that does not appear in it or reading out of it language that does. \u2018Our office . . . \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare\u201d what is in the relevant statutes, \u201cnot to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Doe v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 531, 545 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 330, 169 P.3d 559].) We \u201cmay not, \u2018under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, \u2018 \u201c[w]e must assume that the Legislature knew how to create an exception if it wished to do so . . . .\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(DiCampli-Mintz v.

Together, sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 encompass issues of fact arising from pleas of once in jeopardy without qualification. Nowhere do the statutes indicate that entitlement to a jury trial turns on the particular theory of law underlying the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of once in jeopardy. In order to achieve the result urged by the Attorney General, we would have to add an exemption to section 1041, subdivision 3 for once in jeopardy pleas based on prosecutorial goading. \u201cThe problem with this approach is the one that inheres in most incorrect interpretations of statutes: It asks us to add words to the law to produce what is thought to be a desirable result.\u201d <em>(EEOC </em>v. <em>Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Stores, Inc. </em>(2015) 575 U.S. _[192 L.Ed.2d 35, 135 S.Ct. 2028, 2033].)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">While it seems most sensible and efficient for a judge to determine the goading issue, there is simply no <em>statutory </em>basis for treating once in jeopardy pleas based on a \u201ctraditional\u201d double jeopardy theory (i.e., prior conviction or acquittal of the same offense) differently than those asserting <em>Kennedy-type </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">2. <em>The Fact That Sections 1041 and 1042 Were Originally Enacted Before </em>Kennedy-type <em>Claims Were Recognized Does Not Alter Our Interpretation of Those Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Attorney General argues that the Legislature could not have intended to require a jury trial here because the theory of prosecutorial goading did not exist when sections 1041 and 1042 were enacted.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This contention is foreclosed by long-standing principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u201cOld laws apply to changed situations.

The crucial fact remains that the Legislature \u201cselected] broad and unambiguous statutory language . . . .\u201d <em>(Khajavi, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 51.) Because the statutory language is clear, \u201c \u2018it is unimportant that [the statute\u2019s] particular application may not have been contemplated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>accord, <em>Barr v. United States, supra, </em>324 U.S. at p. 90; <em>Garcia, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 192.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Put another way, the legislative decision to which we are deferring is not a choice to consciously include Kennedy-type claims within the scope of sections 1041 and 1042. Rather, we yield to the Legislature\u2019s choice to enact undifferentiated statutory language that plainly encompasses all pleas of once in jeopardy without regard to the underlying legal theory. Though <em>Kennedy-</em>based theories of double jeopardy did not exist in 1872, pleas of once in jeopardy did. .</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">It remains entirely possible that if the Legislature had anticipated the emergence of Kennedy-type claims, it would have excepted them from the statutory right to a jury trial in section 1042. But these types of riddles are \u201cnot ours to solve.\u201d <em>(Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd. </em>(2014) 573 U.S._ [189 L.Ed.2d 234, 134 S.Ct. 2250, 2258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">3. <em>The Plain Language of Sections 1041 and 1042 Is Not in Conflict with Section 1141</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The Attorney General argues our interpretation of sections 1041 and 1042 is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with section 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Section 1141 reads, in full: \u201cIn all cases where a jury is discharged or prevented from giving a verdict by reason of an accident or other cause, except where the defendant is discharged during the progress of the trial, or after the cause is submitted to them, the cause may be again tried.\u201d This provision is a substantive double jeopardy rule, concerning when a defendant may be retried. Conversely, sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 simply identify the trier of fact on a jeopardy claim, regardless of which substantive jeopardy theory has been invoked. There is simply no conflict between these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">The true conflict is not between section 1141 and sections' 1041 and 1042, but instead between section 1141 and <em>Kennedy </em>itself. While section 1141 would permit retrial in cases of prosecutorial goading leading to a defense-requested mistrial, <em>Kennedy </em>does not. But this conflict between <em>Kennedy </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>section 1141 exists regardless of how sections 1041 and 1042 are interpreted. That is, Kennedy-type claims contravene section 1141 regardless of whether those claims are resolved by a judge or a jury. Section 1141 is not inconsistent with our interpretation of sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">4. <em>The Foreign Decisions Cited by the Attorney General Do Not Compel a Different Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Attorney General cites the decisions of several foreign jurisdictions and notes that many have provided for judicial determinations of prosecutorial intent.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> But the Attorney General fails to explain how those decisions should bear on our interpretation of California statutes. It is true that a foreign opinion interpreting a \u201csimilarly worded statute[], although not controlling, can provide valuable insight\u201d when construing a California law. <em>(In re Joyner </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 487, 492 [256 Cal.Rptr. 785, 769 P.2d 967].) But none of the foreign cases cited by the Attorney General interpreted any relevant statutes whatsoever, much less ones that are similarly worded to sections 1041 and 1042.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> (See <em>State v. Michael J. </em>(2005) 274 Conn. 321 [875 A.2d 510. 519-520]; <em>State v. Hull </em>(R.I. 2000) 754 A.2d 84, 87; <em>State v.

(Cf. <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Vehmeyer </em>(1901) 133 Cal. 459, 461 [65 P. 974] [\u201cIt is unnecessary to review the many cases cited by appellant from other states, for each state has its own statute bearing upon the procedure to be followed, and it is upon the construction of these various and different statutes that the contrariety of decision has arisen.\u201d].) The Attorney General\u2019s \u201ccontention concerning the practice of other jurisdictions is better addressed to the Legislature, which can evaluate the benefit of joining these other jurisdictions . . . .\u201d <em>(Grafton Partners </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 944, 965 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 5, 116 P.3d 479].)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>5. <em>The Supreme Court Cases Cited by the Attorney General Do Not Alter Our Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">a. <em>People v. Betts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Betts </em>(2005) 34 Cal.4th 1039 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 138, 103 P.3d 883] <em>(Betts), </em>the Supreme Court considered whether issues of venue and territorial jurisdiction are to be decided by a judge or a jury. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1043.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In <em>Betts, </em>the Supreme Court observed that section 1126 provides that \u201c \u2018questions of law are to be decided by the court, and questions of fact by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Betts, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1048, quoting \u00a7 1126.) The court then relied on its own precedent establishing that the distinction between questions for the jury and questions for the court under section 1126 \u201c \u2018turns on whether the issue presented relates to the substantive matter of guilt or innocence to be determined at trial or, instead, concerns a procedural matter that does not itself determine guilt or innocence . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Betts, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 1048-1049, quoting <em>People v. Posey </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 193, 206 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 551, 82 P.3d 755].) The court reasoned that while the issues of territorial jurisdiction and venue frequently involve questions of fact, they are \u201cprocedural issue[s]\u201d that do not involve a determination of guilt or innocence. <em>(Betts, supra, </em>at p. 1049.) Accordingly, those issues may be resolved by the trial court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1044.)</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The Attorney General cites this reasoning from <em>Betts. </em>Also, the trial court in this case relied on the \u201cprocedural issue versus matter of guilt\u201d distinction in determining the double jeopardy issue need not be submitted to a jury. We, however, find this reasoning inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">First, the controlling statute in <em>Betts </em>was section 1126, not sections 1041 and 1042. The major premise of the <em>Betts </em>holding is that under section 1126, issues relating \u201c \u2018to the substantive matter of guilt or innocence\u2019 \u201d are generally for the jury to decide and issues concerning \u201c \u2018procedural matter[s] that do[] not. . . determine guilt or innocence\u2019 \u201d are generally for the court to decide. <em>(Betts, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 1048.) But, unlike section 1126 as interpreted in <em>Betts, </em>section 1041 makes it abundantly clear that the issues assigned to the jury under section 1042 are not limited to those impacting the determination of guilt or innocence. Indeed, of the four pleas identified in section 1041, only one always involves the guilt or innocence of the defendant. (\u00a7 1041, subd. 1 [plea of not guilty].) At least two of the other pleas \u2014 former acquittal/conviction and once in jeopardy \u2014 plainly do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>involve the guilt or innocence of the accused.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> (See <em>U.S. v. MacDougall </em>(4th Cir. 1986) 790 F.2d 1135, 1142.) In determining whether an issue must be resolved by a judge or jury, section 1041 clearly sets up a different dividing line than section 1126 as interpreted in <em>Betts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">This distinction between the statutes at issue in <em>Betts </em>and the present case highlights the core flaw in the trial court\u2019s reasoning in this case.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the issue of prosecutorial intent did not need to be submitted to the jury because it involved \u201ca procedural matter . . . and not one of guilt or innocence.\u201d But that is true of <em>all </em>pleas of once in jeopardy. The trial court\u2019s reasoning would mean that <em>no </em>once in jeopardy plea (even those based on a \u201cclassic\u201d double jeopardy theory) would <em>ever </em>be tried to a jury. Such a result would be impossible to square with sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Moreover, section 1041 expressly inserts pleas of once in jeopardy into the scope of section 1042. (See <em>People v. Johns, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.2d at p. 43 [\u201cPenal Code, section 1041, specifies how an issue of fact arises and section 1042 sets forth how it shall be tried.\u201d].) We imagine <em>Betts </em>would have been decided differently if there had been a statute expressly providing that issues of venue and territorial jurisdiction are questions of fact under section 1126. Yet it is that hypothetical \u2014 not the actual circumstances of <em>Betts </em>\u2014 that is analogous to the statutory reality we face here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We are not dissuaded by <em>Betts\u2019s </em>observation that trial courts \u201croutinely\u201d decide \u201cwhether the prosecution\u2019s misconduct that results in a mistrial bars retrial, a decision that requires findings as to the prosecutor\u2019s intent [citation] . . . .\u201d <em>(Betts, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 1049-1050, fn. omitted; see <em>id. </em>at pp. 1049-1050, fn. 3.) Unlike the Supreme Court in <em>Betts </em>(and <em>Batts, </em>discussed below), we have been expressly called upon by the parties to determine whether this practice \u2014 even if routine \u2014 complies with sections 1041 and 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>b. <em>People v. Batts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The Attorney General also cites to dictum from our Supreme Court expressing \u201cgrave doubts that . . . factual questions regarding the prosecution\u2019s intent in committing misconduct are appropriate for resolution by a jury rather than by the court. . . .\u201d <em>(Batts, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 697, fn. 28.) The footnote goes on to say that \u201cas far as we are aware, <em>all </em>courts that have addressed similar double jeopardy issues have assumed that the court, rather than a jury, would make the relevant determination [citation].\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>(Batts, supra, </em>at p. 697, fn. 28, original italics; but see <em>Collins </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>640 S.W.2d at pp. 290-291.) The court concluded the footnote by observing: \u201cWe have no occasion to decide that issue in the present case, however, because none of the parties raised the issue in the trial court.\u201d <em>(Batts, supra, </em>at p. 697, fn. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We have several observations regarding this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">First, we note that the footnote is clearly dictum, and essentially identifies itself as such. <em>(Batts, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 697, fn. 28 [noting court had \u201cno occasion to decide\u201d the issue]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Wiley </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 580, 588 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 347, 889 P.2d 541] [prior Supreme Court decision\u2019s brief mention of state constitutional right to a jury trial not a \u201cconsidered decision\u201d determining scope of California constitutional right to a jury trial].)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Second, we share the Supreme Court\u2019s doubts that these factual questions are \u201cappropriate for resolution by a jury.\u201d <em>(Batts, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 697, fn. 28.) But this case has us deciding not whether a jury trial is \u201cappropriate,\u201d but instead whether it is required by the Penal Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Third, though this is not made explicit in the text, we think the footnote may best be read as an expression of doubt only as to whether the United States and California Constitutions \u2014 rather than the Penal Code \u2014 compel a jury trial in this context.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The <em>Batts </em>opinion is almost entirely concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>with constitutional double jeopardy protections, while sections 1041 and 1042 are not mentioned at all. <em>(Batts, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 665-705.) It would be peculiar for us to resolve a statutory construction issue by relying on precedent that does not analyze or even cite the relevant statutes. (Cf. <em>Fluor Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 1175, 1180 [191 Cal.Rptr.3d 498, 354 P.3d 302] [statute tracing back to 1872 prevails over contrary 2003 Supreme Court opinion that did not address the statute].)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Moreover, the only case cited in the relevant portion of the footnote is the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kennedy. </em>Such a citation would be unusual if used to support the notion that the Penal Code does not provide for a jury trial, yet entirely appropriate if done to show that a jury trial is not compelled by the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">6. <em>The Fact That Policy Considerations May Favor Judicial Resolution of Some Issues of Fact Raised by Once in Jeopardy Plea Is Irrelevant Given the Plain Language of the Applicable Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">To say, as we do, that there is no statutory basis for treating <em>Kennedy-based </em>pleas differently is not to suggest that other approaches are meritless or even inferior.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Attorney General credibly argues that having a judge decide disputed issues of fact regarding prosecutorial intent in this context is \u201cthe better rule\u201d because the judge will have witnessed the prosecutor\u2019s actions and demeanor during trial and will be familiar with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But our role is to determine the <em>actual </em>rule enacted by the Legislature, not to declare a \u201cbetter\u201d rule. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">While the Attorney General\u2019s policy arguments may well be quite valid, they have been presented in the wrong forum. \u201cIt is not our function to \u2018inquir[e] into the \u201cwisdom\u201d of underlying policy choices.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[0]ur task here is confined to statutory construction.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bonnell v.

There are several reasons courts are reluctant to employ the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">First, we are largely powerless to perform legislative functions. (See Cal. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 3 [judiciary may not exercise legislative powers absent authorization by Constitution]; see also Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) \u201cEach time the judiciary utilizes the \u2018absurd result\u2019 rule, a little piece is stripped from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>written rule of law and confidence in legislative enactments is lessened. . . .\u201d <em>(Unzueta, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1699.) Unlike a court\u2019s notion of absurdity and the revisions it would impose as a result, the text of the statute \u201chas successfully braved the legislative gauntlet. . . .\u201d <em>(Halbert\u2019s Lumber, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Second, \u201c[t]here are few, if any, sources guiding an appellate court on how to apply the absurdity exception to the \u2018plain meaning rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Harbison </em>(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 975, 986-987 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 187] (dis. opn. of Yegan, J.).) This lack of guidance is dangerous, since \u201c[a]bsurdity . . . is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d <em>(Unzueta, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1698.) Even when we as judges are convinced a statute will lead to absurd results, it remains \u201c \u2018 \u201cinfinitely better ... to adhere to the words of an Act . . . and leave the legislature to set it right than to, alter those words according to one\u2019s notion of an absurdity.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Ibid.; see <em>People v. Pecci, supra, </em>72 Cal.App.4th at p. 1507.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Attorney General makes several attempts to clear the high bar set by this state\u2019s absurdity jurisprudence. Most of these contentions concern the burden jeopardy jury trials will place on trial courts and the anticipated difficulty of managing the proceedings. But \u201c[m]ere inconvenience resulting from a construction according to the clear meaning of a statute will not justify the courts in ignoring its terms.\u201d (58 Cal.Jur.3d (2012) Statutes, \u00a7 108, p. 521, fn. omitted.) For the reasons explained below, we conclude that we may not rewrite the statutes under the absurd consequences doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Evidentiary Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The Attorney General argues the scope of the evidence presented at the jeopardy proceeding would be \u201cunwieldy.\u201d Below we address the specific hypotheticals and examples posed by the Attorney General. But first, we note as a general matter that the trial judge has authority to limit the \u201cevidence and the argument of counsel to relevant and material matters . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1044.) And the trial court is empowered to exclude even relevant evidence under Evidence Code section 352. We anticipate trial courts will diligently utilize the \u201cundue consumption of time\u201d and \u201cconfus[ion of] the issues\u201d prongs of Evidence Code section 352 to streamline the presentation of evidence at jeopardy trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">\n<em>Calling the First Prosecutor to Testify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The Attorney General notes that at the type of jury trial contemplated here, prosecutors would likely be called to testify regarding the allegations of misconduct underlying a defendant\u2019s plea. We do not see this eventuality as undesirable. To the contrary, the prosecutor\u2019s testimony concerning his or her own state of mind would likely be highly relevant to any Kennedy-type claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\n<em>Calling Judge Brownlee to Testify</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Attorney General next claims that the judge who presides over the mistrial might be called as a witness in a subsequent jeopardy trial. However, that possibility is foreclosed by statute. (See \u00a7 1321; Evid. Code, \u00a7 703.5; but see <em>People v. Fatone </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 1164, 1184 [211 Cal.Rptr. 288].)<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cThe rules for determining the competency of witnesses in civil actions are applicable also to criminal actions and proceedings, except as otherwise provided\u201d in the Penal Code. (\u00a7 1321.) One such rule regarding the competency of witnesses in civil actions is contained in Evidence Code section 703.5, which provides: \u201cNo person presiding at any judicial . . . proceeding . . . shall be <em>competent </em>to testify, in any subsequent civil proceeding, as to any statement, conduct, decision, or ruling, occurring at or in conjunction with the prior proceeding . . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 703.5, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Therefore, the judge who presided over the mistrial could not be called to testify at a later jeopardy trial as to \u201cany statement, conduct, decision, or ruling, occurring at or in conjunction with\u201d the mistrial. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 703.5; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1321.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>Pretrial Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The Attorney General next claims that the jeopardy jury would need to hear evidence about \u201call\u201d of the in limine proceedings leading up to the mistrial. We disagree. The jury would only need to consider evidence of the in limine proceedings relevant to the prosecutorial goading inquiry. For example, if this case proceeds to a jeopardy trial on remand, the jury would need to consider the in limine ruling concerning evidence of defendants\u2019 arrest, which the prosecutor failed to convey to Deputy Starr. In other contexts, we ask juries to determine whether someone \u201cwillfully violated [a] court order\u201d (CALCRIM No. 2700), which necessarily requires that the jury consider evidence of the court order, determine its scope, and identify the relevant conduct it prohibits or requires. We see no meaningful distinction between that circumstance and a jeopardy jury\u2019s consideration of the pretrial ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\n<em>Evidence Admitted at the First Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The Attorney General also notes the jeopardy jurors would need to hear evidence admitted at the first trial up to the point a mistrial was declared.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">But there is nothing absurd or even uncommon about this circumstance in the double jeopardy context. Evidence from prior trials relevant to a jeopardy determination is often admitted at a subsequent jury trial. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Warren </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 103, 108 [104 P.2d 1024]; <em>People v. James </em>(1893) 97 Cal. 400, 400-402 [32 P. 317]; <em>People v. Majors, supra, </em>65 Cal. at pp. 139-140; <em>People </em>v. <em>McDougal </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 571, 576 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 160]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Finch </em>(1963) 213 Cal.App.2d 752, 760 [29 Cal.Rptr. 420]; <em>People v. Demes (1963) 220 </em>Cal.App.2d 423, 433-434 [33 Cal.Rptr. 896], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Collie </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 43, 64, fn. 19 [177 Cal.Rptr. 458, 634 P.2d 534]; <em>People v. Dukes </em>(1934) 2 Cal.App.2d 698, 699-700 [38 P.2d 805]; <em>People v. Kelly </em>(1933) 132 Cal.App. 118, 119-122 [22 P.2d 526]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clinton </em>(1926) 78 Cal.App. 451, 453 [248 P. 929]; <em>People v. Castilla </em>(1915) 28 Cal.App. 190, 191-192 [151 P. 746].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The Attorney General argues that a <em>Kennedy/Batts </em>jury trial is more onerous than other types of double jeopardy trials. But \u201cmore onerous\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cabsurd.\u201d And while we are sensitive to any additional burdens on our trial courts, we do not see the contrast with other jeopardy trials being as stark as the Attorney General suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">To make this point, the Attorney General provides the example of a jury considering a plea of former acquittal. In that context, the Attorney General argues, the jury would merely be required \u201cto review conviction records in conjunction with guilt-phase evidence to determine whether the defendant was acquitted in the prior case and <em>whether that conviction was for the same conduct at issue in the current trial.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) But that inquiry, especially the second prong of the Attorney General\u2019s formulation, may pose many of the same problems faced here. To determine whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was based on the same conduct at issue in the current trial, the jury would have to go through the evidence admitted at the first trial. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>jurors would also likely need to analyze mixed issues of law and fact and evaluate the indictment or information, abstract of judgment, verdict, and jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\n<em>Greer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In a similar vein, consider the actual case of <em>Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d 589. In that case, the defendant was charged with lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under the age of 14 and statutory rape of a minor under the age of 18. Both charges arose from a single incident where the defendant had forced himself upon his 13-year-old stepdaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In a previous trial, the defendant had been charged with the same two charges he currently faced, plus a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under the age of 21. <em>(Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 595.) The prior jury convicted the defendant on the charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor but failed to reach a verdict on the statutory rape and lewd and lascivious conduct charges. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The defendant \u201cpleaded double jeopardy\u201d before his second trial.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> <em>(Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 595.) However, the trial court ruled that the defendant could not introduce evidence of the previous prosecution at trial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 596, 600.) The defendant claimed this was error and the Supreme Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The Supreme Court first observed that the conviction of a lesser included offense is a bar to prosecution for a greater offense. <em>(Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 597, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Krupa </em>(1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 592, 598 [149 P.2d 416].) The court then held that contributing to the delinquency of a minor under the age of 21 is a lesser included offense of both statutory rape of a minor under the age of 18 and lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor under the age of 14. <em>(Greer, supra, </em>at pp. 597-598.)</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">However, the court also observed that even though one offense was necessarily included in the two others, the defendant could nonetheless be convicted of all three, but only \u201cif separate acts served as the basis of each count. . . .\u201d <em>(Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at p. 600.) The Supreme Court said the determination of whether the counts were based on separate acts was \u201ca <em>question for the jury </em>. . . .\u201d (Ibid., italics added.) Therefore, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Court held the \u201cdefendant had the right to attempt to prove his previous conviction for purposes of asserting the double jeopardy bar. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Fields, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 306, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Many of the arguments the Attorney General asserts against jury trials on <em>Kennedy-type </em>claims apply with similar force to <em>Greer\u2019s </em>requirement that the issue of separate acts underlying a jeopardy claim must be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Under the specific facts of <em>Greer, </em>the new jury on remand would have needed to determine whether the first jury\u2019s conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor was based on the same act as the current charges of statutory rape and lewd and lascivious conduct. This would necessarily require introducing most or all of the evidence from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">And, requiring submission of the \u201cseparate acts\u201d issue to a jury would put a greater strain on judicial resources than the pretrial ruling procedure used by the <em>Greer </em>trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Moreover, a strong argument could be made that the trial judge at the <em>Greer </em>defendant\u2019s first trial would be better situated to compare the evidence from the first trial to the allegations in the post-mistrial information.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Nonetheless, <em>Greer </em>requires jury determination of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Surely there would be differences between a jury trial on a Kennedy-type double jeopardy claim and a jury trial on'a double jeopardy claim under <em>Greer. </em>But none of those differences are substantial enough to justify declaring one absurd and the other not.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">The Attorney General also contends the instructions to the jeopardy jury will be novel. It is true that California does not currently have applicable pattern jury instructions, given that there is no published case recognizing that sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 apply to pleas of once in jeopardy asserting Kennedy-type claims. And it is regrettable that the interaction between section 1042 and <em>Kennedy </em>has created this burden for trial courts. We do note that at least one other state has already created pattern jury instructions for certain Kennedy-type claims. (See Berry &amp; Gallagher, Texas Criminal Jury Charges (2011) \u00a7 3:800.)<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Adhering to the plain language of sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042 entails several regrettable burdens, including the need to craft applicable jury instructions. But it cannot be said those consequences are absurd. \u201cInconvenience or hardships, if any, that result from following [a] statute as written must be relieved by legislation. . . . Construction may not be substituted for legislation.\u201d <em>(United States v. Mo. Pac. R. Co. </em>(1929) 278 U.S. 269, 277-278 [73 L.Ed. 322, 49 S.Ct. 133].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\n<em>Separate Juries for Jeopardy and Guilt Determinations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In a request for supplemental briefing we raised the possibility of needing to have separate juries for guilt and jeopardy since evidence of the mistrial-inducing misconduct would be highly relevant to the jeopardy determination but also highly prejudicial to the guilt determination. The Attorney General agreed that separate guilt and jeopardy juries will often be required and argues that the strain on judicial resources this will cause is too great.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">First, we note that the Attorney General acknowledges that in this case, only one jury would need to be empaneled on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Second, we observe that a similar argument was made against permitting bifurcation of jury trials on prior conviction enhancements from the underlying charges. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Calderon </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 69, 77 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 333, 885 P.2d 83].) Yet, the Supreme Court rejected the argument, concluding that \u201cthe state\u2019s legitimate interest in conserving judicial resources is insufficient to justify denying a defendant\u2019s request to bifurcate the trial when having the jury determine the truth of a prior conviction allegation concurrently with the defendant\u2019s guilt of the currently charged offense would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>pose a substantial risk of undue prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We adopt similar reasoning here. While the state has a legitimate interest in conserving judicial resources, that interest is outweighed by the defendant\u2019s interest in avoiding the substantial risk of undue prejudice that would be posed by the guilt jury considering prejudicial jeopardy evidence.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\n<em>Proposed Procedure, Applicable in Certain Circumstances, to Mitigate Burdens on Trial Court and Juror Pool</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Given the substantial burden today\u2019s holding will place on trial courts and juror pools, we have considered alternative procedures that might mitigate these burdens in future cases while adhering to statutory mandates. We set forth one of those possible alternatives below.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">When a defendant makes a meritorious request for a mistrial on the basis of prosecutorial error or misconduct, the court could simply allow the defendant to interpose a plea of once in jeopardy and have the <em>Kennedy </em>issue submitted to the current jury before they are discharged. The jury would be instructed to return a verdict only on the issue of jeopardy, and a mistrial would then be declared as to all substantive counts and allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">This procedure would serve several interests. First, it would obviate the need to empanel two separate post-mistrial juries. Second, the \u201cmistrial jury\u201d would presumably be in a far better position than a subsequently empaneled jury to determine the likelihood of acquittal at the time of the alleged misconduct. The \u201cmistrial jury\u201d will have observed the proceedings firsthand, including the conduct and demeanor of counsel and witnesses and the introduction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The suitability of this procedure may depend on several considerations, including how much of the trial has been conducted and whether the jury actually witnessed the alleged misconduct of the prosecutor. Since this proposal is impossible to implement here we simply raise it as a possibility for courts to consider in the future in the hope it can mitigate the burdens that may be imposed by today\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">E. <em>Trial Courts May Strike a Defendant\u2019s Plea of Once in Jeopardy in Certain Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">On a motion by the prosecution,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> a jeopardy plea may be struck pretrial when the defendant fails to support the plea with proof, or the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>are undisputed and give rise to only one reasonable inference. (See <em>People v. Mason, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d at pp. 283-285; see also <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 512, 528 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 994 P.2d 354] (conc. opn. of Brown, J.); <em>People v. Severance, supra, </em>138 Cal.App.4th at p. 316; <em>People v. Ceja </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1071, 1083-1084 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 601]; <em>People v. Powell </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 107, 142-144 [115 Cal.Rptr. 109]; 4 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law, <em>supra, </em>Pretrial Proceedings, \u00a7 288, pp. 556-557 [trial court may strike jeopardy plea in certain situations].) This rule also applies to jeopardy pleas based on Kennedy-type claims. When a defendant enters a jeopardy plea based on a Kennedy-type claim, the prosecution or trial court may move to strike the plea pretrial. The court would then receive evidence,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and if no issue of fact is presented \u2014 either because the facts are undisputed and give rise to only one reasonable inference, or because the defendants offered no proof in support of the plea \u2014 the trial court may strike the plea without submitting it to a jury. (See <em>People v. Mason, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.2d at p. 285.) If, however, a question of fact is presented, the plea must be submitted to a jury. (\u00a7\u00a7 1041, subd. 3, 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Here, the trial court employed the wrong standard for determining whether a judge, rather than a jury, could adjudicate defendants\u2019 once in jeopardy pleas. The trial court concluded that because defendants\u2019 jeopardy pleas did not present an issue of guilt or innocence, they could be adjudicated by a judge. As explained above, that is not the applicable standard. Instead, the correct standard is whether the evidence concerning defendants\u2019 pleas is undisputed and gives rise to only one reasonable inference (i.e., whether the pleas present solely an issue of law). Therefore, on remand, the prosecution or trial court may move to strike defendants\u2019 pleas without submitting them to a jury. The court may only grant the motion if (1) defendants are first given an opportunity to present evidence concerning the goading issue (e.g., the testimony of the prosecutor at the first trial, and Deputy Starr) and (2) the court thereafter determines that the facts are undisputed and give rise to only one reasonable inference.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Otherwise, the issue must be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>R <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Therefore, consistent with a long line of cases and clear statutory directives, we hold that whenever <em>any </em>plea of once in jeopardy presents a question of material fact, it must be resolved by a jury, unless a jury trial is waived. (\u00a7\u00a7 1041, subd. 3, 1042.)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Other circumstances related to the plea \u2014 such as the specific theory of double jeopardy on which the plea is based \u2014 are not independently relevant to whether a jury trial is required under the undifferentiated language of sections 1041, subdivision 3 and 1042. As a result, it is inconsequential that the factual issue underlying the pleas in this case (i.e., prosecutorial intent) differs from the one underlying a \u201ctraditional\u201d double jeopardy claim (i.e., identity of offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[W]hen the validity of a conviction depends solely on an unresolved or improperly resolved factual issue which is distinct from issues submitted to the jury, such an issue can be determined at a separate post-judgment hearing and if at such hearing the issue is resolved in favor of the People, the conviction may stand.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Gaines </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 172, 180 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 627, 205 P.3d 1074].) We conclude that such a disposition is appropriate for the error we have identified here.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Consequently, we will conditionally reverse the judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">On remand, the trial court may strike defendants\u2019 pleas without submitting them to a jury only if (1) defendants are first afforded an opportunity to present evidence in support of their pleas and (2) the trial court concludes thereafter that defendants have raised no question of fact (i.e., the facts concerning the pleas are undisputed and there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from those undisputed facts).

Thereafter, if the court concludes that defendants have raised no issue of fact (i.e., the facts concerning the pleas are undisputed and there is only one reasonable inference to be drawn from those undisputed facts), the court may strike defendants\u2019 pleas of once in jeopardy and reinstate the convictions, except the conviction on count 22. If, however, the court concludes there is any issue of fact presented with respect to defendants\u2019 jeopardy pleas (or if no motion to strike is made by the prosecution or the trial court), a jury trial must be held on defendants\u2019 pleas of once in jeopardy. (See Discussion, pt. I.E., <em>ante) </em>At such a trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>defendants would bear the burden of proof.

Hence, we invite the Legislature to consider whether a defendant should have a statutory right to a jury trial on a plea of once in jeopardy that asserts a claim under <em>Kennedy </em>or its progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-12\"> We use the term \u201cKennedy-type\u201d claims to encompass double jeopardy claims that retrial is barred when a mistrial is declared at a defendant\u2019s request because the prosecutor allegedly engaged in certain conduct with a specific intent (e.g., to goad the defense into requesting a retrial or to thwart an acquittal). We acknowledge that cases before <em>Kennedy </em>recognized such claims. (E.g., <em>United States v. Dinitz </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 600, 611 [47 L.Ed.2d 267, 96 S.Ct. 1075].)

However, we need not- decide that issue since a jury trial is compelled by statute. For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that mandating a jury trial by statute in this context is not <em>prohibited </em>by the Constitution. That is, a state legislature may enact greater double jeopardy protections by statute than is constitutionally required. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Homick </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 816, 838 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 289 P.3d 791].)

Because this statutory scheme is constitutionally permissible, it is irrelevant that other constitutional options \u2014 such as removing the issue from the jury \u2014 may have been available. In other words, while the Legislature <em>may </em>have the constitutional power to preclude a jury trial in these circumstances, we cannot conclude such a power has been exercised here. (Cf. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(1891) 92 Cal. 573, 576 [28 P. 688] (conc. opn. of Beatty, C. J.).) Our holding is based solely on the statutes which secure the right to a jury trial here.

Indeed, if we were tasked with creating the law on a blank slate, we would not provide for jury trials of Kennedy-type claims. We believe that resolving such claims is similar to other tasks normally reserved for judges, not juries. But the same can be said of other double jeopardy issues that also require a jury trial. (E.g., <em>Greer, supra, </em>30 Cal.2d at pp. 600-601 [when defendant enters jeopardy plea, jury must decide whether greater and lesser offenses were based on same act], overruled on another point in <em>People v.

The fact that resolving <em>Kennedy-type </em>claims seems to us to be a classic judicial function provides no basis for distinguishing them from other double jeopardy claims, which also seem best suited for judicial resolution yet undoubtedly require a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> Of course, this is only true where the judge who presided over the mistrial also presides over the subsequent proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> Earlier cases suggested that the absurd consequences doctrine does not apply when the Legislature\u2019s intent is clearly apparent from the language of the statute. <em>(In re Estate of Letchworth </em>(1927) 201 Cal. 1, 8 [255 P. 195].) Even some more recent cases have suggested that courts should <em>only </em>resort to the absurd consequences rule if the plain language of the statute fails to reveal a clear meaning.

Joseph argues that jurors can be instructed to disregard jeopardy evidence when they are making the later guilt determination. We do not agree that this is a viable option. By definition, a mistrial will have been declared before any Kennedy-type claim is made. And mistrials should only be granted if the prejudice is \u201cincurable by admonition or instruction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendibles </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1277, 1310-1311 [245 Cal.Rptr. 553].)

Preciado, supra, </em>31 Cal.App. at p. 532.) Conversely, when limiting the parties to particular types of evidence (e.g., declarations, transcripts, offers of proof, etc.) will not hamper a defendant\u2019s ability to raise an issue of fact in support of the plea, a formal evidentiary hearing may be unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\"> Alternatively, the court may also strike the pleas if defendants present no evidence whatsoever.

The issue of jeopardy is \u201c \u2018 \u201cdistinct from issues submitted to the jury\u201d \u2019 \u201d at the second trial (i.e., guilt or innocence). <em>{People v.

The Attorney General argues that once defendants make a nonfrivolous showing, the burden shifts to the prosecution to disprove the pleas by a preponderance of the evidence. The Attorney General relies solely on <em>People v.
