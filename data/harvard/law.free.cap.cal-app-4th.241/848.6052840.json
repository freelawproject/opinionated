J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar0\">Valentino Bocanegra alleges that he was arrested on a warrant for a man with a similar but by no means identical name. Even though Bocanegra repeatedly told the authorities that they had the wrong man and noted that his driver\u2019s license, Social Security number, booking photos, and fingerprints would all prove this, he remained in jail for nine days. While incarcerated, he was forcibly sodomized by another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">This appeal concerns just one of the multiple defendants who Bocanegra contends were responsible for his plight: Donald Jakubowski, a deputy district attorney who, according to Bocanegra, negligently failed to determine his true identity and tried to prevent him from ultimately being released. The trial court sustained Jakubowski\u2019s demurrer, which was based on several alternative governmental immunity statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">We will affirm. In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that Bocanegra adequately alleged that Jakubowski was liable for false imprisonment; we will also hold that statutory prosecutorial immunity (Gov. Code, \u00a7 821.6) did not apply to the false imprisonment claim. However, the demurrer had to be sustained based on common law prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">Consistent with the applicable standard of review (see pt. Ill, <em>post), </em>the following facts are drawn from the allegations of the operative complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>On July 16, 2011, Palm Springs police officers conducted a traffic stop of a car that Bocanegra was driving. He was cooperative. He produced his driver\u2019s license, showing his name as \u201cJose M. Gonzalezbocanegra.\u201d The officers then arrested him on the theory that he was Jose Gonzalez (with no middle initial), the person named in an outstanding arrest warrant for a misdemeanor parole violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Bocanegra was booked into a Palm Springs holding facility, then transferred into and booked again at the Banning sheriff\u2019s station, then transferred into and booked yet again at the Riverside County jail, and finally transferred into and booked at the Los Angeles County jail. He was repeatedly subjected to harmful and offensive touchings, in the form of painful and/or prolonged handcuffing. Throughout this process, Bocanegra protested that he was not the Jose Gonzalez named in the warrant, and that his driver\u2019s license, Social Security number, fingerprints, and booking photos would prove this, but to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Jakubowski was a deputy district attorney for the County of Los Angeles. Starting on July 20, 2011, Jakubowski had the opportunity to free Bocanegra. Jakubowski had a file that included Bocanegra\u2019s driver\u2019s license, Social Security number, fingerprints, and booking photos, as well as fingerprints and booking photos of the person named in the warrant. Thus, Jakubowski was on notice that Bocanegra was wrongfully imprisoned, in that a reasonable person in his position would have inquired into the validity of the imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Meanwhile, Jakubowski did not promptly turn over these exculpatory items to Bocanegra\u2019s defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Bocanegra had a court date scheduled for July 21, 2011. His attorney was going to be there and could have secured his release. Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputies, however, did not let him attend the hearing. Bocanegra \u201cvociferously complained\u201d about this.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">That night, Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s deputies placed Bocanegra in a cell with a violent sexual predator, who proceeded to forcibly sodomize him. These deputies were retaliating against Bocanegra for his complaints; they intended \u201cthat some unwanted sexual attack take place in the manner that it did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">On July 25, 2011, Bocanegra finally had his first court appearance. Jakubowski was present; he argued to the court that Bocanegra was, in fact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>the person named in the warrant and should not be released. The judge, however, examined Bocanegra\u2019s booking photographs and fingerprints, realized he was not the person named in the warrant, and released him. The judge even apologized to Bocanegra from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The operative (i.e., second amended) complaint named as defendants the City of Palm Springs, the County of Riverside, a Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s deputy named Pfeiffer, the County of Los Angeles, and Jakubowski. As against Jakubowski, it asserted causes of action for false imprisonment, assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Jakubowski filed a demurrer, arguing that he was statutorily immune under Government Code sections 820.2, 820.8, and 821.6. The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. It therefore entered judgment against Bocanegra and in favor of Jakubowski.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">A demurrer should be sustained when \u201c[t]he pleading does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">\u201cOur standard of review of an order sustaining a demurrer is well settled. We independently review the ruling on demurrer and determine de novo whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action. [Citation.] In doing so, we \u2018give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] Further, we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but do not assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Parthemore v. Col </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1372, 1378 [165 Cal.Rptr.3d 367].)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 821.6</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Bocanegra contends that Jakubowski was not immune under Government Code section 821.6, as construed in <em>Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 710 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527 P.2d 865] <em>(Sullivan).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Government Code section 821.6 provides: \u201cA public employee is not liable for injury caused by his instituting or prosecuting any judicial or administrative proceeding within the scope of his employment, even if he acts maliciously and without probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The trial court properly sustained the demurrer to the causes of action for assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence based on Government Code section 821.6. Indeed, Bocanegra does not argue otherwise. He does argue, however, that under <em>Sullivan, </em>it erred by sustaining the demurrer to the false imprisonment cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">In <em>Sullivan, </em>the plaintiff sued a county for false imprisonment, alleging that he had been held in jail for 12 days beyond the date on which he was entitled to be released. <em>(Sullivan, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 714.) The trial court entered judgment on the pleadings, citing Government Code section 821.6. <em>(Sullivan, </em>at p. 715.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The Supreme Court began by holding that, if the sheriff was liable for false imprisonment, then the county was derivatively liable under Government Code section 815.2. <em>(Sullivan, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 717.) It also held that the plaintiff had alleged sufficient facts to hold the sheriff liable for false imprisonment \u2014 namely, that the sheriff knew or should have known that the imprisonment was unlawful. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 717-719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Finally, the court also held that the sheriff was not entitled to immunity under Government Code section 821.6, for two reasons. <em>(Sullivan, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 719-722.) First, it relied on the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of Government Code section 821.6: \u201c \u2018[institute\u2019 means \u2018to originate and get established . . . \u2018to initiate,\u2019 and \u2018prosecute\u2019 means \u2018to institute legal proceedings against; <em>esp: </em>to accuse of some crime or breach of law or to pursue for redress or punishment of a crime or violation of law in due legal form before a legal tribunal.\u2019 Thus, viewed literally, the language of the section does not reach the act of holding a person in jail beyond his term.\u201d <em>(Sullivan, </em>at p. 719.) Second, after reviewing the legislative history of Government Code section 821.6, it concluded \u201cthat the Legislature intended the section to protect public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>employees from liability only for <em>malicious prosecution </em>and not for <em>false imprisonment.\u201d </em>(Sullivan, at p. 719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Jakubowski argues that <em>Sullivan </em>\u201cdoes not apply\u201d because it dealt with a sheriff rather than a prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">If he is referring to Sullivan\u2019s holding that Government Code section 821.6 does not apply to false imprisonment, this is a distinction without a difference. The court\u2019s reasoning on this point had nothing to do with whether the defendant was a sheriff, a prosecutor, or any other particular type of public employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Actually, however, Jakubowski seems to be referring to <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>holding that the plaintiff there had alleged sufficient facts to hold the sheriff liable for false imprisonment. Thus, Jakubowski argues that he \u201cdid not arrest Appellant [and] he did not confine Appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Jakubowski did not demur on the ground that the complaint failed to state a cause of action for false imprisonment. Nevertheless, \u201c[t]he failure of a pleading to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action is not waived by a failure to demur and may be raised for the first time on appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Andrews v. Mobile Aire Estates </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 578, 585, fn. 5 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 832]; see <em>Buford </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 811, 826 [164 Cal.Rptr. 264].)</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">\u201cFalse imprisonment involves the intentional confinement of another against the person\u2019s will. The elements are (1) nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person, (2) without lawful privilege, (3) for an appreciable period of time, however brief. [Citations.]\u201d (5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Torts \u00a7 426, pp. 642-643.) As <em>Sullivan </em>illustrates, it is not limited to the initial confinement of the victim. Under section 45 of the Restatement Second of Torts, \u201cIf the actor is under a duty to release the other from confinement, ... his refusal to do so with the intention of confining the other is a sufficient act of confinement to make him subject to liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">\u201cAlthough false imprisonment is an intentional tort because it entails an intentional act resulting in confinement, it can arise through negligence.\u201d <em>(Lyons v. Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 880, 888 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 649].) For example, if \u201ca store employee honestly but mistakenly detains a customer the employee believes is a shoplifter[, negligent wrongful detention could be found if the store employee detains the customer without reasonable cause. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">As <em>Sullivan </em>noted, a police officer can be liable for false imprisonment based not only on an initial arrest, but also on prolongation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>imprisonment after the arrest. <em>(Sullivan, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at pp. 717-719, citing <em>Shakespeare </em>v. <em>City of Pasadena </em>(1964) 230 Cal.App.2d 375, 386 [40 Cal.Rptr. 863] and <em>Whirl </em>v. <em>Kern </em>(5th Cir. 1968) 407 F.2d 781, 792.) \u201cThe test requires either that the [officer] have actual knowledge that the imprisonment of the plaintiff is unlawful or alternatively that he have some notice sufficient to put him, as a reasonable man, under a duty to investigate the validity of the incarceration. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Sullivan, </em>at p. 719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In <em>Hamilton v. City of San Diego </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 838 [266 Cal.Rptr. 215], the court recognized that the prosecutor assigned to an arrestee\u2019s case has a similar duty. It stated; \u201cPolice officers do have affirmative duties. They must, without unnecessary delay, take the arrested person before a committing magistrate to be charged with the offense and have bail set as any unnecessary delay may amount to false imprisonment. [Citation.] There is also an affirmative duty placed on the district attorney. Once he or she has filed a complaint, it is his or her responsibility to gather and present such evidence as will both convict the guilty or exonerate the innocent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 846, fn. 7.) More generally, it has been stated that \u201c[a]lthough a prosecutor \u2018may strike hard blows, he [or she] is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his [or her] duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 302, 316-317 [177 Cal.Rptr.3d 231].) Here, the complaint alleged that Jakubowski should have known that Bocanegra was wrongfully imprisoned. If so, he had a duty to bring about his release, and his failure to do so was a tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We therefore conclude that the complaint adequately alleged a cause of action against Jakubowski for false imprisonment. Solely with respect to this cause of action, Jakubowski was not immune under Government Code section 821.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">COMMON LAW PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">As noted, the demurrer was based on various statutory immunities. However, we requested further briefing on whether the complaint was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>demurrer based on common law prosecutorial immunity. Having received and reviewed such further briefing, we conclude that the demurrer had to be sustained based on common law prosecutorial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">\u201c \u2018As a general rule a party is not permitted to change its position on appeal and raise new issues not presented in the trial court. [Citation.] . . . However, \u201ca litigant may raise for the first time on appeal a pure question of law which is presented by undisputed facts.\u201d [Citation.] A demurrer is directed to the face of a complaint [citation] and it raises only questions of law [citations]. Thus an appellant challenging the sustaining of a general demurrer may change his or her theory on appeal [citation], and an appellate court can affirm or reverse the ruling on new grounds. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Sa<em>nchez v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1778, 1787 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 812]; accord, <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>San Mateo County Sheriff\u2019s Dept. </em>(2014) 232 Cal.App.4th 995, 1006 [181 Cal.Rptr.3d 816].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\u201cIt is well established judges are granted immunity from civil suit in the exercise of their judicial functions. [Citations.] This rule applies even where the judge\u2019s acts are alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly. [Citations.] . . . Judicial immunity is a principle of common law which is necessary for the welfare of the state and the peace and happiness of society. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Frost v. Geernaert </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1107-1108 [246 Cal.Rptr. 440].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cAlmost as venerable as immunity for judges is immunity for prosecutors.\u201d <em>(Falls v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 1031, 1042 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 908].) \u201cWhen a gwas;-judicial officer, such as a prosecutor, acts within his official capacity he, like a <em>judicial </em>officer, enjoys absolute immunity.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1043.) \u201cAs with the reason for granting judicial immunity, quasi-judicial immunity is given to promote uninhibited and independent decisionmaking. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Howard v. Drapkin </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 843, 853 [271 Cal.Rptr. 893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">We recognize that Government Code section 820, subdivision (a), enacted in 1963 as part of the Government Claims Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 810 et seq.), provides that \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute . . . , a public employee is liable for injury caused by his act or omission to the same extent as a private person.\u201d It has been held, however, that the Government Claims Act was not intended to override common law judicial immunity. <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>Pickens </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 708, 716-718 [275 Cal.Rptr. 487] [Fourth Dist., Div. Two]; accord, <em>Frost v. Geernaert, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1108-1110.) It follows that it equally was not intended to override common law quasi-judicial immunity. (See, e.g., <em>Falls v. Superior Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1042-1046 [applying common law prosecutorial immunity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u201cA prosecutor acts within his official capacity when his conduct is an \u2018 \u201cintegral part of the judicial process\u201d \u2019 or \u2018intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Falls </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 1044, italics omitted.) Here, all of Jakubowski\u2019s alleged acts were part of the judicial process. Absolute prosecutorial immunity extends to false imprisonment claims. (See <em>Alicia T. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 876, 880-881 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513] [social worker who removes child from home enjoys absolute \u201cquasiprosecutorial\u201d immunity against claims for false imprisonment].) It also extends to claims based on the willful suppression of exculpatory information. (I<em>mbler v.

Here, by way of the 10th cause of action, plaintiff and appellant, Valentino Bocanegra, sues defendant and respondent, Deputy District Attorney Donald Jakubowski, for false imprisonment. While I agree that it was proper to sustain the demurrer without leave to amend, I do not agree with the majority\u2019s broad brush approach to the issue of prosecutorial immunity and, in particular, its reliance on <em>Alicia T. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 869 [271 Cal.Rptr. 513] for the proposition that a prosecutor is immune from claims of false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">We are dealing with a cause of action for false imprisonment under state law. Our analysis should be guided by Government Code sections 821.6 and 820.4, and the construing case law. The relevant principles are found in <em>Asgari </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 744 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 842, 937 P.2d 273], <em>Sullivan v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 710 [117 Cal.Rptr. 241, 527 P.2d 865], and <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 579 [175 Cal.Rptr. 395],</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">As enunciated in these cases, the determinative factor in distinguishing between malicious prosecution, for which an absolute immunity exists under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>Government Code section 821.6, and false imprisonment, for which no such immunity exists under Government Code section 820.4, is whether the alleged wrongful conduct is pursuant to valid or lawful process. As stated; \u201c 4 44 \u2018False imprisonment is the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another\u2019 [citation], the interference . . . [being] absolutely unlawful and without authority ....\u201d\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018 \u201cMalicious prosecution is procuring the arrest or prosecution of another under lawful process, but from malicious motives and without probable cause.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Even though each tort may cause a person to be restrained or confined, each remains distinct, protecting different personal interests. False imprisonment protects the personal interest in freedom from restraint of movement; malicious prosecution protects the personal interest in freedom from unjustifiable litigation. [Citation.] When a person \u2018 \u201c \u2018is arrested or confined without a warrant, or legal authority apart from a warrant, malicious prosecution will not lie, since the essence of that tort is the perversion of proper legal procedure, and the remedy is false imprisonment. On the other hand, if there is valid process or due authority apart from it, the arrest is not \u201cfalse\u201d and the action must be one of malicious prosecution.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Jackson v. City of San Diego, supra, </em>121 Cal.App.3d at p. 585.) \u201c \u2018False arrest or imprisonment and malicious prosecution are mutually inconsistent concepts, the former relating to conduct that is without valid legal authority and the latter to conduct where there is valid process or due authority.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Asgari </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">If the present allegations could be viewed as raising an issue of whether defendant\u2019s alleged wrongful conduct constituted malicious prosecution or false imprisonment, we would be dealing with whether his alleged wrongful conduct was pursuant to valid process or due authority. If his actions occurred under lawful process, but he acted with malicious motives and without probable cause, he would be liable for malicious prosecution but be immune under Government Code section 821.6. If, on the other hand, he was not acting pursuant to valid process or due authority, he could be found liable for false imprisonment for which there is no immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">That said, it is evident that the 10th cause of action fails to state sufficient facts to support a false imprisonment theory against defendant. From the second amended complaint it is clear that plaintiff was arrested pursuant to an outstanding bench warrant. Under Penal Code section 980, a clerk of the court issues a bench warrant \u201cafter the order for a bench warrant is made.\u201d While a bench warrant may be requested by a district attorney, there are no facts pled that defendant or a district attorney had any role in the request to issue a bench warrant or the execution of the warrant. As such, there are no allegations that defendant instigated or played any role in the initial detention of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>\u201cAs a rule, one has no duty to come to the aid of another. A person who has not created a peril is not liable in tort merely for failure to take affirmative action to assist or protect another unless there is some relationship between them which gives rise to a duty to act.\u201d <em>(Williams v. State of California </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 18, 23 [192 Cal.Rptr. 233, 664 P.2d 137].) Here, \u201cplaintiff has not stated a cause of action in that [he] fails to establish a duty of care owed by defendant .... The [prosecutor] did not create the peril in which plaintiff found [himself]; [he] took no affirmative action which contributed to, increased, or changed the risk which would have otherwise existed; there is no indication that [he] voluntarily assumed any responsibility to protect plaintiff[] . . . ; and there are no allegations of the requisite factors to a finding of special relationship, namely detrimental reliance by the plaintiff on the [prosecutor\u2019s] conduct, statements made by [him] which induced a false sense of security and thereby worsened [his] position.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 27-28, fn. omitted.) As such, the 10th cause of action fails to state sufficient facts relative to the duty to state a viable cause of action against defendant. The demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied February 17, 2016, S231021.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
