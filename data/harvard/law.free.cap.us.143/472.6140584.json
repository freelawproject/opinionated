(2) Does an examination of the entire record and proceedings affirmatively establish the facts set forth in the petition for the writ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>I. In determining the question of jurisdiction in the court below, is the examination by this court limited to any particular portion of the proceedings, or is the examination coextensive with the examination and acts of the.condemning court?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">The issuing of writs of prohibition is part of the appellate jurisdiction of this court, and in its exercise, the superior court not only may but must, it is submitted, revise and review the whole proceedings of the inferior court of admiralty. The same matter, showing want of jurisdiction, which may be averred before sentence, as good ground of prohibition, must, if proved in the proceedings of the inferior court furnish good ground for prohibition after sentence. This is well illustrated by comparing the case of <em>The </em>Cassinos, 2 Dali. 365, with that of <em>The Exchange, </em>7 Oranch, 116.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">It was urged, at the former argument upon motion for leave to file, that the phrasethe face of the proceedings \u201d meant the libel, or pleadings, at most, and not the entire proceedings, and several early English cases were cited as supporting that view, but it is submitted that they do not, in any sense, so incline. On the contrary,.that the court will examine the entire proceedings and pass upon all questions going to the jurisdiction of the court below, upon which that court did or could pass, abundantly appears by a series of decisions, the accuracy of which has never been questioned, and \u25a0 the authority of which is -undoubted. <em>Jones </em>v.

Upon the face of the proceedings all the facts averred in the petition fully appear. The record nowhere discloses that- the Say ward wag ever, at any time prior to the seizure, at a-closer proximity to any shores, of the United States than ten miles; and there is no evidence of the killing of seal- by the master or crew of the vessel at any particular place. The positions of the vessel are given in her log, and upon reference to the official map of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as shown 'by the certificate of the officer in charge thereof, the nearest of said positions to any land was ten miles, and the pass of the four mountains through which she entered the Behring Sea is twenty-two miles wide between land at its narrowest point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-5\">In this connection the language of this court applicable to fancied evidence becomes appropriate: \u201cThe rule in such cases is, that if there be a total defeet of evidence to prove the essential fact, and the court find it without proof, the action of the court is void.\u201d <em>Lamp Ghinmey Go. </em>v. <em>Brass &lt;&amp; Copper </em>Go., 91 U. S. 656,. 659. And, as said in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Co eking, </em>9 B. &amp; S. 503, 509, a case of prohibition before referred to, \u201c if it decides without evidence that a case is within its jurisdiction . . . this court will interfere.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-6\">The petitioner\u2019s case is not weakened by the narrower contention as to the face of the proceedings made by the respondent in his return to the rule. That this vessel was a British vessel, appears on the face of the libel wherein she is described as \u201cschooner <em>W. </em>P. Say ward of Victoria, B. C., of 59 and xVir tons burden as per register.\u201d That the place of seizure and the place, of the offence was on the high seas appears on the face of this so-called final record. The libel alleged that said seizure was made \u201c within the waters of that portion of Behring Sea belonging to the United States,\u201d and that the vessel, her captain and crew, were \u201cthen and there\u201d found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>engaged in killing fur seals \u201cin said waters.\u201d It is confidently submitted, as matter of law,\" that no portion of Behring Sea belongs to the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-5\">III. When Congress, in sebtion 1956 of the Revised Stat-( utes, speaks of \u201c Alaska Territory and the waters thereof,\u201d it can only mean (as far as the sea is concerned) three miles or a marine league from the shore of the continent of America, or from the shores of one of the adjacent islands, which is all that can be claimed under treaty or the law of nations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-6\">The amendatory act of March 3, 1889, does not in any way enlarge the effect of section 1956, because we can get no light bn the meaning of the words \u201c all the dominion of the United States in the waters of Behring Sea \u201d from the words of the treaty, and because the law of .nations limits the \u201c dominion \u201d of any nation in the waters of any sea to three miles or a marine league from the shore.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-7\">Assuming that the court is bound to follow and execute the law as laid down by Congress, it still remains clear that Congress never contemplated the exclusion of the vessels of other nations from the right of navigation and fishing outside of our territorial waters bounded by the marine league, and that there was no law for.the seizure by the Secretary of the Treasury of a British vessel so engaged. From the public proceed-' ings of the two Houses of Congress, it appears that the Senate distinctly refused to define the extent, of the dominion of the United States in Behring Sea, and that the House consented to abandon its purpose to define that extent by municipal law; while the act of Congress of March 3, 1889, representing the final determination of Congress not to undertake to define the extent of the dominion of the United Spates in Behring Sea was approved by the President.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-8\">IY.

The power and duty of this court to decide whether the Alaska court had or had not jurisdiction, cannot be affected by any action of the executive. The political departments of the government having before them the- question of \u201c the extent of the dominion of the United States in the Behring Sea,\u201d which they could, doubtless, by conjoint action have determined so as to bind the courts, have chosen neither to - determine the extent of the dominion of the United States nor to make any provision of law by which that extent is to be determined by the executive. The determination qf that extent is, therefore, by the Constitution and laws of the United States .made a duty of this court in the case at bar, involving the legality of the seizure and condemnation of a foreign vessel, alleged to be in violation of the law of nations, and without^ any warrant of any law of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-6\">The question of the legality of the seizure of British vessels in Behring Sea by the United States is a question of law, not only under the law of nations, but under the municipal law of the United States.

And it is insisted that when Congress in section 1956 speaks of \u201c Alaska Territory \u201d and \u201c the waters thereof,\u201d it could only mean, so -far as the sea was concerned, three miles or a marine league from the shore of the continent, or from the shores of one of the adjacent islands, and that the act of March 2, 1889, does not in .any way enlarge the effect of section 1956, because \u201cthe dominion of the United States in the yaters of Behring Sea\u201d is limited by the law of nations to the distance from the shore above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">If we assume that the record shows the .locality qf .the alleged offence and seizure as-stated, it also shows that officers of the United States, acting under the orders of their government, seized this vessel engaged in catching seal and took her into the nearest port; and that the law. officers of the'government. libelled her and proceeded against her for the violation <em>\u25a0of </em>the laws of the.United States,.in the District Court, resulting in her condemnation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>How did it happen that, the officers .received such orders? It must be admitted that they were given in the assertion on the part of this government of territorial jurisdiction over. Behring Sea to an extent exceeding fifty-nine miles from the .shores of Alaska; that this territorial jurisdiction, in the enforcement of the laws protecting seal fisheries, was asserted by actual seizures during the seasons of 1886, 1887 and'1889, of a number of British vessels; that the government persistently maintains that such jurisdiction belongs to it, based not only on the peculiar nature of the seal fisheries and the property of the government in them, but also upon the position that this jurisdiction was asserted by Russia for more than ninety years, and by that government transferred to the United States; and that negotiations are pending upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">While it is conceded that in matters committed :by the-Constitution and laws of the United States either to Congress or to the executive, or to both, courts are clearly bound by the action of Congress or the executive, or both, within the limits of the authority conferred by the Constitution and laws, yet it is insisted that Congress and the executive, constituting the political departments of the government, having.before them the question \u201c of the extent of the dominion of the United States in the Behring Sea,\u201d which they could doubtless by conjoint action determine so as to bindPhe courts, have chosen neither to determine that extent nor to make any provision of law by which it is devolved on the executive to determine it, and that, therefore, it is the duty of this court in the case at bar, involving the legality of the seizure and condemnation of a foreign vessel alleged to be in violation of the law of nations and without warrant of any law of the United States to determine the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Assuming that the executive alone can speak so as to bind \u2022our courts in respect of the sovereignty .of foreign territory, the changes in foreign governments,.the existence of civil war in foreign countries, and the character of &lt;a foreign minister, coun'sel nevertheless confidently assert \u201c that without the clear authority of the law of Congress, the executive can never, by determining a so-called political question or by construing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>act of Congress or a treaty, conclude the rights of persons or property under the protection- of the Constitution and laws of the United States, or conclude the courts of the United States in a determination of these rights; and <em>Little </em>v. <em>Barreme, </em>2 Cranch, 170, 177, and <em>United States </em>v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407, 418, are cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">In <em>Little </em>v. <em>Barreme, </em>the legality of the seizure of a- French vessel, coming from a French port, on the high seas, by the orders of the President, purporting to be issued under an act of Congress authorizing the seizure of vessels bound to a French port, but not those coming from a French port, ivas involved, -and Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201c It is by no means clear that the President' of the United States, whoso high duty it is to \u2018 take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\u2019 and who is commander-in-chief of. the armies and navies of. the United States, might not, without any special authority for that purpose,- in the then existing state \u00f3f things, have empowered the officers commanding the armed vessels of the United States, to seize and send into port for adjudication <em>American </em>vessels which were forfeited by being engaged in .this illicit commerce. But' when it is observed that the general clause\u201eof this first section of the act, which declares \u2018 that such vessels \u00bfray be seized, and may be prosecuted in any District or Circuit Court, which shall be h'olden within or for the district where the seizure shall be made,\u2019 obviously contemplates a seizure within the United <em>States; </em>and that the fifth section gives a special authority to seize on the high seas, and limits that authority to the seizure of vessels bound or sailing <em>to </em>a French port, the legislature seem to- ha,Ve prescribed that the manner in which this law \u2022shall be .carried into execution, was to exclude a seizure of any vessel not bound <em>to </em>a French port. Of consequence, however strong the circumstances might be, which induced Captain \u25a0 Little to suspect the Flying-Fish to be an' American vessel, they could not excuse the detention \"of her, since he would not \u2018 have been authorized to detain, her had she. been really American.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>And he states the conclusion of the court to be: \u201c That - the instructions cannot change the nature of the \"transaction, nor legalize an act which, without those instructions, would have been a plain trespass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rauscher, </em>it appeared that the United States asserted the right under the law of nations to try persons extradited from Great Britain for offences other than those for which they were extradited, while Great Britain insisted that no such right existed .under the law of nations or was conceded by treaty. The question was, whether, under the treaty with Great Britain, a man extradited -from England to this country on the charge of murder could be tried here for another' offence, and it was held that he could not be. And Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the court quoted from the. <em>Head Money </em>Cases, 112 U. S. 580, 598, the following language as determinative of the principle upon which the court proceeded: \u201c A treaty is primarily a compact between independent nations. '-It depends for the enforcement of its provisions on the interest and the honor of the governments which are parties to it. If these fail, its infraction becomes the subject- of international negotiations and reclamations, so far as the injured party chooses to seek redress, which may in the end be enforced by actual war. It is obvious that with all this the judicial courts have nothing to do and can give no redress. But a treaty may also contain provisions which confer certain rights upon the citizens or subjects of one of the nations residing in the territorial limits of the other, which partake of the nature of municipal law, and which are capable of enforcement as between private parties in the courts of the country. An illustration of this character is found in treaties which regulate the mutual rights of citizens and subjects of the contracting nations in regard to- rights of \u2018 property by descent or inheritance, when the individuals concerned are aliens. \u25a0 The Constitution of the United States\" places such provisions as these in the same c\u00e1tegory as other laws of Congress, by its declaration that \u00a3 this Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made-or which shall \u25a0be made under authority of the United States, shall be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>supreme law of the land.\u2019 A treaty, then, is a law of the land, as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be determined. And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, that court resorts to the treaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it would to a statute.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">As to- the third section of the' act of March 3, 1889, it is argued, that Congress intentionally declined to determine the extent of the dominion of the United States in the Behring Sea, as- shown by its action during the steps attending the . passage Of the bill. That section, as the bill passed the House, contained the words: \u201c All the waters of' Behring Sea in A la sha embraced within the boundary lines mentioned and described in the treaty with Russia, dated March 30, a.\u00bb. 1867, by which the \u2022 Territory of Alaska was ceded to the United States.\u201d But as finally enacted these words were1 omitted, and the expression \u201c All the dominion of the United States in \u2022the waters of Behring Sea\u201d substituted. Section two of the bill as originally introduced in the Senate contained the words in question, but they were omitted in a substitute adopted by the Senate, and added by the House, by way of amendment,as section three. To this amendment the Senate disagreed, and the section, as it now-stands, was the result of a conference between the two houses. If reference could be properly made to such matters, (for the act, as finally approved, must speak for itself,) still we do not .concur in the view that it follows that Congress thereby expressly invited the judicial branch of the government to determine what are \u201c the limits of Alaska Territory and the waters thereof,\u201d and what is \u201c the dominion of the Unit\u00e9d States in the waters, of Behring Sea,\u201d and think, on the contrary, that there is much force in the position that, whatever the reason for the conservative course pursued by the Senate, the enactment of this section, with\u2019 full knowledge of the executive action.already had and of the diplomatic situation, justified the President in the conclusion that it was his duty, under s\u00e9ction three, .to adhere to the construction already insisted upon as to the .extent of the dominion of the United State's, and to continue to act accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>If this be so, the application calls upon the court, while negotiations are pending, to decide whether the government is right or wrong, and to review the action- of the political departments upon the question, contrary to the settled law in. that regard. <em>Foster </em>v.

He represents no property interest in the vessel, as is sometimes done by consuls, but only a public political interest. We are not insensible. to the* .courtesy implied in the willingness thus manifested that this court should proceed -to a decision on the main question argued for the petitioner; nor do we permit ourselves to doubt that under such circumstances the decision would receive all the consideration that the utmost good faith would require; but it is very clear' that, presented as a political question merely, it would not fall within our province to determine it. ' We allude to this in passing, but not at all with the intention' bf indicating that the suggestion itself diminishes the private rights of the claimant in any degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">We are not to be understood, however, as und\u00e9rrating the weight of the argument that in a case involving private rights, the court may be obliged, if those rights are dependent upon the construction of acts of Congress or of a treaty, and the case turns upon a question, public in its- nature, which has not been determined by the political departments in the form.bf a law specifically settling it, or authorizing the executive to do so, to render-judgment, \u201csince we have no more right to decline the jurisdiction which is \u00bfiven than to usurp that which is not given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">But we need not go farther in this direction, as our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>rests upomnarrower grounds, and we have been led into these observations because, where an application is made, to stay the \u2022 enforcement of a decree three years after its rendition; and after the pendency of an appeal therefrom for the same length of time, (an appeal being allowable, as we shall presently see,) W6 do not- regard the court as constrained to intervene in this way unless, perhaps, upon an irresistible case and adequate 5?ets.on shown for the delay; and particularly not where such iaterventionJAvolves the definition of the line of demarcation, between cobr,donate departments of the government and the determination- of public questions, action in reference to which \u25a0 is appropriately confided to'other departments, than the judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In what has. been said, we have assumed that it appears from the record, properly examinable by us, that the alleged offence was committed more than a marine league from shore; \u25a0 and we now come to consider whether this is the fact. And in doing this, with the view of ascertaining whether the claimant is entitled to be relieved of the payment of $1289.50, which is the amount of the stipulation, the record must be treated as in any other case of private rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As already seen,, prohibition will not go after sentence unless want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings. But it is contended that the face of the proceedings in a case like the present one embraces the evidence. We think, however, that there is a distinction on principle, and sustained by authority, between what is open on prohibition applied for before sentence and what afterwards. Prohibitipn stays what is about to be done, but which ought not t\u00f3 be done without it. Before' judgment, if the court below persist in going on when it should not, the court above can examine, not simply the process and pleadings technically of record, but the facts in evidence upon which action is being taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In <em>Ex parte Christy, </em>3 How. 292, 308, which was an application for a writ of prohibition against the District Court of Louisiana sitting as-a court in bankruptcy, Mr. Justice Story .saidt \u201cSo far as respects these allegations of facts, not' .so found in the; proceedings of .the District Court, We are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>upon the present occasion at liberty to entertain any consideration thereof - for the-purpose of examination \u2022 or decision, as it w.ould-be am-exercise of original jurisdiction on the part of this court not confided to us by law. The application for thfe prohibition is made upon the ground that the District Court has transcended its jurisdiction in .entertaining those proceedings ; and whether it has or -not must' depend, not upon the facts stated <em>dehors </em>the record, but upon those stated in the record upon which the District Court was called to act,-and by which alone it could regulate its judgment.\u201d And this \u2022 language was rep\u00e9atedand approved in <em>Ex parte Easton, </em>95 U. S. 68, where 'prohibition was' asked against a District Court in admiralty. - These were cases where the application was before sentence, and they show thjit the court may consider the evidence as welF-as the other proceedings in the court sought to be restrained. But after final judgment and the lapse of the term, for the Superior Court to enter upon an examination of the evidence upon a suggested defect in the jurisdiction, that is, \u00e1 defect not apparent upon the- face of the record proper, would be for it to rehear the case and direct the court below not to carry its own judgment into effect; for defect of power to try the particular issue rather than of jurisdiction oyer the cause. What the court below could not then do, or omit to do, the court above ought not ordinarily to undertake to compel it to do or to omit.</p>\n<p id=\"AxD8\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>3 Dall. 121, the Cassius, the vessel seized, was under commission by the French government, and was libelled in the District Court of Pennsylvania on account of the seizure of a schooner belonging to libellants upon the high seas, and the libel showed that the schooner had been taken into-Port de Paix, (in the dominions of the French Republic,) which justified the presumption that she was carried there for legal adjudication, and it appeared from the suggestion for the. prohibition that such was the fact, and that \u25a0 therefore the jurisdiction for the adjudication of the libel was in a French and not in an American admiralty court. That was an application before sentence and the court could look into the \u2022 evidence before the District Court if \u2022 necessary,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>though it appears to us that the want of jurisdiction was evident on the face of the libel; and prohibition was accordingly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In <em>Ex parte Ph\u0153nix Insurance Co., </em>118 U. S. 610, 626, it was held that the District Court of the United States in admiralty h\u00e1s no jurisdiction of a petition by the owner of a steam vessel for the trial of the question of his liability for damages caused, to buildings on land by fire alleged to have been negligently communicated to' them by the vessel through sparks proceeding from her smokestack, and for the limitation of such' liability, if existing, under \u00a7\u00a7 4283 arid 4284, Revised Statutes. And Mr. Justice Blatchford, delivering the opinion of the court, said, after citing <em>Ex parte Easton, </em>95 U. S. 68, and <em>Ex parte Gordon, </em>104 U. S. 515: \u201cBut in the present case the District Court is called upon by the petition of the owner of the vessel to first determine the question of any liability, when it has no jurisdiction of the cause of action, and then to determine whether the statute covers the case. The- case is clearly one for a writ of prohibition, as the want of jurisdiction appears on the face of the proceedings. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>3 Dall. 121.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The cases cited in the text-books, High on Extr. Rem., 606; Shortt on Informations, 442, 448, sustain the general view that the evidence is not to be resorted to after sentence. The principle has no application to courts where the proceridings do not show the matter in any formal way, and such are the decisions in England in reference to county and mayor\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">United States District Courts sitting in admiralty are courts \u2022of superior jurisdiction and every intendment is made in favor of their- decrees, so that where it appears that the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter, and that the defendant was duly served with process or voluntarily appeared and made defence, the decree is not open to attack collaterally. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>11 Wall. 268; <em>McCormick </em>v. <em>Sullivant, </em>10 Wheat. 192; <em>Des Moines Nav. Compamy </em>v. <em>Homestead Company, </em>123 U. S. 552; <em>Cuddy, Petitioner, </em>131 U. S. 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">By section 750, Revised Statutes, it is provided: \u201cInequity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>arid admiralty causes only, the process, pleadings- and decree, and such orders and memorandums as may be necessary to show the jurisdiction of the court and regularity o\u00ed the proceedings, shall be entered upon the final record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">' Section 698 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">\u201cUpon the appeal of any cause in. equity, or of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, or of prize or no prize, a transcript of the record, as directed by law to be made, and copies of the proofs, and of such entries and papers on file as may be neces: sary on the hearing of the appeal, shall be transmitted to the Supreme. Court; Provided, That either the court below or the Supreme Court may order any original document or other evidence to be sent up, in addition to the copy of the record, or in lieu of a copy of a part thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In.this section the distinction is recognized between that which constitutes the final record and that which may be made part of the record for the purposes of appeal. Qn appeal all questions properly preserved are open to determination,. while on prohibition the inquiry is confined to the matter of jurisdiction, so that it seems to follow that, unless under very extraordinary circumstances, the record proper should only be looked into in the latter class of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">If the record thus made constitutes the face of the proceedings here, the alleged want of jurisdiction does not appear therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The libel alleges that the seizure was made \u201c within the limits of Alaska Territory and in the waters thereof, and within the civil and judicial District of Alaska, to wit, within the waters of that portion of \u25a0 Behring Sea belonging to the United States and said district, on waters navigable from the sea by vessels of ten or more tons burden.\u201d As it is admitted that the United States lawfully exercises jurisdiction to the extent of three miles from shore over the waters of Behring Sea, the \u2022 allegation of seizure within the jurisdiction is s in-cient. The libel further avers that the vessel and her captain, .officers and crew, \u201c were then and there found engaged in killing fur seals within the limits of Alaska Territory, and in the said waters thereof, in violation of section 1956 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Revised Statutes of the United States.\u201d. Of course, these are the' waters over which the United States lawfully exercises 'jurisdiction, and upon the face of the libel the court had jurisdiction of the forfeiture-and of the offence. The master raised no question of jurisdiction in filing his claim, and the demurrer having been overruled, the answer denied that the seizure was made within the waters described or that the vessel, captain, officers or crew were found engaged in killing fur seal within the limits of Alaska Territory or in the waters thereof, pr that they were then and there violating any law of the United States. Trial having been had the court found that \u201c On the 9th day of July, 1887, and theretofore, the master and crew-of the defendant vessel were engaged in killing and did kill fur seals in that portion of Behring Sea ceded by Russia to the.United States by the treaty of March, 1867, and within the waters of Alaska, in violation of section .1956 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.\u201d This was a finding of the commission of the offence within the jurisdiction stated\u2019 in the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">As.already seen, the first section of the act of May 17,1884, provided, \u201c that the territory ceded to the United States by Russia by .the treaty of March thirtieth, eighteen-hundred and sixty-seven, and known as Alaska,\u201d should constitute a civil and judicial district. And by section 1954 of the Revised Statutes, the laws \u25a0 of the United Stat\u00e9s relating to customs, commerce and navigation were extended \u201c to and over all the main-land, islands and waters of the territory ceded to the United States by the Emperor of Russia by treaty - concluded at Washington on the thirtieth day of March, anno Domini eighteen hundred and sixty-seven.\u201d The finding refers similarly to that portion of Behring Sea ceded by Russia, and states that the killing was \u201c within the waters of Alaska.\u201d' The second and third findings were that the vessel, her furniture, apparel, tackle, cargo and 477 fur-seal skins, were.seized in said waters, that is to say, in the waters of Alaska, by the commanding officer of the United States revenue-cutter Rush, then and there engaged in the revenue marine service of the United States, who was duly commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>sioned by the President of the United States, and made such seizure under the direction and by the authority of the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Upon the face of th\u2018e libel and findings, if the jurisdiction did not extend beyond three \u2022 miles from the shore, the legal inference is that the offence and seizure were within that limit. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Guestier, </em>6 Cranch, 281; <em>The Rio </em>Grande, 23 Wall. 458. The court had power to inquire into the fact upon which jurisdiction depended and its maintenance of jurisdiction involved the conclusion necessary, to sustain it. .</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">If, therefore, the findings of fact are properly part of the face of the proceedings, the want of jurisdiction not only does not appear, but the contrary. The petitioner asked no finding of fact by the court as to the exact locality, but after the findings and conclusion were made and filed, moved in arrest, assigning, among other grounds, \u201c that from the evidence produced on the \u2018 part of the United States it appears that this court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of this cause.\u201d But this motion was not equivalent to a plea in abatement,nor to a declinatory allegation in the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction, nor to a motion for a rehearing.. By the demurrer and answer the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction, and whatever might be his rights upon appeal, the interposition of this motion did not make that a part of the face of the proceedings, which would not have, been so without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Passing from this, however, what is the attitude of the case as to the findings ? Is this court bound by them or not,? Ii so, no reference to the evidence would' bo admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The latter part of section T of the act of May IT, 1884, 23 Stat. 24, 26,' is as follows: \u201cWrits of error in criminal cases shall issue to the said District Court from thq United' States Circuit Court for the District of Oregon in the cases provided in chapter one hundred and seventy-six of the laws of eighter' hundred and seventy-nine; and the jurisdiction thereby-con-., ferred upon Circuit Courts is hereby given to the /Xfircuii Court of Oregon: And the final judgments or decrees of said Circuit and District Court may be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States as in other cases.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>are of opinion that the word Circuit as here used refers to the Circuit Court of Oregon, and, for the purposes of the matter in hand, the clause may be read: \u201c And the final judgments or decrees of said District Court of Alaska may be reviewed by the Supreme Court of the United States as in other cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Under sections 690, 691, 692, 695 and 699, of the Revised Statutes, this court has appellate jurisdiction to reexamine the final judgments of any Circuit Court, or of any District Court acting as a Circuit Court, in civil actions,- wihere the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, exceeds the sum or value of $5000; all final decrees of any Circuit Court, or of any District Court acting as a Circuit Court, in cases of equity and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, within the same limit of amount involved; all final decrees of any District Court in prize causes ; all final, judgments at law and final decrees in equity of any Circuit Court or of any District Court acting as a Circuit. Court, in any case touching patent rights or copyrights; in any civil action brought by the United States for the enforcement of any revenue law thereof; in actions against revenue officers; in cases brought on account of deprivation of fights of citizens or of rights under the Constitution; and in suits for injuries by conspirators against civil rights. Under section 701 this court may affirm, modify or reverse any judgment, decree or order of a Circuit Court, or. District Court acting as a Circuit Court, or of a District Court in prize causes, lawfully brought before it for review, or may direct such judgment, decree or order to be rendered, or such further proceedings to be had by the inferior court as the justice of the case may require. And it is argued that the words \u201cas in other oases,\u201d in section \u00a1 of the act of 1884 can mean nothing else than other cases of appeals from District Courts and District Courts acting as Circuit Courts; and that the right of appeal from the decrees of District Courts is confined to prize causes under section 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u25a0 It is said that if there could be such a thing as an appeal from the District Court of Alaska in an ordinary admiralty case direct to this court, this court would be obliged to try the case <em>de </em>novo/ that the District Court of Alaska, sitting as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>admiralty court, would supply and take the place of a Circuit Court in admiralty sitting in appeal, although all the statutes authorizing District Courts to exercise the functions 0f Circuit Courts expressly exclude the power of appeal; that the only foundation of a-right of appeal from the Alaska court, based upon this right to exercise the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court, is section 692 of the Eevised Statutes, and that only extends to the final decrees of such District Court when exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court, while the exercise of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction by the District Court for Alaska was, by the act creating it and the Eevised Statutes, the exercise of purely District Court-jurisdiction as such; nor could the Alaska court be supposed to have acted in the exercise of both jurisdictions, as the only admiralty and maritime jurisdiction which belongs to the Circuit Courts is appellate.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">But the District Court of Alaska is not alone a District Court of the United States, and a District Court exercising Circuit Court powers; it is also a court of general law and equity jurisdiction. If the contention of petitioner were correct, any power of review in this court over judgments and decrees of the Alaska court in law and equity, except when entered as a Circuit Court, would be excluded. We do not think it was the intention of Congress to give such finality to its judgments and decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">It seems to us that the words <em>\u201c </em>as in other cases \u201d mean, as in similar cases from other courts; and we concur in the construction contended for on the part of the respondent, that the meaning of the provision is, that this court may review the final judgments or degrees of the District Court of Alaska as in cases of the same kind from other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The act of February 16, 1875, (18 Stat. 315,) provides that Circuit Courts of the United States' in deciding causes of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.on the instance side of the court, shall find the facts and the conclusions of law upon which it renders its judgments of decrees, and shall state the facts and conclusions of law separately. And the review of the judgments or decrees entered upon such findings, by this court, upon appeal, is \u201c limited to a determination of the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tions o\u00ed law arising npon the record, and to such - rulings of the Circuit Court, excepted to at the time, as may be presented by a bill of exceptions prepared as in actions at law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In <em>Durousseau </em>v. <em>United States, 6 </em>Cranch, 307, 315, the effect of section ten of the Judiciary Act of 1789, (1 Stat. -73, 77,) was under consideration. The section provided \u201cthat'the District Court in Kentucky District\u201d should, in addition to the ordinary jurisdiction of a District Court, \u201c have jurisdiction of all other causes, except of appeals and writs of error hereinafter made, cognizable in a Circuit Court, and shall proceed therein in the same manner as a Circuit Court, and writs of error and appeals shall lie from decisions therein to the Supreme Court in the same causes, as from a Circuit Court to the Supreme Court, and under the same regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">It was argued that under this provision the writs of error and appeals provided were intended to lie only from cases in- which the District Court acted as a Circuit Court. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, delivering the opinion of the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201c It would be difficult to conceive an intention in the legislature to discriminate \u2022 between judgments rendered by the District Court of Kentucky, while exercising the powers of a District Court, and those. rendered by the same court, while exercising circuit powers, when it is demonstrated that the legislature makes no distinction in the cases from their nature and character. Causes of which the District Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction are carried -into the Circuit Courts, and then become the objects of' the appellate jurisdiction of this court. It would be strange if, in a case where the powers of the two courts are united in one court, from whose judgments an appeal lies, causes, of which the District Courts have exclusive original jurisdiction, should be excepted from the operation of the appellate power. It would require plain words to establish this construction. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al0\"><em>\u201c </em>The plain meaning of these words is, that wherever the District Court decides a cause which, if decided in a Circuit Court, either in an original suit, or on an appeal, would be subject to a writ of error from the Supreme Court, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ment of the District. Court shall, in like manner, be subject to a writ of error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In our view, that decision is in point and is decisive. We hold that an appeal lay to this court from the decree in question, and, further, that the act of 1875 applies, and that, the District Court having found the facts, we should be limited, on appeal, in the consideration of the case, to the questions of law presented on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Upon the face of the libel, the facts found and the final decree, the District Court clearly had jurisdiction. This petitioner had a remedy by appeal from that decree, which was inefficacious because of his neglect to have included in those findings the fact of the exact locality of the offence and seizure.. Such being the case, the writ of prohibition prayed for should not issue, even if, under any. circumstances, the court could consider the evidence taken below in determining whether a .prohibition should issue after sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>Rule discharged and prohibition denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-7\">Me.- Justice Field dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
