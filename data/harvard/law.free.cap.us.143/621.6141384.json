Before considering the demurrers it seems to us proper that the preliminary question should be called to the attention of the court whether the State of Texas is suable in this cause. As' a Statte cannot be sued without its express consent the inquiry is whether the defendant has authorized this suit to be instituted and prosecuted against it. In o\u00fcr opinion it is not a matter- 'of choice of tribunals or expediency- of interposing the privilege of exemption from suit, but it involves the jurisdiction of the court, and upon it depends the validity of-any d\u00e9cree which, may be rendered. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. 651.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-6\">At no time has the State of Texas expressed its consent to this suit. Neither the executive nor any other officer has authority to consent that the State should be sued, and it does not appear that such authority has been conferred upon the governor by statute : so that, although an appearance has been entered, the question is still open whether the State is suable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-7\"><em>We </em>do .not overlook the settled rule'that in cases in which a State shall be a' party, in which this court has original- jurisdiction, the adoption of the Constitution gave the consent of the States, to be sued. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. 657; in this case, however, as we shall hereafter attempt to show, this provision of the Constitution is inapplicable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>13 How. 40, and note by Chief Justice Taney on page 52; <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>17 How. 478.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b642-8\">II. \u25a0 The first demurrer suggests not only that the question is in its nature political but that, contrary to the rul\u00e9 governing controversies between two States of the Union,-it is such a political question that this court, cannot judicially determine it in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>tion. That a controversy respecting the boundary between two independent nations is a political and not a judicial question is well settled, A question like this respecting the boun-. daries of nations, is, as has .been truly said, more a political' than a legal question ; and in its discussion the courts of every country must respect the pronounced will of the legislature. \u201c The judiciary is not that department of the government to which the assertion of its interests against foreign powers is confided.\u201d <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Ffeilson, </em>2 Pet. 253, 306; <em>Cherokee Ffation </em>v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo, </em>6 Pet. 691, 110 ; <em>Garcia </em>v. Lee, 12 Pet.. 511.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-4\">This rule undoubtedly applied to the treatyof 1819 between the United States and Spain, to that of 1832. between the .United States and Mexico and to that of 1838 between the United States and the Pepublic of Texas, when they were respectively ratified, and no reason is perceived why, after Texas was admitted into the Union, a different principle should control. The several treaties remain intact and are the contracts which define and regulate the relations of the contracting powers. <em>Wilson </em>v. Wall, 6 Wall. 83, 87.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-5\">So, also, the method or tribunal provided by the treaty for the settlement of differences arising thereunder must be re-\u201d sorted to; and as the treaties under consideration stipulate that the boundary shall be determined and marked by commissioners appointed by the respective powers, certainly not a judicial tribunal, it is evident that in its inception \"the question was political, to be adjusted according to the course of nations, and so remains. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>8 Wheat. 1; <em>United States </em>v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b643-6\">But if the court shall be of opinion that this controversy, coming over from a time when the two governments were independent, is not a political question to be determined upon principles of law applicable to nations, but is analogous to boundary differences, between States of the Union Of which the court has original jurisdiction, <em>(Florida </em>v. Georgia,. 17 How. 478; <em>Rhode Isla/nd </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. -657; <em>Alabama </em>v. Georgia, 23 How. 505, 510; <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>11 Wall. 39;) then it is submitted that the judicial.power; \u00f3f the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>United States, and especially the original jurisdiction of this court, does not extend to controversies between the United States and an individual State.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-4\">III. As to. the contention embodied in the second ground of demurrer, the Constitution provides that the judicial power shall extend to controversies to which the \u201c United States shall be \u00e1 party; \u201d to \u201c controversies between two or more States;\u201d \u201cbetween a State and citizens of another State,\u201d and \u201c between a State or the citizens thereof, and foreign States, citizens \u25a0 or subjects.\u201d The Supreme Court, by the clause immediately following, is given original jurisdiction only in \u201c.cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a State shall be a party.\u201d- It is to be noticed that wherever a State is mentioned in the clause declaring, the extent of the judicial power, the opposite party to the controversy is also mentioned and in no instance does it include the United States. In other words, the parties with whom the separate States can'have legal controversies cognizable in the courts of the United States by reason &gt;of the parties thereto, are distinctly named and all others are necessarily excluded. Keeping in view the Eleventh Amendment, it has been justly, said, so far as the present question is concerned, that the controversies over which the United States courts'are given jurisdiction are \u201cthose to which the United States might be a party; those to which a\" State of the Union might be a party, <em>where the opposite party was another State of the UnionS </em>2 Curtis Hist. Const. 444.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-5\">The clause establishing the judicial power is arr\u00e1nged by subjects and parties, carefully and accurately grouped, and the cases in which the United States shall be a party are distinctly .separated from those in which a State may be. The cases of which.this court has original jurisdiction' are defined' alone by reference to the parties and only two classes of cases are included,; namely: those affecting ambassadors,other public ministers and consuls, and those in.which a State, in cases over which the judicial power is by the' preceding clause extended; -shall be a party. In aH the other cases mentioned the. jurisdiction' is declared to be appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>late. It seems manifest to us, therefore, that the judicial power does not extend to controversies between the United States and an individual State, nor is the Supreme Court given original jurisdiction in such cases. In this connection, as strengthening this position and illustrating the purpose of the framers of the Constitution, it is worthy - of mention that' although it was proposed in the Convention to stretch the judicial power to all questions which \u201cinvolve the national peace and harmony .\u201d and \u201c all controversies <em>between the United States cmd an individual State </em>or the United States and the citizens of an individual State,\u201d neither of the propositions, in the breadth proposed, were adopted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-4\">A more specific proposition to vest in the judiciary of the United States authority \u201c to examine into and decide upon the claims of the <em>United States and cm individual State to terri</em>tory\u201d was peremptorily rejected. Mr. Justice Campbell in <em>Florida </em>v. Georgia, 17 How. 521.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-5\">That this court is without \u2022 original jurisdiction in cases in which the United States shall be a party was held by Chief Justice Taney in a note to the case of the <em>United States </em>v. Ferreira, 13 How. 52. Subsequently, it is tri\u00ede, he. delivered the opinion of the court in the case of <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>17 How. 478, in which the United States were permitted to adduce evidence in the controversy between Georgia and Florida, but neither \"the decision nor the opinion indicate a change of views on the subject. The- opinion distinctly announces that, the \u201ccourt do not regard the U\u00f1ited States, in this mode of proceeding, \u00e1s either .plaintiff or defendant; and they are,therefore, not liable to a judgment against, them, nor' entitled to a judgment in their favor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-6\">The true rule on the subject is thus stated by Mr. Justice Curtis in his dissenting opinion in the above-case, and it is not necessarily inconsistent, we think, with the opinion- of the majority of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b645-7\">' \u201c In distributing this jurisdiction, the Constitution has provided that, in all cases in which a State shall be a party, the Supreme Court' shall have original jurisdiction.. In all other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall, have appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>late jurisdiction. One of the other cases before mentioned, is a controversy to which the United States is a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-4\">\u201c I am not aware that any doubt has ever been entertained by any one, that controversies' to which the United States are a party, come under the appellate jurisdiction of this court in this distribution of jurisdiction by the Constitution. Such is the clear meaning of the words of the Constitution. So it was construed by the Congress, in the judiciary act of 1789, which, by the. 11th section, conferred on the Circuit Courts jurisdiction of cases in which the United States are plaintiffs, and so it has been administered to this day. ... . We have, then, two rules given by the Constitution. The one, that if a State be a party, this court shall have original jurisdiction; the other, that if the United States be a party,'this court shall have only appellate jurisdiction. And we are as clearly prohibited from taking original'jurisdiction of a controversy to which the United Sfates is a party, as -we are commanded to take it if a State be a party. Yet, when the United States shall'have been admitted on this record to become a party to this controversy, both a State and the United States will be parties .to the same controversy. And if each of these clauses of the Constitution is to have its literal effect, the one would require and the other prohibit us from taking jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-6\">\u201c It is not to be admitted that .there is any real conflict between these clauses of the Constitution, and our plain duty is so to construe them that each may have its just and full effect. This.is attended with no real difficulty. When, after enumerating the several distinct classes of cases and controversies to which the judicial power of the United States shall extend, the Constitution proceeds -to distribute that power between the Supreme and inferior courts, it must be understood as referring, throughput, to the classes of cases before enumerated, as distinct from each other. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b646-7\">\u201c And when it 'says : \u2018 In all cases in which a State shall be .a party, the Supreme Court shall.'have'original jurisdiction,\u2019 it.means, in all the cases' before' enumerated in which'a State shall be a. party. , Indeed, it says so, in express terms, when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>speaks of the other cases where appellate jurisdiction is given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-5\"><em>\u201c So </em>that this- original jurisdiction, which depends solely on the character of the' parties, is confined to the cases in which are those enumerated parties, and those only. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-6\">\u201c It is true, this course of reasoning leads necessarily to the-conclusion that the United States cannot.be a party to \u00e1 judicial controversy with a State in any court.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-7\">\u201c But this practical result is far from weakening my confidence in the correctness of the reasoning by .'which it has been arrived at. The Constitution of the United States substituted-a government acting on individuals, in place of a confederation which legislated for the States in their collective and sovereign capacities. The continued existence of the States, under a republican form of government, is made essential to the existence of the national government. And the fourth section of -the fourth article of the Constitution pledges the power of the nation to guarantee to every State a republican form of government ; to protect each against invasion, and, on application of its legislature or executive, against domestic violence. This conservative duty of the whole towards each of its parts, forms no exception to the general proposition, that the Constitution confers on the United States powers to govern the people, and not the States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-8\">\u201cThere is, therefore, nothing in the general plan of the Constitution, or in the nature and objects of the powers it confers, or in the relations between the general and state governments, to lead us to expect to find there a grant of power over judicial controversies between the government of the Union and the several States.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-9\">If this position be sound it necessarily follows that the act of Congress under which the suit is instituted is-',void. <em>Mar-burg </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch, 137. <em>In re </em>Metzger, '5 How. 176.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-10\">IV.

Those conditions having been accepted, Texas by a joint resolution of Congress passed December 29, 1845, was admitted into the Unio: on an equal footing '&gt;\u201dith the original States in all respects whatever. 9 Stat; 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">By an act of Congress, approved September 9, 1850, certain. propositions were made on behalf of the United States to the State of Texas, to become obligatory upon the parties when , accepted by Texas, if such acceptance was given on or before December 1, 1850. One of those propositions was that Texas would agree that its boundary on the north, should commence at the point at which the meridian of one- hundred degrees ' west from Greenwich is intersected by the parallel of thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, and run from that point due west to the meridian of one hundred and three degrees west from Greenwich, thence due south to the thirty-second degree of north latitude, thence on the parallel of , thirty-two degrees of north latitude to the Rio Bravo de Norte, and thence with, the channel of said river to the Gulf of Mexico; another, that Texas cede to the United States all her claim to territory exterior to the above limits and boundaries. \u2022 In consideratjLomof -said establishment of boundaries, cession--ef OlaTm to territory and relinquishment of claims, the United States agreed to pay to Texas the sum of-ten mil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>lions of dollars in a stock bearing five per cent interest, and redeemable at the end of fourteen years, the interest payable half-yearly at the Treasury of the United States. 9 Stat. 446, c. 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">By an \u00e1ct of assembly approved November 25, 1850, -the above propositions were accepted by Texas, and it agreed to be bound by them according, to their true import.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">During the whole period of nearly forty years succeeding the- treaty of 1819 no action, except as abov\u00e9 indicated, was taken to settle the boundary line in question. But, in the year 1859, a joint commission on the part of the United States and Texas commenced the work of running that line, but separated without reaching any conclusion. Nevertheless, in 1860, thejjommissioner upon the part of the United States completed thp work, without the cooperation of the commissioner of Texas, and reported the result to the General Land Office in 1861. According to the determination of the Commissioner on the part of the United States, and under certain surveys made from 1857 to i859, pursuant to a contract between two persons named Jones and Brown and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the true dividing and boundary line between the United States and the United Mexican States began where the one hundredth meridian touched the main Bed Biver aforesaid, running thence along.the .line or course of what is now known as the South Fork of the Bed Biver or river of the treaty of 1819.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">After the commissioners of the United -States and Texas had failed to reach an agreement, the legislature of Texas, by an act approved February 8, 1860, declared, \u201c that all the territory contained in the following limits, to wit: Beginning at the confluence of Bed Biver and Prairie Dog Biver, thence running up Bed Biver, passing the mouth of South Fork and-following main or North Bed Biver to its intersection with the twenty-third degree of west longitude; thence due north across Salt Fork and Prairie Dog Biver, and thence following that river to the place of beginning; be, and the same is hereby, created into a county to be known by the name and style of the' county of Greer.\u201d And by acts of its office^?, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>proceeding under its statutes, Texas' assumed and exercised control and jurisdiction- of the territory constituting what is called the county of Greer.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Notwithstanding those assertions of control and jurisdiction, Texas, by . an act approved .May 2, 1882, made provision for running and marking the line in question. That act provided for the appointment by the governor of a suitable person or persons, who, in- conjunction- with such person or persons as might be appointed by or on behalf of the United States for the same purpose, should run and mark the boundary line between the Territories of the United States and the State of Texas, in order that \u201c the question may be definitely settled as to the true location of the one hundredth degree of longi-tudr west from London, and-whether the North Fork of Red River, or the Prairie Dog Fork of said river, is' the true Red River designated in the treaty between the United States and Spain, made February 22, 1819.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">By an act of Congress, approved January \u00bf51, 1885, provision was made for the appointment of a commission by the President to act with the commission to be appointed by the State of Texas in ascertaining and marking the point where the one hundredth meridian of longitude crosses Red River, in-accordance with the terms of the treaty of 1819; the person or persons so appointed to make report of his or their action in the premises to the Secretary of the-Interior, who should transmit the. same to Congress at its next session after the report was made. 23 Stat. 296, c. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Under the last-mentioned acts a joint commission was organized, and it assembled at Galveston, Texas, on February 23, 1886. Being unable to agree as to whether the stream now known as the North Fork of the Red River, or that now called the South Fork or Main Ned River, was the river referred to in the treaty of 1819, the joint commission adjourned <em>sine die </em>with the understanding that each commission would make its report to the proper authorities and await instructions. The commissioners on the part of the United States reported that \u201c the Prairie Dog Town Fork is the true boundary, and that the monument should be placed at the intersec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>tion of the one hundredth meridian with this stream; \u201d while the commission on the part of Texas reported that \u201cthe North Fork of Red River, as now named and delineated on the maps, is the Rio Rqxo or Red River delineated o.n Melish\u2019s maps, described in the treaty of February 22,1819., and is the boundary line of said treaty to the point where the one hundredth degree of west lpngitude crosses the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The United States claims to have jurisdiction over all the territory acquired by the treaty of 1819, containing 1,511,576.17 acres, between what has been designated as the Prairie Dog Town Fork,, or Main Red River, and the North Fork of Red River, being the extreme portion of the Indian Territory lying west of the North Fork of the Red River, and east of the one hundredth meridian of west longitude from Greenwich; and that its right to said territory, so far from having been relinquished, has been continuously asserted from the ratification of the treaty of 1819 to the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The bill alleges that the State of Texas, without right, claims, has taken possession of, and endeavors .to extend its laws and jurisdiction over, the disputed territory, in violation of the treaty rights of the United States; that, during the year 1887, it gave public notice of its purpose to survey and place upon the market for sale, and otherwise dispose of, that territory; and that, in consequence of its proceeding to eject <em>bona fide </em>settlers from certain portions thereof, President Cleveland, by proclamation issued December 3C, 1887, warned all persons, whether claiming to act as officers of the county of Greer, or otherwise, against selling or disposing of, or attempting to sell or dispose of' any of said lands, or from exercising or attempting to exercise any authority over them, and \u201c against purchasing any part of said territory from any person or persons whatever.\u201d 25 Stat. 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The relief asked is a decree determining the tr.u\u00e9 line between the United States and the State of Texas, and whether the land constituting what is called \u201c Greer County,\u201d is within the boundary and jurisdiction of the United States or of the State of Texas. The government prays that its rights,- as asserted in the bill, be established, -and that it have such otner relief as the nature of the case may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u25a0 In support of the contention that the ascertainment of the boundary between a Territory of the United States and one of the States of .the Union is political in its nature and character, and not susceptible of judicial determination, the defendant cites <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>2 Pet. 253, 307, 309; <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 21; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo, </em>6 Pet. 691, 711; and <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>12 Pet. 511, 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Neilson, </em>which was an action to recover certain lands in Louisiana, the controlling question was as to whom the country between the Iberville and the Perdido rightfully belonged at the time the title of the plaintiff in that case was acquired. The United States, the court said, had perseveringly insisted that by the treaty of St. Ildefonso made October 1,1800, Spain ceded the disputed territory as part of Louisiana to France, and that France by the treaty of Paris of 1803 ceded it to the- United States. Spain insisted that the cession to France comprehended only the territory which at that time was denominated Louisiana. After examining various articles of the treaty of St. Ildefonso, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, said: \u201cIn a controversy between two nations concerning national boundary, it is scarcely possible that the' courts of either should refuse to abide by the measures adopted by its own government. There being-no common tribunal to decide between them, each determines for itself \u00f3n its own rights, and if they cannot adjust their differences peaceably, the right remains with the strongest. The judiciary is not that' department of the government to which the ass\u00e9rtion of its interests against foreign powers is confided; and its duty commonly is to decide upon individual rights, according to those principles which the political departments of the nation have established. If the course of the nation has been a plain one, its courts would hesitate to pronounce it erroneous.\u201d Again: \u201cAfter these acts of sovereign power over the territory in dispute, asserting the American construction of the treaty by which the government claims it, to maintain the opposite-construction.in its own courts would certainly be an anomaly in the history and practice of nations. If those departments which are entrusted - with the foreign intercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>. of- the Ration, which assert and maintain its interests against foreign powers, have unequivocally asserted its rights of domin-. ion- over a country of which it is in possession, and which it claims under a treaty; if the legislature has acted on the construction thus asserted, it is not in its own courts that this construction is to be denied. A question like this respecting the boundaries of nations, is, as has been truly said, more a political than a legal question; and, in its discussion, the courts of every country must respect the pronounced will of the legislature;\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arredondo </em>the court, referring to <em>Foster </em>v. Neilson, said: \u201c This court did not deem the settlement of boundaries a judicial but a political question \u2014 that it was not its <em>duty' to lead, but to follow </em>the Action of the other departments of the governm\u00e9nt.\u201d The same principles were recognized in <em>Cherokee Nation </em>v. <em>Georgia </em>and <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">These authorities do not control the present case. They \u25a0 relate to questions of boundary between independent nations, and have no application to a question of that character arising between the General Government and one of the States-composing the Union, or between two St\u00e1tes of the Union. By \u2022the Articles of Confederation, Congress was made <em>\u201c </em>the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences \u201d then subsisting or which thereafter might arise \u201cbetween two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction or any other cause whatever; \u201d the authority so conferred to be exercised by a . special tribunal to be -organized in the mode prescribed in those Articles, and its judgment to be' final and conclusive. Art. 9. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution there existed, as this court said in <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. 657, 723, 724, controversies between eleven States, in respect to boundaries, which had continued from the first settlement of the colonies. The necessity for the creation of some tribunal for the settlement of these and like controversies that might arise, under the new government to be formed, must, therefore, have been perceived by the framers'of the Constitution, and, consequently, among the controversies to which the judicial power of the United States was extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>by the Constitution, we find those between two or more States. And that a controversy between two or more States, in respect to boundary, is one to which, under the Constitution, such judicial power extends, is no longer an open question in this court. The cases of <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>12 Pet. 657; <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>5 Pet. 284, 290; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>7 How. 660; <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>17 How. <em>478 Alabama </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>23 How. 505; <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>11 Wall. 39, 55; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>11 Wall. 395; <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>136 U. S. <em>479; </em>and <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, ante, </em>359, were all original suits, in this court, for the judicial determination of disputed boundary lines between States. In <em>New Jersey </em>v. <em>New York, </em>5 Pet. 284, 290, Chief Justice Marshall said: \u201cIt has then been settled by-our predecessors, on great deliberation, that this court may exercise its original jurisdiction in suits against a State, under the authority conferred by the Constitution and existing acts of Congress.\u201d And in <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>it was said by Mr. Justice Miller to be the established doctrine of this court \u201c that it has jurisdiction of questions of. boundary between two States of this Union, and that this jurisdiction is not defeated, because in deciding that question it becomes necessary to examine into and construe compacts or agreements between those States, or because the decree which the court may render, affects the territorial limits of the political jurisdiction and sovereignty of the States which are parties to the proceeding.\u201d So, in <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co., </em>127 U. S. 265, 287, 288 ; \u201cBy the Constitution, therefore, this court has original jurisdiction of suits brought by a State against citizens of another State, as well as of controversies between two States.As to \u2018controversies between two or more States.\u2019 The most numerous class of which this court has entertained jurisdiction is that of controversies between two States as to the boundaries of their territory, such as were determined before the Revolution by the King in Council, and under the Articles of Confederation (while there was no national judiciary) by committees or commissioners appointed by Congress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>In view of these cases, it cannot, with propriety, be said that a question of boundary between a Territory of the United States and one of the States of the Union is of a political nature, and not susceptible of judicial determination by a court having jurisdiction of such a controversy. The important question therefore, is, whether this court can, under the Constitution, take cognizance of an original suit brought by the United States against a State to determine the boundary between one of the Territories and such State. Texas*'insists that no such jurisdiction has been conferred upon this court, and that the only mode in which the present dispute can be peaceably settled is by agreement, in some form, between the United States and that State. Of course, if no such agreement can be reached \u2014 and it seems that one is not probable \u2014 and if neither party will surrender its claim of authority and jurisdiction over the disputed territory, the result, according to the defendant\u2019s theory of the Constitution, must be that the United States, in order to effect a settlement of this vexed question of boundary, must bring its suit intone of the courts of Texas- \u2014 that State consenting that its courts may be open for the assertion of claims against it by the United States \u2014 or that, in the end, there must be a trial of physical strength between the government of the Union and Texas. The first alternative is unwarranted both by the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Mr. Justice Story has well said: \u201c It scarcely seems possible - to raise a reasonable doubt as to the propriety of giving to the national courts jurisdiction of cases in which the United States are a party. It would be a perfect novelty in the history of national jurisprudence, as well as of public law, that a sovereign had no authority tb sue in his own courts. Unless this power were given to the United States, the enforcement of all their rights, powers, contracts and privileges in their sovereign capacity would be at the mercy of the States. They must be enforced, if at all, in' the state tribunals.\u201d . Story Const. \u00a7 1674. The second alternative, above mentioned, has no place in our constitutional system, and cannot be contemplated by any patriot except with feelings of deep concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>The cases, in this court show that the framers of the Constitution did provide, by that instrument, for the judicial determination of all cases in law and equity between two or more States, including those involving questions of boundary. Did they omit to provide for the judicial determination of controversies arising between the United States'and one or more of the States of the Union ? This question is in effect answered by <em>United States </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>136 U. S. 211. That was an action of debt brought in this court by the United States against the State of Worth Carolina, upon certain bonds issued by that State. The State appeared, the case was determined here upon its merits, and judgment was rendered for the State. It is true that no question was made as to the jurisdiction of this court, and nothing was therefore said in the opinion upon that subject. But it did not escape the attention of the court, and the judgment would not have been rendered except upon the theory that 'this court has original jurisdiction of a suit by the United States against a State. As, however, the question of jurisdiction is .vital in this case, and is distinctly raised, it is proper to consider it upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The Constitution extends the judicial power of the United States \u201cto all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States and treaties made, or . which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of. admiralty and maritime-jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more States; between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different States; between, \u25a0citizens.of the same State claiming lands under grants of different States, and between a State or the.citizens thereof and foreign' States, citizens or subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">\u201cIn all cases, affecting ambassadors or other public minis-, ters and consuls, and those in which a State' shall be party, the'Supreme Court, shall have original jurisdiction, In all the other cases before mentioned, the.Supreme Court shall have, appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ceptions, and nnder sueh regulations as the Congress shall make.\u201d Art. 3, \u00a7 2. \u201c The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or. prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens, or subjects of any foreign State.\u201d 11th Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">It is apparent upon the face of these clauses that in one class of cases the jurisdiction of the courts of the Union depends \u201c on the- character of the cause, whoever may be the parties,\u201d and, in the other, on the character of the parties, whatever may be the subject of controversy. <em>Cohens </em>v. <em>Virginia</em>, 6 Wheat. 264, 378, 398. The present suit falls in eacji class, for it is, plainly, one arising under the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States, and, also, one in which the United States is a party. It is, therefore,-one to which, by the express words of the Constitution, the judicial power of the United States extends. That a Circuit Court of the United States has not jurisdiction, under existing statutes, of a suit by the United States against a State, is clear; for by th,e Revised Statutes-it is declared \u2014 as was done by the Judiciary Act of. 1789- \u2014 -that \u201cthe Supreme Court shall have exclusive-jurisdiction of all controversies' of a civil nature where a State is a party, except between a State and its citizens, or between a'State and'citizens of other States or aliens, in which latter cases it shall have original, but- not exclusive, jurisdiction.\u201d Rev. Stai. \u00a7 687; Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 13; T Stat. 80. Such exclusive jurisdiction was given to this court,, because it best comported witji the .dignity of a- State, that a case in which it was a party should be determined in the highest, rather than in a subordinate judicial tribunal of the nation. Why then may not this court take original cognizance of the present-suit involving a question of boundary between a Territory of the United States and a State ?</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The words, in the Constitution, <em>\u201c </em>in- all cases - . . \u2022. in which a State shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have . original jurisdiction,\u201d necessarily refer to all cases mentioned in the preceding clause' in which a State may be made, of right, a party defendant, or in which a State may, of right; be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>a party plaintiff. It is admitted that these words do not refer to suits brought against a State by its own citizens or by citizens of other States, or by citizens. or subjects of foreign States, even where such suits arise under the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States, because the judicial-power of the United States does not extend to suits of <em>individuals </em>against States. <em>Hans </em>v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, and authorities there cited; <em>North Carolina </em>v. Temple, 134 U. S. 22, 30. It is, however, said that the words last quoted refer only to suits in which a State is a party, and in which, also, the opposite party is another State of the Union or a foreign State. \u25a0 This cannot be correct, for it must be conceded that a State can bring an original suit in this court against a citizen of another State. <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Pelican Ins. Co., </em>127 U. S. 265, 287. Besides, unless a State is exempt altogether from suit by the United States, we do not perceive upon what sound rule of construction suits brought by the United States in this court \u2014 especially if they be suits the correct decision of which depends upon the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States \u2014 are to be excluded from its original jurisdiction as defined in the Constitution. That instrument extends the judicial power of the United States \u201cto <em>all </em>cases,\u201d in law and equity, arising under the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United-States, and to controversies in which the' United States shall be a party, and confers upon this court original jurisdiction \u201c in <em>all </em>cases \u201d \u201c in which a State shall be party,\u201d that is, in all cases mentioned in the preceding clause in which a State may, of right, be made a party defendant, as well as in all cases in which a State may, of right, institute a suit in a court of the United States. The present case is of the former class. We cannot assume that the framers of the Constitution, while extending the judicial power of the United States to controversies between two or more States of the Union, and between a State of the Union and foreign States, intended to exempt a State altogether from suit by the General Government. They could not have overlooked tfie possibility that controversies, capable of judicial solution,' Alight arise between the United States and some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of the States, and that the permanence of the Union might be . endangered if\u2019 to some tribunal was not entrusted the power to determine them according to the recognized principles of law. And to what tribunal could a trust so momentous be more appropriately committed than to that which the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish .justice and insure domestic tranquillity, have constituted with authority to speak for all the people and all the States, upon questions before it to which the judicial power of the nation extends ? It would be difficult to suggest any reason why this court should have jurisdiction to determine questions of boundary between two or more States, but not jurisdiction of controversies of like character between the United States and a State.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Mr. Justice Bradley,' speaking for the court in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U. S. 1, 15, referred to what had been said by certain statesmen at the time the Constitution was under submission to the people, and said: \u201c The letter is appealed to now, as it was then, as a ground for sustaining a suit brought by an individual against a State. . . . The truth is, that the cognizance of suits and actions unknown to the law, and forbidden by the law, was not cob tern plated by the Constitution when establishing the 'judicial power of the United States. Some things, undoubtedly, were made justiciable1 which were not. known as such at the common law; such, for example, as controversies between States as to boundary linesj and other questions admitting of judicial solution. And yet the case of <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Baltimore, 1 Ves. Sen. 444, shows that some of these unusual subjects of litigation were not unknown to the courts even in colonial times; and several cases of the same general character arose under the Articles of Confederation, and were brought before the tribunal provided for ..that purpose in those articles. 131 U. S. App. 50. The establishment of this new branch of jurisdiction seemed to be necessary from the extinguishment of diplomatic relations between the States.\u201d That case, and others in this court relating to the suability of States, proceeded upon the broad ground that \u201c it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>to be amenable to the suit of an <em>individual </em>without its consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The question as to' the suability of one , government by another government rests upon wholly different grounds. Texas is not called to the bar of this court at the suit of an individual, but at the suit of the government established for the common and equal benefit of the people of all the States. The-submission-to judicial solution of controversies arising between these two governments, \u201c each sovereign, with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other,\u201d <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>State of </em>Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 400, 410, but both subject to the- supreme law of the land, does no violence to the inherent nature of sovereignty. The States' of the Union have agreed, in the Constitution, that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to <em>all </em>cases arising under the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United'States, without regard to the character of the parties, (excluding, of course, suits against a State by its own citizens or by citizens of other States, or by citizens or subjects of foreign States,).and equally to controversies to which the United States shall be a party, without regard to the subject of such controversies, and that this court may exercise original jurisdiction- in all such cases,. <em>\u201c </em>in which a State shall be party,\u201d without excluding those in which the United States may be the opposite party. The exercise, therefore, by this court, of such original jurisdiction in a suit brought by one State against another to determine the boundary line between them, or in a suit brought by the United States against a State to determine the boundary between, a Territory of the United States and that State, so far from infringing, in either case, upon the sovereignty, is with the consent of the State sued. Such consent was given by Texas when admitted into the Union upon an equal footing in all respects with the other States.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">We are of opinion that this court has jurisdiction to determine the disputed question of boundary between the United States and Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">It is contended that, even if this court has jurisdiction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>dispute as to boundary must be determined in an action at law, and that the act of Congress requiring the institution of this suit in equity is unconstitutional and void as, in effect, declaring that legal rights shall, be tried and determined as if they, were equitable rights. This is not a new question in this court. It was suggested in argument, though not decided, in <em>Fowler </em>v. Lindsey, 3 Dall. 411, 413. Mr. Justice Washington, in that case, said: <em>\u201c </em>I will not 'say that a State could sue at law for such an incorporeal right as that, of sovereignty and jurisdiction ; but. even if a court of law would not afford a remedy, I can see no reason why a remedy should'not be obtained in a court of equity. The State of New York might, I think, file a bill against the State of Connecticut, praying to be quieted as to the boundaries of the disputed' territory.; and this court, in order to. effectuate justice, might appoint commissioners to ascertain and report' those boundaries.\u201d But the question arose directly in <em>Rhode Island </em>v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, 734, which was a suit in equity in this court involving the boundary line between two States. The court' said: \u201c No court acts differently .in deciding on boundary between States, than on lines between separate tracts of land ; if there is uncertainty where the line is, if there is a confusion of boundaries by the nature of interlocking grants, the obliteration of marks, the intermixing of possession under different proprietors, the effects of accident, fraud or time or other kindred causes, it is a case appropriate to equity. An issue at law is directed, a commission of boundary awarded ; or, if the court are satisfied without either, they decree what and where the boundary of a farm, a manor, a province or a State is and shall be.\u201d When that case was, before the court at a subsequent term, Chief Justice Taney, after stating that the case was of peculiar character, involving a question .of boundary between two\u2019 sovereign States, litigated in a court of justice, and that there were no precedents as to forms and modes of proceedings, said: \u201cThe subject was however fully .considered at January term, 1838, when a motion , was made by the defendant to dismiss this bill. Upon that, occasion the court ^determined to frame their proceedings .according to those which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>adopted in the English courts,-in cases most analogous to this, where the boundaries of great political bodies had been brought into question. And, acting upon this principle, it was then decided, that the rules and practice of the Court of Chancery-should govern in conducting this suit to a final issue. The reasoning upon which that decision was founded is fully stated in the opinion then delivered; and upon reexamining the subject, we are quite satisfied as to the correctness of this decision.\u201d 14 Pet. 210, 256. The above cases, <em>New Jersey v. New York, Missouri </em>v. Iowa, <em>Florida </em>v. Georgia, <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>Georgia, Virginia </em>v. <em>West Virginia, Missouri </em>v. <em>Kentucky, Indiana </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>and <em>Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>were all original suits in equity in this court, involving the boundary of States. In view of these precedents, it is scarcely necessary for the court to examine this question anew. Of course, if a suit in equity is appropriate for determining the boundary between two States, there can be no objection to the present suit as being in equity and not at law. It is not a suit simply to determine the legal title to, and- the ownership of, the lands constituting Greer County. It involves the larger question- of governmental authority and' jurisdiction over that territory. The United States, in effect, asks the specific execution of the terms of the treaty of 1819, to the end that the disorder and public mis-chiefs that will ensue from a continuance of the present condition of-things may,be prevented. The agreement, embodied in the treaty, to fix. the lines with precision, and to place landmarks to designate the limits of the two contracting nations, could not well be enforced by an action at law. The bill and. amended bill make a case for the interposition of a court of equity. .</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b666-5\">Me.
