Iowa was admitted into the Union in 1846, and its western boundary as defined by the act of admission was the middle of the main channel of the Missouri River. Nebraska was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>mitted in 1867, and its eastern boundary was likewise the middle of the channel of the Missouri Iliver. Between 1861 and 1877, in the vicinity of Omaha, there were marked changes in' the course of this channel, so that in the latter year it occupied a very different bed from that through which it flowed in the former year. Out of these changes has come this litigation, the respective States claiming'' jurisdiction over the same tract of land. ,To the bill filed by the State of Nebraska the State of Iowa answered-, alleging<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>' that this disputed ground was part of its territory, and also filed a cross-bill,\u2019 praying affirmative relief, establishing its \u2022 jurisdiction thereof, to which cross-bill the.

Justice Bbeweb</author>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">jit is settled law, that when grants of land border on running water,- and the banks are changed by that gradual process known as accretion, the riparian owner\u2019s boundary line still remains the stream, although, during the years, by this accretion, the actual area of his possessions may vary. In <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Pet. 662, 717, this court said: \u201c The question is-well settled- at.common law, that the person whose land is .bounded' by-'a 'stream of water which changes its course, gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the sanie boundary, including {he accumulated soil. No other rule can. be applied on just principles. Every pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>prietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss by the same means which may add to his territory'; and, as he is without remedy for his loss in this way, he cannot be held accountable for' his gain.\u201d (See also <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Soulard, </em>24 How. 41; <em>Banks </em>v. Ogden, 2 Wall. 57; <em>Saulet </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>4 Wall. 502; <em>St. Clair County </em>v. <em>Lovingston, </em>23 Wall. <em>46; Jefferis </em>v. <em>East Ohama Land Co., </em>134 U. S. 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">It is equally well settled, that where a. stream, which is- a boundary, from any cause suddenly abandons its old and seeks a new bed, such change of channel works no change of boundary ; and that the boundary remains as it was, in the centre of the old channel,, although no water may be flowing therein. This sudden and rapid change of channel is termed, in the law, avulsion. . In Gould on Wafers, sec. 159, it is said : \u201cBut if the change is violent and visible, and arises from a known cause, such as a freshet, or a cut through which a new channel is formed, the original thread of the stream continues to mark the limits of the two estates.\u201d 2 Bl. Com. 262; Angell on Water C\u00f3urses, \u00a7 60; <em>Trustees of Hopkins' Academy </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>9 Cush. 544; <em>Buttenuth </em>v. <em>St. Louis Bridge Co., </em>123 Illinois, 535; <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>8 Porter (Ala.) 9; <em>Murry </em>v. <em>Sermon, </em>1 Hawks (N. C.) 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">.These propositions, which are universally recognized as correct where the boundaries of private property touch on streams, are in like manner recognized where the boundaries between States or nations are, by prescription or treaty, found in running water. Accretion, no matter to which side it adds ground, leaves the boundary still the centre of the channel. Avulsion has no effect on boundary, but leaves it in the centre of the old channel. In volume 8, Opinions of Attorneys General, 175, 177, this matter received exhaustive consideration. A dispute arose between our government and Mexico, in consequence of-changes in the Bio<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bravo. The matter having been referred to Attorney General Cushing,.he replied at length. '\u2022 We quote largely from that opinion. After stating the case, he proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201cWith such conditions, whatever changes happen to either bank of the river by accretion on the one or \u00a1degradation of the other, that is, by the gradual, and, as it were, insensible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>accession or abstraction of mere particles, the river as it runs continues to be the boundary. \u2022 One country may, in process of time, lose a little of its territory, and the other gain a little, b,ut the territorial relations cannot be reversed by such imperceptible mutations in the course of the fiver. The general aspect of thing's remains unchanged. And the convenience of allowing the river to retain its previous function, notwithstanding such insensible changes in its course, or in either of its .banks, outweighs the inconveniences, even to the injured party, involved in a detriment, which, happening gradually, is inappreciable in the successive moments of its progression.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">\u201c But, on the other hand, if, deserting its original bed, the. river forces for itself a new channel in another direction, then the nation, through whose territory the river thus breaks its way, suffers injury by the loss of territory greater than the benefit of retaining the natural river boundary, and that boundary remains in the middle of\u2019 the deserted river bed. For, in truth, just as a stone- pillar constitutes a boundary, not because it is a stone, but because of the place in which it stands, so a river is made the limit of nations, not because it is running water bearing a certain geographical name, but because it is water flowing in a given channel, and within given banks, which are the real international boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cSuch is the received rule of the law of nations on this point, as laid down by all the writers of authority. .

Nations must, of necessity, submit their .rights to these great alterations which nature predisposes and consummates. : . . But, when the change is not total, but progressive only, that is to say, when the river does not abandon either State, but only gradually shifts its course by accretions, then it continues still to be the boundary, and the augmentation of territory, which one country gains at the expense of the other, is to be held by it as a new acquisition of property.\u2019 (Derecho Internacional, tom. i, p. 83.)'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201c Don Andres Bello and' Don Jos\u00e9 Maria de Pando both enunciate the doctrine in exactly the same words, namely</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018 </em>\"When- a river or lake divides two territories, whether it belong in common to the conterminous riparian States, or they possess it by halves, or one of them occupies it exclusively, the rights, which either has in the lake or river, do not undergo any change by reason of alluvion. The lands insensibly invaded by the water aro lost by one of the riparian States, and those which the water abandons on the opposite bank increase the dom\u00e1in of the other State. But if, by any natural accident, the water, which separated the two States, enters of a sudden into-the territory of the other, it will thenceforth belong to the State whose soil it occupies, and the land, including the abandoned \u2022 river-channel or bed, will incur no change of master.\u2019 \u2022 (Bello, Derecho Internacional, p. 38; Pando, Derecho Internacional, p. 99.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c Almeda refers to the same point, briefly, but in decisive terms. He says: ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">. \u201c\u00a3 As the river belongs to the two nations, so,' also, the river-bed, if by chance it become dry, is divided between them as proprietors. \"When the river changes its course, throwing itself on one of two conterminous states, it then .comes to belong to the state through whose territory it runs, all community of right in it so far ceasing.\u2019 Derecho Publico, tom. i; p. 199.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">\u201c Leaving authorities of this class, then, let us come to those which discuss the question in its relation to\u2019 private rights, and as a doctrine of municipal jurisprudence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201c The doctrine is transmitted to us from tbe laws of Rome.

The civil laws have thus provided \u00e1gainst and decided-this case, when it happens between individual and individual; they ought to unite equity with the welfare .of the state, and the care of preventing litigations.*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201c In case of doubt, every territory terminating on a river is .presumed to have no other boundary than. the - river itself; because nothing is' more natural than to take a river for a boundary, when a settlement is made; and wherever' there is a doubt, that is always to be presumed which is most natural and most probable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">.T As soon as it is determined that a river constitutes the boundary line between two territories, whether it remain's. common to the - inhabitants on each of its banks, or whether each shares half of it, o.r, finally, whether' it belongs entirely to one of them, their rights, with respect to the river, are ins nowise changed by the alluvion. If, therefore, it happens that, by a natural effect of the current, one of the two territories receives an increase, while the river gradually encroaches on the opposite bank, the river still remains the natural boundary of the two territories, and, notwithstanding the progressive changes in its- course, each retains .over it the same \u25a0 rights which it possessed before; so that, if, for instance, it be divided in the middle between the owners of the' opposite bank,, that middle, though it chang\u00e9s its place, will continue to be .the line of separation between the two neighbors.- The one loses, it-is true, while the other gains.; but nature alone produces this change; she destroys-the land of the. one,-while she. forms new land.for the other. The case cannot be otherwise determined, since they have taken the river alone for their limits. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u2022 \u201cBut -if, instead of a gradual and progressive change of its bed,, the river, by an accident merely natural, turns entirely out of its \u2022 course and runs into one of the twobieighboring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>States, the bed which it has abandoned, becomes thenceforward their boundary ,_and remains the property of the former owner of the river, (sec. 267.) the river itself is, as it were, annihilated in all that part while it is reproduced in its new bed, and there belongs only to the State in which it flows.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The result of these authorities puts it beyond doubt that accretion on an ordinary river would leave the boundary between two States the varying centre of the channel, and that avulsion would-establish a' fixed boundary, to wit: the centre of the abandoned channel.\u2019 It is contended, however, that the doctrine of accretion has no application to the Missouri Biver, on account of the rapid and great changes, constantly going on in respect to its banks; but the contrary has already been decided by this court in <em>Jefferis </em>v. <em>Land </em>Company, 134 U. S. 178, 189. A question between individuals, growing Out of changes in the very place now in controversy,'was then before \u2022 this court; and in the opinion, after referring to the general rule, it was observed : <em>\u201c </em>It is contended by the defendant that this well settled rule is not applicable to land which borders on the Missouri Biver, because,of the peculiar character of that stream and of the soil through which it flows, the course of the river being tortuous, the current rapid, and the soil a soft,.sandy loam, not protected from the action of water either by rocks or the roots of trees; the effect being that the river cuts away its banks, sometimes in a large body, and makes for itself a new course, while the earth thus removed is almost simultaneously deposited elsewhere, and new land is formed almost as rapidly as the former bank was carried away. But it has been held by this court that the general \u25a0 law of accretion is applicable to land on the.Mississippi Biver; ' and, that being so, although the changes on the Missouri Biver are greater and more rapid than on the Mississippi, the difference does not constitute such a difference in principle as to render inapplicable to the Missouri Biver the general rule of law.\u201d'. It is.true that that case came here pn demurrer to a ' bill, and l.t was alleged in the bill that the land was formed by \u201cimperceptible degrees,\u201d and that the proces's of accretion \u201c went on so slowly that it could not be observed in its pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>gress; but, at intervals, of not less than three or more months, it could be discerned by the eye that additions greater or less had been made to the shore.\u201d The state of facts disclosed by this averment was held not to take the case out of the law concerning accretion, and, after referring to some English authorities, it was said: \u201c The doctrine of the English cases is, that accretion is an addition to land coterminous with the water, which is formed so slowly that its progress cannot be perceived,' and does not admit of' the view that in order to be accretion the formation must be one not discernible by comparison at two distant, points \u00f3f time.\u201d And then was quoted from the opinion in <em>St. Clair </em>v. <em>Lovingston, </em>23 Wall. 46, these words: \u201c The test as to what is gradual and imperceptible in the sense-of the rule is, that though the witnesses may see from time to time, that progress has been-made, they could not perceive it while the process was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The case before us' is presented on testimony, and not on allegation. But what are the facts apparent from that testimony? The Missouri .River'is a winding-stream, coursing through a valley of varying width, the substratum of whose soil, a deposit of distant centuries, is largely of quicksand. In building the 'bridge of the Union Pacific Railway Company across the Missouri River, in the vicinity of . the tracts in controversy, the builders went down to' the solid rock, sixty-five feet below the surface, and there found a pine log a foot and a half in diameter \u2014 of course, a deposit \u25a0 made in the long ago. The current.is rapid, far above, the average of ordinary,, rivers; and by reason of the snows in the mountains there are two well known rises in .the .volume of its waters, known as the'April and June rises. The large volume of'water pouring down at the time of these rises, with the rapidity of its current, has great and rapid action- upon the loose soil of its banks. \u2022 Whenever it impinges with direct attack upon the bank at a bend of the stream,, and that bank is of the loose sand obtaining in the valley,of the Missouri, it is not strange that the abrasion and washing away is rapid and great. \u2022 Frequently, where above the loose substratum of sand there is a deposit of comparatively solid soil, \u25a0 the Washing out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>underlying sand causes an instantaneous fall of quit\u00e9 a length and breadth of the superstratum of soil into the river ; so that it may, in one sense of the term, be said that the diminution of the banks is not gradual and imperceptible, but sudden and visible. Notwithstanding this, two things must be borne in mind, familiar to all dwellers on the \u2022 banks of the Missouri River, and disclosed by the testimony: that, while there may be an instantaneous and obvious dropping into the river, of quite a portion of its banks, such portion is not carried down the stream as a solid and compact mass, but disintegrates and separates into particles of earth borne onward by the flowing water, and giving to the stream that color which, in the history of the country, has made it known as the \u201cmuddy\u201d Missouri; and, also, that while the disappearance, -by reason df this process, of a mass of bank may be sudden and obvious, there is no transfer of such a solid body of earth to the opposite shore, or anything like an instantaneous and visible creation of a bank on that shore.' The accretion, whatever may be the fact in respect to the diminution, is always gradual and by the. imperceptible deposit of floating particles of earth. There is, except in such cases of avulsi\u00f3n as may be noticed hereafter; in all matter of increase of bank, always a mere gradual and imperceptible process. There is no heaping up at an instant, and while the eye rests upon the stream, of acres or rods on the forming side of the river. No engineering skill is sufficient to say where the earth in the bank washed away and disintegrating into the river finds its rest and abiding place; The falling bank has passed into the floating mass of earth and water, and the particles of earth may rest one or fifty-miles below, and upon either shore. There is, no matter how rapid the process of subtraction or addition, no detachment of earth from the one side and deposit of the same-upon the other. The only thing which - distinguishes this river from-other streams, in .the matter.of accretion, is in the rapidity of the change caused by the velocity of the current; and this in itself, in the very nature of things, works no change in the principle underlying Ahe-.rule yd law in respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Our conclusions -*are that, notwithstanding the rapidity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u2022the changes in the course of the channel, and the washing from the one side and on to the other, the law of accretion controls on the Missouri River, as elsewhereand that not only in respect to.the rights of individual land owners, but' also in respect to the boundary lines between States. The boundary, therefore, between Iowa and Nebraska is a-varying line, so far as affected by these changes of diminution and accretion in the mere washing of the waters of the stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">It appears, however, from the testimony, that in 1877 the river above Omaha, which had pursued a course in the nature of an ox-bow, suddenly cut through the neck of the bow and 'made for itself a new channel.' This does not come within the law of accretion, but of that of avulsion. By this selection of a new channel the boundary was not changed, and it remained as it was prior to the avulsion, the centre line of the old channel; and that, unless the waters of the river returned to their former bed, became a fixed and unvarying boundary, no matter what might be the changes of the river in its new channel.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\n<em>We think we hme by these observations' indicated as cleatily as is possible the boundary between the two States, and upon these principles the parties may agree to a destgna- \u25a0 tion of such boundary, and such designation will pass into a final- decree. If no agreement is possible, then the court will appoint a commission to survey amd report in accordance with the views herein expressed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\n<em>The costs of this sitit will be divided between the two States, because the matter irwol/ved is one of those governmental \u25a0 questions bn which each party has a real and vital, and yet not a litigious, m.terest.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
