The' court stated the case as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-11\">This was an action brought by August Lindvall in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota against John Woods and Stephen B. Lovejoy, partners as Woods &amp; Lovejoy, to recover for a personal injury alleged to have been caused, through the negligence of the defendants. The issues were a general denial and the plea of former adjudication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>The cas\u00e9 was twice tried, and upon the first trial the plea of former adjudication was sustained, but a hew trial was granted for the reasons given in the opinions of Mr. Justice Miller and Judge. Nelson, reported in <em>47 </em>Fed. Bep. 195. The , second trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $3800, and costs taxed at $142.50, and a motion for new trial having been overruled, the case was taken by writ of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">In the Circuit Court it was contented, on the merits, that the rule which precludes a servant from recovering from his master for an injury received through the negligence of fellow-servants was applicable, and upon the conclusion of the evidence the defendants moved the court to instruct the jury to return a verdict for them on the ground that the. plaintiff had failed to make out a cause- of action, which motion was denied, exception taken, and the ruling assigned for error. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the rule invoked did not apply, and that the verdict was sustained by the. evidence. (4 IT. S. App. 49.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">From the bill of exceptions it appeared that to sustain their plea of a former adjudication, the defendants offered in evidence- a duly certified transcript of record, which showed the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">\u201c That the same plaintiff had brought an action against the same defendants, upon exactly the same cause, for the same injury, in the District Court of the State of Minnesota for the county of Hennepin, a court of general jurisdiction in said State.

Shaw &amp; Cray, attorneys for said defendanfs, it is ordered and adjudged that, said action be, and hereby is, dismissed, and that said defendants do have and recover of said' plaintiff the sum of seven and -/\u00b6\u00b6 dollars for their costs and disbursements of said action- duly taxed and allowed herein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-10\">To the admission of this transcript in evidence plaintiff objected, the objection was sustained, the transcript excluded, and defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-11\">The Circuit' Court of Appeals held that the effect of the judgment of the state .court dismissing, on the defendants\u2019 motion, an action brought in that court, at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, upon the1 ground that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case, was a question of local law depend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ing on the construction of the statute of. the State, and. that the established doctrine of the 1 Supreme Court of Minnesota was that under the statute such judgment of dismissal- was not a judgment upon the merits of the action: which would \"bar the plaintiff from maintaining another suit for the samp, cause, but that it was in effect nothing more than a common law or voluntary non-suit; that this construction by the. Supreme Court of the State should be followed by that court'; and, therefore, that the record of the judgment of dismissal constituted no bar to th\u00e9 action and was rightly excluded. '.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">Judgment of affirmance having- been rendered by the Circuit Court of Appeals, the' m\u00e1ndate was stayed in order to enable plaintiffs in error to make application to this \u2022 court for a .writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the cause, and that application was accordingly made, upon notice, and accompanied by a certified copy of the entire record of the case, in compliance with the rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-6\"><em>Mr. Willard B.

Chief Justice Fullee</author>\n<p id=\"AV2\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">In <em>Lau Ow Bew, </em>Petitioner, 141 U. S. 583, it was held that the power of this court to require a case in which the judgment and decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is made final, to be certified for review and determination, as if it had been brought here on appeal or writ' of error, could only be properly invoked under section six of the act of Congress entitled \u201c An act to establish Circuit Courts of Appeals and to define and regulate in certain cases' the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, and for other purposes,\u201d approved March 3, 1891, (26 Stat. 826, 828, c. 517,) when questions of gravity and importance were involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">This must necessarily be so in any view, and especially \u2022 when it is considered that the Circuit Courts of Appeals were created for- the purpor 3 of relieving this court of the. oppres- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>. sive burden of general litigation, which impeded the examination and disposition of cases of public concern, and delayed \u2022suitors in the pursuit of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">But in the interest of jurisprudence and uniformity of decision, to use the language of the eminent jurist and statesman who had charge of the bill, provision was made under section six for such supervision on our part, as would tend to avert diversity of judgments and guard against inadvertence of conclusion in controversies involving weighty- and serious matters. _</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In the matter of <em>Lau Ow JBew, </em>the construction of acts of Congress in the light of treaties with a foreign government,- and the status of domicil in respect of natives- of one country domiciled.in another, a matter of \u25a0 international concern, were brought under consideration upon the record, and we were of opinion that the grounds of the application. were sufficient to call for our interposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">But we do not regard the inquiry as to whether it was settled law in the State of Minnesota that a judgment of dismissal in a former suit, such as pleaded her\u00e9, was not a bar to a second suit upon the same cause of action, or whether the law in respect of recovery by a servant against his-master for injuries received in the course of his employment was properly- applied on the trial of this case, as falling within \u25a0 the category of questions of such gravity and general importance as to require the review of the conclusions of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reference to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>The writ of certiora/ri is denied.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
