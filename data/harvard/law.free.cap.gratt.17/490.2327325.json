It is intended to commit the estate of David 0 to the sergeant of L, but by a clerical mistake the name is written Daniel.

The following is a statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">John Clarkson by his will, dated and admitted to pro. bate in 1817, made a bequest in the following words: \u201cI give and bequeath to my well beloved daughter Betsey Taylor and Major Abram Taylor her husband, Mealy and her children, by them freely to be possessed and enjoyed; and if it so happens that the above Betsey Taylor die having no bodily heir, that she and Major Abram Taylor <em>is </em>to enjoy them during their life, but <em>is </em>not to remove the said negroes out of this state, and at their death to to be equally divided among the rest of my children.\u201d Abram Taylor died in the year 1819, and Betsey Taylor on the 27th day of October, 1849, without ever having had- issue. The rest of the testator's children living at the time of his death were James Clarkson, William Clarkson, Frances Carter, Catharine Jones, Lucy Dodd, Mary Bellenger, David Clarkson and Anselm Clarkson. All of them except the two last, David and Anselm, died before Betsey Taylor, and David died before the institution of this suit, but whether before or after the death of Betsey Taylor was a fact not known or ascertained in the cause. Anselm was alive at the time of the institution of the suit and the rendition of the judgment. At different periods in the lifetime of Betsey Taylor the following named personal representatives of the following named children of the testator were duly appointed and qualified as such, viz: Nelson C. Clarkson as executor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>of James Clarkson, Peter J, Hill as administrator with the will annexed of Catharine Jones, and James Smiley as administrator of Yfilliatn Clarkson; and administration <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of Mary Bellenger, was duly committed to Henry Dunnington as sergeant of thecorpo- ' ration of Lynchburg. After the death of Betsey Taylor and before the institution of the suit, to wit, in August, 1854, by an order of the Hustings court of Lynchburg, the estates of Lucy Dodd and of David Clarkson by the name of <em>Daniel </em>Clarkson, were committed to the hands of said Dunnington, sergeant as aforesaid, for administration, according to law. After the institution of the suit, to wit, on the 9th of March, 1859, by another order of the same court, reciting that \u201cit appearing to the satisfaction of the court that there was a clerical error in the order of the 9th of August, 1854, committing the estate of <em>Daniel </em>Clarkson to Henry Dunnington, the sergeant of the city of Lynchburg, when in fact it was the estate of <em>David, </em>Clarkson that was so committed to said sergeant; and that said error was wholly clerical ; and said Dunnington, sergeant as aforesaid, having since that time continued to act as administrator of said David Clarkson, under said order,\u201d the said court, on the motion of the said Dunnington, corrected the said error, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>by so amending the said order of the 9th of August, 1854, as to insert therein the name of \u201cDavid\u201d instead of that of \u201cDaniel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">Abram Taylor used and employed the slaves Mealy and her children as his own during his life, and Betsey Taylor after his death used and employed them as her own while in her possession, some of them being sold by her, and others being sold by the sheriff under an execution against her. She sold some of them to persons who carried them to North Carolina. In 1841 she sold Edmund, a descendant of Mealy, to the defendant Booth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>but at what price or for what period, whether for her own life only or for the life of the slave, does not plainly appear; though it is probable from the circumstances that the latter was the fact. The defendant remained in possession of Edmund from the time of the sale until after the institution of the action, and was still in possession at the trial thereof. On the 27th of September, 1854, the action was brought by Anselm Clarkson, Robert C. Jones executor of Frances Carter, Uelson C. Clarkson administrator of James Clarkson, Peter J. Hill administrator of Catharine Jones, James Smiley administrator of William Clarkson, Henry Dunnington, sergeant of the city of Lynchburg, and as such administrator of Lucy Dodd, ' the same Henry Dunnington, sergeant as aforesaid, and as such administrator of Mary Bellenger, and the same Henry Dunnington, sergeant as aforesaid, and as such administrator of David- Clarkson, against Moses Booth. The declaration is in the common form used in the action of detinue, and claims Edmund and four other slaves by name. The general issue was joined. And in October, 1859, after the action had been pending several years, the plaintiff Robert C. Jones executor of Frances Carter, having died, the case abated as to him, and then came on to be tried by a jury, when a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs for the slave Edmund of the value of $1,400, and for damages for the detention of said slave, assessed at $1,250, and for the defendant as to the other slaves in the declaration mentioned. On the trial the court gave several instructions asked for by the defendant and refused to give several asked for by the plaintiffs; and they excepted to the opinions of the court thus given against them., The effect of these opinions, so far as it is material to be stated, is, that the right of action for the slaves in controversy survived to Anselm Clarkson, and was in him alone, and that the plaintiffs could not recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>them in the suit; and also that the order of the Hustings court of Lynchburg of the 9th of March, 1859, made for the purpose of correcting a clerical error in the order of the same court of the 9th of August, 1854, as aforesaid, does not relate back so as to make Henry Dunning-ton, as sergeant of the city of Lynchburg, the personal representative of David Clarkson at the time of the institution of the suit, which could not therefore be maintained in the name of said Dunnington as such representative. After the verdict was rendered, a motion was made by the defendant to set it aside and grant a new trial, which motion the court sustained; and the plaintiffs excepted. The facts proved on the trial were certified in the bill of exceptions, at the conclusion of which it was assigned as the reason for sotting aside the verdict and granting a new trial, that the court was of opinion that there was a misjoinder of the plaintiffs in the suit, and that the jury disregarded the instructions of the court. On the 20th of October, I860, the ease came on again to be tided, when a verdict was rendered for the defendant. On this trial the same instructions were asked for, and given and refused, as on the former trial; and the plaintiffs again excepted. Judgment for the defendant having been given on the verdict, the plaintiffs obtained a supersedeas thereto from this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-7\"><em>Garland, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-8\">There was no counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-9\">Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">delivered the opinion of the court :</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">The court is of opinion that by the will of John Clark-son the slaves Mealy and her children, which were thereby given to his daughter Betsey Taylor and her husband Abram Taylor, were limited at the death of the survivor of them, to the rest of the testator\u2019s children, upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>contingency of the death of his said daughter without issue living at her death. Although the words \u201cand if it so happens that above Betsey Taylor die <em>having no bodily heir,\u201d </em>immediately following the bequest to her and her husband, might, standing by themselves and unexplained by anything that follows them in the will, import an indefinite failure of issue, yet followed as they are by the words \u201cthat she and Major Abram Taylor <em>is </em>to enjoy them during their life, but <em>is </em>not to remove the said negroes out of this state, and <em>at their death </em>to be <em>equally divided </em>among the rest of my children,\u201d an intention is unmistakably indicated to confine the contemplated contingency to the period of their death, or rather that of the survivor of them. In the event of the happening of such contingency, they are to be regarded as having been mere tenants for life, expressly restrained from removing the negroes out of the state; and at the termination of the life estate, or, in the language of the will, \u201cat their death\u201d (words which are very significant), the negroes are directed to be equally divided among the rest of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The court is further of opinion that after the death of the testator and before the death of his said daughter, the contingent executory limitation aforesaid to the rest of his children created such an interest in them as that the respective portions of any of them dying during that period devolved on their personal representatives respectively, and at the death of the said Betsey Taylor, who survived her said husband and died without ever having had issue, such of the rest of the testator\u2019s children as were then living, and the personal representatives of such of them as were then dead, were tenants in common of the said slaves and their increase, or such of them as were then in existence, and as such were entitled to the possession thereof, and <em>in </em>suoh possession, at least construo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tively, and were entitled to maintain a joint action for any subsequent wrongful detention or conversion of the same or any part thereof. 1 Lomax on Ex\u2019rs, p. 319, marg.; 1 Tho. Co. Lit. 783; 3 Rob. Pr., new ed., 163; <em>Rose\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>10 Leigh 186, and especially the opinion of Stanard, J. in that ease. As tenants in common of personal property must join in an action for an injury to such property, and as a personal representative of a deceased tenant'in common becomes a tenant in common with the survivors, it follows as a necessary conr sequence that he must join with them in such an action. The rule is different where two or more persons are jointly entitled, as parties or otherwise, to a chose in action, and one of them dies. There the <em>remedy </em>survives, though the <em>right </em>does not, and the action must be brought in the name of the survivors only. This was long a mooted question, and was at one time held otherwise in England. But it was decided in the case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Crompe, </em>1 Lord Raym. R. 340, that the action must be in the name of the survivors alone, Lord Holt assigning as a reason that it would make strange confusion that one party should sue in his own right and another in another\u2019s. This decision\u2019has ever since been held in that country to be undoubted law, as was said by Parke, B. in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>1 Eng. L. &amp; E. R. 506; and the same doctrine is firmly established in this country. 3 Rob. Pr., new ed., p. 164, and authorities cited. There is this difference, then, in regard to the proper persons to be made plaintiffs in an action for the wrongful detention or conversion of personal property held by tenants in common, between a case in which the death of one of them occurs before, and a case in which such death occurs after, the wrongful act; that in the former case the action for such act must be'brought in the joint names of the survivors and the personal representative of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the deceased tenant in common, while in the latter it must be brought in the names of the survivors only; and where it is properly brought in the joint names of the survivors and the personal representative of the deceased tenant, and one of them dies pending the action, whether he be such personal representative or one of the survivors, it abates as to him and proceeds in the names of the surviving plaintiffs only; so that if the person dying be such personal representative, the action is not to be revived in the name of an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the deceased tenant in common. In fact, there is no difference in the rights in which the plaintiffs sue where one of them is a personal representative of a deceased tenant in common and the others are the surviving tenant. All of them sue <em>in suo </em>jure, though the description of <em>personal representative of a decedent </em>be added to the name of one of them. Such matter of description is unnecessary but harmless, and may be treated as surplusage. 2 Lom, on Ex\u2019rs, 371, marg.; 3 Rob. Pr., new ed., 518; <em>Rose\u2019s adm\u2019x </em>v. <em>Burgess, supra; Harvey </em>v. <em>Skipwith, &amp;c., </em>16 Gratt. 393. Persons cannot join as plaintiffs in an action at law in different rights\u2014the one <em>as </em>a personal representative and the other in his own right\u2014for the reason assigned by Lord Holt as before mentioned, \u201cthat it would make strange confusion\u201d to do so. A personal representative of a deceased tenant in common must have possession of the subject held in common, actual or constructive, when the wrong is done for which the action is brought, to entitle him to join with the surviving tenants in common as plaintiffs in the action. Title and possession make them tenants in common, and entitle them to maintain the joint action <em>suo jure, </em>even though one of them becomes entitled by being a personal representative, while the others are entitled in their own right. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>possession of one tenant in common is the possession of all who may be entitled as co-tenants with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">It is a rule of law that the property of personal chattels draws to it the possession, unless they be in the actual adversary possession of another. 1 Lorn, on Ex\u2019rs, 814, marg. A personal representative may, at his election, sue as such, or in his own right (of course, in the latter case, for the benefit of the estate he represents), for an injury to the goods of the deceased after his death, unless such representative be tenant in common of those goods with another, in which case, we have seen, they must jointly sue in their own right. A personal representative being considered in law as the owner of the goods of the deceased from the time of his death, may declare upon this constructive possession, though he may never have had actual possession before the tort committed; nor will it make any difference whether the injury was done before probate or administration granted, for <em>they </em>relate back to the death of the deceased. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">The court is further of opinion that the possession of the said slaves or any of them by the said Betsey Taylor during her life was not adverse to, but consistent with the title of the rest of the testator\u2019s children, and. that the sale by her of a portion of the said slaves to the defendant Moses Booth, even if intended to pass the absolute estate, operated to pass the life estate only of the said Betsey Taylor in the same, and was null and void for any other or further purpose. And the said Moses Booth, after the said sale and until and at the time of the death of the said Betsey Taylor, continued to hold the slaves sold to him as aforesaid consistently with, and not adversely to the right and title of the rest of the children ; and such of the said children as were alive at her death and the personal representatives of such of them as were then dead (though some of the said representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tives may not have been appointed or qualified until after that time), <em>eo instanti </em>became entitled to the possession of the said slaves, and by construction of law was in the possession thereof as tenants in common. 1 Rob. Pr., new ed., 508-510, and cases cited. As was said by this court in <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>16 Gratt. 244, 254-5, the particular estate and remainder made together but one absolute estate in the slaves. The assent to the legacy of the particular estate enured to the benefit of the remaindermen, who, though not in actual possession of the remainder during the existence of the particular estate, yet had all the possession of which a remainder is susceptible. The remainder was not a mere chose in action, but at most a <em>quasi </em>chose in action. No action was necessary to reduce it into possession, but at the termination of the life estate it would <em>fall into the possession of the remaindermen by operation of law.\u201d </em>To be sure if the life tenant, or the assignee of the life tenant (who by the assignment becomes a tenant <em>per auter vie), </em>holds, uses and enjoys the property as his own after the termination of the life estate, such possession becomes adverse to the remaindermen and is a wrongful conversion of their property to his use, from the time of which conversion the act of limitations will begin to run against them; as was held by this court in <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Norris's adm'r, </em>16 Gratt. 236. But there must be an instant of time, if not in fact, at least in contemplation of law, between the termination of the life estate and such subsequent wrongful conversion of the property by the life tenant, and that instant of time is sufficient to make the conversion a violation and invasion as well of the possession as the property of the remaindermen. Until the termination of the life estate the life tenant cannot hold adversely to the remaindermen, but must hold in subordination to their title. When the life estate terminates the title and right of possession are united in them, and though they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>not <em>actual, </em>yet they have <em>constructive </em>possession of the property. The law does not, because it cannot, operate an actual transfer of the property from the hands of the life tenant, where it is necessarily found at the termination of the life estate, to the hands of the remaindermen, hut it makes <em>his </em>possession <em>their </em>possession, until he wrongfully detains or converts the property; which act, as before stated, is an invasion of their possession as well as of their property. The law will not presume that they intend such a wrong until it is actually perpetrated, and when it is perpetrated it will not relate back to the termination of the life estate, so as to displace the intermediate constructive possession of the remaindermen, which was incident and adhered to their title. This is perfectly consistent with the decision of this court in <em>Layne </em>v. <em>Norris\u2019s adm\u2019r, supra, </em>as will plainly appear by referring to the reasons on which that decision was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The court is further of opinion that the testator\u2019s children James Clarkson, William Clarkson, Frances Carter, Catherine Jones, Lucy Dodd and Mary Bellenger, having died before the said Betsey Taylor, their personal representatives were tenants in common of the said slaves, or such of them as were in existence when the life estate fell in, with the testator\u2019s son Anselm Clarkson, who survived the said Betsey Taylor, and were properly joined with him as plaintiffs in this action. Whether the personal representative of the testator\u2019s son David Clarkson was also one of that tenants in common at that time and was properly joined as one of the plaintiffs in the action, depends upon whether <em>he </em>also died before the said Betsey Taylor; a fact which is represented in the record as being unknown. But if it be necessary to support the action, it ought to be presumed that he died before her.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The court is further of opinion that the insertion of the name \u201cDaniel\u201d instead of that of \u201c David,\u201d in the order of the Hustings court of Lynchburg of the 9th August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>1854, was a mere clerical error, which the said court at a subsequent term had a right to correct <em>nunc pro </em>tunc, and did so correct by the order of March Sth, 1859; and that by the former order thus corrected the estate of said David Clarkson was duly committed to the hands of Henry Dunnington, sergeant of the city of Lynchburg, for administration as of the said 9th of August, 1854.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">But the court is further of opinion that even if David Clarkson in fact died <em>after </em>the said Betsey Taylor, or if Henry Dunnington were <em>not </em>the legal representative of said David Clarkson, neither of these facts, nor both of them together, would affect the right of the plaintiffs to maintain this action, inasmuch as the same Henry Dunnington is named as a plaintiff by the description of \u201c sergeant of the city of Lynchburg and as such administrator of Lucy Dodd,\u201d and of \u201c sergeant as aforesaid and as such administrator of Mary Bellenger,\u201d as well as by the description of <em>\u201c </em>sergeant as aforesaid and as such administrator of David Clarkson,\u201d all of which is mere description of the person and may be stricken out as surplusage; the said Henry Dunnington being but one plaintiff, suing in his own name and right by the descriptions aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The court is further of opinion that the plaintiff Robert 0. Jones, executor of Frances Carter, having died pending the action, it was properly abated as to him, and further proceeded with in the name of the other plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">And the court is therefore of opinion that the Circuit court erred in such and so much of its rulings as are contrary to the foregoing opinion, and especially in setting aside the first verdict of the jury and granting a new trial, instead of rendering a final judgment for the plaintiffs upon said verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Therefore it is considered that the said judgment of the Circuit court be reversed and annulled, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>plaintiffs recover against the defendant their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their writ of supersedeas aforesaid here. And this court proceeding to give such judgment as the said Circuit court ought to have given, it is further considered that all the proceedings in the action subsequent to the said first verdict of the jury be set aside and annulled, and that the plaintiffs recover against the defendant the negro slave Edmund in the said verdict mentioned, of the value therein mentioned, if he may be had; but if not, then the value aforesaid, together with his damages assessed by the jury in their said verdict, and their costs by them about their suit in the said Circuit court expended. But this judgment is to be without prejudice to any question which may arise in regard to the liability of the defendant for the alternative value of the said slave: this court only intending to give such judgment as the Circuit court ought to have given in the condition in which the case was when the judgment of that court was rendered, without deciding whether the said liability of the defendant is affected, and if so, to what extent, by the provision of the constitution in regard to the abolition of slavery, <em>or </em>by anything else which has transpired since the rendition of the said judgment\u2014. it being considered premature by the court to decide that question now, when the parties have not been heard upon it, and facts which may materially affect it have not been brought into the record. If the defendant shall be advised to raise the question in the Circuit court, he will have an opportunity to do so (notwithstanding this judgment), by motion to quash any execution which may be issued upon the said judgment, as to the said slave or his alternative value, or otherwise, as he may be advised. Which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
