On the trial the prisoner was found guilty, and the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary was fixed at three years. He thereupon moved the court for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence; hut the court overruled the motion, and rendered a judgment upon the verdict. The prisoner excepted to the opinion of the court overruling the motion, and the court having certified the facts proved, he applied to this court for a writ of error to the judgment; which was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-8\">There was evidence from which the jury might reasonably infer that parts of a hog or hogs found in the prisoner\u2019s house, had been stolen, and there was proof that Burwell had lost six hogs; but there was no proof that the meat found was a part of Burwell\u2019s hogs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-9\"><em>John Howard, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-10\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b582-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"ATG\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The court is of opinion that while the facts certified may be sufficient to raise a strong suspicion that a part of the meat found in the possession of the prisoner or his wife was stolen property, they do not identify it as part of the hogs supposed to have been stolen from Blair Bur-well ; but on the contrary tend to show that it was not a part of the said hogs; and that the Circuit court therefore erred in overruling the prisoner\u2019s motion for a new trial: Therefore it is considered that the said judgment be reversed and annulled. And this court proceeding to give such judgment as the said Circuit court ought to have given, it is further considered that the verdict of the jury be set aside. And the cause is remanded to the said Circuit court for a new trial to be had therein: which is ordered to be certified to the said Circuit court of Powhatan county.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">J\u00fcDSMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
