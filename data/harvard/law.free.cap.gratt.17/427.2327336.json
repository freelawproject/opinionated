In an action of covenant assigning numerous breaches, there is a verdict for the plaintiff, and. on a motion by the defendant for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict is against law and evidence, and that the damages are excessive, the jury report to the court the items which constituted the elements of their verdict; and the court being of opinion that as to some of the items the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, gives the plaintiff the option to reduce the verdict by the amount of these items, or to have a new trial; and the plaintiff agrees to take the verdict according to the opinion of the court. There is nothing in the action of the court to which either party can object.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b445-11\">2. In such a case the court states, in its judgment, the items disallowed and those allowed; and the defendant does not except to the opinion of the court.

In the agreement between a canal company and a contractor for building a dam, the company is to furnish the cement upon the written order of the contractor; but \u201c if from any cause the company shall not be able to supply it as required, they shall not be responsible for any damages arising to the contractor from the want of the same.\u201d It is not a sufficient excuse for failing to furnish the cement that the company had not a sufficient quantity on hand to supply it as required. It was their duty to use due and reasonable diligence to obtain and keep on hand a sufficient supply for that purpose. Their failure to do so is a breach of the covenant, for which the contractor may recover damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b445-14\"><em>4. </em>The agreement for the construction of a lock provides, that it is to be done with such changes and alterations thereof as might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>thereafter be adopted by the company; they paying all the additional expense for increase of work or materials caused by such change or alterations.

The company is only liable for a failure to comply with its covenant after its execution; but the contractor may show that it was executed prior to its date.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-9\">On the 8th of December, 1848, a covenant was entered into between the James River and Kanawha Company of the one part, and John L. Adams of the other, whereby the latter contracted to construct, in a substantial and workmanlike manner, the dam across James river, known as the \u201c Pedlar dam,\u201d and the river lock connected therewith, in conformity with certain specifications annexed to the covenant, and with the plan of the said dam and river lock exhibited by the company, and with such changes and alterations thereof as might thereafter be adopted by the president and directors of the said company, and to furnish all the materials which might be necessary and proper therefor, according to the specification, of such quality as the principal assistant engineer having the superintendence of the said dam and river lock, or the chief engineer. of the company, might approve. Stipulations were contained in the covenant that monthly estimates should be made by an engineer of the company, of the quantity and value of each species of work done pursuant to the contract, at the prices contained in the proposal annexed thereto, according to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>scale to be made out for tbe purpose by the principal assistant or chief engineer; which scale should provide for estimating the proportional value of any materials procured for said dam and river lock; and that there should be included in such monthly estimates all suitable materials which might have been delivered upon the land of the company near the site of the work, or at other places, if properly secured to the company; also the value of any extra work done in consequence of any alteration of the plan of the said dam and river lock, which might have been adopted by the president and directors of the company, and of the material required for the construction of such extra work, where such alteration shall have caused an increased expense to the contractor; and where any such alteration shall have caused a saving of expense to the contractor, a reasonable deduction was to be made therefor by the engineer making the said estimates. And it was mutually agreed between the contracting parties, that the said monthly estimates, after being corrected when necessary and approved in the manner provided by the contract, should be final and conclusive. At the first meeting of the president and directors after the due return of any monthly estimate or the correction of any errors therein, it was agreed that four-fifths of the sum appearing to be due for work performed and materials furnished since the preceding estimate, should be paid to the contractor; but no portion of the remaining fifth was to be paid until the contract should be fulfilled on the part of the contractor, and the whole work delivered to the company in good order in pursuance thereof. Within thirty days after the completion of the. work, a final estimate of all work not embraced in former estimates was to be made, approved and, if necessary, corrected, in the manner provided for in regard to monthly estimates; and at the first meeting of the president and directors after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>the adjustment of the final estimate, the whole balance due upon the contract was to be paid: provided, however, that such payment should not be made until the contract shad have been fulfilled on the part of the contractor and the whole work delivered to the company in good order in pursuance thereof. It was further agreed that the work should be commenced within thirty days from the date of the contract, should be steadily prosecuted without interruption until completed, and should he completed and delivered up in good order on or before the first of January, 1851). It was also agreed that all orders given by an engineer which should cause an increase or diminution of the quantity or value of the work to be performed should be given in writing, and that no claim for extra compensation for work done under any order of the engineer should be allowed to the contractor, unless the order was in writing. Other stipulations and details are contained in the contract, which are stated in the opinion of Judge Moncure. The work seems to have been commenced in due time, but was not finished until some time in 1851, though it does not appear that any objection was made on that account. Regular monthly estimates were made in pursuance of the contract, with one or two exceptions only (which are not a subject of objection in the case), commencing with the first day of January, 1849, and ending on the first of January, 1851, inclusive, four-fifths of Avhich were regularly paid to the contractor, who executed his receipts therefor, specifying in each receipt that the amount received was in full payment for the work done by him up to the date of the estimate to which the receipt applied after deducting the reserved twenty <em>per cent. </em>And on the first of December, 1851, a final estimate was made, the balance of which, after deducting the amount paid on the monthly estimates, $5,450 advanced at different times on account of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>reserved twenty <em>per cent., </em>and two other credits, was afterwards paid by order of the contractor to Thomas 0. Aeree, who gave his receipt to the company in full of the same. This receipt bears date March 15th, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">In September, 1852, John L. Adams the contractor, brought two actions against the James River and Kanawha company, for damages on account of their alleged violation of their contract with him in regard to the construction of the \u201cPedlar dam\u201d and river lock aforesaid; one of them an action of covenant founded on the contract aforesaid, and the other an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>In the former, the declaration set out the whole contract at length, with the specifications and proposal aforesaid annexed, and assigned thirteen breaches of the covenant. The defendants pleaded that they had not broken the covenant; on which plea issue was joined. In the action of assumpsit, the declaration contained only the common counts, and with it was filed a bill of particulars, headed \u201c The James River and Kanawha company in account with John L. Adams for work done and materials furnished in and about the Pedlar dam and the river lock connected therewith.\u201d The general issue was joined. In August and September, 1856, these actions came on to be tried together by the same jury, when a verdict was rendered, in the action of covenant for the plaintiff, and his damages were assessed at $ 12,000; and in the action of <em>assumpsit </em>for the defendants. Judgment was entered on the latter verdict without objection; and all proceedings in the action of <em>assumpsit </em>were thus ended. But in the action of covenant, a motion was made by the defendants to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, upon two grounds: 1st, that the verdict was against law and evidence <em>in toto, </em>and 2dly, that if the plaintiff was entitled to any recovery, the damages were excessive. The court was of opinion that the verdict was not against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>law and evidence <em>in toto, </em>but that the damages were excessive to the extent of $7,000'; and upon the plaintiff\u2019s consenting in open court to release that amount of the verdict, the court gave judgment for the remaining $5,000 with interest and costs. In the opinion of the court overruling the motion for a new trial, which seems to have been entered on the order book as a part of the judgment, the mode in which the court arrived at the conclusion that the damages were excessive is stated; from which it appears that the jury reported to the court the items which constituted the elements of their verdict for $12,000; which items are set forth in the opinion, as also are the reasons of the court, for considering that as to some of them, which are enumerated, the plaintiff was precluded and barred from a recovery by the monthly and final estimates made in pursuance of the contract, there having been proved neither fraud nor mistake as to the latter items. But as to the other items reported by the jury, the court was of opinion, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, notwithstanding the monthly and final estimates; and the evidence being conflicting, the court could not say that the damages assessed for those items were excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">No exception was taken to the opinion or action of the court on the motion for a new trial. But on the trial of the cause, fifteen instructions to the jury were moved for by the defendants, all of which were given by the court, except the 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th, 14th and 15th, which were refused; but the 15th was modified and then given. To such refusal the defendants excepted. These instructions are stated in'the opinion of Judge Moncure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">The judgment was rendered on the 5th of September, 1856, and on the 24th of August, 1861, the James River and Kanawa company applied to this court for a writ of error, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-4\">There was no counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-16\"> He was a stockholder in the company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-5\">Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AMR\">after stating the case, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The defendants took no step to have this judgment of the Circuit court reviewed by this corn t from the time it was rendered, on the 5th of September, 1856, to the 24th of August, 1861\u2014-a period of nearly five years\u2014which number of years, if it had fully elapsed, would have barred the presentation of a petition for a <em>supersedeas. </em>This delay, in part at least, may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the cases of <em>Condon </em>v. <em>South Side Railroad Company, </em>14 Gratt. 302, and <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Polly, Woods &amp; Co., </em>Id. <em>447, </em>which seem to be supposed to have a material bearing upon this case, were not reported until 1859 ; and by the further fact that the case of the James River and Kanawha Company v. Adams\u2014a case between these same parties founded on a contract almost identically the same with the contract in this case, for the construction of the \u201cBald Eagle\u201d dam and a river lock connected therewith\u2014was not decided by this court until the 14th of April, 1858, though it was pending here when the judgment of the Circuit court in this case was rendered. The delay is unimportant, however, as it was not for full five years. On the 24th of August, 1861, the defendants applied for and obtained an order for a <em>supersedeas. </em>In their petition they assign for errors, 1st, the refusal of the court to give the 7th, 8th, 11th, 13th and 15th instructions asked for by the defendants; and 2dly, the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial; in support of which second assignment of error, the decisions of this court above mentioned are cited and firmly relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The second assignment of error will first be disposed of, and upon the ground that no exception was taken by the defendants to the opinion of the court overruling their motlon ^01\u2019 a new trial, upon the plaintiffs releasing $7,000 of the damages assessed by the jury. Their failure to take such exception may, perhaps, be accounted for in the same way which has been suggested in regard to their application for this appeal, and they may then have had little hope of being able to reduce the amount of damages which might be recovered against them on a new trial'to less than $5,000. But whatever their motive may have been in not taking such exception, the effect is the same, and the judgment cannot be reversed for any supposed error of the court in overruling the motion for a new trial. In the first place, all the facts of the case are not certified so as to enable this court to determine the question; and in the second place, if there had been an exception, the plaintiff might have withdrawn his release or declined giving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Reference is made in the argument of the appellant's counsel to what is said to be the \u201c extraordinary conduct of the judge in obtaining from the jury a statement of the grounds of their verdict.\u201d I see no just ground of objection to this course of proceeding. The jury had performed their function by finding a verdict for the plaintiff and assessing his damages. The defendants moved for a new trial. The judge thought that the plaintiff was entitled to recover <em>some </em>damages, but that the amount assessed by the jury was excessive. He wished to end the case-, and thus- prevent the expense, trouble and delay of a new trial, by giving judgment for so much of the damages as he might think just, provided the plaintiff would release the residue. But his difficulty \"was to ascertain what was just, and he referred to the jury, who were, judges of the facts and had tried the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>case, to aid him in overcoming this difficulty. If he could have come to a satisfactory conclusion in regard to the facts upon his hearing of them in the course of the trial, he might, and no doubt would, have acted upon that conclusion. But as he could not, or did not, I see no impropriety in calling the jury to his aid. The plaintiff cannot complain of this, because he is not bound to give the release, which is merely proposed to his election as an alternative to the granting of a new trial; and <em>a fortiori, </em>the defendants cannot complain, because it is for their benefit that the damages are reduced, and they may still except to the opinion of the court if they consider it erroneous. A motion for a new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, and the object of granting it is to attain the justice of the case. If that object could be attained in the mode pursued by the judge in this case, it was proper for him to pursue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The other assignment of error will now be considered, and that is, the refusal of the court to give the 7th, 8th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th instructions asked for by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">. The 7th is in these words: \u201c That although the jury may believe that the defendants were responsible for delays, by which the plaintiff was subjected to inconvenience and loss, that upon the present aspect of the pleadings in these causes the plaintiff can recover no damages therefor: not in the action upon the covenant, because such delay is no breach of the written covenants entered into by the defendants; nor in the action on the case, because it only declares for work and labor done and performed and materials furnished, and lays no claim for damages for any loss, but only <em>ex </em>contractu.\u201d The 8th is in these words: \u201cThat according to that provision of the covenant declared upon, which provides that \u00a3it is expressly stipulated that although the Canal company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>agrees to furnish the cement for this dam, yet if from any cause the said company should not be able to supply it as required, they shall not be responsible for any damages to the contractor for the want of the same,\u2019 the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for any failure on the part of the defendants to supply him with ceihent unless he presented a written requisition for the same as required by the covenant, and the defendants, having a sufficient quantity on hand to supply said requisition at the time, refused to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The material specifications in regard to cement in the contract are, that \u201c the cement shall be furnished by the Canal company, and shall be taken by the contractor for the dam from some one of the deposits of cement which shall be established by the Canal company, upon' the written 01 der which he shall from time to time receive from the engineer for the same, and the engineer shall be the sole judge as to-which deposit it shall be-drawn from, and shall express the same in said order; and the said contractor shall transport the cement so received to said work in good tight barrels, casks or bags, to be provided by him at his own cost, and shall keep it secured from the weather until used, in suitable, cement houses, built at his own cost, one near each abutment, under the direction and subject to the approval of the engineer; but the company shall pay -the contractor, upon the completion of the dam, one-half of a cent per bushel per mile for every bushel of cement transported by him in good order and actually used in his contract. On presenting the written order of the engineer and receiving the cement, the contractor, his agent or boatman, shall apply to the company\u2019s agent from whom he received it, for a certificate of the quantity and quality of the cement which may be delivered to him; which certificate shall be presented to the assistant engineer, on the arrival of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>cement at the place where it is to be' used, and it shall be the duty of the assistant engineer to examine and compare the cement delivered there with that which the certificate calls for. No cement shall be used in the -work which shall have been damaged on its passage from the mill, depot or kiln, or while in the possession of the contractor; and in the event of any cement being so damaged, the loss of the same shall be sustained by the contractor. It is expressly stipulated, that although the Canal company agree to furnish the cement for this dam, yet if from any cause the said company shall not be able to supply it as required, they shall not be responsible for any damages arising to the contractor from the want of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">By these stipulations of the contract the company were bound to furnish the cement for the dam, as required by the contractor as aforesaid, <em>if of ability to do so, </em>and were responsible for any damages arising to the contractor from the want of the same, if, <em>being able, </em>they failed so to furnish it. It was not a sufficient excuse for failing so to furnish it, that they had not a sufficient quantity on hand to supply it as required. It was their duty to use due and reasonable diligence to obtain and keep on hand a sufficient supply for that purpose. The 7th and 8th instructions asked for by the defendants were therefore properly refused. The 7th, because, if the plaintiff sustained damages from being delayed by the failure of the defendants to furnish the cement as aforesaid accord-ding to their covenant, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover such damages in the action of covenant. And the 8th, because it confines the title of the plaintiff to recover for any failure on the part of the defendants to supply him with cement, to the single case of their refusal to do so on his presentation of a written requisition for the same as required by the covenant, <em>they having a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>sufficient quantity on hand to supply said requisition at the time: </em>thus ignoring the obligation of the defendants to use due and reasonable diligence to obtain and keep on hand a sufficient supply. The instruction should have been to the effect, \u201c that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover for any failure on the part of the defendants to supply him with cement unless he presented a written requisition for the same, as required by the covenant, and the defendants refused to do so, though they .had, <em>or might, by using reasonable diligence, have had </em>a sufficient quantity on hand to supply said requisition at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The 11 th instruction asked for by the defendants is in these words: \u201cthat at anytime during the progress of the work they had a right under said contract to abandon the construction of the lock on the south side of the river, and to erect it on the north side and to change the materials out of which it was to be constructed; and that they incurred no other liability than that prescribed in the contract itself, that of paying all the additional expense for increase of work or materials prescribed in the covenant caused by said work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">I can see no just ground of objection to this instruction, and think it ought to have been given. The contract, as we have seen, expressly bound the contractor to construct in a substantial and workmanlike manner the \u201cPedlar dam\u201d and river lock connected therewith, in conformity with the annexed specification, and with the plan of the said dam and the river lock exhibited by the company, <em>and with such changes and alterations thereof as might thereafter be adopted by the president and directors of the said company; </em>thus reserving to the defendants the right to adopt such changes and alterations of the work as they might thereafter think proper; and they had, therefore, a right, under the contract, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>abandon the construction of the lock on the south side of the river, and'to erect it on the north side, and to change the materials out of which it was to be constructed; and by so doing, they incurred no other liability than that prescribed in the contact itself; that of paying all the additional expense for increase of work or materials, caused by the adoption of such changes and alterations, for the ascertainment and payment of which additional expense express provision was made by the contract. There being no breach of the contract on the part of the defendants by reason of any such changes and alterations, they could have incurred no liability therefor beyond what the contract prescribed, and if any other damage was sustained by the plaintiff therefrom it was <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The 13th instruction asked for by the defendants is, that if the jury 51 believe from the evidence, that notwithstanding any modification, change or alteration in the plan, construction or material used, the plaintiff continued the woik, and. the work done in pursuance of such modification, chang'e or alteration, was estimated according to the terms of the contract, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action for any work done according to said modification, change or alteration, or any loss of time, or consequence thereof, unless the defendants acted in bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">I think this instruction also ought to have been given, and substantially for the reasons assigned in regard to the 11th instruction. Of course the instruction must be understood as implying, what the evidence tended to prove, that the work done in pursuance of such modification, change or alteration was <em>paid for, </em>as well as \u201cestimated, according to the terms of the contract;\u201d but to make the meaning more plain, the words \u201c and paid,\u201d should have been inserted after the word \u201cestimated.\u201d If the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>danfcs acted in good faith in regard to any modification, change or alteration made by them in the plan, construction or material of the work, and estimates were duly made and paid according to the terms of the contract, there could be no further liability on them for any work done according to said modification, change or alteration, or any loss of time or consequence thereof, for there was no breach of the contract in that respect:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The 15th instruction to the jury asked for by the defendants was, \u201cto disregard all evidence of a failure on the part of the defendants to supply the plaintiff with cement prior to the 8th day of December, 1848 (the date of the covenant sued on);\u201d which instruction the court refused to give as asked for, but gave it in a modified form as follows, to wit: \u201cthat the jury should disregard all evidence of a failure on the part of the defendants to supply the plaintiff with cement prior to the 8th day of December, 1848 (the date of the covenant sued on), unless it should be proved to the satisfaction of the jury, that the said covenant was executed before the 8th day of December, 1848.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">I can perceive no just ground of objection to this modification of the instruction asked for, and no injury which it could have caused to the defendants. I therefore think the court did not err in giving the instruction in the modified, instead of the original, form. There is evidence in the record that the work was commenced, and the covenant may have been executed, before the day on which it bears date.' If it was, it should have effect from the time at which it was executed. If it was not, then the defendants had the full benefit of their instruction in the form in which they offered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Upon the whole, I think the court erred in refusing to give the 11th and 13th instructions asked for by the defendants, and therefore the judgment ought to be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>\u2022versed, the verdict set aside, and the cause remanded for a new trial to be had therein; on which new trial, should the evidence be in substance the same as on the former trial, and the said instructions be again asked for, they ought to be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Joynes, J. concurred in the opinion of Moncure, P.</p>\n<p id=\"AsO\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Note.\u2014The case of <em>The James River and Kanawha Company </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>referred to in this case, was decided by this court on the 14th day of April, 1858. It was founded on a contract for the construction of the <em>\u201c </em>Bald Eagle dam\u201d and a river lock connected therewith; which contract was similar to the one on which this case is founded. All the judges were present, except Judge <em>Daniel, </em>who had an interest in the case, which prevented him from sitting; and all present concurred in the following opinion, delivered by Judge Moncuee, which sufficiently states the case to make the opinion intelligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">I am of opinion that the Circuit court erred in refusing to give the 4th instruction; and also in giving the instruction which it did in lieu therooi. The 4th instruction is according to the substance and almost in the very words of the contract, and ought therefore to have been given in the form in which it was asked. The contract prescribes the mode in which monthly estimates are to be made and approved, of the quantity and value of each species of work done in pursuance thereof at the prices contained in the proposal, &amp;c., and directs that the value of any extra work done in consequence of any alteration of the plan, &amp;c., should be included in the said estimates. It then expressly deelaies that any estimate made and approved as aforesaid, shall he <em>final and conclusive, </em>unless objected to before paid, &amp;c. There is nothing unlawful in these provisions of the contract, and full effect must therefore he given to them. How, then, could the court witli propriety refuse to instruct the jury that estimates so made and approved, and the receipt of the money specified therein, are by the terms of the covenant to he regarded conclusive evidence as between the parties, of the prices of the work, &amp;c., as therein set forth? And how could the court with propriety instruct the jury that such estimates and receipts were <em>prima fade </em>evidence only of the prices of the work, &amp;e.? The error was Dot cured by further instructing the jury that to enable the plaintiff to rebut and overcome such <em>prima fade </em>evidence, and. to recover for such work, &amp;c., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>higher prices than those mentioned in such estimates and receipts, he must prove that an agreement was made between him and the defendants for such higher prices; or that there was no agreement between them on the subject of price, so as to leave that an open question to he settled'by the jury upon the principle of a <em>quantum meruit, </em>in assessing their damages in an action of covenant. If there was in fact a new agreement between the parties as to prices, then the action to recover such prices should have been upon the new agreement and not upon the covenant. This action being upon the covenant, only the covenant prices can he recovered. If there was no new agreement between them on the subject of price, the question was not an open one to be settled by the jury, blit was closed by the. covenant, which provided a mode of ascertaining it. The covenant provided for the construction of the entire work in conformity with a specification and plan agreed upon, with such changes and alterations thereof as might afterwards be adopted by the company ; and it provided a mode of ascertaining the amount to be paid for the entire work, whether done in piusuance of the said specification and plan, or of any such changes and alterations. That mode was by monthly and final estimates. If made, approved and not objected to according to the covenant, they are, by the very terms of the covenant, final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">But even if the question as to the price of any of the work done by the plaintiff under the covenant could ever have been cons.dered as an open one, it was certainly settled and concluded by the facts that such work was included in estimates made and approved according to the covenant, and that the plaintiff, without objection thereto, had, either in the manner mentioned in the covenant or otherwise, received the money mentioned therein and executed receipts therefor. Such estimates and receipts ought surely to he regarded as conclusive evidence of the price of the work, even without reference to the terms of the covenant expressly declaring them to be so. The monthly estimates (33 or 34 in number) appear generally to have been made on the first day of each month, commencing July 1st, 1848, and ending May 1st, 1851. The amount due on each estimate was paid a few days after its date, and a receipt, written under the estimate, was given by the plaintiff' for the amount; \u201cbeing,\u201d as each receipt expresses, \u201cfull payment for the work done by me on the above mentioned dam up to the date of the above estimate, after deducting the reserved twenty per cent, as above stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It is argued by the counsel for the defendant in error, that there is a difference between <em>monthly </em>and <em>final </em>estimates in regard to their effect as evidence; and that while the latter are conclusive according to the decision of this court in <em>Kidwell </em>v. <em>The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., </em>11 Gratt. 676, the former are not. \u2018Whether either are conclusive or not, depends upon the contract, which may make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>either or both conclusive, according to the intention of the parties. Sometimes these monthly or periodical estimates are obviously designed as mere approximations, to enable the company to make safe and reasonable advancements to the contractor during the progress of the work. All that is required to the validity of such estimates (it has been held) is, that they were made <em>bona fide </em>and with the intention of acting according to the exigency of the contract. Red-field on Railways, 207; <em>Rouger </em>v. <em>Great Western Railway, </em>27 Eng. L. &amp; E. R. 35-46. If evidence at all in an action for the balance due on the completion of the work, they would only be <em>prima facie ; </em>or, if conclusive, it could only he as an estoppel in connection with evidence of the assent of the parties. But ordinarily these monthly estimates are designed to be accurate and final, as far as they go; aDd sometimes the contract expressly provides that they shall he final and conclusive. Redfield 207 ; <em>Herrick </em>v. <em>Belknap\u2019s estate, </em>&amp;c., 27 Verm. R. 673 ; <em>Barker, </em>&amp;c. v. <em>Same, </em>Id. 700. The contract in this case so provides. It prescribes the same mode of proceeding in re_ gard to the final as in regard to the monthly estimates, and declares both, alike, final and conclusive. Indeed, it directs the final estimate to be made, not of the whole work, but of all work <em>not embraced in former estimates. </em>Thus showing that, in effect, the final estimate is the last monthly estimate, and all the monthly estimates, as far as they go, are final estimates. It is true that these monthly estimates are not final and conclusivo as to matters not embraced there.n, or not considered and estimated by the engineer in making them. In this respect they are unlike the final estimate, which was intended and expressly directed to embrace \u201c all work not embraced in former estimates;\u201d so that while a part of the work might have been omitted in former estimates because of its unfinished state or otherwise, it must of necessity be embraced in the final estimate. But as to matters embraced in the monthly estimates, they are as conclusive as the final estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\">But it is argued that a <em>fraudulent </em>estimate is not conclusive, and that therefore the court would have erred in giving the 4th iustruc. tion asked for by the defendants. AFithout deciding whether fraud in making the estimates would avoid them at law or n.-.t, it is a sufficient answer to the argument to say that fraud will not be presumed, and that there was no evidence whatever of any such fraud before the jury. If the plaintiff had evidence of any such fraud, he should have offered to introduce it, and thus have plainly raised Die question. Indeed, there is no charge of fraud in the declaration, and certainly the court did not refuse to give the 4th instruction, and give another in lieu thereof, on the ground of fraud, but on wholly different and inconsistent grounds. An award is\u2019final and conclusive in equity as well as at law; and yet it may bo avoided, always in equity and sometimes at law, by proof of fraud. Such proof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>when admissible, gets the award out of the way. So long as it remains in the way, it is final and conclusive. It is never <em>prima facie </em>evidence merely, of the matter it decides. If evidence at all, it must be conclusive. And so of the monthly estimates in this case. If evidence at all, they must he conclusive and not <em>prima facie. </em>They were offered and received as evidence without objection. No motion was made to exclude them. No evidence was offered to impeach them on the ground of fraud or otherwise. The court, therefore, erred in refusing to instruct the jury that they were conclusive, and instructing them that they were <em>prima facie </em>evidence only of the prices of the work, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">I am therefore of opinion that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
