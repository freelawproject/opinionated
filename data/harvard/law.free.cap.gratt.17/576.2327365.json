The constable was one in authority over him; and the statement is not admissible in evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWy\">This was an indictment in the Circuit court of the county of Rockbridge, against Greorge Vaughan, a freedman. The indictment contained but one count, and charged that the prisoner did on, &amp;c., feloniously, in the night time, break and enter the plough shop of Hugh F. Lyle, with intent, the goods and chattels of the said Lyle then and there being found, feloniously to steal, take and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>carry away, and one lot of queensware of the value of <em>d J 7 x </em>sixty dollars, one drawing knife of the value of one dollar, one saw of the value of two dollars, and one hatchet of the value of one dollar, then and there being found, feloniously did steal, take and carry away, against the peace, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-6\">On the trial of the case, the only evidence against the prisoner was his admission. It appears that the prisoner, a freedman of about seventeen years of age, with one Tom Brown, also a freedman, was arrested on the affidavit of Hugh F. Lyle, on the charge of house-breaking and larceny, and without any warning by the magistrate that they were not bound to criminate themselves, upon the confession of Tom Brown, they were committed for trial by a magistrate of Rockbridge county, and the prisoner was sent to jail in charge of Humphreys, into whose custody as special constable, he was delivered, and also in charge of Hugh F. Lyle, the prosecutor; and that on the way to the jail, Humphreys said to the prisoner, \u201cyou had as well tell all about it,\u201d referring thereby to the house-breaking and larceny charged against him. After they had rode about a mile, after Humphreys had made the remark above stated, without any other remark being addressed to the prisoner by Humphreys or Lyle, he voluntarily said to Lyle, I will tell you all about it; and then proceeded to tell how the act had been done, and who were engaged in it. The prisoner, by his counsel, moved the court to exclude the evidence, on the ground that it was induced by what had occurred before the magistrate, and the remarks of Humphreys, a person in authority over the accused. But the court overruled the motion, and admitted the evidence; and the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b595-9\">The jury found the prisoner guilty, and fixed the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary at two years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>And the prisoner thereupon moved the court to arrest the <em>x x </em>judgment, on the ground that the indictment set forth a substantive charge of grand larceny, in stealing a lot of queensware, which is so uncertain and defective, that he could not upon any subsequent trial for stealing, &amp;c., the specific articles of queensware, plead or prove a form\u00e9r acquittal or conviction. But the court overruled the motion, and entered judgment upon the verdict. And the prisoner applied to this court for a writ of error ;\u2022 which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>Dorman, </em>for the prisoner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-7\"><em>The Attorney General, </em>for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-8\">Joynes, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKl\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The indictment in this case contains a single count, in which the prisoner is charged with breaking and entering, in the night time, the shop of Hugh F. Lyle with intent to steal the goods of said Hugh F. Lyle \u201c then and' there being found,\u201d and with stealing certain articles \u201cthen and there being found.\u201d Among the articles alleged to have been stolen was \u201cone lot of queensware.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ai-\">- The prisoner having been found guilty by the jury, moved the court to arrest the judgment; and assigned as the ground- of the motion that the charge of stealing \u201cone lot of queensware,\u201d without further description, is' so uncertain that the prisoner could not, if subsequently\" indicted for stealing the specific articles comprised in the said \u201clot of queensware,\u201d avail himself of the plea of former conviction in this case. And the further ground is -taken in the petition that the articles alleged to b\u00e9stolen are not described as the property of any person.' The grounds thus alleged for arresting the judgment both rest upon the assumption that, by the verdict in this case, the petitioner has been found guilty of the crime of larceny, and'-not-merely of the crime of breaking and enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ing the shop with intent to commit larceny. The court has just decided in <em>Speers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>that the effect of a general verdict of guilty 'upon such a count as the one in this case, is to convict the prisoner of the crime of breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny, and not of the crime of larceny also. The ground upon which the motion in arrest was placed in the court below cannot, therefore, be sustained. And the further ground taken in the petition is equally untenable. As we have held in <em>Speers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>the allegation of an actual larceny is only in aid of the allegation of intent. If that allegation were struck out altogether, enough would remain to describe the offence of which the prisoner has been convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Such being the object for which the charge of an actual larceny is introduced in cases of this character, it need not be laid with the same formality as in an indictment for the larceny itself. <em>Larned </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Metc. R. 240; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doherty, </em>10 Cush. R. 52. And see <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>1 C. &amp; K. 421 (47 Eng. C. L. R). It is always better, however, to lay the charge of larceny in proper form, to avoid objection in case the prisoner should, as he may, on such a count as this, be found not guilty of the breaking and entering, but guilty of the larceny. I do not mean to intimate, however, that the objections taken in this case would have been sufficient to arrest the judgment, if the prisoner had been found guilty of larceny. The description of the goods stolen as \u201ca lot of queensware,\u201d is sufficient, after verdict. And upon a subsequent indictment for stealing the specific articles embraced in the \u201clot of queensware,\u201d the prisoner would not lose the benefit of a plea of former conviction, because he would have a right to establish the identity of the articles by proof. 3 Greenleaf Evid. \u00a7 36; 2 Leading Crim. Cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>500-561. And so the allegation that the prisoner broke 0 A an(j entered the shop with intent to steal the goods of Lyle \u201cthen and there found,\u201d and that he \u201cthen and there stole the goods described,\u201d is a sufficient averment, after verdict, that the goods stolen were the property of Lyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">But I am of opinion that the court erred in overruling the objection of the prisoner to the admission of the confession offered in evidence against him. The confession was made while the prisoner was in the custody of Humphreys, a special constable, who, together with Lyle the prosecutor and owner of the shop and goods, was taking \u2022 him to jail after he had been committed by the magistrate. While on the road Humphreys said to the prisoner, \u201cyou had better tell all about it.\u201d After the parties had gone about a mile further, and without, as far as appears, any other remark having been made by any one of them, the prisoner said to Lyle, \u201c I will tell all about it,\u201d and proceeded to make the confession which was given in evidence. The confession, though not made immediately after the remark of Humphreys to the prisoner, seems evidently to have been induced by it. The form of the prisoner\u2019s first remark to Lyle indicates that it was made with reference to what Humphreys had said to him, and as the result of reflection in the interval. His reflection upon the remark of Humphreys seems to have led him to the conclusion that it would be better for him to \u201ctell all about it;\u201d and he therefore proceeded to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Humphreys was a \u201cperson in authority,\u201d within the doctrine established by this court in <em>Smith's Case, </em>10 Gratt. 734; and <em>Shifflet's Case, </em>14 Gratt. 652. That such a remark as that made by Humphreys, proceeding from a person in authority, will render a confession induced by it inadmissible is well established by the Eng<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>lish cases, and was recognized in the opinion of Judge Moncure in <em>Shiffletts Case, </em>in which all the other judges concurred. 1 Greenleaf Evid. \u00a7 219; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>4 C. &amp; P. 3S7 (19 Eng. C. L. R. 434); cases cited, 2 Leading Or. Cases 164-232.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">In another part of the bill-of exceptions, the remark of Humphreys is stated to have been, \u201cyou had <em>as well </em>tell all about it.\u201d But we must take it to have been in the other form, in which it is given in that part of the bill which states the evidence which was admitted by the court. The difference between the two forms of expression is unimportant. One form of expression ivas calculated to produce as much effect, and the very same effect, upon the mind of the prisoner as the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">I am of opinion to reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
