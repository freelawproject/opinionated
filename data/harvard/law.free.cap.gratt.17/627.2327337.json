Hewitt was indicted for an assault and battery committed in February, 1863, upon Rowland D. Buford. This indictment was made upon the evidence of Rowland I). Buford, a witness called on by the grand jury. A summons was thereupon awarded, returnable to the next term of the court, but on the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>day, viz: on the 1st of May, on the motion of the attorney for the commonwealth, writs of <em>capias </em>were awarded against Heivitt to the sheriff of every county and the sergeant of every corporation in the state, returnable to the next term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-8\">On the 22d of September, 1863, the defendant was arrested by the sergeant of the corporation of Lynch-burg under the process sent to him; and he entered into a recognizance with surety for his appearance on the first day of the next term of the Circuit court of Bed-ford. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-9\">At the April term of the court for 1864 Hewitt appeared by counsel, and an issue was made up on the plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d And the case coming on for trial on the 27th of April, 1864, the jury found him guilty, and assessed upon him a fine of two thousand dollars; for which and the costs the court entered up a judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-10\">When the cause was called for trial Hewitt, by his counsel, moved the court for a continuance, on the ground of the absence of material witnesses, viz: John Downes and John Hurley; and in support of his motion offered his own affidavit. This affidavit was full as to the materiality, &amp;c., of the witnesses. It bore date the 23d day of April, 1864. It was admitted that a <em>subpoena </em>had been regularly issued for these witnesses, and had been served on John Downes a short time before he left this state for Baltimore, where he resides; and as to John Hurley, returned not found. A subpoena for Hurley had also been sent to Bichmond; and was returned not found. And the sergeant added after the return: \u201c This man has been discharged from Castle Thunder, and don't know where he has gone. T. U. D., Serg\u2019t.\u201d Hurley was known to have been in Bichmond a short time before the <em>subpoena </em>was sent'there. He had resided at Liberty until the winter of 1863-4, when he was arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>by the military authorities and sent to Castle Thunder at Richmond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-4\">It was also admitted that Hewitt was in Liberty on the morning of the day the motion for a continuance was made, and that he left in the cars going west; and the affidavit bore date two days before the court commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b647-5\">The court refused to continue the cause, and ruled the defendant to trial, because the court was of opinion that the defendant was attempting to evade a trial by absenting himself from court, so as to prevent a personal examination in open court, on his motion for a continuance. To this opinion\u2019of the court, Hewitt excepted; and obtained a writ of error to the judgment. ;</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b647-6\"><em>Mosby, </em>for the appellant, and <em>The Attorney General, </em>for the commonwealth, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b647-7\">Moncure, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AbA\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">A motion for a continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the court, under all the circumstances of the case; and though an appellate court will supervise the action of an inferior court on such a motion, it will not reverse a judgment on that ground, unless such action was <em>plainly </em>erroneous. As a general rule, where a witness for a party fails to appear at the time appointed for the trial, if such party show that a <em>subpoena </em>for the witness has been returned executed, or, if not so returned, was delivered to the proper officer of the county or corporation in which the witness resides, a reasonable time before the time for the trial, and shall swear that the witness is material, and that he cannot safely go to trial without his testimony, a continuance ought to be granted. 1 Rob. Pr. old ed. p. 250. The party thus shows, <em>prima facie, </em>that he is not ready for trial, <em>though </em>he has used due diligence to be so; and in the absence of anything to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>show the contrary, the court ought to give him credit \u00edor honesty of intention and to continue the case, if there be reasonable ground to believe that the attendance of the witness at the next term of the court can be secured, especially if the case has not been before continued for the same cause. But circumstances may satisfy the court that^the real purpose of the party in moving for a continuance is to <em>delay </em>or <em>evade </em>the trial, and not to <em>prepare </em>for it, and in such case, of course, the motion ought to be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In this case a motion for a continuance was made by the defendant in the court below, on the ground of the absence of two material witnesses, Downes and Hurley; and he exhibited, in support of the motion, his own affidavit, stating in due form the materiality of the witnesses, and that he could not safely go to trial without their testimony. It was admitted that a <em>subpoena </em>had been regularly issued for said witnesses (directed no doubt to the sheriff of Bedford county, in which the prosecution was pending, though the fact is not so stated in the record), and served on the said Downes a short time before he left the state for Baltimore, where he resided, and returned \u201cnot found\u201d as to Hurley. A <em>subpoena </em>for Hurley had been sent to Richmond and returned \u201cnot found,\u201d with a memorandum made by the officer at the foot of his return in these words: \u201cThis man has been discharged from Oastle Thunder, and don\u2019t know where he has gone. T. U.D., Sgt.\u201d Hurley was known to have been in Richmond a short time before the <em>subpoena </em>was sent there. He had resided in Liberty (the county seat of Bedford, in which countv the offence was charged to have been committed) till the winter of 1863-4, when he was arrested by the military authorities and sent to Oastle Thunder at Richmond. It was also admitted that the defendant Hewitt was in Liberty on the morning of the day on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the motion was made, and that he left in the cars going west, and the affidavit bore date two days before the court commenced. The court refused to continue the case, and ruled the defendant into trial, \u201cbecause,\u201d as stated in the bill of exceptions, \u201cthe court was of opinion that the defendant was attempting to <em>evade </em>a trial by absenting himself from court, so as to prevent a personal examination in open court, on his motion for a continuance.\u201d The case was then tried, and the jury found the defendant guilty and assessed his fine at $2,000, for which and the costs of the prosecution the court rendered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">The offence for which the defendant was tried was an assault and battery on Rowland D. Buford, which would appear from the amount of the fine to have been an aggravated offence; though as the fine may have been, and probably was, assessed in Confederate currency, we cannot well estimate its true amount in good money. The indictment was' found on the 25th of April, 1863, and though found 4on the testimony of Buford on whom the offence was charged to have been committed, yet it appears that he was not a voluntary prosecutor, but was called on by the grandJury to give evidence. When the indictment was found, a summons was awarded to answer it, returnable to the next term. But on a succeeding day of the same term, to wit, on the 1st of May, 1863, on the motion of the attorney for the commonwealth and for reasons appearing to the court, it was ordered that writs of <em>capias </em>be awarded against the defendant, directed to the sheriff of every county and sergeant of every corporation in the state, returnable to the next term. One of these writs, directed to the sergeant of the city of Lynchburg, was executed on the defendant in that city on the 22d of September, 1863, when he entered into a recognizance with surety for his appearance on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>first day of the next term of the court, which was to he in a few days thereafter. As stated in the petition, there was no session of the court at the time fixed for that term, nor until the following spring term in 1864, to which time the defendants\u2019 recognizance stood over hy operation of law, and it bound him for his appearance <em>then </em>as if it had been taken with express condition therefor. Code, ch. 161, \u00a7 15. Instead of making his appearance then, in discharge of his recognizance, and although he was in Liberty, the county seat of Bedford, on the morning of the day on which the case was called for trial, yet he left in the cars going west on the same morning (for what place bound, or on what business does not appear), leaving his affidavit aforesaid to be used as the ground-work of a motion for a continuance. Under these circumstances we cannot say that the court was not warranted in the opinion, \u201cthat the defendant was attempting to evade a trial by absenting himself from court, so as to prevent a personal examination in open court on his motion for a continuance And certainly we cannot say that the court plainly erred in refusing to continue the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Judgment affirmed: <em>but without damages.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
