Thorne challenges the amount of methamphetamine attributed to him in the presentence investigation report and the enhancement of his sentence for causing a substantial risk of harm to a minor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">On October 7, 2008, officers of the Sheriffs Department of Bulloch County, Georgia, went to the residence of Tony Finch to investigate whether he had a car that had been reported stolen. At the sight of the officers on Finch\u2019s property, Victoria Foley discarded a device used to smoke methamphetamine, and she and Marlena Taylor fled. After a search of the property, officers discovered evidence that Finch was manufacturing methamphetamine in a large storage building about 20 feet from Finch\u2019s house. The officers obtained a search warrant and discovered in the storage building and Finch\u2019s home precursor materials used to manufacture methamphetamine and 108.3 grams of methamphetamine. Among the items discovered in the storage building was a silver thermos that contained anhydrous ammonia.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">For the next several days, officers interviewed Finch and his cohorts about the methamphetamine operation. Finch admitted that he had entered a conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine five months before his arrest and the conspirators produced between 7 and 54 grams each week. Finch stated that he had witnessed Thorne, Brian Dean, and another member of the conspiracy manufacture methamphetamine in a shed behind Glenn Shuman\u2019s property in Brooklet, Georgia. Finch said that the group had produced as much as 80 grams of methamphetamine at each cook, and he had seen 80 grams of methamphetamine at Shuman\u2019s residence on October 5, 2008. A federal inmate, Billy Joe Williams, told authorities that he had purchased from Finch on at least twelve occasions between 3.5 and 7 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">Other cohorts described Thorne\u2019s role in the conspiracy. Victoria Foley, who had been apprehended outside Finch\u2019s home, told agents that Thorne had sold her 2 grams of methamphetamine two or three times, Thorne had given her methamphetamine on other occasions, and Thorne had offered to teach Foley to manufacture methamphetamine. Foley stated that Dean and Taylor had a two-year-old daughter who had been at Finch\u2019s home the morning of October 7, 2008. Foley also stated that she had transported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Thorne, Finch, Taylor, and Taylor\u2019s daughter to Shuman\u2019s residence, where they obtained anhydrous ammonia that the group brought to Finch\u2019s residence in a silver thermos.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Shuman was arrested in December 2007 with 88 grams of methamphetamine in his possession. Shuman told investigators that he received methamphetamine from Thorne as compensation for allowing him to stay at Shuman\u2019s residence. Shuman stated that Thorne and Dean had manufactured methamphetamine at Shuman\u2019s residence on two or three occasions and Thorne \u201calways\u201d supplied the anhydrous ammonia for the methamphetamine cooks. Shuman also stated that the silver thermos that had been discovered in the large storage building belonged to Thorne.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">After Finch\u2019s arrest, Thorne continued to distribute methamphetamine. While Finch was incarcerated, he gave an inmate a telephone number to order methamphetamine from Thorne. When federal agents later arrested Thorne, they searched his car and discovered a duffle bag containing 32.1 grams of marijuana, 1.01 grams of methamphetamine packaged in three plastic bags, and a spoon and several syringes with methamphetamine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Thorne, Finch, Taylor, and a codefen-dant were indicted for conspiring to manufacture, possessing with intent to distribute, and distributing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine or 500 grams or more of a mixture of a substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(viii). Thorne executed a plea agreement with the government to plead guilty to the lesser-included offense of conspiracy to manufacture, possess with intent to distribute, and distribute a quantity of methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1). As part of the agreement, Thorne agreed to waive his right to appeal his sentence or challenge his sentence in a postconviction proceeding. The district court accepted Thorne\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The presentence investigation report attributed to Thorne \u201ca minimum of 350 grams of methamphetamine mixture.\u201d The report based its calculation \u201con the 108.3 grams of methamphetamine mixture seized [from Finch\u2019s property] on October 7, 2007; the 1.01 grams of methamphetamine seized [from Thorne] on April 25, 2008; and a historical quantity based on statements of codefendants, unindicted co-conspirators, and witnesses.\u201d The report provided a base offense level of 30, United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5) (Nov.2007), increased that level by six points because the decision to transport anhydrous ammonia in a thermos created a substantial risk of harm to a minor, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(10)(D), and decreased that level by three points for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. The report provided a sentencing range between 235 and 293 months of imprisonment based on Thorne\u2019s criminal history of VI as a career offender. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. Because the statutory maximum sentence was 20 years, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), the Sentencing Guidelines provided a sentence between 235 and 240 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Thorne objected to the presentence report on two grounds. Thorne argued that the report relied on unreliable sources to attribute to him 350 grams of methamphetamine. Thorne also argued that there was no evidence to establish that he did not intend to place Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter at risk of harm because he was unconscious in the front seat of Foley\u2019s car when Foley transported the anhydrous ammonia to Finch\u2019s residence and that the six-level enhancement was intended to apply when a minor is near a methamphetamine laboratory.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence to respond to Thorne\u2019s objections. Victoria Foley testified that she transported Thorne, Finch, Taylor, and Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter to Shuman\u2019s house, Thorne was awake for part of the trip, and he was unconscious when the group returned to Finch\u2019s house with a thermos of anhydrous ammonia. Ross Butler, a forensic chemist, testified that transporting anhydrous ammonia in a thermos or other unapproved container was extremely dangerous because the substance must be kept at very low temperatures and, if it exceeds negative 28 degrees, the substance could erode the thermos or cause it to burst and emit toxic gas that could cause those exposed to suffocate. Butler also testified that the various chemicals discovered in Finch\u2019s storage building were highly flammable and the inhalation of those chemicals could burn the respiratory system or cause death. Agent Kent Musey testified about the methamphetamine seized from Finch\u2019s residence and the statements by Thorne\u2019s cohorts attributing additional amounts of methamphetamine to Thorne.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The district court overruled Thorne\u2019s objections to the presentence report. The court adopted the findings of the presen-tence report about the drug quantity and the risk of harm to the child, and sentenced Thorne to 240 months of imprisonment, \u201cbut because [Thorne had waived his right to appeal] and in an abundance of caution ... impose[d] a sentence of 220 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">We review for clear error \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to establish a base offense level[.]\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). We also review for clear error findings of fact about whether \u201cthe defendant\u2019s actions placed a minor at risk.\u201d <em>United States v. Florence, </em>333 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">Thorne challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, Thorne argues that only the 200 grams of methamphetamine seized from him and other members of the conspiracy should be attributed to him. Second, Thorne argues that he is not subject to a six-level enhancement because of his condition when the anhydrous ammonia was transported and because the transportation of anhydrous ammonia was not sufficiently dangerous to place Taylor\u2019s child at risk. The government defends the decisions of the district court, but does not request that we enforce the appeal waiver in Thorne\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">The district court did not clearly err by attributing to Thorne 350 grams of methamphetamine. The government presented reliable and specific evidence that Thorne was responsible for more methamphetamine than that seized by law enforcement. <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1566 (11th Cir.1995). In addition to the 108 grams seized from Finch\u2019s residence, 88 grams seized from Shuman at his arrest, and 1 gram seized from Thorne, cohorts testified that they had purchased from Thorne and Finch at least 130 grams of methamphetamine and Thorne had participated in two or three methamphetamine cooks at Glenn Shuman\u2019s residence that produced 80 grams of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1499 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cFor sentencing purposes a member of a drug conspiracy is liable for his own acts and the acts of others in furtherance of the activity that the defendant agreed to undertake and that are reasonably foreseeable in connection with that activity.\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)). Ample evidence supported the amount of methamphetamine attributed to Thorne.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The district court also did not err by enhancing Thorne\u2019s sentence for creating a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor. The district court was entitled to credit testimony from Foley that she, Thorne, Finch, and Taylor transported anhydrous ammonia in an unapproved container and in a vehicle occupied by Taylor\u2019s two-year-old daughter. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.1995). Based on Thorne\u2019s role in the conspiracy, he was aware of the purpose of the trip and Foley testified that Thorne was conscious when Taylor\u2019s daughter was placed in the vehicle. Based on the serious hazards created by handling anhydrous ammonia, the district court did not clearly err by finding that Thorne\u2019s participation in that conduct exhibited a reckless disregard for the safety of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Thorne\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
