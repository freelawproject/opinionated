We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">The Frieds argue that the defendant\u2019s employee was subject to a heightened duty of care owed to young children rather than to the usual reasonable person standard. They did not advance this argument in the district court, and we ordinarily do not consider new theories raised on appeal. <em>See Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131-32 n. 10 (5th Cir.1992). Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that the witness\u2019s description of how the accident occurred provides no evidence that the defendant\u2019s employee breached any duty of care, heightened or otherwise, when she opened the restroom door and it closed suddenly. <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>cf. Brown v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., </em>671 So.2d 1195, 1197 (La.Ct.App.1996) (although motorist driving near children has a heightened duty, driver must act appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>priately and is not an insurer of every child\u2019s safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-17\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
