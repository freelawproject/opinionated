He contends that the district court improperly went beyond the pleadings and failed to accept the facts alleged in his amended complaint as true, and that he exhausted all administrative remedies available to him in accordance with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">We review the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Shanbaum v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 180, 182 (5th Cir.1994). In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the \u201ccourt accepts all well-pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cHowever, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993). Generally, when ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the district court may not look beyond the pleadings. <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1341 (5th Cir.1994). The court may, however, refer to matters of public record, as well as to documents attached to the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1343 n. 6 (public records); <em>Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc., </em>78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir.1996) (documents attached to complaint). Further, \u201c[djocuments that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiffs complaint and are central to [the] claim.\u201d <em>Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, </em>394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">On May 9, 2004, while a pretrial detainee in the Tarrant County Jail (TCJ), Hicks was assaulted by a fellow inmate while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>restrained in a restraint chair. In his amended complaint, Hicks alleged that the defendants violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights by: (1) failing to protect him from being assaulted; (2) failing to train deputies on ways to protect pretrial detainees; (3) failing to enact or follow TCJ policies on protecting restrained inmates from assaults by fellow inmates and other injuries; (4) failing to provide proper medical treatment following the assault; and (5) placing him in a restraint chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, inmates must exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available\u201d prior to bringing a civil action. \u00a7 1997e(a). Failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense, and \u201cinmates are not required to specifically plead or demonstrate exhaustion in then* complaints.\u201d Jon<em>es v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 216, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Dismissal may be appropriate, however, where the complaint on its face establishes the inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust. <em>See Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The TCJ provides a two-step procedure for presenting a grievance: (1) an inmate must send a written statement directly to the Grievance Board, which should respond within 60 days, then (2) if an inmate is dissatisfied with the Grievance Board\u2019s response, he may appeal in writing to the Inmate Grievance Appeal Board within five days of receiving the written response to his grievance. In his amended complaint, Hicks alleged to have filed grievances complaining of the assault and attached copies of three grievances he filed with the TCJ. The attached grievances arise from and mention the May 9th assault. Considering that \u00a7 1997e does not indicate how specific a prisoner\u2019s administrative grievance must be, <em>see Johnson v. Johnson, </em>385 F.3d 503, 516 (5th Cir.2004), and that under the 12(b)(6) standard of review all well-pleaded facts must be accepted as true, we will accept Hicks\u2019s allegations that he filed a proper grievance for the assault. Therefore, he is deemed to have exhausted the first step of the two-step grievance procedure once the 60-day time period for response expired. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir.1998) (overruled on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">However, Hicks admittedly did not file appeals to the Inmate Grievance Appeal Board prior to instituting his \u00a7 1983 suit. Hicks contends that the exhaustion requirement was satisfied because TCJ officials never responded to his grievances, but courts may no longer read a futility exception into the exhaustion requirement. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739-41 &amp; n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Though we have held that \u201cavailable administrative remedies are exhausted when the time limits for the prison\u2019s response set forth in the prison Grievance Procedures have expired,\u201d <em>Underwood, </em>151 F.3d at 295, in <em>Underwood </em>the inmate had \u201ctimely filed his grievances and appeals at each step of the ... process.\u201d 151 F.3d at 295. Our holding in <em>Undenvood, </em>therefore, stands for the proposition that an inmate has exhausted administrative remedies when he follows each step of the prison grievance process but never receives a response from the prison. Here, the TCJ grievance process explicitly sets out two steps, and Hicks failed to comply with the second step. Therefore, Hicks\u2019s failure to pursue his grievance remedy to conclusion constitutes a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Hicks\u2019s motions to expedite his appeal in accordance with 5th Cir. R. 27.5, to order the appellee to preserve evidence, to tax costs to the losing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>party, and for the appointment of counsel are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b934-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
