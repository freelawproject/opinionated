Mulkey and Bobby Atkins, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeal the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of their complaint. Plaintiffs alleged breach of contract in violation of Florida law against Defendants Land America Title Association and Lawyers Title Insurance Corporation. The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that the district court should not have dismissed their complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because the complaint sufficiently alleged jurisdiction. Pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3), if a court determines \u201cat any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u201d We review the district court\u2019s determination about its subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The party bringing the claim bears the burden of establishing federal subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">In their second amended complaint, Plaintiffs asserted jurisdiction under diversity of citizenship. A district court may exercise jurisdiction over a civil case between citizens of different states, provided that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). Diversity must be complete: no plaintiff can be a citizen of the same state as any defendant. <em>MacGinnitie v. Hobbs Group, LLC, </em>420 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">In their complaint, Plaintiffs indicated that they were citizens of Florida. Plaintiffs also listed a Florida address for Lawyer\u2019s Title. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint did not state where Defendants were incorporated or where they had their principal place of business; so it is unclear where Defendants resided for diversity jurisdiction purposes. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c) (explaining where a corporation resides). But Plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing jurisdiction; and a district court should not assume jurisdiction. <em>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, </em>523 U.S. 83, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (explaining that a court cannot assume jurisdiction to reach the merits of a case); <em>Sweet Pea Marine, </em>411 F.3d at 1247. Therefore, because Plaintiffs failed to allege complete diversity between themselves and Defendants, the district court correctly determined that it could not exercise diversity jurisdiction over the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">Plaintiffs also attempted to assert federal question jurisdiction, noting that they had suffered \u201cpersonal injury\u201d caused by \u201can agency under the color of state law.\u201d Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>court may exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over civil cases \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d To the extent Plaintiffs sought relief under the federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, they clearly alleged no facts that would allow the district court to exercise federal question jurisdiction: both Defendants are private corporations and nothing in the complaint indicates that they are state actors. So, Plaintiffs could not rely on section 1983 as a basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\"> In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro </em>se pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
