Tasher\u2019s motion was based on Amendment 706 to the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The district court did not err by denying Tasher\u2019s motion. Tasher acknowledges that he is not eligible for a reduction of sentence as a career offender, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008), but he argues that he falls within an exception to <em>Moore </em>because he received a downward departure. The district court departed downward on the ground that Tasher\u2019s criminal history category overrepresented his criminal record, which had no effect on Tasher\u2019s offense level. Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering Tasher\u2019s sentencing range. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The denial of Tasher\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
