On appeal, he raises the following two arguments: (1) the district court erred under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) by allowing the government to elicit testimony that narcotics were found in his residence; and (2) the district court erred by applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because there was no showing that his firearms facilitated, or had the potential to facilitate, his possession of methamphetamine. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Perry\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Perry, charging him with being a felon in possession of eight specific firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The indictment also alleged that Perry had been convicted in January 2007 in Alabama for the unlawful possession of marijuana and the unlawful possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">Before trial, Perry filed a motion in limine, requesting the district court to instruct the government not to comment on, or present evidence about, any illegal drugs found in Perry\u2019s residence, where the firearms were discovered. Perry argued that any reference to drugs would constitute \u201cevidence of criminal acts that are not related to [his] possession of the weapons\u201d and would therefore be unduly prejudicial. Perry also offered to stipulate that he was previously convicted of the felonies referred to in the indictment. In response, the government agreed to the stipulation, but argued that, although it did not anticipate doing so, it could refer to drugs found at Perry\u2019s residence during trial, as this evidence was \u201cintrinsic\u201d to the charged offense and therefore fell outside the scope of Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The district court accepted the stipulation and denied Perry\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">At trial, the government called Officer Gary Ward with the St. Clair County Sheriffs Office (\u201cSCCSO\u201d), who testified that, on September 6, 2007, he led a team of approximately 10 to 15 officers in executing a search warrant at Perry\u2019s residence. Upon conducting the search, Ward and the officers found several guns in the guest bedroom, office, and master bedroom. Ward stated that he and the officers also found a large Safari safe in the office, in which they later discovered ammunition and numerous firearms, eight of which were the firearms referenced in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">During the government\u2019s case in chief, the government twice elicited testimony regarding narcotics found in Perry\u2019s residence. First, the government asked Ward what was found in the safe, and Ward responded: \u201cHandguns, long guns, illegal narcotics.\u201d Second, the government posed the same question to Joe Sweatt, chief investigator and evidence custodian for the CCSCO, who testified that they found ammunition, \u201ca host of guns and some other drugs, paraphernalia, and some personal items.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">Defense counsel called Perry, who admitted that the firearms found in the safe belonged to him. However, he denied hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ing access to the safe and testified that only two of his guns, neither of which were operational, were not locked in the safe. He also testified that, following the execution of the warrant in September 2007, he pled guilty in state court to both possession and distribution of methamphetamine, and, with respect to the possession offense, he admitted that there was some methamphetamine found in his house. After the district court instructed the jury \u2014 including that Perry was \u201cnot on trial for any other act or any other conduct or any other offense that is not alleged in the indictment\u201d \u2014 the jury returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The probation officer prepared a pre-sentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). In setting out Perry\u2019s offense conduct, the probation officer first noted that an unspecified amount of methamphetamine was found in the master bedroom and in other unspecified areas of the house. In calculating Perry\u2019s applicable guideline range, the probation officer gave Perry a base offense level of 14, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6)(A), applied a 6-level enhancement based on the number of firearms, pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C), and applied a 2-level enhancement based on the fact that two of the firearms were reported stolen, pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A). The probation officer also applied a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) because Perry possessed the firearms in connection with another felony offense, namely, possession of methamphetamine. In discussing Perry\u2019s criminal history, the probation officer noted that Perry pled guilty to both distribution and possession of methamphetamine. It was noted that the distribution offense occurred on August 1, 2007, while the possession offense occurred on September 6, 2007, the date of the search that uncovered the firearms. Perry\u2019s offense level of 26, combined with his criminal history category of IV, produced an applicable guideline range of 92 to 115 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Perry objected to the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6), arguing that \u201cthere was not sufficient evidence shown at the time of trial that [he] possessed drugs in connection with the firearms for which he was charged and convicted.\u201d The court overruled the objection, stating: \u201cI\u2019m going to overrule based on the evidence I heard in open court regarding where the guns were located, where the ammunition was located, where the son\u2019s guns were located, and where the drugs were located.\u201d The court thereafter adopted the factual statements and guideline calculations in the PSI and, although it sentenced Perry to the low end of the guideline range, the court credited him with time served for an unrelated offense, thus resulting in a total sentence of 74 months and 16 days\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cWe review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2004). However, and despite filing a motion in limine to exclude evidence at trial relating to narcotics, Perry did not object on this ground at trial, and, therefore, we review the Rule 404(b) issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 966 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cA defendant must object at trial to preserve an objection on appeal; the overruling of a motion in limine does not suffice.\u201d). Under this standard, Perry must show that: \u201c(1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected his substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>United States v. Gresham, </em>325 F.3d 1262, 1265 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Rule 404(b) provides that \u201c[evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident....\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). Thus, to be admissible under Rule 404(b), extrinsic evidence of other crimes or acts must \u201c(1) be relevant to one of the enumerated issues and not to the defendant\u2019s character; (2) the prior act must be proved sufficiently to permit a jury determination that the defendant committed the act; and (3) ... the evidence must satisfy Rule 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>204 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In this case, Perry challenges the government\u2019s elicitation of testimony about narcotics found in his residence. In response to questions about what was found in Perry\u2019s safe, both Officer Ward and Investigator Sweatt briefly mentioned that they found narcotics there. This testimony, however, was not \u201cextrinsic\u201d evidence subject to Rule 404(b) because, since the firearms listed in the indictment were also found in the safe, this testimony was \u201cinextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense\u201d and was \u201cnecessary to complete the story of the crime of trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Weeks, </em>716 F.2d 830, 832 (11th Cir.1983); <em>see United States v. Edouard, </em>485 F.3d 1324, 1344 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[Ejvidence is inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense if it forms an integral and natural part of the witness\u2019s accounts of the circumstances surrounding the offenses for which the defendant was indicted.\u201d) (quotation omitted). Thus, Perry has not shown that the district court plainly erred in allowing this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In any event, this testimony did not substantially influence the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Gunn, </em>369 F.3d at 1236. This is so because the government elicited only two isolated and in-passing references to narcotics found in Perry\u2019s safe. Moreover, and even if this limited testimony had some impact on the jury, it was rendered harmless by Perry\u2019s own admission that methamphetamine was found in his residence and that he pled guilty to possession and distribution of methamphetamine. Finally, the district court instructed the jury that Perry was \u201cnot on trial for any other act or any other conduct or any other offense that is not alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>See Edouard, </em>485 F.3d at 1345 (\u201c[A]ny unfair prejudice possibly caused by admitting evidence ... was mitigated by the district court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury.\u201d); <em>G'imn, </em>369 F.3d at 1236 (holding that any error in admitting extrinsic evidence was harmless in part because the court issued a limiting instruction). Thus, even if it was error to allow this testimony, it did not affect Perry\u2019s substantial rights. Accordingly, we affirm Perry\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u201cThis [C]ourt reviews the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines under the <em>de novo </em>standard of review, but reviews its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), a defendant is subject to a four-level enhancement if he \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Application Note 14 of the commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1, added in 2006, clarifies that the enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tial of facilitating, another felony offense .... \u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 14(A)). As a result, when that other felony offense is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d the commentary instructs the court to apply the enhancement when a firearm is found in \u201cclose proximity\u201d to drugs. <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l4(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">In this case, the district court applied the enhancement because it found that Perry possessed firearms in connection with another felony offense. The record fully supports this conclusion. Perry testified and confirmed that he had pled guilty to both possession and distribution of methamphetamine. He also admitted that methamphetamine had been found in his house. It is a given fact that there is a close relationship between guns and drugs. This is true whether or not the criminal conduct is possession of illegal drugs or when the criminal conduct is both possession and distribution of illegal drugs. There is no question that the guns involved in this case were found in close proximity to the drugs. Thus, the four-level enhancement imposed by the district court is in full accord with Application Note 14(B) and we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm Perry\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
