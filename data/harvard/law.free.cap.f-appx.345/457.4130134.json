He contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the sufficiency of the evidence but consider it \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. LeCroy, </em>441 F.3d 914, 924 (11th Cir.2006). To prove a claim under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), it is necessary to show that a defendant used or carried a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime or possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). The \u201cin furtherance\u201d element may be established by showing \u201csome nexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Mendez contends that the mere possession of a gun in the presence of illegal drugs is insufficient to sustain his conviction. That contention fails. The police officers that searched Mendez\u2019s home found a loaded handgun in the same room as cocaine, scales, baggies, and cash. That evidence supports the necessary nexus \u201cbetween the firearm and the drug selling operation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1076-77 (11th Cir.2008). As we recognized in <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>a reasonable jury could infer that the purpose of keeping a gun next to the drugs \u201cwas to provide defense or deterrence in furtherance of the drug trafficking.\u201d 425 F.3d 953, 962 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Mercer, </em>541 F.3d at 1077 (holding that the \u201cin furtherance\u201d element was satisfied where the firearm was \u201chidden in a pouch under the mattress\u201d in the defendant\u2019s motel room); <em>United States v. Molina, </em>443 F.3d 824, 830 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that the \u201cin furtherance\u201d element was satisfied where the gun was found in the drawer of a nightstand in the defendant\u2019s bedroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Although Mendez offers an alternative explanation, \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilty, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>906 F.2d 615, 618 (11th Cir.1990). Sufficient evidence supports Ferguson\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
