The BIA concluded that the petitioners had not met their burden of demonstrating eligibility for relief because they failed to demonstrate that membership in their family group, which has been targeted by the Mara Salvatrucha gang in El Salvador, constituted membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The BIA concluded that the petitioners\u2019 family lacked the required social visibility to qualify as a particular social group. Accordingly, the BIA concluded that the petitioners had not demonstrated the required nexus between their well-founded fear of persecution and a protected ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The Secretary of Homeland Security or Attorney General is authorized, in his discretion, to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). An alien is a \u201crefugee\u201d when he is outside of his country and \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The BIA has provided the following factors to consider when determining whether a \u201cparticular social group\u201d exists: (1) \u201cwhether the group\u2019s shared characteristic gives the members the requisite social visibility to make them readily identifiable in society\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the group can be defined with sufficient particularity to delimit its membership.\u201d <em>In </em>re <em>A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 69, 69 (BIA 2007). A factor in determining social visibility \u201cis whether the members of the group are perceived as a group by society.\u201d <em>Matter of S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 579, 586 (BIA 2008). The BIA rejected arguments that \u201cpersons resistant to gang membership\u201d and \u201c[Salvadoran] youths who have resisted gang recruitment, or family members of such Salvadoran youth\u201d constitute social groups, after determining that the proposed groups lacked the required social visibility. <em>In re E-A-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 591, 594 (BIA 2007); <em>S-E-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 582, 587. We will defer to the BIA\u2019s construction of a statute that it administers if the BIA\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The petitioners argue that their family membership places them in a particular social group because their family membership is an immutable trait. The BIA\u2019s holding did not rest on a finding regarding the proposed group\u2019s immutability. The petitioners do not address the issue of social visibility or any of the administrative cases cited by the BIA in its analysis of the subject. The petitioners have therefore failed to meaningfully challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusion that membership in their family does not constitute membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for asylum. Conclusional and inadequate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ly briefed arguments are waived. <em>See Chambers v. Mukasey, </em>520 F.3d 445, 448 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Even if we consider the petitioners\u2019 argument, it lacks merit. The petitioners have not demonstrated membership in a particular social group or that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that term is unreasonable. <em>See Ramos-Lopez v. Holder, </em>563 F.3d 855, 859-62 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 745-47 (9th Cir.2008). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b54-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
