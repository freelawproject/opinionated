Glinsey\u2019s direct appeal of his conviction, sentence, and restitution order resulted in an affir-mance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and certiorari was denied. <em>United States v. Glinsey, </em>209 F.3d 386 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 919, 121 S.Ct. 282, 148 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000). Thereafter, Glin-sey filed an unsuccessful application for habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 followed by an equally unsuccessful appeal. <em>United States v. Glinsey, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 211 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-24\">Several years later, Glinsey sought a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>from the district court challenging his conviction and contending that (1) an incriminating tape (relevant only to the witness tampering charge) was wrongfully obtained and used; (2) the government failed, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3504, to admit or deny that the tape recording was obtained unlawfully; (3) deficiencies exist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ed in the information used to charge him; and (4) he received no hearing on his various challenges to his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Glinsey contends that, as a result of his convictions, he now suffers from various civil disabilities such as not being able to run for public office. We need not address whether the civil disabilities Glinsey alleges qualify for <em>coram nobis </em>relief because we conclude that the district court correctly determined that Glinsey failed to meet the high burden of proving entitlement to such relief. Glinsey\u2019s claims either already have been raised, should have been raised previously, or are not errors \u201cof the most fundamental character\u201d as necessary to support a request for <em>coram nobis </em>relief. <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>136 F.3d 417, 422 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">As such, for substantially the same reasons expressed in the district court\u2019s opinion, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-25\">. The restitution amount was modified to reduce it to $1,000,000 in order to comport with the district court\u2019s admonishments during the guilty plea hearing regarding his maximum fine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\">. In his summary of argument, he also mentioned, without elaboration, a \u201cwarrantless search of [Glinsey's] business private office.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
