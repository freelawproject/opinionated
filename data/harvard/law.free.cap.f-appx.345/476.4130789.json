No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-21\">Chandler\u2019s base offense level was 32 when calculated pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. But Chandler\u2019s sentence was enhanced because he was classified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1: he was at least eighteen years old at the time of the instant drug felony offense; and he had one earlier drug felony conviction and one earlier conviction for a crime of violence. Because the statutory maximum sentence for the offense was life, with the career offender enhancement Chandler\u2019s total offense level was 37, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1; and Chandler\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 360 months to life imprisonment. A low-end guideline range sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-22\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Chandler filed a motion to reduce his sentence based on a retroactive amendment of the guidelines for crack-cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion. On appeal, Chandler argues that he was due a section 3582(c) reduction: his crack-cocaine sentence was based on the amended guideline even if the sentence imposed was otherwise enhanced. Chandler also seeks to argue that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(2005), requires the guidelines to be applied in an advisory fashion in section 8582(c)(2) proceedings; and that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its authority when it limited section 3582(c)(2) reductions to a two-level decrease. None of these arguments are of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009), and <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009), are dispositive of Chandler\u2019s claimed entitlement to a sentence reduction based on Amendment 706. In <em>Moore, </em>the defendants also sought the benefit of Amendment 706 but were sentenced as career offenders; we affirmed that the district court lacked authority under section 3582(c)(2) to grant the requested sentence reductions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">Where a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence. Here, although Amendment 706 would reduce the base offense levels applicable to defendants, it would not affect their guideline ranges because they were sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-12\"><em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330. In <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1193, we concluded that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has no application to motions to reduce sentence under section 3582(c)(2). And Chandler\u2019s argument that the Sentencing Commission exceeded its authority when it confined the district court\u2019s section 3582 authority also is foreclosed by <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192 (rejecting argument that <em>Booker </em>or <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) prohibit limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in a section 3582 proceeding). Because Chandler\u2019s guideline range was not impacted on by Amendment 706\u2019s offense level reduction, the district court was without authority to grant the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-16\">. Amendment 706 revised U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 by reducing by two levels the offense levels applicable to crack-cocaine offenses. Subject to technical changes effected by Amendment 711, Amendment 706 was made retroactive as of 3 March 2008 by Amendment 713.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
