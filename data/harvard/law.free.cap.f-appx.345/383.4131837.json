We granted a certificate of appealability as to whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v.

In <em>Clisby, </em>we held that when a district court fails to address all claims in a habeas petition, we will vacate without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims. 960 F.2d at 938. Under <em>Clisby, </em>a claim \u201cis any allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. Ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes a violation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, and thus is a claim of a constitutional violation. <em>Strickland v.
