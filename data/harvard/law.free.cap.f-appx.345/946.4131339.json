For the following reasons, the petition is DENIED.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-6\">1. Petitioner first argues that the IJ failed to properly assess the evidence showing Petitioner relied on \u00a7 212(c) in deciding to proceed to trial. However, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s factual findings, and is limited in its review to constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) \u2014 (D); <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 460-61 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, the evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-7\">2. Petitioner further argues that the immigration judge failed to reopen the proceedings for further evidence in light of this circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 200 (5th Cir.2007). However, Petitioner was provided adequate opportunity to present evidence and develop the record regarding his \u00a7 212(c) claim before the IJ issued his decision, and Petitioner never requested the opportunity to present additional evidence before appeal. Moreover, Petitioner\u2019s counsel specifically argued the theory of \u00a7 212(c) reliance, and the IJ\u2019s decision cited to and reviewed the facts of the instant case in light of <em>Carranza-De Salinas </em>when determining that Petitioner was ineligible for relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-10\">3. Petitioner further argues that he is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief <em>nunc pro tunc </em>for his prior entries while in inadmissible status. However, the BIA correctly concluded that it does not have the authority to initiate removal proceedings in order to charge Petitioner with removal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>so it may then grant him relief <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-11\">4. Ultimately, the IJ found that after a review of all the evidence, Petitioner did not become aware of \u00a7 212(c) until after its repeal. Petitioner has therefore failed to demonstrate actual detrimental reliance on former \u00a7 212(c), thus failing to establish eligibility for relief. <em>See Carranza-DeSalinas, </em>477 F.3d at 206-10; <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 520 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s assignments of error fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
