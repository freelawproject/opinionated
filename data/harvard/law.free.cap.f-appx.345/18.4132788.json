The district court found that the Hunters\u2019 reliance on two federal criminal statutes as a premise for federal question jurisdiction over their civil lawsuit was without merit as the statutes in question, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 and 1002, did not provide for a personal cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-24\">On appeal, the Hunters argue the merits of their civil suit and contend that their complaint stated a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Hunters also state that the defendants\u2019 actions rose to the level of an \u201corganized mortgage fraud crime,\u201d but the Hunters wholly fail to address the district court\u2019s finding that there was no subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court for their complaint because the federal criminal statutes in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>did not provide for a personal cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), arguments must be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The Hunters have abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of them complaint on jurisdictional grounds. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Consequently, the appeal lacks any issue of arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
