He argues that the district court erred by upwardly departing from a guidelines range of 77-96 months of imprisonment because the sentence effectively denied Flores an acceptance of responsibility adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">This court reviews criminal sentences for reasonableness, using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-96, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, this court examines whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Reasonableness review, in the context of a guidelines departure, requires this court to evaluate both \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and 2) are justified by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">The district court clearly stated that it was not denying Flores an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. District courts may upwardly depart and impose statutory maximum sentences upon defendants who have received acceptance of responsibility adjustments. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 433-34, 443 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d. at 346-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Flores\u2019s extensive criminal history, the district court\u2019s rationale for departure, provided adequate justification for the departure, and the sentence furthered the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>See Zuniga-P eralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. Moreover, the extent of the departure is propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>tionally less than departures we have affirmed in other cases. <em>See Jones, </em>444 F.3d at 433; <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 346-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
