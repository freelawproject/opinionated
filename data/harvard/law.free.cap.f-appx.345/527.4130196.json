Daniels, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner convicted of a crack cocaine offense, appeals the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court denied the motion because Daniels\u2019s career offender designation precluded a sentence reduction, and no other jurisdictional basis existed for the court to grant him a reduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tion. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">When a sentencing guideline is amended and given retroactive effect, the district court may reduce an already incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under the amendment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, unauthorized under section 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 \u2014 which became retroactive on 3 March 2008, U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. 1 May 2008) \u2014 reduced by two the base offense levels in crack cocaine sentences calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Daniels\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion because he was sentenced based on the offense level for the career offender guideline and not the offense level for drug quantity. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), <em>and cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009) (concluding that Amendment 706 did not affect the guidelines ranges of defendants who were sentenced as career offenders because their final offense levels were not based on section 2D1.1 and, thus, the sentences were not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d). On appeal, Daniels argues that, because the district court granted him a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(l) downward departure on his criminal history category, he was not sentenced as a career offender, and, thus, was eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. Although Daniels\u2019s criminal history category was lowered from VI to V, his offense level remained at 31 pursuant to the career offender provision. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. And Amendment 706 applies only to offense levels calculated pursuant to the drug quantity table.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">Daniels\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), allow the district court to reduce his sentence is unavailing. Daniels was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706; and <em>Booker </em>does not, by itself, permit a court to impose a section 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1369 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1657, 173 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2009). In addition, we have concluded that neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to section 3582(c)(2) motions. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-14\">Daniels argues that the district court did not explain why it denied his motion. But the court\u2019s order explained clearly and accurately why it lacked authority to reduce Daniels\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> We review <em>de novo </em>die district court's legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v.
