No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">On appeal, Morales argues that Amendment 706 applies to him because his sentencing calculations began with the drug quantity table. He also argues that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), gives the court more discretion to reduce his sentence under section 3582(c)(2). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, McFadden v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156 (2009), and <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Here, the district court committed no error in denying Morales\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Morales was sentenced based on the career-offender and armed career criminal offense levels instead of the offense level determined by drug quantity, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 706. <em>See id. </em>at 1330 (concluding that the district court had no authority to reduce the sentence of a defendant who was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008) (Amendment 706 had no effect on defendant\u2019s sentencing range when he had been sentenced as an armed career criminal, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Morales\u2019s other arguments in support of section 3582(c)(2) relief are unavailing. Morales argues that the court could have granted him a downward departure based on his consent to deportation upon release; but the court was not permitted to reconsider guideline applications, except to the extent they were changed by Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that a sentence reduction under section 3582(c)(2) is not a <em>de novo </em>resentencing and \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d). And <em>Booker </em>provides no independent basis for section 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for relief under section 3582(c)(2) because it \u201cis a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\">.
