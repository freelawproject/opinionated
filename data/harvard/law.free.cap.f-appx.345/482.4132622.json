During the government\u2019s rebuttal argument, the government responded to issues Erwin\u2019s counsel raised in his closing argument on three separate occasions as \u201csmoke screens.\u201d On the third occasion, the government stated \u201c[i]t\u2019s another smoke screen. It\u2019s an attempt to cover things up.\u201d The government then played a tape of Erwin talking with a confidential informant about his then attorney, who was not his trial attorney, in which Erwin said \u201c[sjhe\u2019s there to protect me. She needs to know what I\u2019m doing to know how to cover it up.\u201d The government then stated \u201c[tjhat\u2019s how Mr. Erwin construes his legal strategy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">On appeal, Erwin argues that but for this prosecutorial misconduct, he would not have been convicted of distributing drugs that resulted in Andrew Culver\u2019s death. Specifically, Erwin argues the government\u2019s \u201csmoke screen\u201d arguments and use of the tape of Erwin speaking of his attorney prejudicially affected his substantial rights by depriving him of a fair trial because the prosecutor\u2019s comments distracted the jury from the evidentiary holes in the government\u2019s case. Erwin argues that because he presented evidence raising a reasonable doubt of his guilt, this prose-cutorial distraction tipped the balance to the prosecutor\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Knowles, </em>66 F.3d 1146, 1163 (11th Cir.1995). We review a prosecutorial misconduct claim <em>de novo. United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 947 (11th Cir.2006). We give considerable weight to the district court\u2019s assessment of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and conduct. <em>United States v. Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d 1194, 1198 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">A new trial is required for prosecutorial misconduct if we find that (1) a prosecutor\u2019s remarks during closing argument were improper, and (2) they prejudiced the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cReversal on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct requires that the misconduct be so pronounced and persistent that it permeates the entire atmosphere of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. McLain, </em>823 F.2d 1457, 1462 (11th Cir.1987) (holding that prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in disparaging defense counsel was not a sufficient basis for reversing, though concluding that reversal was warranted in light of the cumulative effect of all errors by the prosecution and judge in the case), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Watson, </em>866 F.2d 381, 385 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">To assess the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, we \u201cevaluate them in the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1438. \u201cA defendant\u2019s substantial rights are prejudicially affected when a reasonable probability arises that, but for the remarks, the outcome of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. \u2018When the record contains sufficient independent evidence of guilt, any error is harmless.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Here, Erwin has challenged the government\u2019s statement that the defense counsel was using \u201csmoke screens\u201d to \u201ccover things up,\u201d and Erwin has challenged the government\u2019s use of the tape recording of Erwin stating that his then attorney, who was not his attorney at trial, would cover things up. The statement by the government that Erwin\u2019s counsel was using \u201csmoke screens\u201d may have been a valid response to Erwin\u2019s closing argument. <em>See United States v. Strmel, </em>744 F.2d 1086, 1090 (5th Cir.1984) (holding prosecutor\u2019s statement that defense\u2019s tactic at trial was to \u201cblow enough smoke\u201d to \u201ccloud the issues enough\u201d was a proper response to the defense\u2019s closing arguments). However, we assume arguendo that there was improper argument \u2014 i.e., the statement that Erwin was attempting to \u201ccover things up\u201d by pointing out the absence of fingerprint evidence, in conjunction with playing the tape of Erwin wherein Erwin had said that his previous counsel \u201cneeds to know what I\u2019m doing to know how to cover it up\u201d and the government\u2019s statement that \u201c[tjhat\u2019s how Mr. Erwin construes his legal strategy.\u201d While a prosecutor \u201cmay strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">However, a prosecutor\u2019s misconduct must be both improper and prejudicial, and Erwin has not shown that the \u201csmoke screen\u201d comments or the use of the tape recording prejudiced his substantial rights. <em>Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d at 1438. First, while the district court did not instruct the jury to disregard the incident, it did give the general instruction that the jury should not consider as evidence anything said by the attorneys and should only consider Erwin\u2019s guilt on the evidence presented. We have previously held that such an instruction may rectify improper prosecuto-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>rial statements. <em>United States v. Jacoby, </em>955 F.2d 1527, 1541 (11th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Barshov, </em>733 F.2d 842, 847 (11th Cir.1984). Second, the district judge (who was present in person and who saw and heard the entire argument) disagreed with Erwin\u2019s interpretation of the argument. The district court perceived the prosecutor as arguing that Erwin was attempting to cover up his crime, not as accusing Erwin\u2019s counsel of unethical conduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, the use of the tape was an isolated incident in the government\u2019s rebuttal argument, Erwin objected to it, and the district court sustained the objection. Giving considerable weight to the district court\u2019s assessment of the government\u2019s remarks and use of the Erwin tape, <em>Cordoba-Mosquera, </em>212 F.3d at 1198, the government\u2019s misconduct did not \u201cpermeate\u201d the entire trial so as to deprive Erwin of a fair trial. <em>McLain, </em>823 F.2d at 1462.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Finally, the government presented clear and very strong evidence that Erwin provided cocaine and methadone to Culver on the night he died, and that cocaine and methadone caused Culver\u2019s death. Erwin cannot show a reasonable probability that, but for the government\u2019s improper comments during closing argument, the outcome of the trial would have been different. <em>Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d at 947. Therefore, any error would be harmless. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm Erwin\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-24\">. Indeed, although the tape itself appears to have Erwin telling the confidential informant that Erwin's then counsel (not his trial counsel) was engaging in cover-up, the transcript of the prosecutor\u2019s closing \u2014 in particular the transcript\u2019s report of the tape that was played to the jury during that closing was garbled, Thus, its prejudicial impact was lessened,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AX6f\">.
