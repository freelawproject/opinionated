Sampson raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues the district court clearly erred in construing his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a request for relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, rather than U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, and that this error was compounded by its failure to provide him notice and an opportunity to withdraw his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, pursuant to <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>(2003). Second, Sampson argues the district court clearly erred and abused its discretion in failing to grant his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion pursuant to Amendment 709, the application of which, he contends, would have reduced the calculation of his criminal history score and precluded him from qualifying as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We review a district court\u2019s resolution of a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and issues of legal interpretation <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2003). We have held on direct appeal that an error a court committed at sentencing was harmless and remand was unnecessary where the defendant received the lowest possible term of imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d 661, 670-71 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that an error in applying an upward departure from a criminal history category I to category II was harmless where a correct calculation of the defendant\u2019s criminal history score would have placed him in criminal history category II); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity, or variance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">First, Sampson\u2019s claim that the district court violated <em>Castro </em>is without merit, as <em>Castro </em>sets forth notice requirements preliminary to a district court\u2019s recharacterization of a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s motion as a first 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Castro, </em>124 S.Ct. at 792. Because the district court did not recharacterize Sampson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion, it was not required to comply with Castro\u2019s notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Second, while the district court appears to have denied relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the Sentencing Commission had not lowered the guideline imprisonment range applicable to a career offender sentenced pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and assumed erroneously that Sampson was convicted of a drug offense, any error was harmless error, as discussed below. <em>See Hernandez, </em>160 F.3d at 670; Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(a). Thus remand is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">As noted above, while a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, where the issue presented involves a legal interpretation, review is <em>de novo. Brown, </em>332 F.3d at 1343; <em>Pringle, </em>350 F.3d at 1178. A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced based on a sentencing range that subsequently has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The amendment to the Guidelines must be retroactively applicable, however, and only amendments listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) qualify as retroactively applicable amendments warranting \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), (c); <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907-08 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), and, therefore, it is not a retroactively applicable amendment that may be the basis for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (listing the retroactively applicable amendments, which does not include Amendment 709). Because Amendment 709 is not retroactively applicable, it cannot be a basis for Sampson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and, therefore, the district court properly denied Sampson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), (c); <em>Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 907-08. Moreover, to the extent that Sampson challenges the district court\u2019s original determination at sentencing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>he qualified as an armed career criminal, we have held that \u201ca sentencing adjustment undertaken pursuant to Section 3582(c)(2) does not constitute a de novo resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Based on our review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Sampson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
