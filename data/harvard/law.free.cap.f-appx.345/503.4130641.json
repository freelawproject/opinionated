Jones, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order granting in part his motion for reduced sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines. On appeal, Jones argues that: (1) the district court erred by failing to request a revised Pre-sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) before reducing his sentences; (2) the district court committed both statutory and constitutional error by applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion and relying on facts neither admitted by himself nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt when reducing his sentences; (3) the district court erred by refusing to reduce his sentence for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime, and by altering his \u201csentencing package\u201d; and (4) the reduction to his sentences was unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion and its conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338 (11th Cir.2008). However, claims raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cUnder the plain error standard, ... there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, ... (3) that affects substantial rights[, and that] ... (4) ... seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">First, we do not agree with Jones\u2019 argument that the district court erred by failing to request a revised PSI in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 before reducing his sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Rule 32 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(d) set forth the requirements for the disclosure of PSI\u2019s. Rule 32 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it imposes sentence unless ... the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(l)(A)(ii). However, sentencing adjustments under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, all \u201coriginal sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Here, Jones did not request a revised PSI before the district court, and we therefore review his argument for plain error. <em>See Smith, </em>459 F.3d at 1282-83. Because proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings, the district court was not authorized to reconsider its sentencing determinations except for the guideline range. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Thus, there was no reason to order a revised PSI, and the district court did not plainly err by declining to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">We also are unpersuaded by Jones\u2019 claim that the district court committed both statutory and constitutional error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion and relying on facts neither admitted by himself nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt when reducing his sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), do not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009). Thus, a district court is permitted to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only in a manner consistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 1193. Under the applicable guideline policy statement, the district court must not reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to a term less than the minimum amended guideline range determined under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">As applied here, Jones\u2019s arguments that the district court violated <em>Booker </em>are foreclosed by binding precedent because neither <em>Booker </em>nor <em>Kimbrough </em>apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192-93. The district court therefore did not err by applying \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) or by relying on its original judicial fact-findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">We likewise find no merit in Jones\u2019s claim that the district court erred by refusing to reduce his 60-month sentence for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) because he would be subject to a lesser penalty under the current version of that statute, and by altering his \u201csentencing package\u201d when it reduced his sentences for Counts 1 and 2 under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Normally, \u201cvacating the sentence for one count disrupts the sentencing package and requires resentencing for all counts of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Klopf, </em>423 F.3d 1228, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). However, as discussed above, sentencing adjustments under \u00a7 3582(e)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">While Amendment 706 reduced the base offense level for Jones\u2019s cocaine-base offenses, it did not affect his guideline range for Count 3 under \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706 (2007). Thus, the district court did not err by refusing to modify Jones\u2019s sentence for Count 3 because all \u201coriginal sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (quotation omitted). In addition, Jones\u2019s reliance on the \u201csentencing package\u201d principle is misplaced because sentencing adjustments under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not constitute <em>de novo </em>resentencings. <em>See id. </em>Further, there was no <em>ex post facto </em>concern because Jones was sentenced based on the law in effect at the time the offense was committed. <em>See United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1224 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that <em>ex post facto </em>concerns are raised where a defendant is subjected to an increased penalty after the commission of the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Finally, we reject Jones\u2019s argument that the reduction to his sentences was unreasonable because the district court failed to consider an analysis report stating that he possessed powder cocaine rather than cocaine base. A \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). It must (1) \u201csubstitute the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range and determine what sentence it would have imposed\u201d and (2) \u201cconsider the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine whether or not to reduce the defendant\u2019s original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAll other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court may not reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range. <em>Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Because Jones did not argue below that the district court was obligated to reconsider the drug type and drug quantity based on the analysis report, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See Smith, </em>459 F.3d at 1282-83. The record shows that the district court correctly calculated the amended guideline range and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining whether to reduce Jones\u2019s sentences under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court was not authorized to reconsider its original sentencing determinations, including the drug type, drug quantity, and original base offense level. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Moreover, the district court reduced Jones\u2019s sentences to the maximum extent allowed by the Guidelines. <em>See Melvin, </em>556 F.3d at 1192. Thus, the district court did not plainly err in reducing Jones\u2019s sentences for Counts 1 and 2 to 168 concurrent months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
