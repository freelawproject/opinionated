Pellerin, brought this action against the Veterans Administration (VA) pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. He alleges that the VA violated the Act by refusing to amend his records and by disclosing confidential information to third parties. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Pellerin\u2019s action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-11\">Pellerin is a World War II veteran. Upon discharge in 1946, he received service-connected benefits from the VA due to such medical problems as anxiety and flat feet. In 1981 and 1982, he sought unsuccessfully to secure additional benefits. Pellerin brought this action against the VA stating claims against the agency in an amended complaint which is divided into five counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-12\">In Count I, Pellerin alleges that the VA violated the Privacy Act by refusing to amend records which state that he claimed \u201can earlier effective date\u201d for previously awarded benefits for an ulcer. Pellerin contends that these records are not accurate because he never claimed an earlier effective date for benefits. Pellerin also alleges that the VA violated the Act by refusing to correct records which state that he had been \u201chighly uncooperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-14\">In Count II, Pellerin contends that the VA violated the Act by refusing to correct records stating that he did not have athlete\u2019s foot because a VA report dated February 9, 1948, concluded that he had athlete\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-15\">Count III alleges that the VA violated the Act by refusing to correct errors regarding his \u201canxiety reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-16\">Count IV alleges a violation due to the VA\u2019s refusal to correct records regarding his flat feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-17\">Finally, in Count V, Pellerin alleges that the VA released confidential information to his physician and to two congressmen. Pellerin sent a medical affidavit from his treating physician, Dr. William E. Kilgore, to the VA together with a bill for his services. The VA returned the package to Kilgore stating that the VA had not authorized the payment for the services billed. Pellerin contends that this violated the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-18\">Pellerin asked Congressman William McCollum and Congressman Michael Bilikaris to assist him in his dealings with the VA. In response to inquiries from the congressmen, the VA released information regarding Pellerin\u2019s claims. Pellerin alleges that this also violated the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-19\">The VA filed a motion to dismiss Pellerin\u2019s amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In granting the motion, the district court concluded that Pellerin sought to \u201cuse the Privacy Act as a tool with which to reconstruct his medical history\u201d and that the disclosures complained of in Count V were authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-21\">On appeal, Pellerin contends that the district court erred because he never sought to reconstruct his medical history, but sought to correct records containing statements made by the VA during the 1980\u2019s. He also alleges he did not authorize the VA\u2019s disclosures. The VA contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>the district court did not err because Pellerin\u2019s requests for the VA to amend its records constituted a collateral attack upon the agency\u2019s determinations. As to Pellerin\u2019s claim in Count V, the VA contends that the district court\u2019s ruling was correct because Pellerin\u2019s treating physician already knew of the information released to him, and the information released to the congressmen was released pursuant to his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-5\">A. Counts I-IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-6\">The district court concluded that Pellerin\u2019s true aim, despite his contentions to the contrary, was to circumvent the VA\u2019s established procedures for reconsidering benefit determinations by using the Privacy Act to reconstruct his medical history. Courts have consistently denied plaintiff\u2019s use of the Privacy Act as a weapon to collaterally attack agency determinations. In <em>Rogers v. United States Department of Labor, 607 </em>F.Supp. 697 (N.D.Cal.1985), where the plaintiff, a former employee of the VA, sought to compel the alteration of certain purportedly erroneous records stemming from her repeated disability claims, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1641-7\">The Privacy Act allows for the amendment of factual or historical errors. It is not, however, a vehicle for amending the judgments of federal officials or of other parties as those judgments are reflected in records maintained by federal agencies. [Citation omitted.] <em>Moreover, it may not be employed as a skeleton key for reopening consideration of unfavorable federal agency decisions.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-8\"><em>Rogers, </em>607 F.Supp. at 699 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-9\">We are especially reluctant to interfere with determinations made by the VA because Congress has mandated that judicial review regarding that agency\u2019s determinations shall be limited. Title 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axo\">The decisions of the administrator or any decision of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans Administration providing benefits for veterans and their dependents or survivors shall be final and conclusive and no other officer or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-11\">In <em>Rosen v. Walters, </em>719 F.2d 1422 (9th Cir.1983), where a veteran\u2019s claim for damages under the Privacy Act was based on allegations that the VA deliberately destroyed medical records pertinent to his disability claim, the district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, stating that \u201c[t]he difficulty with Rosen\u2019s claim is it would require precisely, although indirectly, the type of judicial review over Veterans Administration decisions that is precluded by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a).\u201d <em>Rosen </em>at 1424. Elaborating on its holding, the court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1641-12\">In a specific statute, Congress made the Veterans Administration the exclusive arbiter of disability benefits decisions. In a more generalized statute, the Privacy Act, Congress has made all agencies accountable for the maintenance of records on individuals. In order to allow Rosen\u2019s claim to proceed, we would have to conclude that Congress intended to impliedly repeal \u00a7 211(a) to the extent an individual claims the Veterans Administration based its adverse disability decision on improperly maintained records. We are unable to so conclude, however, because the Privacy Act fails to evince the clear and manifest congressional intent necessary to overcome the presumption against repeals by implication. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1641-13\"><em>Rosen </em>at 1425.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-14\">Likewise, we decline Pellerin\u2019s invitation to allow attacks on VA disability benefit determinations. If Pellerin believes that he is entitled to additional disability benefits, he can \u2014 and should \u2014 challenge the agency\u2019s determinations by utilizing the proper procedures. We agree with the district court, however, that he cannot use the Privacy Act to mount such a challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>B. Count V</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">Pellerin\u2019s first contention under this count is that the VA violated the Privacy Act by releasing confidential information to his treating physician, Dr. Kilgore. The district court found no merit in this contention because Dr. Kilgore already knew of the information which the VA sent him. The district court\u2019s determination was correct. \u201cA dissemination of information to a person or persons who were previously aware of the information is not a disclosure under the Privacy Act.\u201d <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Dye, </em>642 F.2d 833, 836 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (citing <em>Harper v. United States, </em>423 F.Supp. 192 (D.S.C.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">Pellerin also contends that the VA violated the Privacy Act by releasing confidential information to Congressman McCollum and Congressman Bilirakis without his authorization. The district court rejected Pellerin\u2019s contentions because Pellerin consented in writing to the release of information to the congressmen and asked them to intervene on his behalf. We agree with the district court that Pellerin\u2019s actions in consenting to the release of the information and soliciting the congressmen\u2019s assistance in his dealings with the VA estops him from objecting to the VA\u2019s release of information to the congressmen. \u201cUnder the doctrine of equitable estoppel a party with full knowledge of the facts, who accepts the benefits of a transaction ... may not subsequently take an inconsistent position to avoid the corresponding obligation of effects.\u201d <em>DeShong v. Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co., </em>737 F.2d 1520, 1522 (11th Cir.1974) (footnote omitted). Pellerin clearly solicited his congressmen\u2019s support in his battle with the VA. He cannot state a claim against the VA for releasing information to the congressmen when he requested their assistance in gathering such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing Pellerin\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
