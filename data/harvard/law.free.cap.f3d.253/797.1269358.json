The Board concluded that Rodriguez had failed to adduce sufficient new evidence to convince it to reverse its denial of his application for suspension of deportation, which denial was grounded on the Board\u2019s determination that Rodriguez had failed to establish the requisite \u201cextreme hardship\u201d element of INA \u00a7 244. Because Congress has explicitly precluded us from reviewing such discretionary decisions, we dismiss Rodriguez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">I. <em>Facts and Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-17\">Deportation proceedings were initiated against Rodriguez, charging that he was deportable pursuant to then-Section 241(a)(1)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(A), because he had procured his entry visa by willfully misrepresenting a material fact in violation of INA \u00a7 212(a)(19), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(19), and was excludable at entry. Specifically, the Board found that Rodriguez had willfully misrepresented his marital status and his U.S. address (and that of his purported U.S. citizen-spouse), thereby falsely securing a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen. An Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Rodriguez deportable as charged and denied his application for suspension of deportation pursuant to then-section 244 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. The IJ concluded that Rodriguez had failed to establish that he would suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d should he be forced to leave this country and return to his native Mexico. The IJ did, however, grant Rodriguez\u2019s request for voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-19\">On appeal the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Rodriguez did not appeal the Board\u2019s decision at that juncture, but instead filed a motion asking the Board to reconsider its decision denying his applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>tion for suspension of deportation in light of new evidence. The Board treated that motion as a motion to reopen and concluded that the evidence proffered as new\u2014 Rodriguez\u2019s purchase of a home \u2014 was insufficient to change its decision. Rodriguez timely appealed that Board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">We review a denial of a motion to reopen under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), we reviewed for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for suspension of deportation on the ground that the alien has failed to establish the requisite element of \u201cextreme hardship\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but our review of such questions has been abolished, as explained in greater detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">In his petition for review, Rodriguez raises two claims: Whether the Board abused its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s conclusions that Rodriguez (1) willfully misrepresented a material fact to gain entry into the United States (the \u201cwillful misrepresentation\u201d claim) and (2) failed to establish that he would suffer \u201cextreme hardship\u201d if deported (the \u201cextreme hardship\u201d claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">Assuming without granting that, because the motion to reopen was filed with the Board within the 30-day window of appealability<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and addressed the extreme hardship issue \u2014 one issue underlying the Board\u2019s initial decision \u2014 Rodriguez\u2019s timely appeal of the denial of his motion to reopen carries the substance of the extreme hardship issue in its entirety.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner essentially concedes, however, that because he did not address the willful misrepresentation issue in his motion to reopen and had not timely appealed the Board\u2019s initial decision (which did address that issue), we may not here consider that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">Congress has expressly precluded our consideration of the merits of Rodriguez\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his application for suspension of deportation pursuant to INA \u00a7 244 for his failure to establish that he would suffer extreme hardship if deported to his native Mexico. IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under [INA] section ... 244.\u201d We have previously held that denials of applications for suspension of deportation \u201cbased on the [INA] \u00a7 244 element of \u2018extreme hardship\u2019 are discretionary decisions, which IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c) precludes us from reviewing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">This provision not only interdicts our consideration of the Board\u2019s initial denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of Rodriguez\u2019s application for suspension of deportation but also his motion to reopen. Congress has divested us of jurisdiction to review a denial of a motion to reopen when, as here, the Board, in reaching that decision, addressed the \u201cmerits of an alien\u2019s request for relief pursuant to\u201d a provision <em>of </em>the INA established as discretionary by \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite Petitioner\u2019s contention to the contrary, this conclusion is consistent with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Arrozal v. </em>INS<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E) did not preclude review of a motion to reopen. We see that case as clearly distinguishable because the merits of the denial of the motion to reopen did not involve a decision by the Board involving any of the discretionary provisions set forth in \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E); rather, it involved a deportation order under INA \u00a7 241(a)(2). It is axiomatic that if we are divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by the Board that an alien has failed to establish that he would suffer extreme hardship if deported, we must also be divested of jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen on the ground that the alien has still failed to establish such hardship. To hold otherwise would create a loophole that would thwart the clear intent of Congress that the courts not review the discretionary decisions of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">At most, Rodriguez preserved only his claim that the Board abused its discretion in denying his application for suspension of deportation on grounds of extreme hardship. As we are expressly denied jurisdiction to hear that claim, we are constrained to deny Rodriguez\u2019s petition for review of the Board\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen grounded in the same contention of hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">Petition for Review DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">. <em>Ramos v.

Section 309(c)(4)(C) of the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRI-RA\u201d) provides that a petition for review of a final order of exclusion or deportation entered after October 30, 1996 but before April 1, 1997 must be filed no more than 30 days after that order is entered. The filing with the Board of a motion to reopen does not toll the running of this 30-day period. <em>Stone v.
