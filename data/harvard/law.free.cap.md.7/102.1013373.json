On the 6th of July 1852, he sued out of said court a writ of attachment on this judgment, which, on the same day, was laid in the hands of the Etna Fire Insurance Company, as garnishee, who appeared and pleaded <em>nulla bona </em>of said Upton in its lands, upon which issue was joined. At January term 1853 the case was tried, and a verdict rendered against the garnishee for the sum of $ 19.29, the amount claimed by Griffith. A motion was then made by the garnishee in arrest of judgment, and the reason filed \u201cthat the court had not original jurisdiction therein.\u201d This motion the court, (Marshall, J.,) allowed and arrested the judgment. From this decision Griffith appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b110-8\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C. J., Eccleston, Tuck and Mason, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-9\">S. <em>A. Leakin </em>and <em>Jas. Malcolm </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahl\">argued, that this decision should be reversed, because an attachment on a judgment is an execution, and the Court of Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>had jurisdiction to issue an execution on its own judgment and to give judgment against the garnishee. <em>Acts of </em>1715, <em>ch. </em>40, <em>sec. </em>7; 1824, <em>ch. </em>74, and 1834, <em>ch. </em>189. 1 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>408, <em>Waters vs. Caton. </em>6 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 200, <em>Barney vs. Patterson. </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>241, <em>Baldwin vs. Wright &amp; Kent. </em>2 <em>Md. Rep., </em>458, <em>Evans &amp; Co., vs. Sprigg, et al.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-5\">No counsel appeared for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-6\">Mason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZ7\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The reason assigned by the counsel why this judgment should be arrested, namely, that the court had not <em>original </em>jurisdiction therein, does not, we suppose, properly indicate the grounds upon which, in fact, the judgment was arrested. That the Court of Common Pleas had original jurisdiction to render the judgment, upon an appeal from the magistrate\u2019s proceeding, there can be no doubt; but the objection doubtless was, that the court had not. power to order an attachment by way of execution upon its own judgment, because it was supposed that the attachment was a new or original proceeding, and the sum upon which it issued being below the jurisdiction of the court, no such action could be taken over the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This view is not correct. An attachment on judgment seems to have been treated, in the several acts of Assembly upon the subject, as an execution, and as its office is the same with that of a <em>Ji.fa., </em>we cannot see why, upon general principles, it should not be governed by the same rales. But the Court of Appeals have virtually settled the point. In the case of <em>Baldwin, use of Owens, vs. Wright &amp; Kent, </em>3 <em>Gill, </em>246, \u201cthis process,\u201d meaning an attachment on a judgment, the court say, \u201cunder this act, is considered by the terms of the act as an execution, and in our judgment should be governed by the same principles;-\u201d and they proceed to add, that therefore an <em>alias </em>attachment could not issue until the first is returned, and assimilate the case to that of <em>Turner vs. Walker, </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; Johns., </em>385, which related to a <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">It follows, therefore, from what we have said, that as every court has power to enforce its own judgments by issuing execution thereon, and- as this attachment was an execution, it was properly issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The language of the act of 1715, chap. 40, sec. 7, <em>that any person having obtained, a judgment in any court of this Province may take out an attachment by way of </em>execution, is certainly comprehensive enough to authorise the Court of Common Pleas to issue an attachment upon a judgment rendered upon appeal from a magistrate\u2019s decision, such judgment thereby becoming a judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and judgment for appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
