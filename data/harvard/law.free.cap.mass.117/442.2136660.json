In an action of contract on this agreement the declaration alleged that the defendant built the party wall, but built the same negligently, improperly, and without due care, and by means thereof said wall fell upon the plaintiff\u2019s close, and injured a building thereon standing. <em>Held, </em>on demurrer, that the declaration disclosed no cause of action in contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-9\">Contract, with counts in tort. The count in contract was as follows: \u201c And the plaintiffs say that the plaintiffs and the defendants mutually executed and entered into an indenture, a copy of which is hereto annexed ; and were the respective owners of two adjoining parcels of land on the west side of Main Street, Worcester, as in said indenture set forth; that the defendants erected the party wall therein mentioned, but erected the same negligently, improperly and without due care, and by means thereof said wall fell upon the plaintiff\u2019s said close, and injured and destroyed a building thereon standing, and injured and destroyed a stock of goods, merchandise and other personal property in said building, the same being the property of the plaintiffs, and otherwise injured the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>The indenture was dated July 9, 1873, and the material parts thereof were as follows: \u201c Whereas the said Charles L. and Chester Gorham, and the said Gross and Strauss, are owners of certain adjoining parcels of land situated on the westerly side of Main Street in the said Worcester between land of. the People\u2019s Savings Bank on the north and land of Mrs. Mary H. E. Davis on the south, and whereas the said parties to these presents propose to erect buildings upon their respective premises, they do hereby covenant and agree, each with the other, for themselves, their heirs or assigns, that the wall between their said premises shall be what is known as a party wall, to wit: One half of the thickness of the wall shall be built upon land owned by each of the said parties to these presents, and for the proper erection and maintenance of such party wall, the said parties do hereby give and grant each to the other, and to their heirs or assigns, all such rights and privileges in the premises and estates of each other as may be necessary for the fulfilment of this agreement in each and every particular thereof, subject to the restrictions and provisions hereinafter specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\">\u201c It is hereby agreed that either or each party shall have the right at any time to build said party wall, or any part thereof, or to make additions thereto, by whomsoever such wall, or part, may have been previously built.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-7\">\u201c And it is hereby agreed that the said party wall shall be built, constructed and maintained, in its several parts, and in any additions that may be made thereto, as follows.

Sts. <em>o. </em>129, inasmuch as the said count contained no allegation of a breach of any contract, but only allegations of a case in tort. <em>Gray, </em>C.

Jur. 243, 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">But upon advisement we are all of opinion that no undertaking in this respect is expressed in, or can be inferred from, the written agreement into which the parties have entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">By that agreement, each party grants to the other a license to build a party wall upon the boundary line between their estates, and all such rights and privileges in the estate of the former as may be necessary for the fulfilment of the agreement. It is agreed that the wall built by either party shall be built of a certain, width and materials, and to the satisfaction of the other party; that the cost shall be ascertained and agreed upon within a reasonable time after the building thereof; and that the other party, his heirs or assigns, may use the wall, upon paying half the cost. Neither party is under any obligation to build the wall at all, and the agreement contains no stipulation as to the degree of care to be exercised in building it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u25a0 It is possible that a contract might be implied that the wall, if actually built by one party, and afterwards used by the other in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the construction of a building on his estate, should be sufficient for such use; and that if, by reason of its insufficiency in that respect, the building so constructed by the latter should fall, an action upon such implied contract might be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">But the duty of the party, who avails himself of the right to build the wall, to exercise due care in building it, so as not to injure the buildings and property already upon his neighbor\u2019s estate, is not regulated by the agreement, and does not rest in contract; it is governed by the common law, and redress for any injury suffered by a failure in the performance of this duty must be sought by action of tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 count in contract does not allege that the wall was not built of the prescribed width or materials, or to the satisfaction of the plaintiffs, nor that the plaintiffs have used the wall; but merely charges negligence of the defendants in building the party wall mentioned in the agreement, and consequent injury to a building and property upon the plaintiffs\u2019 land. The demurrer to this count must therefore be sustained and the</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Count adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
