The evidence was that he left her without cause and remained away for ten months without providing for her; that they afterwards lived together until a year prior to the filing of the libel, when the wife, shortly before her confinement, went at his request to the house of her aunt, and he left her again without means of support, and had not since provided for her. There was evidence of the husband\u2019s ability to support his wife, and there was no evidence whether she was or was not able to earn her own support. The justice of this court, before whom the case was heard, dismissed the libel. <em>Held, </em>upon exceptions to his decision, that it did not appear that the divorce was improperly re fused.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b218-9\">Libel on the St. of 1870, <em>e. </em>404, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for a divorce from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>bond of matrimony, alleging for cause that the libellee, \u201c being of sufficient ability so to do, grossly, wantonly and cruelly refuses and neglects to provide suitable maintenance for \u201d the libellant.
