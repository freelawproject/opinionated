The trustees were authorized to mortgage the land in the sum of $3000, and to apply the sum \u201c to erect and finish the buildings on the premises, or in aid of such erection.\u201d Ho personal liability was to be incurred by the trustees in executing the mortgage. On the erection of the house, the trustees were to convey the land to the church by a quitclaim deed, \u201csubject to said mortgage if subsisting, and subject to all incumbrances, liens and mortgages thereon.\u201d The trustees covenanted to execute the trusts, but stipulated that they were not \u201cto be subjected personally to any cost or expense, but all costs and expenses are to be chargeable upon said estate.\u201d The trustees completed the buildings, but expended more than $3000, and for the excess executed a second mortgage. When called upon to convey the property, they refused unless the liabilities incurred in building were paid or secured.

The rector requested a rehearing, which was granted, and at the rehearing the question came up whether the rector ought not to convey to the parish the title to the rectory building, the land of which had been conveyed to him and another person in trust. The board returned to the bishop their original award, with their reasons therefor, one of which was that the rector had \u201c evinced no desire to convey the rectory to the parish, as bound by the deed of trust.\u201d The bishop of the diocese thereupon passed an order requiring the rector to relinquish his connection with the parish on the day stated in the award, on condition that the parish paid his <em>salary; </em>and also required the rector to convey the title to the rectory, held by him and his co-trustee, to the wardens and vestry of the church. The rector was paid his salary and resigned his office, but refused to convey the title to the rectory. <em>Held, </em>on a bill in equity by the wardens and vestry against the trustees to compel a conveyance, that the above recited proceedings had no bearing on the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-5\">Bill in equity, by the wardens and vestry of Christ Church in Hyde Park, a duly incorporated religious society, against John W.

Richards, or by said trustees or either of them, for or by reason of the mating or executing such mortgage; but said mortgage will constitute a valid incumbrance upon the estate and premises aforesaid, and said trustees are empowered to secure said loan by deed of mortgage upon said premises. And said premises are holden also upon this special trust, that in case said trustees or their successors shall determine to -sell and dispose of said premises, they are authorized to sell and convey the same, in fee or otherwise, or in mortgage or otherwise, the consent of the rector, for the time being, being thereto in writing first obtained ; but upon sale, the net avails and proceeds of such sale shall be reinvested by said trustees for the time being in a lot and house for a parsonage for said church, and so that the uses and interests and purposes of the trust aforedeclared may be performed and fulfilled.

The defendant Birchmore was at the date of the execution of the trust deed, and had been for some time before, the rector of said church, and continued to hold that office until May 15,1872. The trustees named in the trust deed accepted the trust and proceeded at once to improve the lot of land and to build a house thereon in accordance with the requirements of the. deed. Before the execution of the trust deed, it had been the understanding of the parties that the conveyance would not be made by the grantor until Birchmore should raise the sum of $1000 in aid of the building to be erected on the premises. The sum of $1008 was so raised by Birchmore, and was subsequently ex pended by the trustees on the building.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">In accordance with the provisions contained in the trust deed, a mortgage of the premises was executed by the trustees to the Weymouth and Braintree Institution for Savings, in the sum of $3000, and this sum was received by the trustees and expended by them, in building the rectory and in the improvement of said .ot of land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>A second mortgage of the premises was on May 9, 1872, executed by the trustees to Julius W.

No money was received by the trustees as a consideration, for such conveyance, and such conveyance was made to secure the debts therein named, incurred by the trustees in building the rectory. The entire sum of money received by the said trustees and expended by them in the building of the rectory, and the improvement of the land, was $4011.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">The defendant Birchmore, being rector of the church, took upon himself the principal charge of the work of building the house. His co-trustee, the defendant White, consulted with Birchmore in relation thereto, examined the accounts, was occasionally upon the grounds as the work went forward, and had full knowledge of all matters connected with the building of the rectory and the improvement of the land. The entire work was done, both as regards the building of the house and the improvement of the grounds, under the supervision of a person named Dalrymple, who was recommended to the trustees as a fit and suitable person by the grantor named in said trust deed and some of the principal donors contributing money in aid of the rectory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The building was erected and the land improved, so that the said Birchmore moved into and occupied the house as a rectory on December 1, 1871, although the work upon the building and grounds was not at that time entirely completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">The amount of debts incurred by the trustees in the execution of the trust and still unpaid is $1137.04.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">The master reported that it was not seriously disputed on the part of the plaintiffs that the amount of money was expended and debts incurred by the said trustees in the sums set forth in their answer; \u201c but it was contended, and evidence was offered to prove, that the trustees were guilty of gross negligence in the discharge of their duty, and that the amount expended by them in the execution of the trust was largely in excess of what could reasonably be required for such a purpose ; and from the evidence and an inspection of the building and premises, I am satisfied that a building of the same general class could have been erected for a sum much less than the sum which has been expended by these trustees upon these premises, and I am also satisfied that there were errors in judgment in the supervision of the work, in consequence of which the building has settled, and the embankment wall in the rear of the building has twice fallen down, so that it would require more than $300 to put the premises in their former state of repair; but I find in view of the nature and purposes of the trust, and especially in view of the fact that the entire work was done under the supervision of a person who was recommended to the trustees by the grantor named in the trust deed, and by some of the principal donors contributing money in aid of the building, that the trustees have not been guilty of gross negligence, that they have acted with reasonable prudence, and that the disbursements have been made and the debts incurred in good faith by them, the said trustees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">For some time before the execution of the trust deed, there existed a dissension between the parish of Christ Church and its rector, the defendant Birchmore; and in February, 1872, the wardens and vestry of said church, and a majority of the congregation, made application to the bishop of the diocese for the appointment of a board of reference, under Canon IV., Title II., of the Canons for the government of the Protestant Episcopal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Church in the United States, a copy of which is in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> A board of reference was duly constituted under said canon, and the defendant Birchmore was cited to appear before said board. A hearing was had before the board on February 21, 1872, at which both parties appeared, the parish being represented by its senior warden. The question was asked of the representative of the parish, whether the parish would abide by the decision of the board, as required by the said canon, and an affirmative answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>was given. It was a matter in dispute at the hearings before the master, whether, in answer to the same question, Birchmore gave his assent to abide by the decision of the board. The records, of the board did not show that Birchmore gave such assent, and upon the evidence the master found that no such assent was given by him.

This application was granted, and the board was again convened, and a second hearing was had on March 19. At this second hearing the matter of the rectory was taken up, and evidence was gone into upon the subject before said board. On March 21 the board of reference returned to the bishop their original award, together with their reasons therefor, one of which was that the rector \u201c has evinced no desire to convey the rectory to the parish, as bound by the deed of trust.\u201d The bishop thereupon sent to. the parish and'to the said Birchmore the following letter :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-8\">Boston, March 22, 1872.

The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have expended more than they were authorized by the trust deed to expend, and ought not to be allowed for such excess as a charge upon the estate. The deed authorizes the trustees to execute a mortgage of the premises for three thousand dollars, \u201c to be applied to erect and finish the buildings on the premises, or in aid of such erection,\u201d but it does not limit the trustees to this amount, as the cost of the buildings, nor provide that they shall not create other liens or incumbrances. On the contrary, it is clear that all the parties understood that more than three thousand dollars would necessarily be expended by the trustees, and that other liens and incumbrances might be placed upon the premises. The deed accordingly carefully provides, that after the buildings are erected they are to be conveyed to the rector, wardens, and vestry, subject \u201c to said mortgage, if subsisting, and subject to all incumbrances, liens, and mortgages thereon;\u201d that no personal liability shall be incurred by the trustees by reason of executing such mortgage; and that \u201cthey are not to be subjected personally to any cost or expense, but all costs and expenses are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>chargeable upon said estate.\u201d It was clearly the purpose of the donor and of the trustees, that the expenses of building the rectory, in excess of three thousand dollars, should be a charge upon the estate, and we are of opinion that the trustees have an equitable lien for such amount as is due to them for all the expenses reasonably incurred in executing their trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The master, to whom the case was referred for the purpose of determining the facts, has found that the expenditures and disbursements claimed by the defendants were made in good faith, and that they have acted with reasonable prudence. It follows that such expenditures, so far as they have not been paid to the trustees, ought to be allowed them as a charge upon the trust estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">For the same reasons the debts incurred by the trustees in erecting the buildings, being unpaid, and having been incurred in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable prudence, should be allowed them. The second mortgage was given to Tilson as trustee for the sole purpose of securing these debts. The master has not passed upon the question of the validity of this mortgage, and we do not understand that this question is of practical importance in this case. If it is void the trustees have an equitable lien upon the estate for the same amount for the debts incurred by them in executing this trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The only other question presented upon the facts found by the master, is as to the claim of the plaintiffs that the trustees in settling their account should be charged with a reasonable rent of the rectory after the defendant Birchmore resigned the rectorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">He resigned in May, 1872, and continued to occupy the premises until February 15, 1873. He thus directly received a benefit from the estate, with the knowledge and assent of his co-trustee, and we think they are chargeable for the amount found by the master as the fair rent for this time. It is the same in substance as if the trustees had received rents from the trust estate from a third person, which upon familiar principles would belong to the <em>cestui que trust. </em>But a majority of the court are of opinion that the further claim of the plaintiffs, that the trustees should be charged a reasonable rent for the premises after Birch-more left them, ought not under the circumstances of this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>to be allowed. For this time no rents were received, and neither trustee received any benefit from the estate. The premises were designed solely for the use of the rector of the church, and it was not any part of the purposes of the trust that the trustees should lease them to others. It is doubtful if they had the power to lease them. It is true that if they had done so and received rents they would be chargeable therewith, but they were not guilty of negligence in not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Nor are they chargeable upon the ground that they refused to convey to the church and thus deprived them of the use of the rectory, to which they were entitled. The master finds that after a new rector was settled over the parish, the trustees were requested to permit him to occupy the premises, \u201c but that the trustees refused to deliver up the premises to be so occupied except upon payment or security of the debts incurred by them in the execution of the trust.\u201d They offered to make a conveyance upon such payment or security, but the parish declined to comply with the condition. The trustees, as they had an equitable lien upon the estate, were entitled to insist upon this condition, and cannot be held guilty of any negligent or wrongful act in refusing to convey or to yield the possession of the premises until they were paid or secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The facts reported by the master as to the proceedings before the board of reference appointed under the general canons of the Episcopal Church, have no bearing upon this case. One of the defendants was not a party to those proceedings, and the board did not attempt to adjudicate upon the subject matter of this suit. Their award provided only that the defendant Birch-more should resign his office as rector, and that the parish should pay him his salary, but contained no provisions as to the conveyance of the rectory or the accounts between the parish and the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The result of the- whole case is, that the trustees are to be allowed the expenditures made and the liabilities incurred by them as found by the master, and are to be charged with the amount found by the master as the fair rent of the rectory while occupied by the defendant Birchmore after his resignation; the plaintiffs are to pay or indemnify the defendants for the balance of expenditures and liabilities incurred by them in executing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>trust, and thereupon the defendants are to convey the trust e&amp; tote to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">A hearing may be had, if necessary, before a single justice to settle the form and details of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
