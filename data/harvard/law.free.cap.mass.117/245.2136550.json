The report stated that the demandant\u2019s title was derived from a deed from A. to B., signed, sealed and attested by two witnesses. The attestation clause of the deed was in the usual printed form, with the words \u201c and delivered \u201d erased by a stroke of the pen, but when this was done did not appear. The deed, in the granting clause, named B. as the grantee, and described him as a resident of a lunatic asylum; and after a description of the premises, declared that it was understood that the premises were to remain under the control of the grantor and his heirs, so long as he or they should pay for the support of the grantee, and that the property was to enure to the benefit and use of the grantor\u2019s father and mother during their lives, \u201c afterwards to the said B. in his sole right, to be disposed of, if necessary, for his support and maintenance; and if not necessary for his maintenance, the same property shall fall in,equal portions to each of my sisters.\u201d The habendum was \u201c to him and them and their heirs and assigns,\" to his and their use forever. The covenants were with B., the father and mother, <em>\u201c </em>&amp;c.,\u201d and the first was, \u201c that until delivery hereof, I am the lawful owner of the said premises.\u201d The deed was recorded, and indorsed on the deed, in the handwriting of the grantor, under date of ten years after the date of record, was a statement that, as the grantor had paid more than the value of the property for the support of B., <em>\u201c </em>the property enures to me and my heirs, after its use shall not be wanted for him.\u201d The demandant\u2019s title was derived by deed from the sisters. The auditor found that the deed remained in A.\u2019s possession until his decease, and ruled that the deed conferred no title upon any of the persons named therein. <em>Held, </em>that a delivery of the deed might be inferred from the facts reported by the auditor; but as the auditor had not found a delivery, the demandant\u2019s title failed. <em>Held, also, </em>that, if there was a delivery, the deed conveyed an estate to B. for life, and that the sisters had no estate in remainder.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>A demandant in a writ of entry, brought in 1872, put in evidence that his grantor from 1819 to 1834 had been a tenant of an adjoining estate, and that during this period he had enlarged the house thereon, and had extended it over a part of ths land in controversy, and had cultivated the rest of the land as a garden, claiming' it as his own. <em>Held, </em>that on this evidence the action could not be maintained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">Writ OR entry, dated March 22, 1872, to recover land in Ashburnham. At the trial, before <em>Gray, </em>C. J., the parties agreed that the following report of an; auditor, to whom the case had been referred, should be taken as a statement of facts, and judgment rendered according to the opinion of the full court upon the matters of law arising thereon:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-5\">\u201c It was agreed that the demanded premises consist of two lots of land; one of which embraces nearly all the land in controversy, and the other, known as the \u2018 Hill Lot,\u2019 is a small lot situated in the rear of the house upon the large lot. Both parties derive their title to the large lot under Isaac Hill, formerly governor of New Hampshire. The tenant claims under a deed from the adminia trator of said Hill, given in 1853, in pursuance of a license of the Probate Court, and which embraces both the lots. The demand-ant claims the large lot under a deed from Isaac Hill to Walter B. Hill, dated and acknowledged August 30, 1834, and recorded September 2,1834, the material portions of which, with indorsements thereon, admitted to be in the handwriting of the grantor, are in the margin.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> This deed, thus indorsed, was in the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>.sion of Isaac Hill, the grantor, at his decease. Walter R. Hill, the grantee named therein, who died in 1855, is admitted to have been insane during the whole time in which delivery to any one was offered to be proved; and the deed was not shown to have ever been in his possession. The demandant contended that all the persons named in the habendum of the deed were grantees, and put in evidence a release to himself from all of them, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>one, or their heirs. I ruled that the deed conferred no title upon \u2022 any of the persons named therein, and that the demandant showed no title to the large lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">\u201c The small lot known as the 6 Hill Lot,\u2019 the last title to which by deed was in William J. Lawrence, was claimed by the demandant under a title derived from Hannah Hill. It appeared that this lot is contiguous to, and immediately ini the rear of the house situated upon the large lot. The large lot contained about an acre of land, and the Hill Lot about five square rods. The Hill Lot was not included in the deed from Isaac Hill to Walter R. Hill, but the evidence offered by the demandant tended to show that Hannah Hill occupied the house and large lot as the tenant of Isaac Hill, from 1819 to 1834, the date of the deed of Isaac Hill to Walter R. Hill; that during this time she enlarged the house by putting an L to it, a portion of which L extended several feet over the Hill Lot; and that she cultivated the remainder of the Hill Lot as a garden in connection with the house, and claimed it as her own land, which claim, however, did not appear ever to have been brought to the notice of Isaac Hill. It was conceded that if Hannah Hill had had a title to this Hill Lot, it was acquired by the demandant. The demandant upon these facts claimed title in Hannah Hill,- by possession, to the Hill Lot. The tenant contended that whatever title was gained, if any, enured to the benefit of Isaac Hill. I ruled that the demandant showed no title to the Hill Lot.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">At the argument the parties agreed that Isaac Hill, the grantor, and Walter R. Hill were brothers, and that Walter died without issue and unmarried, and all his sisters survived him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-6\"><em>W. S. B. Hopkins, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-4\">1. The demandant is entitled, on the facts developed before the auditor, to recover the large lot, under the deed. The deed, construed as a whole, although inartificially drawn, operates to give life interests to the father, mother and brother of the grantor, with remainder in fee to the sisters. These sisters survived Walter. The interests conferred on the father, mother and brother are secured and protected to them by the second clause of the deed, which is operative as a covenant to stand seised to uses. Under that clause, the grantor places himself and his heirs in a fiduciary relation, holding the estate during three lives for the benefit of three <em>eestuis que use. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>and expressly providing that the whole estate conveyed shall be hable to be \u201c disposed of\u201d for the support of Walter R, if necessary. That the grantor only intended to give Walter R a life estate further appears from the words-of grant, which do not give the land to his heirs ; and from the habendum, which is peculiar in not specifying \u201c his \u201d heirs, although the land is given to have and to hold \u201c to him \u201d and to \u201c his \u201d use and behoof. The remainder, if the trustee holding to the use of Walter should not find it necessary to dispose of the land, is given to the sisters and their heirs with entire clearness. \u201c The property shall fall in equal portions to each of my sisters (naming them) or to their children, if they shall be living at his (Walter\u2019s) decease. This is confirmed by the habendum to \u201c their \u201d heirs. So, too, the covenants of seisin and warranty run to the three life tenants, \u201c &amp;c.,\u201d \u201c their \u201d heirs and assigns. It is clear that this use of \u201c their heirs \u201d does not mean the heirs of Isaac or Hannah, to whose benefit the property was to \u201c enure \u201d \u201c during the period of their natural life.\u201d This use of the words \u201c their heirs \u201d cannot include Walter, whose personal maintenance alone was contemplated. And the \u201c &amp;c.\u201d can mean only the sisters, and \u201c their heirs \u201d must be applied to them only for they are the only persons who are ever to enjoy the estate otherwise than \u201c under the control \u201d of the grantor and his heirs, as trustees under the covenant to stand seised. Whether the deed is regarded as a covenant to stand-seised founded on the consideration of blood, or as a deed of bargain and sale founded on pecuniary consideration, it will be operative to pass an estate <em>in futuro. Trafton </em>v. Hawes, 102 Mass. 583.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\">2. The evidence is sufficient to show a delivery of the deed. The fact that the words \u201c and delivered \u201d were erased, with no evidence of when the erasure was made, or by whom, or for what reason, is entirely inconclusive on the question of delivery. The deed was recorded, and some of the grantees lived on the premises, and this makes a <em>primd fade </em>case of delivery, and it is incumbent on the tenant to show that it was not delivered. <em>Berkshire Ins. Co. </em>v. Sturgis, 13 Gray, 177. <em>Concord Bank </em>v. <em>Bellis, </em>10 Cush. 276. The indorsed memorandum is admissible also for the purpose of proving a delivery, as it is a declaration of the grantor made against his interest, and amounts to an admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of delivery. It proves that the deed was and had been for ten years in full force, and had been acted under by the covenantor to stand seised. And it declares that the deed sha,11 remain in force for the further use \u00a9f Walter. This all tends to show a delivery. No other delivery than a record was necessary to make a good delivery to the grantee. He was a lunatic and in an asylum, and a deed to a lunatic passes and vests a good title, despite his incapacity to give an intelligent assent to the deed. <em>Concord Bank </em>v. <em>Bellis, </em>10 Cush. 276, per Shaw, C. J. 4 Kent Com. (12th ed.) 446. 2 Bl. Com. (Wend, ed.) 291, 292. 2 Washb. Real Prop. 567, and cases cited. The principle that persons are presumed to accept grants which are beneficial to them is well recognized, and applies with much greater force to persons incapacitated to assent than it does to persons who are simply ignorant of the execution of the instrument for their benefit. 2 Bl. Com. (Wend, ed.) 309, note 27, and cases cited. <em>Church </em>v. <em>Gilman, </em>15 Wend. 656. 2 Washb. Real Prop. 583. It is also contended earnestly that a deed which operates as a covenant to stand seised to uses is sufficiently delivered by the covenantor\u2019s placing it on record and then proceeding to execute the use. Whether this, as a general proposition, be true or- not, there is imperative reason for holding such a deed to be duly delivered when the <em>cestui que use </em>is laboring under an incapacity; and the use is created out of tenderness toward that incapacity. 2 Bl. Com. (Wend, ed.) 338. In covenants to stand seised, it is the statute and not delivery of the deed which takes the seisin out of the covenantor and executes it with the use in the <em>cestui que use. </em>2 Washb. Real Prop. 129. In such case the grantor acts \u201c with the intention that it (the deed) shall operate immediately as a transfer of title,\u201d and \u201c it is placed at the disposal of the grantee or of some other person in his behalf,\u201d to wit: the person covenanting to stand seised to the use of the grantee and proceeding to execute his covenant. <em>Hawkes </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>105 Mass. 560.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">3. The demandant is entitled to the small lot. Mrs. Hill, as the tenant of Isaac Hill, occupied only the house and large lot. She cultivated and built upon the small lot, thus occupying it from 1819 to 1834, and she did this claiming to own it herself. Such a possession was adverse against all the world. The tenant is a stranger, against whom the possession of Mrs. Hill, transmit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ted by deed to the demandant, is fully sufficient to maintain this action. <em>Sparhawk </em>v.

Written and topied from the pencil draft, this 5th day of January, 1849.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-5\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9b\">The demandant\u2019s title to the large lot depends upon the question of delivery of the deed of 1834 from Isaac Hill. The burden rests upon the demandant to prove the fact of delivery. The auditor reports certain matters of evidence from which a delivery might be inferred. <em>Moore </em>v. Hazelton, 9 Allen, 102. <em>Howe </em>v. Howe, 99 Mass. 88, 97. But it is not a necessary inference, and the auditor has not found it as a fact. It is not clear to us that the auditor has not found the contrary. He \u201c ruled that the deed conferred no title upon any of the persons named therein, and that the demandant showed no title to the large lot.\u201d The case is submitted upon an agreement that the auditor\u2019s report shall \u201c be taken as a statement of facts.\u201d Taking this ruling or finding by itself, it would imply that there had been no sufficient delivery to confer title upon the grantee, Walter R. Hill; and that fact would be fatal to the demandant\u2019s claim of title to the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">But if this statement of the auditor\u2019s report should be construed as referring only to the persons under whom, as grantees of a remainder, the demandant seeks to make out his title, %e are of opinion that it was correct as a ruling upon the construction and legal effect of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The only grant which the deed contains is that of a life interest to Walter R. Hill. The clause intervening before the habendum is, in all its characteristics, a declaration of trust; which, if not void for repugnancy, would seem to qualify the preceding grant into a mere equitable estate. Its whole scope contemplates not only control of the property by the grantor, but the right and power of disposal, and the application of the principal as well as income to the support of Walter R. Hill. Following such provisions in relation to the disposal and appropriation of the property during the life of Walter, the further provision that \u201c if not necessary for his maintenance, the same property shall fall in equal portions to each of my sisters, .... or to their children, if they shall be living after his decease,\u201d cannot well be construed as a grant of a legal estate in remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The habendum and covenants will not serve to give it the effect of a conveyance of the legal estate, if only an equitable interest is defined in the premises. <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>First Universalist Society in </em>Chicopee, 8 Gray, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The auditor also ruled that the demandant showed no title to the \u201c Hill lot.\u201d And the facts stated by him show none. The demandant claimed title in Hannah Hill, by possession; and it was conceded that, if Hannah Hill had a title, it had been acquired by the demandant. But if the occupation by Hannah Hill had been of such a character as to support a claim of title by adverse possession, it does not appear to have continued for a sufficient length of time to perfect it, being only from 1819 to 1834. Nothing else appears to make out any title for the demandant. Mere possession by Hannah Hill in 1834, not followed by possession in the demandant or in any intermediate grantee from Hannah Hill, will not sustain a writ of entry in 1872. There must therefore be - <em>Judgment for the tenant.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
