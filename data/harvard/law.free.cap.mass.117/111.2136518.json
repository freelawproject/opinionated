John, Landers by will gave the demanded premises to his wife Lydia Landers, the mother of the demandant. The said Lydia and Temperance C.

Also a certain piece of salt meadow in Barnstable, being a part of the estate of said Hamblin, said meadow being bounded northeasterly by S. C. Howland, northwesterly by marsh formerly belonging to N.
