J. P. Cook. George A. Guernsey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">The first count of the declaration alleged the purchase by the plaintiff, in pursuance of the agreement, of one hundred shares of the said stock and the payment of $10,000 therefor, and the delivery by the plaintiff to the defendant of one hundred shares of the stock to be held by the defendant for the purpose mentioned in the agreement; that on February 1, 1872, the plaintiff entered into the employment of the India Company and gave his whole time and best efforts to the care and promotion of its interests, until his services as treasurer were dispensed with by the stockholders of the company on March 1, 1873, and another chosen in his place; that the plaintiff thereupon tendered to the defendant and to Beebe to reconvey to them the said stock purchased by the plaintiff, and demanded of them repayment of the said $10,000 and interest thereon at seven per cent., which was refused. The second count alleged that after the said purchase of one hundred shares by the plaintiff, the defendant had four hundred and fifty-five shares of the stock and Beebe four hundred and fifty shares, of which stock the defendant was in possession according to the agreement; that on October 2, 1872, the defendant sold the stock belonging to himself, the plaintiff and Beebe, amounting to nine hundred shares, without making any offer thereof to the plaintiff, at par and interest, and received therefor the sum of $90,000, of which the plaintiff was entitled to his proportionate share, to wit, nine thousand dollars and interest thereon, which the plaintiff demanded of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">At the trial in this court before <em>JEJndicott, </em>J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that at the time of signing the said agreement, James M. Beebe owned 500 shares of the capital stock of the India Manufacturing Company, and the defendant owned 505 shares, the whole capital stock of the company consisting of 2000 shares ; and that the 100 shares of stock referred to in the agreement were the property of Beebe and the defendant and that the plaintiff gave to the defendant $10,000 for the said stock; and the defendant and Beebe received the money as and for a purchase of the stock which they conveyed to the decendant. These facts, if competent to be proven and available aa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>evidence in construing the contract, were, for the purpose of raising the question of law upon the liability of the defendant, admitted ; the defendant contending that he is not personally liable upon the agreement as declared upon in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-4\">The case was taken from the jury, and the question reserved for the consideration of the full court, whether the action could be maintained, and the evidence offered was admissible. If the action could be maintained, it was to stand for trial; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-5\"><em>J. Gr. Abbott B. </em>Bean, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b566-6\"><em>J. A. </em>Gtillis, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b566-7\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjO\">We are of opinion that the instrument declared on is the contract of the defendant personally and not of the India Company. It is not executed so as to bind the company. It is signed by Cook, without any addition indicating that he was acting as an officer or agent of the company. The fact that the contract is in form a personal promise of Cook is very strong, if not conclusive, evidence that it was intended that he should be bound by it. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Heard, </em>28 Pick. 120. <em>Morell </em>v. <em>Codding, </em>4 Allen, 403. <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>West Brookfield, </em>9 Allen, 1. But the terms of the contract show that such was the intention of the parties. The principal stipulations of the contract, as to the plaintiff\u2019s purchase of one hundred shares of the stock of the company, as to the terms upon which it was to be reconveyed to Cook and Beebe if the plaintiff should cease to be treasurer, and as to his rights in any proposed sale of stock, are all mat ters which do not concern the company, and in which Cook and Beebe alone are interested. To hold the company bound by promises in which it has no interest, there ought to be unequivocal evidence that such was the intention of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">It was competent for the plaintiff, for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the contract, to show by paroi the relations of Cook and Beebe and the plaintiff to the company and to each other. The fact that Cook and Beebe, before they sold the hundred shares to the plaintiff, owned more than half of the capital stock of the company, tends to explain the provisions of the contract, as to the services of the plaintiff as treasurer, consistently with the theory that it was understood to be the per sonal contract of Cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>After the sale, Cook, Beebe and the plaintiff, who alone are interested in the main subject matter of the contract, had the control of the corporation. The whole arrangement as to the plaintiff\u2019s buying and holding the stock was based upon .the condition that he was to be the treasurer of the company. This was <em>t </em>matter within the control of Cook and Beebe, and it is not unnatural or surprising that Cook, who plainly acted for Beebe as well as for himself, should enter into the agreements contained in the contract as to the plaintiff\u2019s being treasurer, as an inducement to him to make the contract. Under these circumstances, the facts that these stipulations, in which the company are interested, are embodied in the contract, and that Cook in the opening sentence of the contract is described as \u201c president and representing the India Company,\u201d do not tend very strongly to overcome the presumption that the parties understood this to be the personal contract of Cook, afforded by the form of the contract, ancl the fact that the main subject matter concerned Cook and Beebe alone and not the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\n<em>Case to stand for trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
