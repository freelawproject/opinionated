It is a deposit note, by which the maker, in consideration of a policy of insurance issued to him, promises to pay to the insurance company or its treasurer the whole or any part of the note when required; the defendant was not bound to pay any part of the note untu the company required him and other makers of similar notes to do so i and the statute of limitations did not begin to run before the laying of an assessment. <em>Long Pond Ins.
