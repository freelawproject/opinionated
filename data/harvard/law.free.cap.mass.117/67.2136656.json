At June term, 1872, the case was, by agreement of parties and rule of court, referred to three referees, whose judgment was to be final. An award was made by two of the referees in favor of the plaintiffs, which was filed in court. This was set aside and the case recommitted to the same referees. One of the referees declined to act further, and the others made a second award in favor of the plaintiffs, and filed it in court. This award was set aside, and the plaintiffs appealed, and, without anything further being done in the Superior Court, entered the appeal in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-7\"><em>G.
