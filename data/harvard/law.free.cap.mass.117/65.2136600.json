My child was croupy, and I had had medicine before for her of Dr. Graves, and it cured her, and I was going to Lowell to get some of that same.\u201d On cross-examination she said : \u201cI started from my house in Chelmsford at half past six Sunday afternoon, September 14, 1873, to go to my boarding-house in Lowell. I did not intend to come back that night; intended to go to my boarding-house, and get the medicine before I went to my boarding-house, and send it home to my child by a person whom I supposed would go to my house in Chelmsford that night; but intended in the morning to see my overseer, and if I could get away I intended to go home in the morning, whether he gave me leave or not; I intended to stay in my boarding-house over night, and to get my supper there.
