The other half formerly belonged to Mary Skinner, who was the mother of the parties, and through whom they claimed. The demandant claimed title under a deed from Mary Skinner, dated October 24, 1870, and recorded May 27, 1872. The tenant claimed title under a deed from Mary Skinner, dated December 9,1870, but executed in the latter part of March, 1871, and acknowledged on April 8, following, and recorded May 31, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">The only question submitted to the jury was whether the tenant had actual notice of a valid, subsisting deed at the time he took his deed. There were several meetings between the parties and Mary Skinner before the deed was delivered to the tenant. The tenant testified that as the demandant, his mother, and himself, were about to start for the magistrate\u2019s for his mother to acknowledge her deed to him, he said to the demandant, \u201c I suppose now the other deed should be delivered up to me ; \u201d and she replied, \u201c I have burnt it up,\u201d all of which was denied by the demandant. It was contended by the demandant that the deed of the tenant was obtained from his mother by threatening to use up the estate in a lawsuit. The demandant admitted that the deed was made for a valuable consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-9\">The demandant was the witness to the deed from Mary Skinner to the tenant, and she testified that at the time of signing her name as witness, she knew the writing she was witnessing was a deed from her mother to the tenant, and supposed it conveyed the same premises as were conveyed by the deed of Mary Skinner to herself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The tenant asked the court to rule that upon these facts the demandant was estopped as matter of law from claiming title under her deed. The judge declined so to rule as matter of law. The jury found for the demandant; and the tenant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-4\"><em>Cr. Marston $ G. E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXV\">The case presented by the bill of exceptions does not require us to determine either of the questions, learnedly argued at the bar : whether the doctrine of courts of equity, that a person witnessing or present at the execution of a conveyance of property by another is estopped afterwards to set up title in himself, can be applied to the title to real estate in an action at law; and whether the conduct of the demandant would have been sufficient to constitute such an estoppel, if the tenant had taken a conveyance upon the faith of it, and with no knowledge of the actual state of the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The tenant\u2019s testimony was contradicted by the demandant\u2019s ; ' and the jury have found that the tenant, at the time of the deed to him, had actual notice of a valid subsisting deed previously executed by his grantor to the plaintiff. Under such circumstances, the authorities are uniform that it could not be ruled as matter of law that the demandant, by the mere fact of having knowingly witnessed the deed to the tenant, was estopped to assert a title under the earlier deed to herself. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>20 Pick. 186. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>2 Met. 423. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>14 Allen, 182. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Manchester Lawrence Railroad, </em>111 Mass. 1. <em>Odlin </em>v. <em>Gove, </em>41 N.
