Trial in the First District Court of Southern Worcester, the judge of which allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-7\">In November, 1872, James P. Sullivan applied to the plaintiff for permission to occupy a part of the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, for carrying on the business of marble and stone cutting. The plaintiff stated to him the conditions of occupancy, which were similar to those contained in the written lease hereinafter named. Sullivan, in December following, built on the land a wooden building, standing by its own weight on posts set and embedded deep in the ground. Afterwards Sullivan mortgaged the building to the defendant on December 21,1872, by deed recorded in the town clerk\u2019s office in Southbridge on January 4, 1873. On March 16, 1874, the mortgagee gave notice of foreclosure, which was recorded April 9,1874. On January 1,1873, the plaintiff gave to Sullivan an instrument under seal, signed by the plaintiff, granting Sullivan \u201c permission to occupy the land upon which his marble shop is now built, situated upon the west<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>erly side of Central Street, in said Southb ridge, for the purpose of carrying on the trade of marble cutting, upon condition of the payment by the said Sullivan of rent for the use thereof, at the rate of thirty dollars per year, payable quarterly from the first day of December last, reserving to myself, my heirs and assigns, the right of terminating such occupancy by giving six months\u2019 notice in writing, and giving to the said Sullivan also the privilege of removing said building after six months\u2019 written notice, and the payment of all rents that may be due for the use of said land.\u201d No other contract or understanding was ever entered into between the parties than this one in writing regarding the occupancy of the premises. Sullivan carried on business till some time in January, 1874, and then suspended work, and left early in February following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-4\">Sullivan paid but about $15 rent, the last money paid being in October, 1873. The plaintiff made frequent demand for his rent, but no demand was made March 1, 1874, the quarter day named in said lease, Sullivan being away. On March 12, 1874, the attorney of the plaintiff, in presence of witnesses, entered upon said premises and into said buildings for breach of the conditions of the lease, and fastened it up and retained the key, claiming a forfeiture of all rights to the premises and property for the nonpayment of rent. After this the defendant demanded of the plaintiff a statement of the amount of rent due, and the key to the building, which were refused, the defendant saying he was willing to pay the rent due. The plaintiff claimed the property. Thereupon the defendant brought an action of replevin for the building, which was served on March 23 by a deputy sheriff, under the direction of the defendant, who was present and gave the directions to the workmen during its removal. It was duly served, and the injuries to the premises were done in digging up the ground when the building was so removed. It did not appear that the plaintiff ever gave six months\u2019 notice in writing to Sullivan to remove the building, or that Sullivan or the defendant ever gave six months\u2019 written notice to the plaintiff. Upon this evidence, the defendant contended that the plaintiff could not recover; the judge, ruled that the action could be maintained and directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff, and the jury thereupon returned a verdict for the plaintiff and assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>damages at one dollar; and the defendant alleged exceptions to this ruling. The exceptions were overruled in the Superior Court, and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-4\"><em>J. M. </em>Cochran, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-5\"><em>A.

The building was thereupon erected on the land with the plaintiff\u2019s consent, with a right, by express agreement, on Sullivan\u2019s part to remove it. It was therefore personal property, and rightfully mortgaged as such to the defendant. <em>Hinckley </em>v. Baxter, 13 Allen, 139. <em>Howard </em>v. Fessenden, 14 Allen, 124. <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Car</em>brey, 13 Allen, 462. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>French, </em>106 Mass. 326. <em>Ham </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>111 Mass. 297. The plaintiff had not given notice to Sullivan, according to the terms of the memorandum, for the purpose of terminating his occupation, and there have been no proceedings which would operate as a forfeiture of his right at common law. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Harney, </em>100 Mass. 353. <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>6 Gray, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">As the building was personal property, and lawfully mortgaged to the defendant, he had a title which he might lawfully seek to enforce by a writ of replevin. Even if the right to remove the building was subject to conditions which Sullivan had not fulfilled, or the plaintiff held a lien upon it for his rent, it would not follow that the officer or his assistants would be trespassers in serving a writ of replevin in a proper manner. His justification does not depend upon the ability of the plaintiff in replevin to maintain his suit successfully. The precept would be a protection to the officer serving it, and also to the defendant and all other persons reasonably employed by the officer to assist him in taking and removing the building in obedience to the precept. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Ingalls, </em>97 Mass. 524. _</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The right to take the building of course implies the incidental right to enter upon the lot of land where it stood, for the purpose of taking it. As the verdict for the plaintiff was for a nominal sum only, we may infer that no unnecessary, wanton or unreasonable injury was done to his freehold.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
