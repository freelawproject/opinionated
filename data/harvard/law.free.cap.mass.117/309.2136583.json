Trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., who, after verdict, reported the case for the determination of this court in substance, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">The cases were tried together; and the only question made at the trial was whether the defendant was liable to be assessed as a member of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-9\">The plaintiffs introduced evidence that Jeremiah Williams represented to the company that he was the owner of the premises covered by the policies, and applied to them for insurance, and the policies, which were not under seal, were issued accordingly to \u201c Jeremiah Williams, guardian.\u201d There was no record evidence produced that Williams was guardian; but Jacob Fotler testified, without objection, that Williams was guardian of his, Fotler\u2019s, children. It appeared that the youngest of the children became of age before June, 1872, and thereafterwards, in said month, all the children conveyed the premises to Fotler, who, in a few days after, conveyed the same to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-10\">The plaintiffs then introduced evidence to show that Williams gave verbal authority to Arthur W. Austin, attorney at law, to transfer and assign the policies to the defendant for a valuable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>consideration, in Williams\u2019s name; and that thereupon, in the absence of Williams, Austin made on the back of the record of the policies, kept by the company, the following entry; \u201c Boston, June 19,1872. For value received I hereby transfer to Jonas B. Hildreth, of Boston, all my right, title and interest in this policy. Jeremiah Williams, Guardian. By Arthur W. Austin, his Attorney.\u201d Underneath the same was written by the president of the company as follows: \u201c Approved by me. \u2022 Chas. B. Cumings, Pres\u2019t.\u201d This transfer and approval were then copied on the policies. Austin further testified that Hildreth agreed to take and pay for these policies a value to be ascertained, and also agreed, for security of a mortgage given back by Hildreth to Fotler of the premises, (which was put into the case, and contained a clause that the buildings should be kept insured for the benefit of the mortgagee,) to transfer the policies back to Fotler \u201c to go with the mortgages; \u201d and that the defendant accordingly, the same 19th of June, indorsed on the policies the following: \u201c Having mortgaged the within premises to Jacob Fotler, I hereby assign this policy to him. Jonas B. Hildreth. June 19, 1872.\u201d This was stamped, and recorded on the books of the company. The plaintiffs then introduced evidence showing that the defendant received the policies from the company after the indorsements and record; and this was all the material evidence introduced relating to the property insured and the policies and assignments \"thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">The defendant requested the judge to rule that the policies were wager policies, and were void, and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on this evidence ; but the judge refused so to rule, and ruled that the jury would be authorized to return a verdict for the plaintiffs in each case, which was accordingly done. If the evidence would not in law authorize such verdict, then it is to be set aside; otherwise, judgment to be rendered thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-5\"><em>T. S. Dame, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-6\"><em>F. C. Welch, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-7\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEk\">The policy issued to Williams, guardian, was a personal contract, which he could transfer like any contract to which he was a party in his own right. His oral authority to Austin was sufficient for that purpose. The report shows that the policy was intended in good faith to insure property in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Williams was supposed to have some title or interest. Even if it failed to do so by reason of want of insurable interest in him, it would not be void as a wager policy. When it was transferred to the defendant, who then owned the property, and the transfer was assented to by the insurance company and recorded, and the policy so transferred was accepted by him, it became operative to insure the property intended; and the defendant became a member of the company, liable to assessments from that time until he should cease to be a member in accordance with its provisions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Ins. Co. </em>112 Mass. 116. <em>Cumings </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>ante, 30. <em>Boot &amp; Shoe Manuf. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Melrose Congregational Society, ante, </em>199.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The transfer by the defendant to Fotler, as mortgagee, was by way of collateral security only; and the record of this transfer was a recognition of it as such, or an acknowledgment of notice. But in such case the mortgagor remains, as before, the member of the company representing the policy. He, and not the mortgagee, is the party liable to assessment. The evidence fully authorized the verdict for the plaintiffs, and there must accordingly be in each case \u2022 <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
