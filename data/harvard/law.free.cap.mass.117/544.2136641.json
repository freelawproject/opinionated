At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Pitman, </em>J., there was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, under the provisions of the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>381, \u00a7 36, purchased in East Boston <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>a commutation ticket from the conductor of a Metropolitan car, in order to secure a passage on the horse-railroad cars to the defendant\u2019s stable in South Boston ; that he rode on the Metropolitan car to the corner of Harrison Avenue and Beach Street, at which place the plaintiff exchanged cars, getting into a car upon which he saw the words \u201c South Boston,\u201d and which, as it appeared in evidence, belonged to the Dorchester Street line of the defendant. The plaintiff gave up his ticket to the conductor of this car. On arriving at Dorchester Street the car stopped, and the plaintiff was informed by the conductor that that car would go no farther, it being short of the point to which plaintiff intended to go ; the plaintiff asked the conductor if he could ride upon another car then going by, down to the company\u2019s stable, without paying another fare; to which the conductor replied that he could. Immediately the plaintiff left the car and got on the front platform of the car of the defendant\u2019s that was going farther. After riding a short distance, the conductor asked the plaintiff for his fare, to which plaintiff replied that he had paid one fare in the other car, and he would not pay another, as that conductor had told him he could ride on this car without paying another fare; upon which declaration the conductor put the plaintiff off the car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-4\">Upon these facts the judge ruled as a matter of law, that \u201c the conductor had a right to put him off, unless he paid another fare,\u201d giving instructions not objected to, as to the time and manner of so doing. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-5\"><em>B. B. </em>Grove, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-6\"><em>W. A. Munroe, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b561-7\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0g\">The plaintiff\u2019s commutation check, which he received as a passenger in the car of the Metropolitan road from the conductor of that car, entitled him under the St. of 1871, <em>e. </em>381, \u00a7 36, to a passage on the same day in any car run in the city by any other street railway \u201c between any two points therein,\u201d without paying \u201c any sum beyond eight cents for both of the passages aforesaid.\u201d This right the plaintiff had used up when he surrendered his check and left the second car. It cannot be fairly claimed that he had the right to three passages in three different cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The fact that the defendant\u2019s conductor when he took up the check had informed him that he might ride without pay to the place of his destination in the car from which he was ejected, affords him no excuse for refusing to pay his fare when demanded. The conductor of that car, whose duty it was to collect the fare, had no authority to give him a free passage upon his statement that the conductor of another car had promised it to him without any consideration. Conductors have no authority so to bind the corporation by which they are employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
