Sts. <em>e. </em>161, \u00a7 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">To sustain an indictment under this statute it must be shown that the defendant fraudulently obtained property of another by a game, device, trick or other means, using \u201c cards or other implements or instruments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">The indictment in this case is broader than the statute. It charges that the defendant fraudulently obtained the property described, \u201cby means of a game, device, sleight of hand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>trick, and by the use of cards and other implements, instruments and means.\u201d Under this indictment it would not be necessary to prove that the defendant used cards or other implements or instruments, but he might be convicted by showing that he obtained the property by some trick or device, by the use of any other means, such as betting, or false representations or pretences.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The words \u201c and means \u201d cannot be rejected as surplusage ; they are not immaterial, but change the character of the acts charged. The indictment does not follow, but enlarges, the statute, and for this reason, without considering the other objections urged to it, we are of opinion that it is defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
