The commissioners in 1872 made a report <em>accordingly; </em>and any right of the respondents to avail themselves of the express repeal of the St. of 1864 by the St. of 1871, c. 338, \u00a7 7, was waived by not being invoked until after the St. of 1872, c. 107, had provided that such repeal should not affect cases pending, and after such report of the commissioners had been returned. <em>Held, </em>that, under the St. of 1871, a title asserted by one of the respondents against one of the petitioners to a portion of the flats by deed or prescription could not be tried in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>this case, and would not he affected hy an acceptance of the report under the St. of 1871; and, no other party objecting to such acceptance, that the report might he accepted under the St. of 1871.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-4\">Petition filed August 19, 1869, under the St. of 1864, <em>e. </em>306, by Stephen N.

Neal and Nehemiah Lee, alleging that the petitioners were seised in fee of certain parcels of land (described by metes and bounds) abutting on Lynn Harbor, with the buildings, wharves and other structures thereon, and of the flats adjacent and belonging thereto; that Lynn Harbor was deep and circular in form, and the flats thereof covered by high water; that the other owners of the land abutting on the harbor, and the flats adjacent and belonging thereto, so far as they were known to the petitioners, were Henry Breed and others named ; that the petitioners could not possess, occupy and improve their flats while their ownership respectively in the same, and the boundaries thereof, were not settled and determined; and praying for notice to the persons named and all other parties interested, and that the ownership in said flats respectively, and the boundaries thereof, might bel settled and determined according to law. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-5\">George L. Babb, having acquired the title of Thing and Rowe was afterwards admitted as a petitioner in their place.

If the order could be entered under the St. of 1871, <em>c. </em>338, it was to be affirmed ; otherwise, the- case to stand for further proceedings under the St. of 1864, <em>c. </em>306.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b612-5\">\u00ab7. <em>0.

Breed, 110 Mass. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">The St. of 1871, <em>e. </em>338, is a complete revision of the legislation upon this subject. It differs from the previous statutes in two important particulars. 1st. It requires the commissioners to , determine and report the boundary lines, not merely of the flats of the petitioners, but of \u201call other flats adjacent and owned by other persons, whose lines may be affected in, determining the lines' of such petitioners\u2019 flats.\u201d 2d. It makes no provision for the trial of any question of title in the flats depending upon acts of the parties; and declares that the report of the commissioners, when accepted and recorded, shall forever fix and determine the rights of all persons, \u201c except where definite boundary lines have been established by parties legally authorized so to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The St. of 1871, <em>e. </em>338, \u00a7 7, expressly repealed the St. of 1864. The St. of 1872, c. 107, provided that this section should \u201c not be taken to affect any proceedings which had already been commenced and were pending,\u201d at the time of its passage, under the St. of 1864. And it has been already decided in this case that the respondents, not having pleaded or set up such repeal until after the passage of the St. of 1872 and the return of the report of the commissioners, had waived any right to avail themselves of such repeal to defeat this proceeding. <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Breed, </em>110 Mass. 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The St. of 1872 simply provides that the express repeal, contained in \u00a7 7 of the St. of 1871, shall not affect pending proceedings ; and leaves the effect of the other sections of this statute upon such proceedings to be determined by the ordinary rules of construction. Those sections, as is manifest from their terms, and is admitted by the counsel on both sides, do not impair the validity of the proceedings of the commissioners appointed before they took effect. But so far as they prescribe the action to be taken by the court upon or after the report of the commissioners, they must supersede the former statutes and control the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>quent proceedings in the case, when this can be done without injuriously affecting the rights of any party before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The only objection made to the acceptance of the report of the ' commissioners is by one of the respondents who claims, and desires to try, against one of the petitioners, a title to a portion of the flats by deed or prescription. Upon this title, a final decree under the St. of 1871 has no more effect than was contemplated in the order appointing the commissioners in this case, and is expressed in the decree accepting their report and now appealed from. The only difference is, that since the passage of the St. of 1871 such\" title cannot be tried in this case, as it might have been under the previous statutes, but is left open to be determined in any appropriate, form of action hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">The motion of the appellant to have his title tried in this case was therefore rightly refused, and no reason is shown why the. decree accepting the report of the comraiw'cnors should not be</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
