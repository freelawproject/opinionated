D. enforced a lien on A.\u2019s land for labor in plastering. A. then brought an action against C. for the $200, on an alleged promise to pay the workmen on the building. The judge before whom the case was tried, without a jury, ruled on the above facts, that the plaintiff could not recover. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">Contract. The declaration contained three counts. The first and second counts were for money paid to prevent the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien for labor on a block of houses owned by the plaintiff, which money the defendant agreed to pay. The third count was for money had and received. The bill of particulars contained two items, the first being: \u201c To cash paid defendant on his promise to pay workman on plaintiff\u2019s building in Somerville which defendant neglected to do, $200; \u201d and the second item was for interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-5\">Trial in the Superior Court, without a jury, before Lord, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">On July 21, 1870, Milo Scott entered into a written contract with the plaintiff to furnish the labor and materials and build a block of houses on the land of the plaintiff in Somerville, for the sum of $5450. The defendant verbally agreed with Scott to furnish material and do the plaster and brick work of the block, and thereafter actually furnished the material and performed the work. In so doing the defendant employed William E. Bucknam, his brother, with other men, to work on the block; and William E. actually worked on said block for the defendant, from August 5, 1870, to October 1870, charging therefor the sum of $253.25, and agreeing not to call on the defendant for hia pay till Scott had paid him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-7\">In November, 1870, William E. Bucknam commenced pro ceedings to enforce his lien against said land and block of houses, and obtained a verdict in the Superior Court for the County of Middlesex, on January 15, 1872, for the sum of $206.82, as damages, and costs taxed at $45.42, though no decree for a sale of the premises was ever entered. The defendant knew of the proceedings to enforce said lien, and was present, and testified in favor of his brother at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\">The plaintiff, on March 14, 1872, paid William E. Bucknam the amount of said verdict and costs.as above stated, to avoid further proceedings for the enforcement of said lien; and at March term 1872, of said court, William E. gave the plaintiff a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>writing acknowledging \u201c full satisfaction of the debt and costs of suit, and of judgment and decree therein,\u201d and the same was filed in court on March 14, 1872. The plaintiff paid $68, as witness and counsel fees in defending said lien suit, and demanded of the defendant, before service of his writ, the sum of $382.21, the amount of said verdict, costs and expenses, which the defendant refused to pay. The plaintiff had overpaid Scott on his contract to the amount of $264, before the commencement of the proceedings to enforce said lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">The defendant commenced an action against Scott on a running account, embracing twenty-six items, \u2014 the first twenty-four items, being prior in point of time, amounted to $221.91; the twenty-fifth item was for said brick work, and amounted to $518.00; and the twenty-sixth item was for said plastering work, and amounted to $224.00. The total amount of the debits in said account being $993.91, and the credits given being $545.50. In that action the defendant employed the same attorney, and obtained a verdict against Scott for the sum of $436.17, and judgment was entered thereon, February 29,1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">On October 29, 1870, Scott gave to the defendant the following order on the plaintiff: \u201c Mr. Nichols: Please pay Mr. D. P. Bucknam $200 on account of plastering block. Milo Scott.\u201d And the defendant, on the morning of that day, presented the same to the plaintiff, who did not pay the same. The defendant paid his men in part, who had worked on said plastering, with \"other money obtained by him; and in the evening of that day the plaintiff paid to the defendant the amount of said order, who gave him the following receipt therefor: \u201c Received of Mr. J. O. Nichols the sum of two hundred dollars on account of work done for Milo Scott. D. P. Bucknam.\u201d The defendant credited the $200 to Scott, and the same is the last item of credit, in point of time, in the account in the action of the defendant against Scott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">When William E. Bucknam commenced to prosecute his said lien, and ever since, there was and has been due to the defendant from Scott, for materials and labor furnished and performed as aforesaid in the erection of said block, an amount much larger than said William\u2019s claim under his lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-7\">The defendant never made any promise to or agreement with the plaintiff, except so far as the same can be implied in law, ii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>at all, from said order and receipt, and from the other facts in the case. The plaintiff requested the judge to rule that a promise was implied by law on the part of the defendant. The judge, upon the foregoing facts, ruled that such promise was implied, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the amount of the verdict in the lien suit, without the costs or the expenses of the plaintiff in defending that suit, and that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on his third count, and ordered judgment accordingly for the sum of $266.82.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">The defendant alleged exceptions to the ruling \u201c that such promise was implied.\u201d The plaintiff alleged exceptions to the rulings, that he was not entitled to recover the costs in the lien suit, and that he was not entitled to recover on his third count.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>O. 8. Lincoln, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>0. Robinson, Jr., </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b507-7\">Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6v\">It appears upon Qthis report that the plaintiff, in order to save his property from being sold on legal process, has been compelled to pay a debt which was really due from the defendant. Under such circumstances, the law implies a request on the defendant\u2019s part, and a promise to repay; and the plaintiff has the same right of action as if he had paid the money at the defendant\u2019s express request. <em>Exall </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>8 T. R. 308. 1 Smith Lead. Cas. (5th Am. ed.) 70 <em>a, </em>73. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Huse, </em>10 Gray, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">But the costs incurred in defending against the claim stand on other grounds. The judge in the court below has held that they should be disallowed; his decision in matter of fact is conclusive, and there is nothing in the bill of exceptions to show that he erred in matter of law in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">We do not find in the bill of exceptions any reason for setting aside the ruling of the court as to the third count of the declaration. It is impossible to say, on the facts reported, that the money paid by the plaintiff was specifically appropriated to the payment of William E. Bucknam\u2019s claim, or that the defendant incurred any obligation so to apply it. It was found by the judge to have been a general payment on account, and we cannot Eay as a matter of law that there was any error in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The result is that the exceptions of both parties are</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
