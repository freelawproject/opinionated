The warrant issued on this complaint recited the averment of the complaint, and directed the officer \u201c to enter the. building in the basement herein above described,\u201d and make search, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">In the Superior Court, before the jury were .empanelled, the claimant made a motion to quash the proceedings, for the following reasons : \u201c1. The description of the building, in which it is alleged said Rankin kept the intoxicating liquors, is indefinite, irregular, not precise, and does not with certainty describe the premises or the portion of the premises kept by said Rankin. 2. There is no sufficient description of the place alleged to have been occupied by said Rankin as a place of common resort. 3. The complaint, warrant, and other proceedings had thereon, are generally vague and indefinite, and do not with accuracy set forth the requirements of the statute under which this complaint is made.\u201d Allen, J., overruled the motion, and the claimant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">After reading the complaint and the officer\u2019s return on the warrant, the clerk read the following issue to be submitted to the jury: \u201c The issue now submitted to you is whether any part, and, if so, what part, of the liquors described in the officer\u2019s return upon the warrant and named in said complaint, were at the time of the making of said complaint owned or kept by the person named in the said complaint, for the purpose of being sold contrary to the provisions of chapter 415 of the statutes of 1869, and this issue you are now sworn to try. If you find that the whole or any part of said liquors were so owned or kept, you will say so specifically; if you find that none were, you will say so and no more.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">Thereupon the claimant objected to the issue presented, as not containing the words \u201c in the premises described in the complaint,\u201d or any words equivalent thereto, or specifying the premises where the liquors described in the complaint, warrant, &amp;c., were owned or kept; and requested the judge to have inserted in the issue, after the words \u201c the person named in the complaint,\u201d the words \u201c in the premises described in the complaint,\u2019 or their equivalent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The judge overruled this objection, and refused the request, and the claimant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">Several witnesses called by the government testified that the entrance to the premises was from Washington Street, and that there was a sign on the right-hand side of the entrance with the figures \u201c 195\u00a3\u201d painted thereon ; that there was a flight of stairs from this entrance leading down into a basement; that Rankin, the claimant, had admitted he was proprietor of this basement ; that on January 15 they found the greater part of the liquors described in the complaint in a room or place directly under the sidewalk, to which they gained access by passing through a door in the basement; that on the 16th a barrel of whiskey was taken from this same .place under the sidewalk, and the other packages of liquors seized on the 16th were scattered around in different portions of the basement. No further testimony was introduced by the government tending to show the number of the building or the basement. On cross-examination the witnesses stated that they did not know the number of the building; that they did not know whether the premises kept by Rankin were in the basement of building numbered 195 or 197 Washington Street; that they only knew that on the sign on the right of the stairs, going down to the basement, were painted the numbers \u201c 195^- \u201d ; that they did not know who kept No. 195 or 197 Washington Street, or what business was carried on in said buildings. They were asked if there was any \u201c building in the basement; \u201d to which they answered in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">The claimant called William F. Sanborn, who testified that he was book-keeper for George F. Foye &amp; Co., jewellers ; that they kept at No. 195 Washington Street; that there was no basement in the building numbered one hundred and ninety-five Washington Street; that the adjoining building on the south was numbered one hundred andninety-seven, and that Simon S. Rankin did not carry on any business at, or keep or own, No. 195 Washington Street. On cross-examination this witness testified that Rankin carried on business in the basement of 197 Washington Street; that there was a sign on each side of the stairs leading down to the basement, with the name of 66 Rankin,\u2019 and the words \u201c Lager Beer \u201d painted on said signs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>No further evidence was introduced, and the claimant requested the judge to rule that there was a variance in the allegations in the complaint and the proof, in this : - The allegation in the complaint and warrant being that the liquors described were \u201c kept and deposited by Simon S. Rankin, of said Boston, in a certain building situated on Washington Street, and numbered one hundred and ninety-five and one-half on said street (195J) in said Boston; \u201d and the proof being, that if kept or deposited by said Rankin, they were kept and deposited in building numbered one hundred and ninety-seven, or in the basement of said building. The judge was further asked to rule that there was no proof to sustain the allegation, \u201c the building in the basement herein above described; \u201d that if the jury found that a portion of the liquors were seized in a place under the sidewalk, such portion so seized was not covered by the complaint and warrant to search. The judge ruled that there was no variance, and refused to give the rulings requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">At the conclusion of the charge, and before the jury retired, the claimant requested the judge to instruct the jury, that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the liquors described were kept and deposited by the person named in the complaint, in the premises described in the complaint; but the judge refused so to rule, and ruled that the only issue was whether or not the liquors seized were kept by the claimant illegally. The claimant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-5\"><em>J. W. </em>Mahan, for the claimant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-6\"><em>O. It. </em>Train, Attorney General, <em>$ W. Gr. Oolburn, </em>Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-7\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">The motion to quash the proceedings was properly overruled. The place to be searched was the basement numbered 195\u00a3 Washington Street, in Boston, and the complaint and warrant describe it with sufficient particularity to identify it. The court correctly ruled that proof that it was under a shop numbered 197 Washington Street did not create a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">As to the liquors seized in the room under the sidewalk, it was for the jury to say whether such room was attached to the basement as a part of it. If it was, the liquors found there were rightly seized under the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The statute provides that in proceedings for the forfeiture of intoxicating liquors, the complaint and warrant shall set out fully, plainly and substantially the place to be searched, the liquors to be seized and the person believed to be the owner or keeper of such liquors, intending to sell them contrary to law. St. 1869, <em>c. </em>415, \u00a7 46. It also provides that whether a claimant appears or not, the court \u201cshall proceed to try, hear and determine the allegations of such complaint,\u201d and whether the liquors seized or any part thereof are forfeited. \u00a7 51. If a claimant appears, he has the right to have any issue of fact tried by a jury. \u00a7\u00a7 55, 56. The allegation of place in the complaint is a material traversable allegation, and the claimant- has the right to require proof of it, and to submit this issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In the case at bar, therefore, the claimant had the right to submit to the jury the question whether the liquors seized, and which were before the court for adjudication, were kept in the premises described in the complaint. Unless they were thus kept by him as alleged in the complaint, they were not liable to forfeiture under these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the learned judge who presided at the trial erred in refusing to modify the issue for the jury as requested by the claimant, and in refusing to rule that the jury must be satisfied that the liquors were kept by the claimant in the premises described in the complaint. For this reason the <em>Exceptions are sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
