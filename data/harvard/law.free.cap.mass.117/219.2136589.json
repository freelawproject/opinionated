Parton.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\">Pool died on April 15, 1864, being then seised of the said land and having made no conveyance thereof previous to his death, leaving a will, by which he devised all his estate to Henry Bigelow in trust to hold the property invested as he might receive it, \u201c or to sell the same or any part thereof, and reinvest the proceeds, whenever and in such manner as he may deem expedient, executing and delivering sufficient deeds of the real estate,\u201d and to pay the income, after deducting expenses, to his wife Maria M. Pool, during her life, and the remainder to such person as she should by will appoint. The testator also appointed his wife his executrix, and gave her the same power to sell real estate as that given to his trustee, \u201c if she should find it necessary or convenient to sell any part thereof for the payment of my debts in the course of the settlement of my estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-5\">In June, 1864, Maria M. Pool, the widow of Nathan, was duly appointed his executrix by the Probate Court, and in December, 1866, Bigelow, the trustee named in the said will, having deceased without accepting the trust, the said Maria was duly appointed by the Probate Court trustee under the will in his place, in accordance with the Gen. Sts. c. 100, \u00a7 9, and accepted the trust and was duly qualified therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-6\">On December 16, 1868, Maria, intending to carry out and fulfil the provisions of the bond to Nugent, without license of the Probate Court, executed as executrix and trustee under the will of her late husband, and delivered to Martha W. Rhodes, the mother of the plaintiff in review, a warranty deed of the said land. Maria at the time of the conveyance had no notice of the assignment of the bond to Mrs. Parton, nor of any rights thereunder, but Martha W. had notice of the same. It was the intention both of Maria and Martha that the premises should be eon-r eyed by the latter to the plaintiff in review. The deed was duly acknowledged and was recorded January 14, 1869, and the said Rhodes entered into possession of the premises thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-7\">On May 21, 1869, Sylvester Nugent having died, Martha W\". Rhodes and her husband executed and delivered to the plaintiff in review a warranty deed of the demanded premises, which was duly acknowledged and was recorded May 26, 1869. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>commencement of this action the plaintiff in review was seised and in possession of the premises under the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-3\">Mary R. Parton died November 20, 1868, leaving a will duly proved and allowed, appointing William F. Cloon, the defendant in review, trustee of certain property, who having been duly appointed to and qualified for said trust, succeeded and became entitled to whatever rights Mary R. Parton was entitled to at the time of her death under the bond assigned to her by Sylvester Nugent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-4\">On July 24, 1869, Maria M.

The equitable rights of either party, under the original agreement between Pool and Nugent, and its transfer to Mrs. Parton, cannot be enforced or protected in this proceeding, even if the facts were sufficiently developed to enable the court properly to determine those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">By the will of Nathan Pool the title to the estate vested in the trustee, with a general and unrestricted power to sell and reinvest. It was a power attached to the trust, and not personal to the nominee of the testator. Upon the appointment of Mrs. Pool as trustee, by the Probate Court, the legal title became vested in her, and she was thereby clothed with the same power of sale. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>100, \u00a7 9. <em>Purdie </em>v. Whitney, 20 Pick. 25. <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>2 Met. 243, 254. <em>Parher </em>v. <em>Converse, </em>5 Gray, 336, 341. As executrix also she had a power of sale, by the express terms of the will, for payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The deed, under wnich the plaintiff in review claims title, was executed by her in both capacities. 3STo fraud is shown, upon the agreed statement, as a ground for avoiding the conveyance. If it might be inferred that the plaintiff in review received her deed without consideration or with notice of the trusts with which the estate was charged, her legal title would not thereby be defeated. The remedy of the <em>cestuis que </em>trust, if they are entitled to any, would be in equity.
