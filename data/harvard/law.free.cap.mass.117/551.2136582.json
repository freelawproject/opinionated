Writ dated July 14,1874. Charles E. Morrison, summoned as trustee, answered, denying that at the time of service on . him he had in his hands or possession any goods, effects or credits of the principal defendants, unless he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>was chargeable upon the following facts: \u201c The principal defendants were owners of a part of the steamboat George Shat-tuck, of which the trustee also owned a part. The trustee, acting for himself and the other owners of said steamboat, sold the same, and in payment therefor received, on the day of the service of said writ on him, the check of Williams &amp; Hall for the sum of $19,849.75, about eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon, and the person delivering him said check requested him not to use the same until after half-past twelve o\u2019clock of said day, which the trustee agreed to, and agreed that said check should not be presented before half-past twelve o\u2019clock of said day. The trustee, before the service of the writ upon him, indorsed the check to his firm of C. E. Morrison <em>&amp; </em>Co., as he did all the checks and funds of said steamboat and the business connected therewith, his said firm being the financial agents of said steamboat. His firm, after the service of the writ upon the trustee, deposited said check in a bank, and the proceeds of the same wA'e passed to the credit of the firm. The principal defendants were entitled to $838.63 of the proceeds of said check after it was collected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-4\">The trustee answered certain interrogatories as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-5\">\u201c I did not receive said check as cash, but I received it as precisely what it was, a check. I received no specific instructions from the principal defendants as to how I should receive payment for their share of said steamboat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-6\">\u201c I have no recollection of any instructions or authority that the defendants gave, further than that in common with the other owners, they executed the bill of sale which was delivered to me to deliver to the purchaser on completing the sale. I understood that the whole matter was placed in my hands by the owners to act according to my judgment, and that I would do what would be for their interest, which I did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-7\">\u201c There was never any formal appointment of my firm as such financial agents. Erom the time I became the acting manager of the boat my firm acted as the financial agents; that is, they received and paid out all the moneys that passed through my hands. The authority so to act was given by me by having that portion of the business done by them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b568-8\">In the Superior Court the trustee was discharged; the plaintiff recovered judgment against the principal defendants, and appealed from the order discharging the trustee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>T. S. </em>Dame, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-4\"><em>A. S. </em>Wheeler, for the trustee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-5\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Amj\">The alleged trustee had in his hands a check of a third party payable to his order, which had not been paid at the time of the service of the plaintiff\u2019i writ, and which, by the terms on which he received it, was not then presentable. He is not chargeable for this. <em>Hancock </em>v. Colyer, 99 Mass. 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The plaintiffs claim that he is chargeable because he agreed not to present the check for payment until after twelve and a half o\u2019clock of the day of its date. If the effect of this agreement was to create a debt due absolutely to the principal defendants, the alleged trustee would be chargeable. But he states in his answer that the defendants and other owners of the vessel placed the whole matter of the sale in his hands, to act according to his judgment. The agreement for delay in presenting the check, therefore, was not a breach of his instructions or a violation of his duty, which would render him absolutely liable to the owners for the amount of the check. <em>Trustee discharged.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
