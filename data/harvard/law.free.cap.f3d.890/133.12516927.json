After arresting Kolsuz, the agents took possession of his smartphone and subjected it to a month-long, off-site forensic analysis, yielding a nearly 900-page report cataloguing the phone's data. The district court denied Kolsuz's motion to suppress, applying the Fourth Amendment's border search exception and holding that the forensic examination was a nonroutine border search justified by reasonable suspicion. Kolsuz ultimately was convicted of attempting to smuggle firearms out of the country and an associated conspiracy charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kolsuz now challenges the denial of his suppression motion. First, he argues that the forensic analysis of his phone should not have been treated as a border search at all. According to Kolsuz, once both he and his phone were in government custody, the government interest in preventing\n   contraband from crossing the border was no longer implicated, so the border exception should no longer apply. Second, relying chiefly on\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (holding that search incident to arrest exception does not apply to searches of cell phones), Kolsuz urges that the privacy interest in smartphone data is so weighty that even under the border exception, a forensic search of a phone requires more than reasonable suspicion, and instead may be conducted only with a warrant based on probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We agree with the district court that the forensic analysis of Kolsuz's phone is properly categorized as a border search. Despite the temporal and spatial distance between the off-site analysis of the phone and Kolsuz's attempted departure at the airport, the justification for the border exception is broad enough to reach the search in this case. We also agree with the district court that under\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , the forensic examination of Kolsuz's phone must be considered a nonroutine border search, requiring some measure of individualized suspicion. What precisely that standard should be-whether reasonable suspicion is enough, as the district court concluded, or whether there must be a warrant based on probable cause, as Kolsuz suggests-is a question we need not resolve: Because the agents who conducted the search reasonably relied on precedent holding that no warrant was required, suppression of the report would be inappropriate even if we disagreed. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We begin with the Fourth Amendment principles that govern this case.

By that time, Kolsuz already was well known to government authorities. In December 2012, agents had discovered 163 firearms parts in his luggage when Kolsuz checked in for a flight to Turkey at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The parts were listed on the United States Munitions List (\"USML\"), subjecting them to export controls and a license requirement under the Arms Export Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20120.2\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 120.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121.1 (setting out USML, and defining \"defense articles and defense services\" subject to control under the Act). Agents explained the licensing requirements to Kolsuz and his companions, and ultimately seized the weapons parts. Just one month later, in January 2013, the process more or less repeated itself: Kolsuz arrived at JFK Airport for a flight to Turkey; a search of his checked luggage revealed firearms parts; and a licensing determination disclosed that although the parts were listed on the USML, Kolsuz had not obtained the requisite export license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Kolsuz reentered the country on January 25, 2016, the authorities were ready for him. On February 1, 2016, Charles Reich, a Special Agent with United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") in New York, reached out to CBP officers on duty at Washington Dulles International Airport (\"Dulles\") to let them know that Kolsuz, who had been stopped before while attempting to smuggle firearms parts out of the country, would be traveling from Dulles to Turkey the following\n   day. Agent Reich urged the officers to search Kolsuz's luggage for firearms parts, and followed up with an email containing additional information and a list of questions to ask Kolsuz about his associates and activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 2, 2016, Kolsuz began his return trip by checking in at Miami International Airport for a series of flights that would take him through Dulles and on to Turkey. When Kolsuz and his luggage reached Dulles, CBP officers Lauren Colgan and Jonathan Budd conducted an outbound customs examination of his two checked bags.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Once again, they found multiple firearms parts: 18 handgun barrels, 22 9mm handgun magazines, four .45 caliber handgun magazines, and one .22 caliber conversion kit. Colgan and Budd, thanks to their training, immediately recognized that the barrels and conversion kit were listed on the USML and thus could not be removed from the country without a license. And when Kolsuz was stopped on the jetway as he attempted to board his flight to Turkey, he admitted that he was in possession of firearms parts for which he did not have a federal license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After transporting Kolsuz to a secondary inspection area, the officers conducted what would be the first of two searches of Kolsuz's iPhone 6 Plus. This search-often referred to as a \"manual\" search-involved using the iPhone's touch screen, which was not password protected, to scroll through Kolsuz's recent calls and text messages. The officers also confirmed through a records search that Kolsuz had no export license or pending application for a license. After an interview with a number of CBP officers, Kolsuz was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At that point, CBP Special Agent Adam Coppolo initiated the second search of Kolsuz's phone, this one commonly known as a \"forensic\" search. Coppolo first transported the phone approximately four miles from Dulles to the Homeland Security Investigations office in Sterling, Virginia. There, Computer Forensic Agent Michael Del Vacchio attached the phone to a Cellebrite Physical Analyzer, which extracts data from electronic devices, and conducted an advanced logical file system extraction. The phone remained in airplane mode throughout, so the forensic examination did not reach data stored remotely-or \"in the cloud\"-and was instead limited to data stored on the phone itself. Even so, the data extraction process lasted for a full month, and yielded an 896-page report that included Kolsuz's personal contact lists, emails, messenger conversations, photographs, videos, calendar, web browsing history, and call logs, along with a history of Kolsuz's physical location down to precise GPS coordinates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kolsuz was indicted on three counts: (i) attempting to export firearms parts on the USML without a license, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202278\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (c); (ii) attempting to smuggle goods from the United States in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20554\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; and (iii) conspiracy to commit those offenses, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20371\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Before trial, Kolsuz filed a motion to suppress the report generated by the forensic examination of his phone, arguing primarily that the border exception did not apply to the search. According to Kolsuz, a\n   forensic search of a phone that occurs miles away from an airport and for a month after an attempted departure does not constitute a \"border search.\" Moreover, Kolsuz contended, the rationales justifying the border exception were not implicated in this case, because at the time of the search there was no prospect that either he or his phone-both securely in government custody-would be crossing the border. Instead, Kolsuz argued, the forensic search should be treated as a search incident to his arrest, and under\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , cell phones may be searched incident to arrest only with a warrant based on probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a comprehensively reasoned opinion, the district court denied Kolsuz's suppression motion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Va. 2016). The court held first that the forensic search of Kolsuz's phone was properly evaluated as a border search. That Kolsuz had been arrested, the district court explained, did not transform the forensic examination into a search incident to arrest or render the border exception inapplicable; both the Fourth Circuit and other courts have held that a border search may be conducted after a traveler is arrested and no longer in a position to cross the border.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134286\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/843/#p860\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 851 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, the court found, it is well established that a search initiated at the border may fall under the border exception even if it ultimately is conducted off-site and over a long period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 851-52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Now applying the border exception, the district court went on to consider whether the forensic search of Kolsuz's smartphone was a routine border search, subject to no Fourth Amendment requirements, or whether, as Kolsuz urged, it was a nonroutine search that required some degree of individualized suspicion. The court acknowledged that in\n   <em>\n    Ickes\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit treated as routine a border inspection of a computer's contents, accessed manually \"in the same way a typical user would\" and without any \"sophisticated forensic analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853 (citing\n   <em>\n    Ickes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171173\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/501/#p507\">\n    393 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   502-03 ). But that decision, the court determined, \"does not address whether more sophisticated forensic searches\" also may be classified as routine,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 854, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and its emphasis on the significant privacy interests in the digital contents of phones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court concluded that while the manual search of Kolsuz's iPhone at the airport was a routine border search,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the off-site forensic analysis of the phone's data qualified as a nonroutine search. After\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , the court found, a forensic search of a phone no longer can be analogized to an ordinary search of luggage or some other container at the border, given the breadth and sensitivity of the private information that may be uncovered. It is \"difficult to conceive of a property search more invasive or intrusive than a sophisticated, digital search of a cell phone,\" the court concluded, which might be compared to a \"body cavity search\" of a phone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 856 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Md. 2014) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a nonroutine border search, the court went on to hold, the forensic analysis of Kolsuz's phone required particularized suspicion, in the form of the familiar reasonable suspicion standard. The court rejected the more demanding requirement of a warrant\n   based on probable cause, noting that no reported case has held a border search to that standard. Instead, courts consistently have deemed reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify even the most intrusive of nonroutine border searches, including body cavity and alimentary canal searches. Because the government in this case had \"more than reasonable suspicion\" that a forensic examination of Kolsuz's phone would reveal evidence of both past and ongoing attempts to export firearms parts illegally, the court concluded, the forensic search was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 859, 860.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties consented to a bench trial, and the district court found Kolsuz guilty of all three counts against him. In finding that Kolsuz acted with the requisite willfulness, the court relied in part on messages Kolsuz exchanged with a co-conspirator, obtained from the forensic search of Kolsuz's phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ultimately entered judgment only on the Arms Export Control Act and conspiracy counts against Kolsuz, dismissing the smuggling charge on the government's motion. Kolsuz was sentenced to 30 months in prison and three years of supervised release, and this timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Kolsuz's appeal is a narrow one, and we begin by clarifying what is and is not in front of us today. First, Kolsuz does not challenge the manual search of his smartphone, undertaken on-site at the airport as he tried to depart for Turkey. We thus have no occasion to consider application of the border exception to manual searches of electronic devices, conducted at the border and roughly contemporaneously with an attempted crossing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But perhaps because he was in custody while the government undertook its month-long forensic analysis, Kolsuz has not asserted any impairment of a possessory interest in his phone. Accordingly, we do not address whether and under what circumstances an extended confiscation of a traveler's phone-quite apart from any search undertaken-might constitute an unreasonable seizure of property for Fourth Amendment purposes.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saboonchi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316760\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/990/536/#p569\">\n    990 F.Supp.2d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that forensic searches of digital devices may deprive individuals of their possessions for periods of days or weeks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That leaves the question that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   raised by this appeal: whether the forensic search of Kolsuz's phone, and the associated invasion of Kolsuz's privacy, was justified under the border search exception. In considering the district court's denial of Kolsuz's motion to suppress, we review\n   that court's legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Once he was arrested and his phone seized and transported miles from the airport, Kolsuz contends, the government interest that underlies the border search exception-preventing contraband from crossing a border-was no longer at issue, and the border exception was therefore inapplicable. Rather, standard Fourth Amendment rules governed the forensic search, and required a warrant based on probable cause because the search was incident to Kolsuz's arrest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2485, 2493-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the search incident exception does not apply to cell phones, which generally may be searched incident to arrest only with probable cause and a warrant). We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, as the district court explained, the border exception is not rendered inapplicable because a search initiated at a border ultimately is conducted at some physical or temporal remove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kolsuz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134286\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/843/#p860\">\n    185 F.Supp.3d at 851-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"as several courts have held, an off-site forensic search of an electronic device over a long period of time is nonetheless a border search\");\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, after pressing this point before the district court, Kolsuz concedes it on appeal, agreeing that the location and timing of the search in this case are consistent with the border search exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Nor, as the district court determined, does the fact of Kolsuz's arrest transform the examination of his phone into a search incident to arrest, triggering\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and calling for a search warrant based on probable cause. In\n   <em>\n    Ickes\n   </em>\n   , our court applied the border search exception to approve a manual search of computer data that occurred only after the defendant had been arrested, obviating any threat of an imminent border crossing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171173\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/501/#p507\">\n    393 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   503 ;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cal. 2016) (rejecting argument that arrest renders border exception inapplicable by making it impossible for defendant or contraband to cross border). Kolsuz attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Ickes\n   </em>\n   on the ground that it involved an entry search rather than the exit search at issue here, but for these purposes, it makes no difference: As we have explained, where the relevant governmental interests are present, the border search exception extends equally to entry and exit searches,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oriakhi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414789\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/57/1290/#p1296\">\n    57 F.3d at 1296-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and any rule carving out post-arrest searches from that doctrine would apply equally in both contexts, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its strongest form, Kolsuz's argument combines all of these factors-his arrest as he sought to depart the country, the phone in government custody miles from the border, the month-long gap between the action at the airport and the end of the search-and argues that taken together, they show that the search in this case is entirely \"untethered\" from any justification behind the border exception. The rati\n   onale allowing outgoing border searches, as Kolsuz describes it, is limited to intercepting contraband as it crosses the national border. Here, with the phone as well as the firearms parts seized by the government and Kolsuz under arrest, there was no contraband poised to exit the country and thus no nexus to that rationale. When that is the case, Kolsuz argues, the border search exception does not apply, because the concerns underlying a warrant exception \"define the boundaries of the exception.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p338\">\n    556 U.S. at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653882\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/332/#p338\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Kolsuz's foundational premise is correct: As a general rule, the scope of a warrant exception should be defined by its justifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2484-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (asking whether \"application of the search incident to arrest doctrine to this particular category of effects would untether the rule from the justifications underlying the [search incident to arrest] exception\").

On the facts here, the link between the search of Kolsuz's phone and the interest that justifies border searches was sufficient to trigger the border exception on any account of a \"nexus\" requirement.

Such a rule claims for courts the sole prerogative to set standards in an area where legislative inquiry would be invaluable and where the executive maintains a strong sovereign interest.

The whole enterprise calls for the greatest caution and circumspection, not premature declarations of constitutional rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   If individualized suspicion is to be required in order to conduct what the majority asserts is a \"nonroutine border search,\" Maj.

Assuming without deciding that reasonable suspicion was even required, it is present here in triplicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Instead my colleagues wander from what Article III indisputably envisions as the core role of courts: simply to decide a case or controversy.

Before his arrest at Dulles airport, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents had twice stopped Kolsuz, a Turkish national, at JFK airport for carrying contraband firearms parts proscribed by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202278\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On both occasions, Kolsuz failed to produce the license required to export those parts. Both times, CBP agents informed Kolsuz that he needed a license to export those items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Kolsuz reentered the United States on January 25, 2016, on a tourist visa. He again purchased numerous gun parts. Law enforcement officials who were familiar with Kolsuz's previous attempts to export contraband firearms asked CBP to search Kolsuz's bags when he tried to return to Turkey. When Kolsuz arrived at Dulles, CBP searched his bags. The inspection revealed eighteen handgun barrels, twenty-two 9 mm handgun magazines, four .45 caliber handgun magazines, and one .22 caliber Glock conversion kit. All of these firearms parts are restricted items on the U.S. Munitions List. At no time did Kolsuz have permission to export them. Based on Kolsuz's previous attempts to bring firearm parts out of the country, CBP had ample reason to suspect that Kolsuz might again try to export firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Following the search of Kolsuz's bags, CBP officers interrogated Kolsuz and performed a cursory inspection of his iPhone. At the end of the interrogation, Kolsuz was arrested and his iPhone seized. At that point, his iPhone was transported to Sterling, Virginia, where federal law enforcement conducted an \"advanced logical file system extraction\" of the iPhone. This extraction, as the majority notes, generated an 896-page report on the information contained in the phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This was plainly a border search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 144-45. Assuming reasonable suspicion of Kolsuz's criminal activity is somehow required, it clearly existed here. We need go no further. Rather than deciding the case on solid and suitably limited grounds, the majority goes on to prescribe a constitutional standard whose rationale would label a great many cell phone searches undertaken at the border as \"nonroutine\" and forbidden absent prior individualized suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   While the majority purports not to reach the question of the justification required for the manual search of Kolsuz's cell phone at Dulles airport,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 146-47 n.5, the rhetorical thrust of its opinion as concerns cell phones and smartphones may be read by many courts to require individualized suspicion for border searches of all cell phones period. Or if the majority intends a less sweeping standard, the slipperiness of the distinction between intrusive and less intrusive cell phone searches and between those that are routine and those that are nonroutine will\n   lead, I fear, to difficulties in application down the road. While the majority's constitutional venture may be correct, it also may well not be. Again, we are not the ones to set the standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We are, each of us, in over our heads. We have no idea of the dangers we are courting.

Thousands of international travelers go through them every day. Yet the majority hardly grapples with how law enforcement is expected to ascertain individualized suspicion when dealing with such numbers. The privacy interest, while weighty, is the only side of a precarious balance that seems to concern the majority, and this in the application of the Fourth Amendment, which articulates reasonableness and hence balance as a standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

But the so-called floor in this case is not some innocuous minimum, but a hugely consequential policy judgment that certain categories of border searches will require individualized suspicion. The fact that Congress has not thus far seen fit to adopt a court's preferred standard gives us no license to act preemptively with an unnecessary constitutional disquisition. The dangers of this notion are underscored by the majority's reservation here of the question whether probable cause or a warrant may be required for some unspecified categories of border searches in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 146-47. This does not sound like any sort of \"floor\" at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The dangers of judicial standard-setting in an area as sensitive as border searches is thus apparent. Here the legislative process would be informed by numerous representatives of the executive branch, who can lend their practical insights and experience to the inquiry. The executive's role has always been thought especially important in an area such as border searches, where it has long been held to have a uniquely sovereign interest. The border search exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement is based on the \"longstanding right of the sovereign to protect itself by stopping and examining persons and property crossing into this country.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1727\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/606/#p620\">\n    431 U.S. 606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1727\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/606/#p620\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1727\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/606/#p620\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977).

Madison\n   </em>\n   did of course say that it is \"emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12121622\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/5/137/\">\n    2 L.Ed. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1803). But that is a very different proposition from holding that constitutional interpretation must be solely a judicial function. Indeed \"the general architecture of [the Constitution] would seem to imply a basic coequality among the three departments. ... [I]t nowhere explicitly raises the Court above coordinate legislative and executive departments.\" Akhil Reed Amar,\n   <em>\n    Architecture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Ind.%20L.J.%20671\">\n    77 Ind. L.J. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 692-93 (2002). This is not a new idea. James Madison wrote that \"none of [the three branches of government] ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence over the others in the administration of their respective powers.\" The Federalist No. 48 (James Madison). But it is precisely that\n   \"overruling influence\" the majority asserts in its unnecessary constitutional exercise today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The general search that all of us must undergo at airports attests to the difficulties of ensuring airborne security through individualized suspicion. Our new world has brought inconvenience and intrusions on an indiscriminate basis, which none of us welcome, but which most of us undergo in the interest of assuring a larger common good. Our old world of relative security and relative privacy, if indeed it ever existed, is now gone with the wind. It is painful to dream of retrieving what is ours no longer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Supreme Court has often noted how technology endangers privacy. As it observed in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , \"[m]odern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2488-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   involved the warrantless search of a cell phone following an ordinary roadside arrest after a traffic violation. The defendant was not at the border. The setting here is far different from\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Nor does the privacy interest recognized in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   begin to answer the question of\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   should strike the balance between privacy and security at the border of the country, the point most freighted with security threats and the point at which a nation asserts and affirms its very right to nationhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Porous borders are uniquely tempting to those intent upon inflicting the vivid horrors of mass casualties. Then too, there is the danger of highly classified technical information being smuggled out of this country only to go into the hands of foreign nations who do not wish us well and who seek to build their armaments to an ever more perilous state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   It is no secret that rapid technological advances have enhanced the ability of criminal syndicates and terrorist networks to execute transnational schemes through the coordination now made possible by instantaneous communications. To give criminal enterprises the advantage of technological advancements and at the same time impair access of law enforcement to those same developments risks recalibrating the Fourth Amendment balance in a manner that does not comport with reasonableness. Cell phones may prove essential to revealing the scope of a conspiracy; who is involved; what weapons and devices the conspirators possess; what the purpose and plans and timing of the plotted criminal acts may be; and where indeed those who would carry out these acts may be located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   But to stop there is to halve the equation. The majority is right to emphasize that searches of cell phones and the like can reveal a trove of data unconnected to any criminal offense. The intrusion upon personal privacy is undoubtedly severe. One may of course say that international travelers are on notice that border inspections may be uniquely intrusive, and that travelers can prepare for that prospect by not taking a full load of personal data abroad, where additional dangers of theft and inadvertent loss may also await. But the fact that we can pack our digital suitcase with the same care that we pack personal belongings in traditional luggage still does not nullify the reality that these sorts of searches look into our lives in a way that is deeply uncomfortable, especially when government itself becomes the agent of intrusion. But the ultimate question here is not whether there is a balance to be struck between what are highly significant privacy and security interests. It is\n   what branch of government is best suited to make that determination. In this case, where there is a longstanding historical practice in border searches of deferring to the legislative and executive branches, the majority should have shown a modest measure of restraint simply by deciding the case. Our role in this narrow area is more the application of standards than the creation of them. In reaching to formulate a constitutional rule, the majority has turned the whole thing on its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   We are ruling in a vacuum. We are building a doctrinal house without foundation. The majority opinion provides little context or background or real-life picture of Dulles Airport. It leaves little role for the legislative branch. At what point the domestic conveniences of cell phone use should ripen into transnational entitlements is primarily for the political branches to determine. The elected branches are also best able to gauge at what point the creeping constitutionalization of border searches reflects the cultural habits and practices of an elite group of transnational Americans at the risk of endangerment that knows no class bounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   It is ill advised to ignore the role of the political branches in addressing a phenomenon that may fall short of the formal warfare contemplated in Articles I and II, but still retains major features of international conflict. To reach beyond the Article III function is to court grave dangers which we may perceive as remote and hypothetical until one day, very suddenly, they are not. Not that any one case or any one appellate court will likely bring down havoc on our heads. In our shielded circumstances, we may never know or be apprised of many effects of our decisions. Still it is uncomfortable to guess. I have nothing but respect for my friends in the majority. But taken cumulatively, rulings slowly constitutionalizing border searches are taking chances with the safety and lives of our fellow Americans. And this, as a judge, I cannot do.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Kolsuz never has suggested that this standard customs search of his checked luggage presents any constitutional problem.

Because Kolsuz does not challenge the initial manual search of his phone at Dulles, we have no occasion here to consider whether\n    <em>\n     Riley\n    </em>\n    calls into question the permissibility of suspicionless manual searches of digital devices at the border.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The new policy does not use the \"routine\" and \"nonroutine\" terminology of Supreme Court case law, distinguishing instead between \"basic\" and \"advanced\" searches. But the import is the same. \"Basic\" searches (like those we term \"manual\") are examinations of an electronic device that do not entail the use of external equipment or software and may be conducted without suspicion. \"Advanced\" searches (like \"forensic\" searches) involve the connection of external equipment to a device-such as the Cellebrite Physical Analyzer used on Kolsuz's phone-in order to review, copy, or analyze its contents, and are subject to the restrictions noted above.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Customs and Border Prot., CBP Directive No. 3340-049A,\n    <em>\n     Border Search of Electronic Devices\n    </em>\n    4-5 (2018);\n    <em>\n     Molina-Isidoro\n    </em>\n    , 884 F.3d at 294 &amp; n.2 (Costa, J., concurring).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Kolsuz also argues that even if the search of his phone could be justified by reasonable suspicion, what would be required is reasonable suspicion that contraband, as opposed to evidence, would be found on the device. Otherwise, according to Kolsuz, the search would be \"untethered\" from the constitutional justification for border searches: the interception of contraband as it crosses the border. If this argument sounds familiar, that is because it is a reformulation of Kolsuz's threshold argument against any application of the border exception to this case, addressed above. And for essentially the reasons already given, we cannot agree. The district court found-and Kolsuz does not dispute-that the agents here had reason to believe that their search of Kolsuz's phone would reveal not only evidence of past export-control violations, but also evidence of ongoing efforts to smuggle firearms over the border.\n    <em>\n     Kolsuz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134286\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/185/843/#p860\">\n     185 F.Supp.3d at 860\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That is enough to \"tether\" the search to the rationale behind the border exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
