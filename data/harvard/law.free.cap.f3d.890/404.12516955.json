Under the IDEA, when parents and school districts dispute a child's educational placement, a parent may file an administrative due process complaint that can lead to an administrative hearing. At least ten days before the dispute reaches a hearing, the school district can extend a settlement offer to the parent, referred to herein as a \"ten-day offer.\" If the matter proceeds to a hearing and the parent is the prevailing party, this ten-day offer becomes significant. A parent who is the prevailing party may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees under the IDEA, but the ten-day offer allows a school district to limit its exposure to such fees by limiting a parent's eligibility for attorney's fees to only those fees accrued before the time of the ten-day offer. If a parent rejects the ten-day offer, the parent may only receive attorney's fees for work done after the time of the offer if (1) the hearing leads to more favorable relief than the offer included, or (2) the parent was substantially justified in rejecting the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the instant matter, Rena C., mother to student A.D., filed an administrative due process complaint against the Colonial School District to determine an appropriate placement for her daughter. In an effort to limit the accrual of owed attorney's fees, Colonial extended Rena C. what it contends was a ten-day offer. Rena C. rejected the offer. When the matter eventually proceeded to a hearing, an administrative officer entered an order in favor of Rena C., ordering a private school placement for the student. As the prevailing party, Rena C. then filed a claim for attorney's fees in the District Court. This appeal concerns whether or not Colonial successfully limited Rena C.'s eligibility for attorney's fees with its offer. Because Rena C. was the prevailing party, the District\n   Court awarded her attorney's fees for work performed prior to the ten-day offer. However, the District Court held that because she did not receive more favorable relief and was not substantially justified in rejecting the offer, she was not entitled to fees accrued after Colonial's offer. We disagree and hold that Rena C. was substantially justified in rejecting Colonial School District's offer. We will reverse and remand to the District Court for recalculation of attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rena C.'s child, A.D., attended public school in the Colonial School District. The instant matter was not the first placement dispute between Rena C. and Colonial. Prior to this matter, when A.D. was entering seventh grade, Rena C. unilaterally pulled A.D. from the public school she had been attending and enrolled her at the Stratford Friends School. Rena C. claimed that Colonial had failed to provide a free, appropriate public education as required by the IDEA and sought reimbursement from Colonial. The matter went to an administrative hearing officer who found that A.D.'s Individualized Education Program (IEP) at Colonial was inappropriate and that the placement at Stratford was appropriate. The hearing officer awarded Rena C. two years of compensatory education, tuition reimbursement for the current school year, and ongoing tuition reimbursement until Colonial convened an appropriate IEP meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The following school year, for A.D.'s eighth grade year, Rena C. again enrolled her at Stratford. Colonial convened an IEP meeting at the end of that school year. Rena C. disputed the adequacy of the IEP and requested mediation, thus beginning the dispute underlying this appeal. At the end of the summer, Rena C. notified Colonial that she intended to enroll A.D. at Delaware Valley Friends School for the next school year and requested reimbursement for tuition and related expenses. Colonial responded that the new IEP placing A.D. at the public school was adequate and that it therefore was not required to further reimburse Rena C. for any educational expenses. Rena C. then cancelled the mediation she had requested and filed an administrative complaint challenging the adequacy of the IEP. She sought declaratory relief and \"reimbursement for private tuition and associated costs ('tuition reimbursement') arising from [A.D.]'s private placements for the [previous] school year and the [upcoming] school year.\" App. 45. Rena C. received a tuition bill from Delaware Valley on the same day she filed her administrative complaint. The invoice shows two separate educational expenses: $36,300 for tuition and $10,800 for one-on-one educational support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 18, 2014, Colonial sent Rena C. what it contends was a ten-day offer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i)(I)-(III). In this letter, Colonial offered \"to pay private school tuition and transportation for Parent's unilateral placement at Delaware Valley Friends School.\" App. 49. Rena C. did not respond to this letter for over a month. She eventually claimed that it did not constitute a valid offer because it lacked school board approval, and that it was inadequate for failing to address attorney's fees or pendency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties attempted negotiation, but eventually proceeded to an administrative hearing. After the first session of the hearing concluded, the parties participated in mediation with the assistance of a secondary\n   administrative hearing officer. Subsequently, the parties stipulated to a consent order entered by an administrative hearing officer providing for tuition, one-on-one instructional support, transportation reimbursement, and pendency at Delaware Valley. The order did not include attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rena C. filed a complaint in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking approximately $70,000 in attorney's fees under the IDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Colonial counterclaimed for attorney's fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(B)(i)(II) and (III), alleging that Rena C. continued to litigate after the litigation had become frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, thereby needlessly increasing the cost of litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court granted Rena C.'s motion for summary judgment on her claim for attorney's fees, but awarded her only $7,438.00. This figure included only those attorney's fees accrued before the school district made its ten-day offer. She was not awarded any fees accrued after the school district made its ten-day offer because the court found that she did not receive more favorable relief during the subsequent proceedings, and that she was not substantially justified in rejecting the offer. The District Court granted in part and denied in part Colonial's motion for summary judgment, rejecting its argument that the school district was a prevailing party, but agreeing that Rena C. was not entitled to fees for post-offer work. The District Court rejected Colonial's counterclaim because Colonial was not the prevailing party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court exercised jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1343.

We apply plenary review to legal questions related to the interpretation of ten-day offers and to questions of construction regarding such offers under the IDEA. This standard is consistent with this Court's standard of review for rulings on attorney's fees, and with its standard of review for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 offers of judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.R. v.

First, she argues that Colonial did not make a valid offer of settlement pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i). We conclude that it did. Second, she argues that she received more favorable relief in the administrative order than Colonial had included in the ten-day offer. We conclude that she did not. Third, she argues that she was substantially justified in rejecting the offer. We agree. Fourth, she argues that she\n   was entitled to fees under the ADA and \u00a7 504 even if she was precluded under the IDEA, and fifth, she argues that she was separately entitled to fees for her defense of Colonial's counterclaim. We decline to reach these issues. Because the IDEA did not preclude fees, we need not address these alternative statutory arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A)\n   <em>\n    Colonial School District made a valid offer of settlement pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rena C. argues that Colonial did not make a valid ten-day offer because the school board had not yet approved it. Neither Pennsylvania law nor the IDEA, however, required Colonial to secure school board approval prior to extending a ten-day offer of settlement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pennsylvania law requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the members of a board of school directors to take any action,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[c]reating or increasing any indebtedness\" or \"[e]ntering into contracts of any kind, including contracts for the purchase of fuel or any supplies, where the amount involved exceeds one hundred dollars ($100).\" 24 P.S. \u00a7 5-508. This state statute might require school board approval before a completed settlement agreement for more than one hundred dollars can be enforced, but the text of the provision lacks any indication that it prohibits school boards from doing what Colonial did here: authorizing an agent, such as an attorney, to negotiate a contract on its behalf. And Rena C. points to no cases applying \u00a7 5-508 to IDEA ten-day offers. On its face,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i) requires only that the ten-day offer be a \"written offer of settlement.\" Colonial's offer to Rena C. was exactly that-an offer of settlement in writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The IDEA has been interpreted to promote the speedy resolution of disputes between parents and school districts.\n   <em>\n    El Paso Independent Sch. Dist. v.

Interpreting \u00a7 5-508 to require school board approval before a ten-day offer could be valid under the IDEA would undermine the IDEA's goal of promoting speedy resolutions of placement disputes. The broad terms of the IDEA provide a framework that is flexible enough to apply to a multitude of different jurisdictions and school districts, each with its own policies and procedures. The clear wording of the IDEA requires only a \"written offer of settlement\" and \u00a7 5-508 does not provide a basis for requiring Colonial to have done more in order to make a valid ten-day offer satisfying the IDEA. We therefore hold that Colonial made a valid ten-day offer under the IDEA to Rena C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   B)\n   <em>\n    Rena C. did not receive more favorable relief in the administrative officer's order than she had been offered in Colonial's ten-day offer.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The IDEA provides for an award of reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child with a disability.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(B)(i)(I). However, a parent may not receive attorney's fees \"for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent\" if: (1) the offer is made more than ten days before the proceeding begins; (2) the offer is not accepted within ten days; and (3) the court or administrative hearing officer finds that the relief finally obtained by the parents is not more favorable to the parents than the offer of settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(D)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Colonial provided the settlement offer more than ten days before the proceeding began. Rena C. never sent any response, thereby rejecting the offer. The District Court found that the relief ultimately obtained by Rena C. was not more favorable\n   than the settlement offer. We agree, finding that the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(3)(D)(i) bar applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rena C.'s administrative complaint requested two items of relief. First, she sought \"reimbursement for private tuition and associated costs (tuition reimbursement)\" for two school years. App. 43. Second, she requested declaratory relief in the form of an adjudication that her child's rights under the IDEA, the ADA, and \u00a7 504 had been violated. In its ten-day offer, Colonial offered \"to pay private school tuition and transportation for Parent's unilateral placement at Delaware Valley Friends School.\" App. 49. The administrative officer's order provided for tuition, one-on-one instructional support, transportation reimbursement, and pendency at Delaware Valley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rena C. argues that the explicit inclusion of one-on-one instruction and pendency rendered the final order more favorable than the ten-day offer. This is incorrect because the terms of the ten-day offer already included these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    1. Colonial's offer to pay tuition included the cost of one-on-one instruction.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the administrative officer's order explicitly indicated that one-on-one instruction was included (while the ten-day offer did not), the enumeration of this item did not constitute more favorable relief. The District Court correctly concluded that Colonial's offer to pay tuition necessarily included an offer to pay for one-on-one instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rena C.'s due process complaint sought \"reimbursement for private tuition and associated costs ('tuition reimbursement') arising from [student's] private placements for the 2013-2014 school year and the 2014-2015 school year.\" App. 45. On the same day that she filed her complaint, Delaware Valley sent an invoice to Rena C for the \"2014-2015 Tuition for A.D.\" containing two line items: $36,300 for tuition and $10,800 for \"Language Arts One-on-One\" for a total due of $47,100. Rena C. did not share this invoice with Colonial before the ten-day offer letter was sent. The ten-day offer letter offered \"private school tuition and transportation.\" App. 49. The District Court correctly concluded that Colonial offered to pay the tuition bill from Delaware Valley for the 2014-2015 school year, which necessarily included the one-on-one instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Colonial cannot be penalized for not specifically including the cost of one-on-one instruction when Rena C. never informed Colonial that this charge was annotated separately as part of Delaware Valley's tuition invoice. Merriam-Webster defines \"tuition\" as \"the price of or payment for instruction.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary,\n   </em>\n   2461 (1993). The Random House Dictionary defines tuition as \"the charge or fee for instruction as at a private school or a college or university.\"\n   <em>\n    Random House Dictionary of the English Language\n   </em>\n   , 2034 (2d Ed. 1987). Based on the language contained in Rena C.'s complaint and the dictionary definitions, Colonial's offer to pay \"private school tuition\" included the cost of one-on-one instruction. When the hearing officer ordered Colonial to \"pay private school tuition\" and specified that tuition included one-on-one instruction, the hearing officer did not provide greater relief than Colonial's ten-day offer to \"pay private school tuition.\" The hearing officer simply knew the additional fact that the one-on-one instruction was a separately annotated cost in the bill for tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Rena C. argues that it was ambiguous whether one-on-one instruction was included in Colonial's offer and that\n   this ambiguity should have been construed against Colonial, both because Colonial was the drafter, and because Colonial was the moving party at the summary judgment stage. Rena C. is correct that any ambiguity would have been construed against Colonial had she agreed to the offer and then Colonial refused to pay. However, this is not a contract enforcement case. Rena C. cannot inject ambiguity into a clear offer to pay private school tuition by withholding information about the particular billing conventions of the private school. Had Rena C. been unsure whether Colonial's offer included the cost of one-on-one instruction, she could have clarified with them. Unlike Rule 68 offers of judgment, IDEA ten-day offers are not required to be non-negotiable. Ten-day offers may be clarified by parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Beauchamp v. Anaheim Union High Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4176435\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/816/1216/#p1223\">\n    816 F.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1223 (9th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Additionally, Rena C.'s contention that the District Court erred in applying the summary judgment standard by not resolving the issue of whether one-on-one instruction was included in tuition in Rena C.'s favor fails. Whether \"tuition\" in the ten-day offer included the cost of one-on-one-instruction is a legal question regarding the construction of the offer, not a factual question that should be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2. Colonial's offer to pay tuition at a private school placement would have created pendency at the private school and triggered the student's \"stay-put\" rights at the private school.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pendency refers to a student's rights under the IDEA to \"stay-put\" in the current educational placement. The \"stay-put\" provision requires that \"during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section, unless the State or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree, the child shall remain in the then-current educational placement of the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). This requires the school district to continue to pay for the \"then-current educational placement\" during the pendency of proceedings resolving placement disputes.\n   <em>\n    Drinker by Drinker v.

Rena C. contends that this sentence provided more favorable relief than ten-day offer. Colonial contends that although the ten-day offer letter did not specifically state that pendency would attach at Delaware Valley, pendency would have attached had Rena C. accepted their offer because Delaware Valley would have automatically become A.D.'s \"then-current placement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This issue turns on whether Rena C.'s acceptance of the ten-day offer would have made Delaware Valley A.D.'s \"then-current educational placement,\" vesting her with \"stay-put\" rights should any dispute over placement arise in the future. This Court has held that \"[b]ecause [then-current] connotes preservation of the status quo, it refers to the operative placement actually functioning at the time the dispute first arises.\"\n   <em>\n    Drinker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"94495\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/78/859/#p865\">\n    78 F.3d at 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

This\n   argument ignores the fact that relief granted at an administrative hearing creates the condition necessary for parents to seek attorney's fees. Without pursuing the administrative hearing, a parent cannot achieve the prevailing party status necessary to claim attorney's fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . ;\n   <em>\n    P.N. v.

The District Court correctly disposed of this argument by recognizing that had Rena C. accepted the ten-day offer, the parties would have created a non-judicially sanctioned agreement, and neither party would be considered the prevailing party, so Rena C. would have no path to recover attorney's fees. Attorney's fees are therefore relevant to a ten-day offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The letter stated: \"This offer does not imply that the School District acknowledges any liability in this matter whatsoever; rather, it is an attempt to achieve an amicable resolution. This offer is also being made in order to further limit the School District's possible prevailing party attorney fee liability.\" App. 49. The District Court held that, because \"Colonial explained it was making the offer to 'further limit' exposure to attorney's fees, [it] implicitly acknolwedg[ed] it would pay attorney's fees incurred to date.\" App. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In interpreting this offer, we must focus on its plain language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lima v.

The plain language does not indicate that Colonial offered to pay any amount of attorney's fees, but rather that it wished to avoid them. The District Court erred because the language of the offer makes clear that Colonial believed its liability for attorney's fees would only arise if Rena C. were the prevailing party. Had Rena C. accepted the offer, she would not be the prevailing party. For this reason, the District Court erred in concluding that the ten-day offer letter included attorney's fees. Had Colonial intended to include attorney's fees in its offer, it had the burden to state that the offer included payment of attorney's fees accrued up until that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837028\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/324/#p331\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that the district court erred in concluding that Rule 68 offer of judgment included attorney's fees because the offer \"did not explicitly include attorney's fees or costs).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    3.

The ten-day offer provision in the IDEA facilitates efficient resolutions of disputes between parents and school districts over placement and seeks to obviate the need for a due process hearing.

Thus, we need not reach the issue of whether a good faith argument rooted in unsettled law can qualify as substantial justification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Additionally, the District Court erred in considering that after the ten-day offer had lapsed, Colonial made a separate, explicit offer to pay reasonable attorney's fees because that evidence is extrinsic and cannot be used to interpret the offer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-72\">\n   GREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   I agree that Rena C. was substantially justified in rejecting Colonial's offer because the offer did not include the payment of attorney's fees, and I join the majority opinion in full. I write separately to briefly discuss the difficulties certain kinds of ten-day offers can create for school districts, parents, and, ultimately, courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This case is illustrative of those difficulties because it requires us to interpret what is a short and, in my view, amorphous offer. The entire substance of the offer is contained in two sentences: \"This offer is also being made in order to further limit the School District's possible prevailing party attorney fee attorney liability. The School District offers to pay private school tuition and transportation for Parent's unilateral placement at Delaware Valley Friends School ('DVFS').\" JA 49. Colonial asked this Court to conclude that the offer's two sentences contained a number of implicit terms: pendency at DVFS and reimbursement for both one-one-one language arts instruction and attorney's fees. As the majority opinion explains, we agreed with Colonial regarding pendency and one-on-one instruction, but could not conclude that the terms of the offer implied that Colonial would pay the attorney's fees Rena C. had incurred up to that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   I found the question regarding one-on-one instruction to be particularly challenging, both because the question of what falls within the ambit of tuition seems to me vague and indeterminate, and because the record here reveals little about the nature of the one-on-one services A.D. receives at DVFS. It merely indicates that DVFS provides her with a one-on-one instructor for the subject of language arts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In deciding to join the majority opinion's conclusion that Colonial's offer to pay \"private school tuition\" included an offer to pay for this one-on-one instruction, I found\n   it significant that Colonial's offer was unqualified. It did not, for example, say \"base tuition\" or \"tuition only and no other cost or fee.\" As the majority opinion also notes, Colonial did not know that one-on-one instruction would be listed separately on the DVFS tuition invoice, so it had no reason to offer it expressly. Ultimately, I concluded that the record, though certainly far from comprehensive, provides enough information for us to infer confidently that the one-on-one instruction A.D. receives at DVFS is the kind of substantive curricular service that a school district like Colonial would generally consider to be within the ambit of a \"tuition\" payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It bears emphasis, however, that the majority opinion takes no position on whether countless other types of supplementary educational services would be included in an offer to pay \"tuition.\" The opinion does not answer, for example, the question of whether a one-on-one aide who accompanies a student for assistance throughout the school day, but does not themself provide instruction, would be included. Nor does it determine whether physical therapy services, speech and language therapy services, or occupational therapy services would be included. Given the scarcity of information in the record here, I do not think this Court is well-positioned to provide much guidance regarding these questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I therefore would caution parties not to needlessly proceed to federal court based on the belief that our opinion here dictates the outcome in some future case involving some other kind of educational service or instruction. Instead, I would suggest that parties in the future be clear and specific when crafting and discussing ten-day offers. School districts should be precise about what they are offering. Parents should be forthcoming about the services they are seeking or anticipate receiving for their children. And both school districts and parents should communicate throughout this process. As the majority opinion correctly notes, ten-day offers need not be non-negotiable. I understand that these cases can be deeply personal, and I am under no illusion that parties will always be on the best of terms, but litigants must prioritize the children at the heart of these disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A protracted IDEA dispute should result from a legitimate disagreement about the needs of the student, not conflicting interpretations regarding the wording of a settlement offer. Indeed, ten-day offers should foster discussion, which hopefully will often lead to the prompt resolution of IDEA disputes without the need for due process hearings or litigation. This purpose is not served, however, when parties treat terse or inexact offers as non-negotiable. In those circumstances, the parties potentially prolong the dispute unnecessarily, for they risk losing sight of what is most important: ensuring that the child gets the educational services needed. Had the parties in this case communicated more effectively, the dispute very well could have been resolved far earlier and with the expenditure of fewer public funds. My hope is that parties in these types of actions shall, in the future, heed this caveat.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
