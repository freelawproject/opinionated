A jury in Grant County, Indiana, decided that the aggravating circumstance of Laux's crime-that he committed murder during a burglary-outweighed the primary mitigating circumstance-that he had no criminal history. The jury recommended a sentence of life without parole, which the state trial judge imposed. The Indiana state courts affirmed Laux's convictions and sentence. After a post-conviction hearing, they also rejected the claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2014, Laux filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court denied the petition. On appeal, Laux contends that his trial counsel was ineffective by not fully investigating and presenting all of the available mitigating evidence about Laux's childhood that surfaced at his 2011 post-conviction hearing. If his trial counsel had presented all of these details in 2002, Laux argues, there is a reasonable chance that the jury would not have recommended a sentence of life without parole. We affirm the judgment of the district court. The state courts' conclusion that Laux received effective assistance of counsel was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Murder Trial and Penalty Phase\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Laux's state public defender said at the outset of his post-conviction proceeding, \"there is really no doubt about who killed Heidi Laux. And this trial\"-the subject of Fred Laux's ineffective assistance claims here-\"was all about what punishment Mr. Laux was set to receive\" for what he did to his ex-wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After eleven years of marriage and a period of separation, the couple divorced in November 2001. Distraught by the divorce, and increasingly disturbed by the prospect that Heidi had found a new partner, Laux made a romantic gesture toward Heidi on\n   Valentine's Day in 2002. He was rebuffed. Heidi and Laux, along with their two daughters, attended a social event the next evening where \"Laux became increasingly suspicious that Heidi was involved with a co-worker.\"\n   <em>\n    Laux v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9025152\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/821/816/#p817\">\n    821 N.E.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (Ind. 2005) (\n   <em>\n    Laux I\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Laux returned home and put his daughters to bed, but remained fixated on Heidi's new life without him. The Indiana Supreme Court explained what happened next:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 3 a.m. the following morning, Laux awoke and decided to \"fix\" Heidi. He dressed in two pairs of sweatpants, a sweatshirt, gloves, a hat, and a ski mask. He collected a flashlight and a crowbar and ran to Heidi's house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon arrival, Laux used the crowbar to pry open a coal chute and gain entrance to Heidi's house. He entered the basement through the chute and made his way upstairs. Laux proceeded to Heidi's bedroom, struck her three times with the crowbar, strangled her, and left. She died from her injuries within twenty minutes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The State charged Laux with murder, felony murder, and burglary resulting in bodily injury. It later requested a sentence of life in prison without parole. After a three-day trial, the jury found Laux guilty on all counts and recommended life in prison without parole. The trial court merged Laux's murder and felony murder convictions and sentenced him to life in prison without parole for the murder and a consecutive term of twenty years for the burglary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9025152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/821/816/#p817\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9025152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/821/816/#p817\">\n    at 817-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted). Because Laux contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to ward off a life sentence, we focus on the penalty stage of his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In Indiana, \"life without parole is imposed under the same standards and is subject to the same requirements\" as imposing the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Ajabu v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830118\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/693/921/#p936\">\n    693 N.E.2d 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936 (Ind. 1998). This meant that with no dispute as to guilt, Laux's trial came down to the penalty phase where the jury considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that surrounded the crime. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-50-2-9\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-50-2-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (c), (d). By statute, if a jury finds that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances and thus decides to recommend life without parole, its recommendation must be accepted by the trial judge at sentencing. \u00a7 35-50-2-9(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the penalty phase of his trial, Laux's jury heard evidence that he broke in to Heidi's house that night intending to beat her with his crowbar and kill her, and possibly also to rape her. This undisputed evidence was the basis for Laux's burglary conviction, which in turn was the aggravating circumstance under \u00a7 35-50-2-9(b)(1)(B) for his murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As for mitigating circumstances, Laux qualified for only one of the seven circumstances specified by statute-no prior criminal conduct. \u00a7 35-50-2-9(c)(1). The law also permitted the jury to weigh any \"other circumstances appropriate for consideration.\" \u00a7 35-50-2-9(c)(8). Laux's trial counsel used this opportunity to present him as a devoted father and devout Catholic of above-average intelligence who, in the words of a psychiatrist, had been overtaken by a \"severe mental disease at the time of the offense\" (i.e., \"major depression\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Laux was found to be sane at the time of the offense, his mental condition did not qualify as one of the express mitigating circumstances under the law. See \u00a7 35-50-2-9(c)(6). Jurors heard from two experts about Laux's episode of depression and related medications. These\n   experts formally testified as the State's witnesses, though they had been appointed by the trial court at the behest of Laux's trial lawyer, who reviewed their written reports ahead of their testimony. Both Dr. Parker (a psychiatrist) and Dr. Atkinson (a psychologist) had interviewed Laux and studied his personal history and mental health. Though their diagnoses differed somewhat, both experts rejected the idea that Laux's mental-health struggles caused him to commit the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Laux's lawyer called as a witness a priest who had known Laux for over fifteen years, since Laux had been a student at Purdue University. In the priest's judgment, Laux was a particularly devoted Catholic. The priest also shared that because Laux was so distraught after the police came to inform him of Heidi's death, the priest had to inform Laux's young daughters about their mother's murder. After the priest's testimony, Laux's lawyer called a Catholic school teacher who had one of Laux's young daughters in her class. She reported that Laux was a devoted father and active in their parish. Finally, Laux himself took the stand to express his remorse and to (try to) explain his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his closing statement in the penalty phase, Laux's trial lawyer stressed that Laux had no history at all of violent behavior or criminal activity. His lawyer repeated that even if it did not legally amount to a defense, Laux had a \"severe mental disease\" according to the experts. \"I understand the State wants you to ignore that,\" his lawyer continued, \"but that's a fact, that's what was said by the doctors and those are doctors ... that's not my diagnosis.\" \"[D]on't just totally discount that and throw that in the trash. That's the whole reason we did this trial was to get that story before you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Laux's lawyer summed up by reminding the jurors that Laux \"had something go seriously, tragically wrong with his thinking that night ... all I'm asking you to do is weigh that as a [factor in] mitigation [regarding] ... whether he should go to jail for the rest of his life. You can't discount that and say it didn't happen.\" The jury recommended life without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Post-trial Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    State Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Direct Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Laux appealed his life-without-parole sentence directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, which has jurisdiction over such appeals.

He first raised those arguments in the post-conviction petition he filed in 2005 and later amended in 2011. See\n   <em>\n    Laux v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7111788\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/985/739/#p743\">\n    985 N.E.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 743-44, 743 n.1 (Ind. App. 2013) (\n   <em>\n    Laux II\n   </em>\n   ). To develop a record for these claims nine years after trial, the state public defender representing Laux called his trial lawyer, his appellate lawyer, his sister, Dr. Parker (the psychiatrist), a juror, and an acquaintance who once worked for Laux at a retail store. Though Laux raised a host of issues in his state post-conviction proceedings, he has focused our attention in this appeal on just one issue: whether his trial lawyer provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate fully and present mitigating evidence with respect to his childhood and family history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On this score, the state public defender elicited the following evidence at the post-conviction hearing. Laux's trial lawyer had about ten years of legal experience at the time, but he had never before served as lead counsel on a murder case as of the fall of 2002. As part of the lawyer's preparation, he reviewed the Indiana Public Defender Council's life-without-parole materials since, in his recollection, \"I don't think\" a trial like Laux's \"had been something that anyone [around] here had done before.\" He prepared for the penalty phase of Laux's trial as he had for other cases, by speaking to Laux himself \"about his history and his family and who he thought ... would be beneficial\" to call as a witness in mitigation. Laux's lawyer could not remember clearly whether he had spoken to Laux's family members, but thought he had at least seen some correspondence from Laux's sister. Laux's lawyer also requested court-ordered psychological examinations for his client, and he reviewed the resulting written reports before examining Dr. Parker and Dr. Atkinson at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although Dr. Atkinson had passed away between Laux's trial in 2002 and his post-conviction hearing in 2011, her pre-trial report was discussed at length in the post-conviction hearing. Dr. Atkinson had reported before trial that Laux's father had been an alcoholic whose drinking had caused financial problems for the family. Laux's mother had been present but emotionally distant from the children; she was later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after Laux and his three sisters had reached adulthood. Dr. Atkinson repeated Laux's characterization of his relationship with his siblings by saying \"he and his sisters were close and 'clung' together because of the lack of support and interest from the parents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Laux's sister Paula added more details to this story when she testified at the post-conviction hearing in 2011. Paula reported that \"money was real tight growing up\" because of their father's drinking and spending habits. Laux's father would often be nude around the house, and he took his children along when he went to see R-rated and even X-rated movies. Paula also testified that their mother had gotten a job at a canning factory when the children were adolescents, but by 1991 when Laux was an adult, her paranoia had grown worse and culminated in hospitalization and her schizophrenia diagnosis. The parents' marriage was far from a happy one, but it did not become physically abusive. When the two would fight, their daughters would \"wait to see if it got violent. And it never did.\" Though Paula admitted that she did not remember a lot about her childhood, and speculated that she had \"blocked a lot of it out,\" she had no opportunity to share these details at Laux's trial because no one from his defense team had ever interviewed her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Parker testified last, and much of his testimony was devoted to criticizing the diagnosis Dr. Atkinson had presented at trial: that Laux suffered from anti-social personality disorder. Though Dr. Parker had not met with Laux since his pre-trial interview almost a decade before, he described Laux as having \"a very limited range of emotion.\" Dr. Parker opined at length that Dr. Atkinson had misinterpreted Laux's cold, distant demeanor as a lack of remorse, resulting in a misdiagnosis. On this point, post-conviction counsel and Dr. Parker had the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q. Earlier you stated the lack of remorse could have other alternative explanations besides being anti-social since in your opinion, Mr. Laux is not anti-social, what are those?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. Mr. Laux comes from a dysfunctional family. His father was an alcoholic throughout his upbringing. His mother ... had pre-morbid schizophrenia [.] ... So if he grew up in a family where the display of emotion was not encouraged, was not shown, was not modeled, and it was not welcome as far as I can tell, he reacted as many first children of alcoholics do by working very hard and trying to be as successful as possible[.] ... So I think the reserve, the difficulty with emotions, has a better explanation in his family, and the dynamics of that family, than in calling it a lack of remorse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dr. Parker acknowledged, though, that when he analyzed Laux before trial, he knew Laux's mother had suffered from late-onset mental illness. Dr. Parker also did not retreat from his own diagnosis-that Laux was depressed, but the murder was not related to his depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The state trial court denied post-conviction relief in a thorough order. Supp. App. 392-402. After discussing the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard, the post-conviction judge explained point by point why none of Laux's claims of ineffective assistance merited relief. The court briefly described the penalty phase and noted that Laux's one undisputed mitigating circumstance (no criminal history) was not overlooked. The mitigating evidence advanced at the post-conviction stage, the judge concluded, would also not have made a difference to the Indiana Supreme Court when it weighed Laux's sentence on direct review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Indiana Court of Appeals-whose decision we review here under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) -affirmed the post-conviction court in all respects.\n   <em>\n    Laux II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7111788\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/985/739/#p743\">\n    985 N.E.2d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If a state were to assign pre-determined weights to different kinds of mitigating evidence, that might be problematic as well, given that other Supreme Court decisions stress the need for individualized determinations in imposing serious punishments.
