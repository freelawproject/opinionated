Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and under California's Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (\"anti-SLAPP\") statute. The district court denied both motions, and Defendants appeal the denial of the anti-SLAPP motion. We conclude that the district court did not err by reviewing Defendants' motion using a Rule 12(b)(6) standard and did not err by denying Defendants' anti-SLAPP motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the district court, Defendants the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), BioMax Procument Services LLC (BioMax), Daleiden, and Lopez moved to strike Plaintiffs' claims under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 425.16, commonly known as the anti-SLAPP law. On their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs had not alleged enough factual content to state the necessary elements for each of their named claims. On their motion based on the anti-SLAPP law, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs' lawsuit is an attempt to silence and punish CMP and other Defendants for gathering information and publishing their findings. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs' state law claims arise out of their undercover investigative journalism, which falls within the scope of the anti-SLAPP statute. They further argued that Plaintiffs did not have a reasonable probability of prevailing on any of their state law claims because Defendants were entitled to \"judgment as a matter of law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The district court denied both Defendants' motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP law and their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Because Defendants appeal only denial of their anti-SLAPP motion, we address only that issue on this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In ruling on and denying Defendants' motion to strike, the district court assumed that Plaintiffs' lawsuit arose from acts in furtherance of Defendants' rights to free speech, but found that Plaintiffs showed a probability of succeeding on the merits. To succeed on their anti-SLAPP motion, Defendants had to show both that their acts arose from behavior aimed at furthering their First Amendment speech rights, and also that Plaintiffs had shown no probability of success on their claims. Because Defendants failed to prevail on\n   the second element, they lost their anti-SLAPP motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court reasoned that \"defendants repeat the\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   arguments they made on their motions to dismiss,\" and that Defendants made no evidentiary-based argument to undermine Plaintiffs' probability of success other than the declaration from Daleiden. Daleiden's declaration only discusses his work as an investigative journalist. The district court said that because Defendants attacked \"pleading deficiencies\" and argued that Defendants were entitled to \"judgment as a matter of law,\" it limited its review to the adequacy of Plaintiffs' pleadings. The district court therefore denied Defendants' motion to strike for the same reasons it had denied Defendants' motion to dismiss. The district court also rejected the evidentiary-based arguments Defendants made for the first time in their Reply brief supporting their motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court found that Merritt's separate motion to strike raised two evidence-based arguments: (1) that the location of the lunch meetings with Drs. Nucatola and Gatter preclude a finding that the communications in those meetings were \"confidential\" and (2) that Merritt is exempt from liability for violations of California Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 632 and 634 because she reasonably believed that Plaintiffs were committing crimes of violence against unborn babies. The district court concluded that there were questions of fact regarding whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy at the lunch meetings with Drs. Nucatola and Gatter. The district court also concluded that Merritt's exemption defense was an affirmative defense and that the parties' competing citations to Merritt's deposition demonstrated that there was a question of fact as to the reasonableness of her beliefs. The district court denied Merritt's anti-SLAPP motion.

Plaintiffs argue that for Defendants to succeed on their anti-SLAPP motion, Defendants had to show that Plaintiffs did not allege a legally sufficient claim\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   that Plaintiffs did not produce evidence showing a probability that Plaintiffs would prevail. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants' anti-SLAPP motion challenged the legal sufficiency of Plaintiffs' complaint and was correctly denied on those grounds, using the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) standard.

The\n   <em>\n    Metabolife\n   </em>\n   court concluded that an automatic stay on discovery would conflict with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, and was inapplicable in federal court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 846 (\"the discovery-limiting aspects of \u00a7 425.16(f) and (g) collide with the discovery-allowing aspect of Rule 56\" and therefore, \u00a7 425.16(f) and (g) could not apply in federal court.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Z.F. v. Ripon Unified School District\n   </em>\n   , a non-precedential unpublished opinion, we stated: \"If a defendant makes an anti-SLAPP motion to strike founded on purely legal arguments, then the analysis is made under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 and 12 standards; if it is a factual challenge, then the motion must be treated as though it were a motion for summary judgment and discovery must be permitted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20Fed.%20Appx.%20239\">\n    482 Fed.Appx. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (9th Cir. 2012). Although we are not bound by\n   <em>\n    Z.F.\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that its reasoning is persuasive and we hereby adopt it. In order to prevent the collision of California state procedural rules with federal procedural rules, we will review anti-SLAPP motions to strike under different standards depending on the motion's basis. Our interpretation eliminates conflicts between California's anti-SLAPP law's procedural provisions and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=482%20Fed.%20Appx.%20239\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Taken together,\n   <em>\n    Metabolife\n   </em>\n   and our ruling today adopting the rule of\n   <em>\n    Z.F.\n   </em>\n   support the idea that if Defendants' anti-SLAPP motion was based on legal deficiencies, Plaintiffs were not required to present prima facie evidence supporting Plaintiffs' claims. Requiring a presentation of evidence without accompanying discovery would improperly\n   transform the motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP law into a motion for summary judgment without providing any of the procedural safeguards that have been firmly established by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That result would effectively allow the state anti-SLAPP rules to usurp the federal rules. We could not properly allow such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before the district court, Defendants agreed that an anti-SLAPP motion \"may be premised on legal deficiencies inherent in the plaintiff's claim, analogous to a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).\" \"If a defendant makes a special motion to strike based on alleged deficiencies in the plaintiff's complaint, the motion must be treated in the same manner as a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) except that the attorney's fee provision of \u00a7 425.16(c) applies.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Home Shopping Network, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11585387\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/57/973/#p980\">\n    57 F.Supp.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 983 (C.D. Cal. 1999). We agree with the reasoning and result in the district court's\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   decision. Defendants' Motion to Strike explicitly incorporated by reference the arguments in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. Defendants must have understood that the district court would be conducting a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis and supported their motion with arguments regarding Plaintiffs' pleading. Plaintiffs responded in kind, defending the legal sufficiency of their pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In their reply before the district court, Defendants argued for the first time that Plaintiffs had not met their burden of presenting evidence showing that their claims have minimal merit. Although we have never ruled on this issue, some district courts have accepted Defendants' view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carr v. Asset Acceptance, LLC.\n   </em>\n   No. CV F 11-0890 LJO GSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%203568338\">\n    2011 WL 3568338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2011) (\"piercing\" the pleadings and requiring an evidentiary showing at the pleading stage to survive an anti-SLAPP motion). Conversely, some other district courts have gone the opposite way, rejecting Defendants' view that Plaintiffs had to submit evidence showing the merit of their claims when the challenge was only as to the sufficiency of the pleadings. In any event, having now considered this issue in-depth, and having carefully reviewed the record, we reject Defendants' view. In defending against an anti-SLAPP motion, if the defendants have urged only insufficiency of pleadings, then the plaintiff can properly respond merely by showing sufficiency of pleadings, and there's no requirement for a plaintiff to submit evidence to oppose contrary evidence that was never presented by defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Echoing the point we made earlier in adopting the rule of\n   <em>\n    Z.F.\n   </em>\n   , we hold that, on the one hand, when an anti-SLAPP motion to strike challenges only the legal sufficiency of a claim, a district court should apply the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) standard and consider whether a claim is properly stated. And, on the other hand, when an anti-SLAPP motion to strike challenges the factual sufficiency of a claim, then the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 standard will apply. But in such a case, discovery must be allowed, with opportunities to supplement evidence based on the factual challenges, before any decision is made by the court. A contrary reading of these anti-SLAPP provisions would lead to the stark collision of the state rules of procedure with the governing Federal Rules of Civil Procedure while in a federal district court. In this context, if there is a contest between a state procedural rule and the federal rules, the federal rules of procedure will prevail.\n   <em>\n    Hanna v.
