The district court adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation, but additionally concluded that even if the defense had not been waived, venue in the Eastern District of Texas would still be proper. In doing so, it explained that \"a domestic corporation resides in the state of its incorporation and if that state contains more than one judicial district, the corporate defendant resides in each such judicial district for venue purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Diem LLC v.

That\n   <em>\n    Fourco\n   </em>\n   said \"state of incorporation only\" and not \"district within the state of incorporation only\" does not imply that venue is thereby proper in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   district within the state of incorporation. The better reading of\n   <em>\n    Fourco\n   </em>\n   is that the Court simply did not address the corporate venue at the district level of granularity, and set a\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   but not necessarily\n   <em>\n    sufficient\n   </em>\n   condition for corporate residence for venue under \u00a7 1400(b).

Respondents note, for example, that defendants do not always have principal offices or other indicia of inhabitance in any location in the state in which they incorporate or may have facilities in more than one district. This raises the question: \"Which single judicial district in a multi-district state is the proper judicial district for purposes of venue under \u00a7 1400(b) in an infringement suit against a corporate defendant?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The answer depends on whether the corporate defendant maintains a principal place of business in the state. If so, the judicial district where the principal place of business is located would be the proper venue under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Galveston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8298940\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/151/496/#p504\">\n    151 U.S. at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8298940\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/151/496/#p504\">\n    14 S.Ct. 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that corporate inhabitance is determined \"by the principal offices of the corporation, where its books are kept and its corporate business is transacted\"); 8 Fletcher Cyc. Corp. \u00a7 4030.10 (Sept. 2017) (\"[T]he Supreme Court has held that a corporation's principal place of business, for diversity jurisdiction purposes, is its nerve center. This means the place where a corporation's officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities. This should normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters, provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, and not simply an office where the corporation holds its board meetings, for example, attended by directors and officers who have traveled there for the occasion.\" (citations omitted) ). We note that the \"principal place of business,\" as it relates to the \"resides\" prong of \u00a7 1400(b), is to be distinguished from the \"regular and established place of business\" prong of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p93\">\n    559 U.S. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p93\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (distinguishing \"principal place of business\" from \"general business activities\" for purposes of diversity jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    Cray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266925\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1355/\">\n    871 F.3d at 1362-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting considerations for determining the \"regular and established place of business\" of the defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   If the corporation does not maintain its principal place of business within the state in which it is incorporated-yet for purposes of venue is considered to be a resident of the state in which it is incorporated,\n   <em>\n    TC Heartland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604310\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1514/#p1521\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1521 -then the natural default is to deem it to reside in the district in which its registered office, as recorded in its corporate filings, is located,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562194\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/145/444/\">\n    145 U.S. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562194\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/145/444/\">\n    12 S.Ct. 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A universally recognized foundational requirement of corporate formation\n   is the designation of a registered office that will serve as a physical presence within the state of the newly formed corporation.
