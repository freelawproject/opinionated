We respectfully disagree.

Appellant Kevin Rotkiske accumulated credit card debt between 2003 and 2005, which his bank referred to Klemm &amp; Associates (Klemm) for collection. Klemm sued for payment in March 2008 and attempted service at an address where Rotkiske no longer lived, but eventually withdrew its suit when it was unable to locate him. Klemm tried again in January 2009, refiling its suit and attempting service at the same address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unbeknownst to Rotkiske, somebody at that residence accepted service on his behalf, and Klemm obtained a default judgment for around $1,500. Rotkiske discovered the judgment when he applied for a mortgage in September 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 29, 2015, Rotkiske sued Klemm and several associated individuals and entities asserting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the above-described collection efforts violated the FDCPA. Defendants moved to dismiss Rotkiske's FDCPA claim as untimely and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania agreed. The District Court rejected Rotkiske's argument that the Act's statute of limitations incorporates a discovery rule which \"delays the beginning of a limitations period until the plaintiff knew of or should have known of his injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Rotkiske v. Klemm\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-3638,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201021140\">\n    2016 WL 1021140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2016).

The Court also rejected Rotkiske's request for equitable tolling as duplicative of his discovery rule argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rotkiske timely appealed the judgment of the District Court and a panel of this Court heard oral argument on January 18, 2017. Prior to issuing an opinion and judgment, on September 7, 2017, the Court sua sponte ordered rehearing en banc, and argument was held on February 21, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Statutory interpretation, as we always say, begins with the text.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Ross v.

Likewise, when Congress specifies that the \"date on which the violation occurs\" starts the limitations period, the occurrence rule plainly applies. Accordingly, we hold that \u00a7 1692k(d) 's one-year limitations period begins to run when a would-be defendant violates the FDCPA, not when a potential plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Congress does not, of course, always express statutes of limitations so directly. Instead of expressly enacting an occurrence or a discovery rule, Congress often articulates statutes of limitations in terms somewhere between those two poles. Some statutes of limitations begin when a \"claim first accrue[s].\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gabelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/#p448\">\n    568 U.S. at 447-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407574\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/442/#p448\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (interpreting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202462\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Others start when the \"cause of action arises\" or when \"liability arises.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McMahon v.

And we have little doubt that an exhaustive search would yield still other variations-some subtle, some stark. This appeal does not implicate the less-determinate language of those statutes, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Despite the \"occurrence\" language of the FDCPA, Rotkiske insists that the discovery rule applies. His argument relies on the text of the FDCPA, the policies underlying the Act, decisions of two of our sister courts of appeals finding a discovery rule in the FDCPA, and decisions of this Court applying a discovery rule to other federal statutes. We consider each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For starters, we reject summarily Rotkiske's assertion that the text of the FDCPA is silent on the discovery rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rotkiske Supp. Br. 6. While it is true that the Act does not state\n   <em>\n    in haec verba\n   </em>\n   that \"the discovery rule shall not apply,\" the Supreme Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    TRW Inc. v. Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p28\">\n    534 U.S. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p28\">\n    122 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p28\">\n    151 L.Ed.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), that Congress may \"implicitly\" provide as much. In that Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) case, the Court held that Congress had \"implicitly excluded a general discovery rule by explicitly including a more limited one.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p28\">\n    534 U.S. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107958\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/19/#p28\">\n    122 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same natural reading applies to the FDCPA in this appeal: Congress's explicit choice of an occurrence rule implicitly excludes a discovery rule. A quotidian example illustrates why this is so. When a bill states that payment is timely if it is \"received at the bank by 5:00,\" it goes without saying that a check arriving at 6:00 is late even if it was postmarked a week earlier. Short of the express command that\n   <em>\n    TRW\n   </em>\n   tells us is not required, it is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly foreclosed the discovery rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rotkiske also highlights the remedial purpose of the FDCPA, which was enacted to combat the national problem of abusive debt-collection practices. Rotkiske Supp. Br. 10-11. Rotkiske emphasizes that those practices may involve fraud, deception, or self-concealing behavior such that the failure to apply the discovery rule would thwart the principal purpose of the Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13. He warns that \"[a]bsent the discovery rule, vulnerable consumers will be left without redress if the harm caused by debt collectors' abusive or deceptive acts remains concealed for over a year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. We disagree for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, to the extent Rotkiske contends that the collection practices the FDCPA proscribes are inherently fraudulent, deceptive, or self-concealing, the statute belies his argument. Debtors are often vexed by overzealous or unscrupulous debt collectors precisely because of repetitive contacts by phone or mail. As the language of the FDCPA makes clear, many violations will be apparent to consumers the moment they occur.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692c(a)(1) (proscribing communication regarding debt collection \"at any unusual time or place\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692d (proscribing various forms of harassment in the service of debt collection, including \"[t]he use of obscene or profane language\" and \"[t]he publication of a list of consumers who allegedly refuse to pay debts\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692f(7) (proscribing \"[c]ommunicating with a consumer regarding a debt by post\n   card\"). The Act's statute of limitations applies to all of its provisions, so we decline Rotkiske's invitation to interpret the Act as if it contemplated only concealed or fraudulent conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, to the extent that FDCPA claims\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   deal with \"false, deceptive, or misleading representation[s],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692e, nothing in the Act impairs the discretion district courts possess to avoid patent unfairness in such cases.

Instead of focusing on the statutory text (which we relegated to a footnote,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852350\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1380/\">\n    38 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1385 n.3 ), we described a \"general rule\" that \"the statute of limitations begins to run ... [on] the date on which the plaintiff\n   <em>\n    discovers\n   </em>\n   \" an injury rather than \"the date on which the wrong that injures the plaintiff occurs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852350\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1380/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852350\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1380/\">\n    at 1385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court's approach in\n   <em>\n    TRW\n   </em>\n   counsels in favor of reconsidering our earlier practice of presuming that federal statutes of limitations include an implied discovery rule. Indeed, to the extent that our decisions have relied on such a general presumption in applying a discovery rule to statutes that expressly begin to run when a violation \"occurs,\" they cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court's mandate that when \"the text [of a statute] and reasonable inferences from it give a clear answer,\" that is \"the end of the matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.
