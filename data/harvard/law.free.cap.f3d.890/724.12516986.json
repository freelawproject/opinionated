On appeal, he challenges only the validity of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue's notice of deficiency (NOD). This court reviews de novo, as a matter of law, whether the Tax Court had jurisdiction pursuant to a validly issued NOD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartman v. Comm'r\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2841214\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/785/#p787\">\n    446 F.3d 785\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 787 (8th Cir. 2006) (standard of review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Muncy argues that the signer of the NOD did not have authority to \"issue\" it. This court previously remanded for factual findings \"whether [Janet A.] Miller[, the IRS employee who purported to issue the NOD,] occupied a position that gave her authority-under the delegation order in effect at the time the NOD was issued, or under any other authorization-to issue Muncy the NOD.\"\n   <em>\n    Muncy v.

Delegation Order 4 - 8 authorizes certain employees to \"sign and send\" NODs. \u00a7 1.2.43.9(2).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.11.2.2(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207321805\">\n    2011 WL 7321805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"The IRM is the primary, official source of IRS 'instructions to staff' relating to the administration and operation of the Service.\"). Among the listed employees are \"SB/SE Technical Services Revenue Agent Reviewers GS-12 and Tax Compliance Officer Reviewers GS-09.\" \u00a7 1.2.43.9(3). Miller's position-Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) Technical Services Territory Manager-is not directly listed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   But Miller's position is higher than, and supervisory of, both SB/SE Technical Services positions directly listed in Delegation Order 4 - 8. The Manual section on the \"Organizational Structure\" of \"Technical Services\" says that \"Technical Services is composed of seven territories that align with the seven SB/SE Examination Compliance Areas ....\" \u00a7 4.8.1.2(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207349301\">\n    2011 WL 7349301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). \"Each territory is led by a Territory Manager.\" \u00a7 4.8.1.2(3). There are \"groups within each territory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207349301\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Groups are composed of a Manager,\n   <em>\n    Revenue Agent Reviewers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tax Compliance Officer Reviewers\n   </em>\n   , Tax Examiners, and supporting clerical staff.\" \u00a7 4.8.1.2(4) (emphasis added). In sum, Territory Managers lead a staff that includes the Revenue Agent Reviewers and Tax Compliance Officer Reviewers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Manual says, \"Authority should be delegated directly to the lowest level expected to take final action.\" \u00a7 1.11.4.4.1(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207321882\">\n    2011 WL 7321882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). This means that as a general rule, \"[e]very intervening line supervisory position up to and including the Commissioner has the same authority.\" \u00a7 1.11.4.4.1(1)(a). Because Miller was in an intervening line supervisory position with respect to SB/SE Technical Services Revenue Agent Reviewers and Tax Compliance Officer Reviewers, she had authority to sign and send the NOD.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.8.9.6.1(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%207349726\">\n    2011 WL 7349726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\" Delegation Order 4 - 8 in IRM 1.2.43.9 delegates the authority to sign statutory notices of deficiency to\n   <em>\n    Technical Services Managers\n   </em>\n   , Revenue Agent Reviewers GS-12 and above, or Tax Compliance Officers GS-09 and above.\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The NOD satisfies the statutory requirement that the deficiency be \"determine[d],\" and the NOD \"sen[t],\" by someone \"duly authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury directly, or indirectly by one or more redelegations of authority, to perform the function ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206212\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; 7701(a)(11)(B); 7701(a)(12)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   *******\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Citations to the Internal Revenue Manual refer to the Manual in effect as of September 7, 2011, the date the NOD was issued.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
