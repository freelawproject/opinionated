Defendants appeal, arguing that the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   erred in denying their motions to\n   dismiss, for judgment of acquittal, and for a new trial; in instructing the jury; in issuing certain evidentiary rulings; in denying Tate's motion for severance; and in issuing a discovery ruling. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants were officials with Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign. Benton served as campaign chairman, Tate served as campaign manager, and Kesari served as deputy campaign manager. During the primary campaign for the Republican Party nomination, Defendants sought the endorsement of Iowa State Senator Kent Sorenson, who had previously endorsed rival Republican candidate Michelle Bachmann and was employed as Bachmann's Iowa campaign chairman, in which capacity he worked seventy to eighty hours a week and was paid $7,500 a month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 29, 2011, Aaron Dorr, the brother of Sorenson's legislative aide, Chris Dorr, emailed Tate a proposal, which stated that Sorenson would need to be paid a salary of $8,000 a month to endorse Paul, Chris Dorr would need to be paid a salary of $5,000 a month, and a $100,000 donation would need to be made to a political action committee established by Sorenson. Tate shared the proposal with Benton, among others, describing it as \"insulting,\" \"offensive,\" and \"unethical,\" and stating that the Paul campaign could make a counter-proposal, simply refuse the proposal, or communicate the proposal to the press, which he believed \"would destroy the Bachman[n] campaign, Kent, and possibly Aaron.\" In reply, Benton sent an email on October 31 addressed to Sorenson and Aaron and Chris Dorr, stating that although he was pleased that Sorenson was considering supporting Paul, he was surprised by the proposal because it appeared to be \"trying to sell Kent's endorsement for hundreds of thousands of dollars and other in-kind support for future political ventures,\" which \"would be unethical and illegal.\" Benton further stated that the Paul campaign \"would be happy to employ [Sorenson] at fair market value,\" which the Bachmann campaign had set at $8,000 a month for Sorenson and $5,000 a month for Chris Dorr, and that Sorenson should respond to this offer by November 2. Later the same day, Kesari told Tate in an email that he and Sorenson had arranged to meet for dinner the following week. Tate responded by saying that Kesari should not \"firm up anything yet.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Aaron Dorr responded to Benton's counter-offer on November 2, stating that he alone was responsible for the earlier proposal and that Sorenson was unaware of its details. He also stated that Sorenson would be unable to consider Benton's counter-offer until after November 8. Benton replied that the offer for Sorenson and Chris Dorr to join the Paul campaign remained open but that it would require a response by November 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 13, Benton emailed Tate and Kesari that he was considering telling the press about Sorenson's endorsement proposal in light of a \"cheap shot\" from Bachmann toward Paul. Tate replied that Benton should first contact Aaron Dorr regarding the possibility of Sorenson's endorsement. Kesari suggested that he could meet with Sorenson and Sorenson's wife, but Tate stated that Benton should contact Aaron Dorr instead, which Benton agreed to do that night. On November 15, after Dorr had failed to respond, Benton gave Kesari permission to meet with Sorenson and Sorenson's wife. Tate told Kesari, \"Make sure you talk to Jesse about how we want to do this and what you are supposed to say. We need to be very careful.\" Kesari agreed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 21, Kesari emailed Tate and Benton that he had spoken with Sorenson\n   and his family over dinner the previous evening and learned that Sorenson wanted to defect to the Paul campaign but in a way that would cause the least harm to Bachmann. Tate replied, \"Seems to me, next step is to make him an offer (in person, not in writing) and give him a firm but polite deadline. In my view we would want it to occur after Christmas, a few days before Caucus.\" On December 23, Benton sent an email to Tate and others stating, \"Sorenson is endorsing [Paul ] on Monday. We have his statement already.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sorenson requested a meeting with Kesari on December 26. Kesari, Sorenson, and Sorenson's wife met at a restaurant to discuss Sorenson's endorsement of Paul. In Sorenson's absence, Kesari gave Sorenson's wife a $25,000 check made out to Grassroots Strategy, a corporation owned by Sorenson. After the meeting, Kesari sent an email to campaign staffers saying, \"The deal is done. Please draft a press release and send to me and Jesse.\" Attached to the email was Sorenson's draft statement endorsing Paul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 27, however, Kesari sent an email to Tate, Benton, and others saying, \"Hold the release. Kent is getting cold feet. He wants to meet with me in about 2 hours. Any advice? Damn I was afraid of this.\" Tate asked, \"Why is he getting cold feet? What can we do, say to help him? What time are you meeting him, and where?\" Benton replied, \"I am not interested in this game any more. Dimitri, pull the offer. If we can't depend on him, I don't want him involved.\" Benton then sent another email, saying, \"In all seriousness, I am [not] sure what to do about this. The DMR [\n   <em>\n    Des Moines Register\n   </em>\n   ] has his statement, I sent last night since Kent said [he] [was] [c]omfortable.\" Benton told Tate and Kesari in subsequent emails that he was considering telling the press about Sorenson's request for payment if Sorenson did not uphold his agreement to endorse Paul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Sorenson, he had a heated argument with Bachmann's campaign staff on December 28. Later that day, he drove to a rally for Paul at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines. Sorenson met Kesari in the parking lot and asked if Kesari, Benton, and Tate were still \"on board\" with his endorsement of Paul; Kesari replied that they were. Sorenson spoke with Benton and Kesari in the backstage area of one of the buildings at the Fairgrounds, where Tate was also present. Sorenson testified that Benton told him something to the effect of, \"[Y]ou bled for us, we'll take care of you,\" which Sorenson understood to mean that he would be \"financially taken care of and politically taken care of.\" Sorenson thereafter went on stage and publicly endorsed Paul. Shortly after Sorenson's endorsement, Kesari sent an email to Fernando Cortes, the Paul campaign's assistant controller, requesting a $25,000 wire transfer for the next morning. Copies of the email were sent to Benton and Tate and stated that Benton had approved the wire. Tate replied the following day that the wire was approved. The Paul campaign issued a press release announcing Sorenson's endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Sorenson endorsed Paul, members of the Bachmann campaign began telling the press that the Paul campaign had paid Sorenson for his endorsement. Responding to media inquiries, Benton stated that Sorenson would not be paid by the Paul campaign, in one instance explicitly denying that Sorenson would be paid a salary by the campaign. Tate sent an email to Benton, saying, \"We need to make sure anyone asked about this ... is prepared to say the same thing. I would assume that is something like: The Ron Paul campaign has not and is not paying Kent for his endorsement. Kent decided to endorse\n   Ron because blah blah blah. Short sweet and truthful.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 29, the Paul campaign issued a press release that included a statement from Sorenson that he \"was never offered money from the Ron Paul campaign or anyone associated with them and certainly would never accept any.\" The statement further stated, \"Financial reports come out in just days which will prove what I'm saying is true.\" Benton had approved this release before it was made public. In television interviews, Sorenson also denied being paid by the campaign. He had been urged by Kesari to support this denial by referring to the forthcoming financial reports and was told by Kesari not to cash the $25,000 check that Kesari had given to Sorenson's wife. Also on December 29, Cortes sent an email to Kesari, Benton, and Tate, with the subject line \"25k wire,\" asking \"Is this invoice still on for today? Please send when you get.\" Benton told Cortes to \"[h]old for a couple days.\" Tate agreed that the wire should be held, and Kesari stated, \"We are holding till after the filing.\" Kesari also explained that he did not want the wire \"showing up on this quarter filings.\" Later that day, Cortes sent Tate a list of outstanding invoices, which included \"$25k-Dimitri's mystery wire.\" Tate responded, \"Thanks. There will not be the 25k dimitri wire for now. Wipe it off the books.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kesari then arranged to pay Sorenson through a third party. He asked his brother, Pavlo Kesari, if Pavlo could pay, via Pavlo's video production company, a graphic designer who had done work for the campaign. Pavlo replied that he could not do so, but referred Kesari to his friend Sonny Izon, who owned a video production company called Interactive Communications Technology (ICT). On January 24, 2012, Sorenson sent Kesari an invoice addressed to ICT from Grassroots Strategy Inc., the corporation owned by Sorenson, for \"Consulting Services,\" consisting of $25,000 for \"Retainer to provide services\" and $8,000 for services provided during the month of January 2012. Kesari sent the invoice to Pavlo, saying, \"Here is the invoice that needs to be taken care of. Send me an invoice for video services.\" Pavlo forwarded the invoice to Izon and added a $3,125 invoice for audio equipment that Pavlo had rented to the Paul campaign. On February 5, Izon sent Kesari an invoice charging the Paul campaign $38,125 for \"Production Services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After receiving the February 5 invoice, Kesari sent Tate an email asking \"[d]id jesse get kent paid?\" Tate replied, \"No idea. Ask him.\" Kesari then emailed Benton, asking \"Did you get kent paid? Or should I submit the payment and pay him?\" Benton replied, \"Yo[u] handle.\" Kesari forwarded the invoice to Cortes, saying \"Please wire tomorrow morning[.] This is approved by jesse.\" On March 21, Izon sent Kesari an invoice charging the Paul campaign $8,850 for production services rendered in February. Kesari forwarded the invoice to Cortes, saying that it was \"[a]pproved by jesse.\" Cortes forwarded the invoice to Tate, asking if the payment was approved, with Tate responding that it was. The same exchange took place regarding the invoice for services in March. After receiving the invoice for services in April, Kesari forwarded it to Benton, asking \"Kent's bill[.] Pay?\" Kesari then forwarded the invoice to Cortes, saying that it was \"[a]pproved by Jesse.\" After receiving the May invoice, Kesari forwarded it to Cortes, saying, \"This should be the last one.\" Cortes forwarded the invoice to Tate, asking \"[A]pproved? Dimitri said it is the last one.\" Tate approved the payment. After receiving the June invoice, Kesari forwarded it to Cortes, saying, \"This is the last one.\" Cortes forwarded the invoice to Tate, saying, \"According to dimitri [this is]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   the last one (again)[.] Approved? 8k.\" Tate told Cortes, \"I will find out what it is.\" Tate emailed Kesari, asking, \"What is this? What is it for, who is it? Why do we keep paying them? The last payment was supposedly the last.\" Kesari replied, \"This [is] the last payment for kent Sorenson. The deal jesse agreed to with kent.\" Kesari sent Tate another email, saying, \"I[t] was for 6 months.\" Tate then approved the payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sorenson testified that he performed some services for the Paul campaign while being paid by it. He posed for photographs, made two television appearances, sent emails, and recorded a phone call on behalf of the campaign. He traveled to South Carolina and appeared at rallies in support of Paul, although he did not organize these rallies, as he had done while working for the Bachmann campaign. While in South Carolina he also met with state legislators and encouraged them to endorse Paul.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the invoices, Cortes and other campaign staff prepared wire instructions for the payments to ICT, using a code designating the payments as \"audio/visual expenses.\" The campaign used this information to report the payments to the Federal Election Commission (the Commission). The campaign reported the payments to ICT to the Commission as \"audio/visual expenses,\" using the code assigned by Cortes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In response to media reports regarding the $25,000 check that Kesari had given to Sorenson's wife, Sorenson sent Kesari a draft press release in August 2013, which stated that he had been offered the check but never cashed it and thus he \"was never paid.\" Kesari told Sorenson to hold the release until after Kesari had returned from a trip abroad. Upon arriving in Toronto, Kesari placed phone calls to Sorenson, Tate, and Benton. He placed several more phone calls to Sorenson, Tate, and Benton after returning to Virginia. Kesari traveled to meet with Sorenson at his home. Sorenson testified that upon arriving, Kesari lifted up his shirt and asked Sorenson to do the same, to prove that neither was wearing a wire. Kesari asked Sorenson to give him the check back or to alter it to show either a smaller amount or to show \"Loan\" as the check's purpose. Sorenson refused these requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants were indicted by a federal grand jury on Counts 1 through 4 as described above. Benton was indicted on a count of making false statements to law enforcement, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1001(a)(2) (Count 5) and Kesari was indicted on a count of obstruction of justice, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201512\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) (Count 6). The district court dismissed without prejudice Counts 1 through 4 against Benton and Tate because the government had presented information to the grand jury that Benton and Tate had proffered to the FBI, in violation of their proffer agreements. The jury convicted Kesari of Count 2, causing false records; acquitted Kesari of Count 6, obstruction of justice; and acquitted Benton of Count 5, making false statements to law enforcement. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By way of a superseding indictment, a grand jury again charged Defendants with Counts 1 through 4, except Kesari. who was not indicted on Count 2. After a second trial, the jury convicted Defendants on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Statutory Construction and Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants argue that the district court erred in denying their motions\n   for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial because the court misconstrued the relevant statutes and the evidence was insufficient to support Defendants' convictions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The district court's statutory construction is a legal determination that we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Federal Election Campaign Act\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Act requires the treasurer of a political campaign committee to file with the Commission a report disclosing \"the name and address of each [ ] person to whom an expenditure in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $200 within the calendar year is made by the reporting committee to meet a candidate or committee operating expense, together with the date, amount, and purpose of such operating expenditure.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030104\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(5)(A). Violations of the Act's reporting requirements committed \"knowingly and willfully\" and \"aggregating $25,000 or more during a calendar year\" may be punished by up to five years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 30109(d )(1)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants argue that the Act does not prohibit a campaign from paying a vendor, which in turn pays a sub-vendor, while reporting only the payment to the first vendor. As the district court noted in its order denying Defendants' motions, this argument is unavailing because Defendants were not charged with violating the Act merely by failing to report Sorenson as the ultimate recipient of the campaign's payments to ICT. Rather, the government \"was properly permitted to argue that [the] combination of a payee used to disguise the true payee, together with a false statement of purpose, was sufficient to violate the statutes alleged in the indictment.\" D. Ct. Order of Oct. 24, 2016, at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The district court's analysis does not conflict with the Commission's decisions. In\n   <em>\n    Mondale for President\n   </em>\n   , the Commission advised that a campaign may report expenditures to a corporation it hired to provide media consulting services without reporting the corporation's expenditures to its sub-vendors. FEC Advisory Opinion 1983-25 (\n   <em>\n    Mondale for President\n   </em>\n   ). And in\n   <em>\n    Kirk for Senate\n   </em>\n   , the Commission concluded that a campaign had not violated the Act's reporting requirements by paying a vendor for media services, who in turn paid a sub-vendor that allegedly used some of the funds to pay the personal expenses of the candidate's girlfriend.\n   <em>\n    Kirk for Sen\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ate\n   </em>\n   , Matter Under Review (MUR) 6510 (FEC July 16, 2013). In both matters, however, the Commission concluded that the vendors and sub-vendors had provided the services described by the campaign. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Mondale\n   </em>\n   , the Commission noted that itemization of the vendor's payments to sub-vendors would not be required because the campaign would report \"specific information describing the various purposes of each expenditure made\" to the vendor, such as \"media consulting fees, media photocopy expenses, media buys, media production, and other similar descriptive language that reflects the actual purpose of each\" of the campaign's expenditures to the vendor. Here, by contrast, the government presented evidence that Defendants caused false reports to the Commission that the payments to ICT were for \"audio/visual expenses,\" when in reality ICT had provided no such services to the campaign and the payments were instead for Sorenson's endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Commission found a violation of the Act's reporting requirements in a matter whose facts are similar to those here,\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Jenkins for Senate 1996 and Woody Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , MUR 4872 (FEC Feb. 15, 2002).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The campaign had contracted with a company called Impact Mail &amp; Printing for computerized phone bank services. The campaign wanted to conceal its association with Impact Mail, however, and to that end it issued payments to its media firm, Courtney Communications, which then transmitted the payments to Impact Mail. The campaign's reports to the Commission reflected disbursements to Courtney Communications and not to Impact Mail. The Commission reasoned that because Courtney Communications \"had no involvement whatsoever with the services provided by Impact Mail,\" and served only \"as a conduit for payment to Impact Mail so as to conceal the transaction with Impact Mail,\" the campaign had violated the Act's reporting requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Boustany, Jr. MD for Congress\n   </em>\n   , MUR 6698 (FEC Feb. 23, 2016), in support of their argument, but we do not find that case persuasive. The supplement to the complaint in that matter set forth allegations similar to those in this case, and in a three-to-three vote the Commission failed to find legal violations. Those Commissioners voting to take no action pointed to the campaign's descriptions of the disbursement's purpose as \"[d]oor-to-door get-out-the-vote,\" and noted that while \"a portion of the disbursement was ultimately used for another kind of [get-out-the-vote] activity,\" it would not be \"a prudent use of Commission resources\" to investigate such a \"minor discrepancy.\" Here, by contrast, reporting the payments to ICT as \"audio/visual expenses,\" when the actual purpose of the payments was for Sorenson's endorsement, can hardly be characterized as a \"minor discrepancy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We also reject Defendants' argument that the coding of the disbursements to ICT as \"audio/visual expenses\" did not render the reports false. That Sorenson performed some work for the campaign that might arguably be described as an audio/visual expense is beside the point. The government's theory was that the payments to Sorenson were for his endorsement and not for any audio/visual services, a theory bolstered by the fact that the payments were arranged before Sorenson performed any services. Based on Commission\n   Branch Chief Michael Hartsock's trial testimony, Defendants contend that \"a campaign is limited in the way that it can report disbursements and still comply with the Commission's facial review,\" that the Commission considers \"audio/visual\" to be an adequate expenditure purpose, and that it considers \"political consulting\" or \"endorsement\" to be inadequate purposes. Benton Br. 28-29. Hartsock's testimony, however, was that the Commission's lists of adequate and inadequate disbursement purposes are non-exhaustive, and he agreed that \"while consulting is not an acceptable purpose, specifying the type of consulting services provided can help to ensure that the purpose is considered adequate.\" He also testified that \"audio/visual\" does not appear on either the list of adequate or the list of inadequate purposes. This testimony thus did not establish that \"audio/visual\" was an accurate description of the purpose for the disbursements to ICT, nor did it establish that Defendants could not have accurately described the purpose for the disbursements in a manner that would have been accepted by the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Benton and Tate contend that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions under the Act because it did not show that they were involved in preparing the false Commission reports. We disagree. The government presented evidence that Benton and Tate coordinated with Kesari to offer Sorenson money in return for endorsing Paul and that they approved a wire transfer to pay Sorenson after he had done so. After the Bachmann campaign claimed that Sorenson had been paid for his endorsement, Tate told Benton that everyone involved should be \"prepared to say the same thing,\" namely, that Sorenson had not been paid for his endorsement. Benton told members of the media that Sorenson would not be paid by the Paul campaign. The Paul campaign issued a Benton-approved statement from Sorenson that Sorenson would not be paid by the campaign and that the campaign's forthcoming Commission reports would bear out this claim. Tate and Benton instructed Cortes to hold the previously-approved wire, which, Kesari explained, was intended to prevent it from appearing on that quarter's Commission report. Later, Tate told Cortes to \"[w]ipe [the wire] off the books.\" Benton told Kesari to handle the payments to Sorenson. Kesari sent several invoices from ICT to Cortes, saying in nearly every case that the disbursements had been approved by Benton. Kesari told Benton that the April invoice was for \"Kent's bill.\" Tate approved the invoices after Cortes forwarded them to him. Although Tate asked what the June invoice was for, he approved the invoice immediately after Kesari told him that it was for \"[t]he deal jesse agreed to with kent.\" The jury was entitled to infer from these facts that Benton and Tate had knowingly and willfully caused Commission reports to be filed which falsely reported the payments to Sorenson for his endorsement as payments to ICT for audio/visual services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We reject Defendants' arguments that the reporting requirements are so vague or confusing that we should either apply the rule of lenity or determine that criminal enforcement is not appropriate in this case. As set forth above, Defendants were not convicted for an unsuccessful, good-faith attempt to accurately report the disbursements to ICT, but for knowingly and willfully causing false reports to be filed with the Commission, a conviction that we conclude finds ample evidentiary support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   2.

If the defendants acted in good faith, sincerely believing themselves to be exempt by the law from the conduct constituting any of the above charges, then the defendants did not intentionally violate a known legal duty, that is, the defendants did not act \"willfully.\" The burden of proof is not on the defendants to prove good-faith intent because the defendant does not need to prove anything.

Exclusion of Defense Experts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Defendants argue that the district court erred in excluding the testimony of two expert witnesses, David Mason and Jeff Link. Mason, a campaign consultant and former Commissioner and Commission Chairman, testified at the first trial in 2015. During direct examination, defense counsel asked several questions regarding general campaign-finance legal requirements, to which the district court sustained several relevance-based objections saying to defense counsel,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   This is not the subject matter that you represented would be his testimony. You were very specific about what you wanted this for. ... It was represented as associated with the campaigns, how hectic the campaigns and things like that were. That was the representation, and the organizational structure of campaigns, not the difficulty complying with the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   After defense counsel asked Mason if there was \"any confusion about the compliance issues with vendors and sub vendors,\" the court sustained another objection and called counsel to a sidebar conference, during which the court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Confusion goes to the state of mind of another, whether it's one person or a whole bunch. This gets back to the exact same concern I had last week about whether the Mondale Campaign sought an advisory opinion. Until I find out that that's-that your client heard it and relied upon it and bases a good faith defense\n   on that, it's not relevant. Confusion generally is not relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The district court sustained a relevance objection when government counsel asked Mason on cross-examination if he had ever advised a campaign that it could report a disbursement to the Commission as an audiovisual expense when the disbursement was for something else. Government counsel then asked Mason a series of questions regarding the legality of paying sub-vendors through an \"umbrella vendor,\" including whether the umbrella vendor would have to actually work with the sub-vendors. On redirect examination, defense counsel asked Mason about the rules regarding paying sub-vendors through an umbrella vendor and possible confusion surrounding those rules. The district court overruled the government's objections, ruling that the government had opened the door to the issue through its line of questioning on cross-examination. Mason continued to testify on this topic during the remainder of his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Prior to the beginning of the second trial, the district court granted the government's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude Mason's testimony. It did so because Mason's testimony at the first trial \"did not provide helpful context regarding the inner workings of federal campaigns at all, and only arguably touched on any relevant standard of care by alluding to general confusion,\" and instead offered an impermissible legal conclusion that the Commission regulations were confusing and that payments to sub-vendors through an umbrella vendor did not violate these regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S. Pine Helicopters, Inc. v.

The court accordingly excluded the evidence under Rule 403 of the Federal Rule of Evidence, finding that the \"helpfulness of Mr. Mason's testimony to the jury's clear understanding of the general context of a political campaign and how a political campaign operates is outweighed by the danger of confusion of the issues and impermissible instruction on the law.\" The court noted that it would instruct the jury that the use of an umbrella vendor to pay sub-vendors would not alone violate the Act and that Defendants were free to elicit testimony from other witnesses \"regarding the hectic nature of political campaigns.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Benton served pretrial notice that he intended to call Link as an expert witness to testify regarding \"the operating environment within federal candidate campaigns and the customs and practices and standards of care with respect to organizational structure;\" \"the customs and practices of federal candidate campaigns with respect to paying outside consultants through the use of corporations ... and other similar entities;\" and \"the customs and practices of federal candidate campaigns with respect to the use of vendors who subcontract for services intended for the benefit of the federal candidate campaign.\" The government filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude Link's testimony, which the court orally granted during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Tate contends that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the experts' testimony because the impermissible legal testimony that the district court was concerned about was elicited by the government. The record shows, however, that the testimony was elicited by both sides. As the district court noted, testimony about the \"hectic nature\" and operational structure of the Paul campaign was available from other witnesses with direct knowledge thereof, and so the court acted well within its discretion in excluding the proposed testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   2. Admission of the $25,000 Check\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Benton argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of the $25,000 check because it was not relevant to the theory of conviction and that any tangential relevance was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We disagree. The check was relevant to show that the purpose of the payments to Sorenson was to purchase his endorsement, rather than for \"audio/visual expenses,\" as was reported to the Commission. Any potential prejudice resulting from admission of this evidence was mitigated by the district court's instruction that paying for an endorsement alone is not illegal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   3. Admission of Cortes Email\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Kesari argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting an email sent from Cortes to other campaign staff. The email stated that \"Dennis is not a good guy ... but neither is Dimitri IMO- but then again I don't know it all so I leave it to you.\" The email also included several attachments, including the ICT invoices; one attachment bore a lewd title. Cortes opined, \"The last attachment is an email (sorry for the lewdness) I got about a month ago- not sure who its from- my two guesses-Dennis or Dimitri using dummy accounts.\" The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence. In any event, any prejudice to Kesari was so slight as to render any error harmless.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Jencks Act requires a court to order the government, upon request by the defendant, to produce any statement in the government's possession which relates to the matter on which a witness called by the government has testified on direct examination.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In response to subpoenas issued by Defendants, the government stated that Sorenson had met with FBI agents on October 9 and that no notes were taken at the meeting. Kesari argues that trial testimony established that notes were taken at the meeting, but that testimony was equivocal. During the first trial, Sorenson was asked if people at the meeting were taking notes, and he responded, \"I don't recall.\" Then, when asked, \"Were [note] pads out?\" Sorenson said, \"Yes.\" When asked \"And were people writing on those pads as you spoke to them?\" he replied, \"I would assume so, yes.\" During the second trial, FBI Special Agent Karen LoStracco, who attended the October 9 meeting along with two other agents, testified, \"I think I usually take at least some notes. I don't recall an occasion where I didn't take notes. If I wasn't taking notes, somebody else was taking notes, meaning another agent.\" In the absence of any probative evidence that notes were taken at the October 9 meeting, no Jencks Act violation was established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Kesari argues that even if no tangible notes exist,\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   nonetheless entitled him to impeachment evidence from the meeting. As Kesari offers only the speculative claim that the October 9 meeting must have produced impeachment evidence in light of Sorenson's penchant for dishonesty, he has not shown that any impeachment\n   evidence existed and thus has established no\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Honorable John A.
