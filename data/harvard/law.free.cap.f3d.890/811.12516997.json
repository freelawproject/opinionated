As a result of these crimes, on October 23, 1996, Briones and four other members of the gang were indicted on federal charges including felony murder, arson, assault, and witness tampering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The most serious of the crimes was a murder committed on May 15, 1994, when Briones was seventeen. According to evidence presented at trial, Briones and fellow gang members planned to rob a Subway restaurant knowing that there would be only one employee present. Briones drove four other gang members to the restaurant, including one armed with a gun, and parked his car outside while the other four went in to rob the store. They ordered food from the lone employee, and while it was being prepared, the gunman returned to the car to speak with Briones, then went back into the restaurant, shot the clerk in the face, and then shot him several more times on the floor. With the cash register locked, the gang members were able to steal only a bag with $100 and the food they had ordered. One of the gang members, who eventually cooperated with the government, testified that after they got back in the car, Briones looked for a maintenance man whom he thought had seen them. According to the cooperating witness, Briones instructed the other gang members to shoot the maintenance man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Three weeks later, Briones helped plan to firebomb a rival gang member's home and prepared the Molotov cocktails to be used. Although Briones was not the one to throw them, a fellow gang member did, setting fire to a house with a family inside, including an eleven-year-old girl. Fortunately, the child was not harmed. Several months later, the gang decided to try firebombing the same home again. Briones once more provided Molotov cocktails and drove other gang members to a kindergarten and an abandoned trailer house to set diversionary fires. Briones then drove them to the rival gang member's home, which they firebombed. Again, fortunately, the family was unharmed. Another month later, Briones helped plan a drive-by shooting of the same home, although he was neither the driver nor the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Over the next year, Briones continued to participate in gang-related crimes. He pistol whipped a member of his gang who revealed he knew about the Subway murder. That gang member managed to escape and eventually cooperated with authorities. When other gang members committed another drive-by shooting of a home with a mother and child inside, Briones made sure the culprits disposed of their clothes and accounted for the shell casings. At trial, the government also presented evidence that Briones discussed escaping from custody, that he carved gang graffiti into the door of a jail cell, and that he discussed plans to blow up the Salt River Police Department and to kill a tribal judge, federal prosecutors, and Salt River Police investigators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Briones was arrested on December 21, 1995. He was one of five co-defendants, each of whom was made a plea offer of twenty years in prison. Briones declined the offer, in part because his father (one of the co-defendants) would not take the deal. Ultimately, Briones was convicted of all charged offenses. At the original sentencing in July, 1997, Briones continued to deny responsibility for the crimes. As part of its sentencing determination, the district court found that Briones was the leader of the gang, and imposed the then-mandatory guidelines sentence of life imprisonment without parole on the felony murder count. Briones was also sentenced to ten and twenty years, respectively, to run concurrently on the non-homicide counts, which he has since served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Fifteen years after Briones's original sentencing, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   that \"the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (citation omitted). In light of that holding, a sentencing judge is required \"to take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against irrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote reference omitted). On the basis of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Briones filed a motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to vacate his original mandatory life sentence, which the district court granted in July, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At his resentencing, Briones requested a sentence of 360 months' imprisonment rather than a life sentence. He argued that the sentencing guidelines, which recommend a life sentence in his case, should be set aside in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . Invoking the \"hallmarks of youth\" identified by\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , Briones argued that a life sentence was inappropriate in his case. He argued that his gang participation was a product of youthful immaturity and a desire to have a \"feeling of banding together.\" He pointed to a dysfunctional childhood environment, including parental drug and alcohol abuse,\n   a history of family criminality (both his father and brother were also in the gang and were co-defendants), dropping out of school in the tenth grade, and difficulties as a Native American attending school off the reservation. He said that he was poorly situated to aid in his own defense or to contradict his father when he refused to take a plea deal that would have resulted in a much lower sentence. To mitigate his culpability in the crime, he observed that the robbery scheme was not his idea and that he was not the shooter. Finally, he pointed to evidence of rehabilitation, including that in all his time in prison he had not been written up once for a disciplinary infraction, that he had no gang involvement, that he had been working continuously, and that he married his girlfriend with whom he has a now-adult child, and that he sees his wife regularly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Both Briones and his wife testified at the resentencing hearing and discussed the difficulties of his childhood. Briones testified that he started drinking around age 12 and as a teenager was regularly drunk in addition to using cocaine and LSD. He wrote a letter to express \"[g]rief, regret, sorrow, pain.\" He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I don't know how but I know I have to apologize for everything and I apologize all the time to my family because they're there, and my apology goes out to also to the [victim's] family and to all the families, not just for what happened but for the other changes that occurred in my life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although Briones told the court that he \"want[ed] to express remorse\" and \"want[ed] to express grief,\" he never actually took responsibility for any of the crimes of which he was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The government countered that Briones deserved a life sentence. The government acknowledged that under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , \"a life sentence for a juvenile is inappropriate in all but the most egregious cases,\" but argued that \"this is the most egregious case.\" Despite recognizing that Briones was \"really doing well in prison,\" the government noted that Briones expressed remorse, but failed to accept responsibility, and continued to minimize his role in the murder and in the gang. Specifically, the government contended that it was not credible that Briones was unaware of the gang members' intention to murder the Subway clerk, and circumstantial evidence suggested Briones himself may have ordered the murder, because the gunman shot the clerk immediately upon reentering the restaurant after speaking with Briones outside. The prosecutor described Briones's gang as \"the most violent gang that I have ever been involved in prosecuting,\" including the Hells Angels. Finally, the government pointed out that although Briones was a juvenile, he was only barely-he was over seventeen years and eleven months old when the murder occurred-and he continued to commit violent crimes for another year and a half, stopping only when he was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After hearing from the parties, and \"[u]sing the guidelines as a starting point,\" the district court calculated a sentencing range of life imprisonment for Briones's felony murder conviction without objection from counsel. The court noted that, \"in addition to the presentence report, I've considered the Government's sentencing memorandum, the defendant's sentencing memorandum[,] ... the transcript of the [original] sentencing[,] ... the victim questionnaire and the letters on behalf of the defendant.\" The court found that \"[a]ll indications\n   are that defendant was bright and articulate, he has improved himself while he's been in prison, but he was the leader of a gang that terrorized the Salt River Reservation community and surrounding area for several years. The gang was violent and cold-blooded.\" Briones \"appeared to be the pillar of strength for the people involved to make sure they executed the plan [to murder the victim],\" and he \"was involved in the final decision to kill the young clerk.\" The court expressed that \"in mitigation I do consider the history of the abusive father, the defendant's youth, immaturity, his adolescent brain at the time, and the fact that it was impacted by regular and constant abuse of alcohol and other drugs, and he's been a model inmate up to now. However, some decisions have lifelong consequences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, the district court announced that, \"[h]aving considered those things and all the evidence I've heard today and everything I've read ... it's the judgment of the Court that Riley Briones, Jr. is hereby committed to the Bureau of Prisons for a sentence of life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because the federal system does not permit parole or early release from life sentences,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Briones's sentence is effectively for life without the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He argues that, in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , \"a court should no longer start with a life sentence and work down, which is precisely what the district court did here.\" Instead, says Briones, \"a court must start from the presumption that a life sentence should be uncommon\" so that using the guidelines as \"the starting point was error that entitled Mr. Briones to a new sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, however, \"a district court should begin\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range,\" and \"[a]s a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.\"\n   <em>\n    Gall v.

Although \"[t]he Guidelines are not the only consideration,\" and a sentencing court \"may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable,\" the district court's \"individualized assessment based on the facts presented\" must follow a correct guidelines calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Briones can point to no language in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   or subsequent case law that overrules those clear instructions. We therefore see no error in the district court following the\n   sentencing process prescribed by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

He asserts that the district court \"merely recite[d] 'youth' as a mitigating circumstance\" when it was in fact required substantively to \"consider the mitigating quality of youth.\" He argues that the court failed to give the evidence of his rehabilitation \"the weight\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requires\" and instead \"focused on the facts of the case.\" Briones contends that \"[t]he critical question should have been whether Mr. Briones had the capacity to change\" and that the district court gave \"short shrift\" to \"the evidence of [his] maturation and change in demeanor.\" He also points to evidence he presented of his immaturity, dysfunctional family environment, and inability to aid in his own defense, which he says the district court \"failed to properly assess\" in evaluating \"the hallmarks of youth that must be considered before sentencing a juvenile to spend the rest of his life in prison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held unconstitutional mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders and, in so doing, enumerated a series of factors sentencing courts should consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features-among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him-and from which he cannot usually extricate himself-no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might have been charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with you-for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    567 U.S. at 477-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There is no doubt that the \"hallmarks of youth,\" as they related to Briones, were considered by the court because the record is replete with references to those hallmarks, reflected in the following statements from Briones's counsel, and encompassing rehabilitation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 [If] we look at the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    hallmarks of youth\n   </em>\n   , ...

From the government's perspective, Briones minimized both his role in the Subway murder and his role in the gang. The government recounted in detail testimony from co-defendants explaining that Briones was a leader of the gang, and instructed them to find and kill a potential witness to the Subway murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The government also pointed out that Briones was only twenty-two days shy of his eighteenth birthday when the Subway murder was committed, that Briones continued his crime spree for another eighteen months, and that Briones scratched gang graffiti into his cell door three years after the Subway murder. According to the government, Briones's actions were \"not indicative of an individual who is so immature that he didn't know what he was doing.\" The government argued that Briones's conduct was not sufficiently mitigating to warrant a change in Briones's sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After hearing from defense counsel and the government, the court demonstrated that it had heard and considered all the information presented and remarks made during the sentencing hearing, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Well, in mitigation I do consider the history of the abusive father, the defendant's youth, immaturity, his adolescent brain at the time, and the fact that it was impacted by regular and constant abuse of alcohol and other drugs, and he's been a model inmate up to now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nevertheless, the judge determined that after considering \"all the evidence ... and everything the judge had read,\" a life sentence for Briones was warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Admittedly, the district court did not explain at length why consideration of Briones's youth failed to persuade the court to impose a sentence of less than life imprisonment. But he was not required to do so.

If anything, the sentencing transcript reveals factual findings that suggest Briones has demonstrated a capacity to change. The district court observed that Briones has \"been a model inmate\" and that he \"has improved himself while he's been in prison.\" Perhaps, despite that promising behavior, the district court could have determined that countervailing evidence indicated that Briones is permanently incorrigible. But the transcript does not indicate that the district court made such determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   More troubling, the transcript suggests that the district court may have misunderstood the nature of the inquiry Briones was asking it to make.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   \"rendered\n   life without parole an unconstitutional penalty for ... juvenile offenders whose crimes reflect the transient immaturity of youth,\" which the Supreme Court has instructed includes \"the vast majority of juvenile offenders.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12601432\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/718/#p734\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet the district court only considered the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   hallmarks of youth as \"mitigation,\" suggesting that it started from the inverted assumption that most juvenile offenders are eligible for life sentences and that Briones's evidence could only mitigate from that. If the district court fully grappled with\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's rule, one would think it would have spoken of \"aggravating\" evidence rather than \"mitigation.\" Moreover, in explaining that Briones's crime justified a life sentence because \"some decisions have lifelong consequences,\" the district court suggested it misunderstood\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   entirely. The point of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   is that \"juveniles have diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    567 U.S. at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In fact, there are no forward-looking statements at all from the district court in its sentencing colloquy; the stated basis for the sentence was entirely retrospective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To cure the deficiencies in the district court's explanation of the sentence imposed, the government asks us to infer that the district court must have found Briones incorrigible based on a lack of candor when he testified at the resentencing hearing. The majority jumps at this invitation, adopting the government's position to observe that \"Briones' statements\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   reasonably be interpreted as not taking responsibility for his prior criminal activity, in contravention of one of the basic tenets of rehabilitation.\" Majority Op. at 820 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The equivocal nature of the majority's statement is telling. Perhaps the district court\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have thought that Briones failed to take responsibility for his actions, but nowhere in the district's court's statement of reasons for the sentence did it say as much. Although the government and the majority offer one plausible interpretation of Briones's testimony, it is hardly the only one. In fact, when I read the transcript, I see much that could support a contrary finding that Briones expressed remorse repeatedly and at length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Briones expressed regret for his actions. He admitted the key facts of the murder and subsequent crimes and admitted that \"it's probably my fault when I thought about it.\" He explained that he regularly asks himself \"why didn't I do something at that time, why ... didn't I stop myself way before that, why didn't I do something at the court?\" He explained that \"the thing that haunted me so much about just living in prison was that\" the murder victim was \"a young Christian man,\" and that it \"haunts me to have that on my hands.\" And he said, \"I want to express remorse, I want to express grief.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Briones also expressed sympathy for those he had harmed. For instance, he explained that he did not believe the victim's family could ever forgive him because he was responsible for \"a great offense that ... is unrepaired.\" He explained that \"now that I'm older ... I witness not just in my own life people murdered and their killers get to go home,\" and he can \"see[ ] people in pain when they've gone through their loss, [and] all of this had made me not only sympathize but to empathize with all of it.\" He said, \"I know I have to apologize for everything and I apologize all\n   the time to my family ..., and my apology goes out ... to the [victim's] family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   I do acknowledge that there are portions of the transcript from which one could infer a lack of candor. It is true that Briones's testimony was not crisp and eloquent. And it is true that he continued to say that he \"didn't think myself a leader\" in the gang and that he continued to deny that the plan from the beginning was to murder the Subway clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Perhaps, hearing all the testimony and weighing the countervailing inferences, the district judge could have concluded that Briones was insufficiently honest or that he failed to take responsibility for his crimes. Perhaps those findings could be evidence of incorrigibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   But the district court never said any of that. All the reasons that it\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   give for the sentence were about the nature of the crime, not the subsequent lack of remorse or acceptance of responsibility. Reading a cold transcript, the majority is willing to conclude that Briones \"never actually took responsibility for any of the crimes of which he was convicted.\" Majority Op. at 815. I am not willing to reach such a critical factual conclusion based on an ambiguous transcript, especially when the district court made no such factual finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The majority accuses me of retrying Briones's case rather than reviewing it as an appellate court should.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 821. But it is the majority that has invented a basis for the sentence which cannot be found in the record. The reason courts of appeals accord great deference to a district court's sentencing decision is that \"[t]he sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than ... the appeals court.\"\n   <em>\n    Rita\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573000\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/338/#p341\">\n    551 U.S. at 357-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573000\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/338/#p341\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the majority, I would take advantage of that expertise by remanding for an actual determination of Briones's incorrigibility rather than attempting to divine one by reading a transcript through squinted eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Another aspect of this case that gives me pause is that it is not obvious whether or not Briones fits within the class of juvenile offenders constitutionally eligible for a life sentence. If the only plausible reading of the record were that Briones is incorrigible, I could more easily assure myself that the district court reached that conclusion even though it did not specifically respond to the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   argument.

The court's failure properly to explain its sentence requires remand\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   because it was procedural error, but rather because such failure prevents us from being able properly to review Briones's substantive claim. As the majority acknowledges, a district court's sentence is invalid \"if the court applied an incorrect legal rule.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Martinez-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275958\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/1034/#p1043\">\n    864 F.3d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1043 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 818. Because the record does not allow us to determine whether the court did apply the correct legal rule, we should remand for that limited purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   I share the majority's concern that we ought not to conjure procedural sentencing hurdles unsupported by law. I am especially cognizant of this concern because other courts have read\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   to impose special procedural requirements well beyond what those opinions actually require.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Batts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12318132\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/163/410/#p415\">\n    163 A.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415-16 (Pa. 2017) (\"recogniz[ing] a presumption against the imposition of a sentence of life without parole for a juvenile offender\" that may be rebutted only if the government proves, \"beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile offender is incapable of rehabilitation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   But the district court's explanation of the sentence may be faulty without requiring that it utter any \"magic phrase\" to justify its sentence, Majority Op. at 819, and we need impose no special procedures simply because Briones was a juvenile when he committed the murder. Instead, I would simply enforce the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) so that we may properly evaluate Briones's\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The error here was not that the district court failed to apply some procedure special to juvenile offenders. Rather, the court failed to provide an adequate explanation of its sentence under the same standard that would apply to any sentencing. It\n   erred because Briones argued that he could not constitutionally be given a life sentence, his arguments were \"not frivolous,\" and the court did not squarely \"address any of them, even to dismiss them in shorthand.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Trujillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3559034,3559571\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/713/1003/\">\n    713 F.3d 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1010 (9th Cir. 2013). Remanding for a new sentencing here would have no bearing on a case in which the defendant does not present a credible argument under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   or one in which the district court explicitly confronted a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   argument about the defendant's incorrigibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Comparing this case to another illustrates that we can reasonably expect more of the district court at sentencing without our being overly pedantic. In another case raising a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   claim, submitted to our panel the same day that Briones's case was argued, the defendant-appellant had committed four murders as a juvenile-including two while facing trial-and in the process had disfigured or dismembered and then buried the victims' bodies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Orsinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20Fed.%20Appx.%20527\">\n    698 Fed.Appx. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (9th Cir. 2017) (unpublished). Two of the victims were a 63-year-old grandmother and her nine-year-old granddaughter, and the defendant had killed the little girl by hand, crushing her head with rocks. We affirmed the life sentence because the district court made clear it had grappled with the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20Fed.%20Appx.%20527\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The fact that another defendant committed even more monstrous crimes than did Briones does not ameliorate the tragedy of an innocent clerk's death or the terror that Briones's gang inflicted on his community. But in that second case with four gruesome murders, and where the defendant had continued to exhibit violence while incarcerated, the sentencing judge nevertheless properly evaluated the objection to a life sentence under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   . That judge \"recognize[d] that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   permits life sentences for juvenile offenders only in 'uncommon' cases\" and \"made a finding that [the defendant] did indeed fit within that 'uncommon' class of juvenile offenders\" to justify imposition of a life sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20Fed.%20Appx.%20527\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    567 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p479\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   That is not to suggest that the district judge in Briones's case could not justifiably impose the same sentence.
