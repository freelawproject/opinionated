While assertions in the patent will not always be enough to create a genuine dispute of material fact, they did so here.

Its only evidence\n   that addressed the additional limitations in claims 4-7 was the conclusory statement from its expert's declaration that the features disclosed and claimed in the '713 patent, including one-to-many changes, \"were known functions at the time the application was filed\" and \"[w]hen combined into a single computerized system, these known features perform[ed] the exact same functions to yield predictable results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1061.

Indeed, beyond its expert's conclusory declaration, HP could point to no evidence in the record contradicting the statements from the specification. Applying the standard for summary judgment in Rule 56, as we must, summary judgment had to be denied as to claims 4-7. Because no genuine issue of fact existed for claims 1-3 and 9, we affirmed the grant of summary judgment that those claims were not eligible. As with claims 1-3 and 9, when the evidence that aspects of the invention are not well-understood, routine, and conventional does not pertain to the invention as claimed, it will not create a factual dispute as to these claims.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mortg.

Thinking further concerning \u00a7 101, but beyond these cases, steps that utilize natural processes, as all mechanical, chemical, and biological steps do, should be patent-eligible, provided they meet the other tests of the statute, including novelty, nonobviousness, and written description. A claim to a natural process itself should not be patentable, not least because it lacks novelty, but also because natural processes should be available to all. But claims to using such processes should not be barred at the threshold of a patentability analysis by being considered natural laws, as a method that utilizes a natural law is not itself a natural law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Supreme Court also held in\n   <em>\n    Association for Molecular Pathology v.

We are all aware of the need for new antibiotics because bacteria have become resistant to our existing products. Nature, including soil and plants, is a fertile possible source of new antibiotics, but there will be much scientific work to be done to find or discover, isolate, and purify any such products before they can be useful to us.

For example, in addressing\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   step two, the\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   panels raised and considered the same, exact question of \"whether the invention describes well-understood, routine, and conventional activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1124\">\n    882 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1129 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1370\">\n    881 F.3d at 1369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After declaring this to be a question of fact, the panels found this question dispositive of the step two analysis. This action has the effect of reducing the entire step two inquiry into what is routine and conventional, rather than determining if an inventive concept expressed in the claims transforms the nature of the claims into a patent-eligible application. Step two is thus divorced from the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Having made this profound change, the court offers no meaningful guidance to the bar, the government, or the public on how to proceed on these new grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For\n   example, to what extent will discovery be allowed to prove or disprove a fact that has been placed in contention? Does this new factual inquiry extend to other aspects of the \u00a7 101 inquiry, such as whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea or a natural phenomenon? Can expert opinion supplant the written description? Does the court or jury determine this factual issue? What deference is due to the fact finder? These and similar questions will have to be addressed and resolved by the district courts.

In\n    <em>\n     Aatrix\n    </em>\n    , Green Shades filed a Petition for Re-hearing\n    <em>\n     En Banc\n    </em>\n    in which it raised two questions essentially similar to the question that HP raises in its\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    petition. As in\n    <em>\n     Berkheimer\n    </em>\n    , the court in\n    <em>\n     Aatrix\n    </em>\n    voted to deny Green Shades's petition for rehearing\n    <em>\n     en banc\n    </em>\n    .

On April 19, 2018, the USPTO issued a memorandum of changes in examination procedure in light of\n    <em>\n     Berkheimer\n    </em>\n    .

The memorandum highlights that, for the first time, this court held that \"whether something is well-understood, routine, and conventional to a skilled artisan at the time of the patent is a factual determination.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1370\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 2 (citing\n    <em>\n     Berkheimer,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1370\">\n     881 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1369 ). Accordingly, the memo \"revises\" the MPEP and changes USPTO examination procedure.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-5. The memorandum provides that now \"an examiner should conclude that an element (or combination of elements) represents well-understood, routine, conventional activity\n    <strong>\n     only\n    </strong>\n    when the examiner can readily conclude that the element(s) is widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant industry\" in step two of the\n    <em>\n     Mayo\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     /\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alice\n    </em>\n    test.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 3.
