The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") determined that Mellow was \"formed and availed of solely for purposes of tax avoidance\" and \"constitute[d] an economic sham.\" Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment Letter, Tax Year Ended: December 31, 1999,\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") 64. On the basis of this determination, IRS commenced partnership-level proceedings under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (\"TEFRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206221\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 6234 (2012), to adjust the partnership items in Mellow's 1999 partnership return. On March 24, 2005, IRS issued to Mellow a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (\"FPAA\") setting forth adjustments to the partnership items, disallowing losses from unlawful transactions, and assessing penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mellow filed a petition with the Tax Court challenging the FPAA. It then moved to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the FPAA was invalid because Mellow was a \"small partnership\" exempt from TEFRA's audit and litigation proceedings under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206231\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). The Tax Court denied the motion. The court held that, as set forth in Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6231(a)(1)-1(a)(2) and other authorities, a partnership\n   does not qualify for the small-partnership exception if any of its partners is a \"pass-thru partner\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206231\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9), and that disregarded single-member LLCs are such pass-thru partners. The Tax Court subsequently entered a decision upholding most of IRS's adjustments to Mellow's partnership return and imposing penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Mellow asserts that the Tax Court erred in rejecting its contention that it qualified for the small-partnership exception to TEFRA. It contends that, pursuant to certain tax-classification regulations, the single-member LLCs' individual owners rather than the LLCs themselves were Mellow's partners for TEFRA purposes and, therefore, Mellow constituted a \"small partnership\" within the plain meaning of \u00a7 6231(a)(1)(B). Mellow also asserts that the Tax Court erred in imposing penalties because IRS failed to obtain the requisite written approval for such penalties, as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206751\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We affirm the Tax Court's holding that Mellow was subject to the TEFRA partnership proceedings. The record makes clear that Mellow's partners were the single-member LLCs, not their individual owners. Moreover, we defer to IRS's reasonable interpretation of its own regulation that a partnership with pass-thru partners is ineligible for the small-partnership exception and that single-member LLCs constitute pass-thru partners. We further hold that we lack jurisdiction over Mellow's challenge to the penalties because Mellow failed to raise its claim below and waived its claim by consenting to a decision applying penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The partnership agreement also states that the partnership was formed \"by and between\" MB 68th Street Investments LLC (\"68th Street\") and WNM Hunters Crest Investments LLC (\"Hunters Crest\") (collectively, \"the single-member LLCs\" or \"the LLCs\").\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Myer Berlow, the sole member of 68th Street, and Mr. William Melton, the sole member of Hunters Crest, signed the partnership agreement on behalf of their respective LLCs. The single-member LLCs did not elect to be treated as associations under the check-the-box tax-classification regulations and therefore were treated as disregarded entities separate from their owners. Accordingly, the LLCs did not file federal income tax returns for the 1999 tax year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In April 2000, Mellow filed a Form 1065 partnership return for the taxable year beginning November 12, 1999 and ending December 29, 1999. Mellow attached to its Form 1065 Schedules K-1,\n   <em>\n    Partner's Share of Income, Credits, Deductions, etc.\n   </em>\n   , which identified 68th Street and Hunters Crest as Mellow's partners.

The FPAA concluded that Mellow \"was formed and availed of solely for purposes of tax avoidance,\" \"lacked economic substance,\" and \"constitute[d] an economic sham for federal income tax purposes.\" Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment Letter, Tax Year Ended: December 31, 1999, J.A. 64.

Whether Mellow Qualified for the \"Small-Partnership\" Exception to TEFRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The central question in this case is whether the Tax Court properly denied Mellow's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction based on its finding that Mellow was subject to the TEFRA partnership provisions. Mellow argues that when a business entity with a single owner is classified as \"disregarded\" under the check-the-box regulations, the entity is treated as a \"nullity\" for all federal tax purposes. Appellant's Br. 21. This means that, in Mellow's view, if a disregarded single-member LLC is a partner in a partnership, it is actually the LLC's owner rather than the LLC itself that is the partner in the partnership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662225,3555058\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/712/581/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, according to Mellow, Mellow's partners here were the single-member LLCs' individual owners (Berlow and Melton), not the two LLCs.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The record makes it absolutely clear that Mellow's partners were the single-member LLCs, not their individual owners. In the proceedings below, Mellow stipulated that \"[a]t all times during the existence of Mellow Partners, its only partners were\" 68th Street and Hunters Crest. J.A. 52-53. Mellow's partnership agreement provides that the agreement was formed \"by and between\" 68th Street and Hunters Crest. J.A. 68. The agreement identifies Hunters Crest as its Managing Partner. And the agreement is signed by Berlow and Melton on behalf of their respective LLCs. Mellow also issued Schedules K-1, reporting each partner's share of income, losses, deductions, and credits, to the two LLCs, and there is no evidence that Schedules K-1 were issued to the LLCs' individual owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, Mellow has offered no pertinent authority, and we are aware of none, stating that a single-member LLC's tax classification under the check-the-box regulations dictates whether the LLC or its sole owner is treated as a partner in a partnership comprised of two single-member LLCs under TEFRA. The check-the-box regulations merely determine \"the tax consequences for\n   <em>\n    that particular entity\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Seaview Trading, LLC v.

For example, it is undisputed that if the entity is disregarded, the owner \"reports the tax consequences of the entity's activities on his own tax return regardless of any independent existence the entity may have under state law and of any limitation on liability the entity may afford its owners\n   under state law.\" Appellee's Br. 33. But the check-the-box regulations do not determine the tax consequences of a \"separate, higher-level partnership\" composed of two or more disregarded entities, nor do they specify who holds a partnership interest for TEFRA purposes.\n   <em>\n    Seaview Trading\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276727\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/858/1281/#p1286\">\n    858 F.3d at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore reject Mellow's claim that the single-member LLCs' classification as disregarded entities meant that the LLCs' individual owners, rather than the LLCs, were Mellow's partners for TEFRA purposes and, therefore, that it qualified for the small-partnership exception under \u00a7 6231(a)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mellow next contends that the Tax Court erred in finding that the single-member LLCs were \"pass-thru partners\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206231\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(9) (2012) and that a partnership with pass-thru partners is ineligible for the small-partnership exception.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellant's Br. 19-20.

We therefore have no grounds whatsoever in this case to question the validity of Treasury Regulation \u00a7 301.6231(a)(1)-1(a)(2) and, accordingly, decline to consider Mellow's vague and unsubstantiated argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutchins v.

The Revenue Ruling makes it clear that a partnership cannot qualify as a small partnership under \u00a7 6231(a)(1)(B) if it has pass-thru partners, and it concludes that a single-member LLC constitutes a pass-thru partner. In reaching this conclusion, the Revenue Ruling highlights that \" 'pass-thru partner' is defined in section 6231(a)(9) as 'a partnership, estate, trust, S corporation,\n   <em>\n    nominee or other similar person through whom other persons hold an interest in the partnership\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%20165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting \u00a7 6231(a)(9) ).

Because A holds an interest in P through LLC, A is an indirect partner and LLC, the disregarded entity, is a pass-thru partner under the TEFRA partnership provisions.\n   <em>\n    Consequently, the small partnership exception does not apply to P because P has a partner that is a pass-thru partner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%20165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   IRS's position has been unwavering and consistently sustained by the Tax Court.

We find no merit in this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Mellow's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   and the various Tax Court decisions that post-date\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   is misplaced because in each of those cases the parties or the Tax Court acting\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   raised the \u00a7 6751(b)(1) issue while the dispute remained pending in the Tax Court. Here, however, Mellow did not raise its \u00a7 6751(b)(1) challenge at any point during the Tax Court proceedings. Nothing precluded Mellow from doing so. Section 6751 has been in existence since 1998.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,\n   Pub. L. No. 105-206, \u00a7 3306(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20Stat.%20685\">\n    112 Stat. 685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744. Mellow was free to raise the same, straightforward statutory interpretation argument the taxpayer in\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   made-that is, that the language of \u00a7 6751(b)(1) requires IRS to obtain written approval by a certain point in the process in order to impose penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In this regard, we find the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kaufman v. Commissioner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181902\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/56/\">\n    784 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2015) -which was issued prior to\n   <em>\n    Chai\n   </em>\n   -more apposite here. There, the First Circuit held that the taxpayer had not preserved his argument that the Commissioner did not comply with the written-approval requirement in \u00a7 6751(b)(1) by failing to raise it in the Tax Court proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181902\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/56/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181902\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/56/\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the court refused to consider the claim in the first instance on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This reasoning applies with equal force here. Accordingly, we decline to consider or remand Mellow's penalties claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
