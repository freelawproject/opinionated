U.S. Const. amend. IV. Karl Touset appeals the denial of his motions to suppress the child pornography found on electronic devices that he carried with him when he entered the country and the fruit of later searches. We recently held that the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant or probable cause for a forensic search of a cell phone at the border.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Touset argues that, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Riley v. California\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), reasonable suspicion was required for the forensic searches of his electronic devices. But our precedents about border searches of property make clear that no suspicion is necessary to search electronic devices at the border. Alternatively, the border agents had reasonable suspicion to search Touset's electronic devices. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a series of investigations by private organizations and the government suggested that Karl Touset was involved with child pornography, border agents forensically searched his electronic devices after he arrived at the Atlanta airport on an international flight. Xoom, a company that transmits money, identified several people it suspected were involved with child pornography based on a pattern of \"frequent low money transfers to\" individuals in \"source countries for sex tourism and child pornography,\" including the Philippines. Xoom alerted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and notified Yahoo because some of the people it suspected were involved with child pornography used Yahoo email and messenger accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Yahoo then conducted its own investigation into the accounts identified by Xoom and found a file with child pornography in the account for the email address iloveyousomuch0820@yahoo.com. This email account listed a phone number in the Philippines. Yahoo then sent tips to the National Center, which notified the Cyber Crime Center of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While performing its own investigation, the Cyber Center subpoenaed transaction data related to the iloveyousomuch0820@yahoo.com email account and the Philippine phone number associated with it from several companies that transmit money. One of those companies, Western Union, provided information about an account associated with the Philippine phone number. The information established that an account that listed Touset's name and a post office box in Marietta, Georgia, had sent three payments to the account associated with the Philippine phone number. In March 2013, the account associated with Touset sent a payment of $35 to the account associated with the Philippine phone number; in April 2013, it sent another payment of $35; and in July 2013, it sent a payment of $37. Based on this information, the Department placed a \"look-out\" on Touset so that his luggage and electronic devices would be searched when he returned to the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Touset arrived on an international flight at the airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 21, 2014, Derek Escobar, an officer of the Customs and Border Protection Agency, inspected Touset's luggage. Touset had two iPhones, a camera, two laptops, two external hard drives, and two tablets. Escobar manually inspected the iPhones and the camera, found no child pornography, and returned those devices to Touset. But the Agency detained the remaining electronic devices, and computer forensic analysts at the Department later searched them. Forensic searches revealed child pornography on the two laptops and the two external hard drives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Based on that information, Dianna Ford, a special agent of the Department, obtained a warrant to search Touset's home in Marietta, Georgia. Ford and about 14 other agents executed the warrant on January 28, 2015. During the execution of the warrant, Ford and another agent read Touset his rights under\n   <em>\n    Miranda v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    384 U.S. 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    86 S.Ct. 1602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12046400\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/384/436/\">\n    16 L.Ed.2d 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966), and recorded an interview with him. Ford arrested Touset after that interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evidence obtained by the government established that Touset purchased thousands of images of child pornography. Over the course of several years, Touset sent more than $55,000 to the Philippines for pornographic pictures, videos, and webcam sessions. In some webcam sessions, he instructed prepubescent girls to display and manipulate their genitals. Touset also created an Excel spreadsheet that documented the names, ages, and birthdates of\n   those young girls as well as his notes about them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A grand jury indicted Touset on three counts: knowingly receiving child pornography,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) &amp; (b)(1) ; knowingly transporting and shipping child pornography,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) &amp; (b)(1) ; and knowingly possessing a computer and computer-storage device containing child pornography,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) &amp; (b)(2). Touset initially pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Touset filed motions to suppress the evidence obtained from his electronic devices at the border, as well as the fruit of those searches. After an evidentiary hearing at which Escobar and Ford testified, the magistrate judge recommended denying Touset's motions to suppress. The magistrate judge explained that the parties agreed that the government \"needed reasonable suspicion of criminal activity in order to lawfully detain for further analysis and search [Touset's] electronic devices.\" The magistrate judge found that reasonable suspicion was present because \"[t]he collective information of the officers allowed the reasonable inference that Touset had made three small payments through Western Union to an entity in the Philippines, a country known for child exploitation,\" and that entity \"used an email address that had previously received or sent child pornography.\" And the magistrate judge rejected Touset's argument that, because his most recent payment to the Western Union account associated with the Philippine phone number occurred about one and a half years before his electronic devices were searched, that evidence was stale. Instead, the magistrate judge found that the evidence of Touset's payments was not stale because \"[f]iles on a computer are less likely than other types of contraband to disappear over time and can often be recovered even if they are deleted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court adopted the magistrate judge's report and recommendation over Touset's objections. The district court relied on the decision of the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545805\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/952/#p968\">\n    709 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (9th Cir. 2013) (en banc), and concluded that reasonable suspicion is required for a forensic search of electronic devices at the border. The district court found that reasonable suspicion existed for the detention and forensic search of Touset's electronic devices. And the district court agreed with the magistrate judge that the evidence was not stale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Touset pleaded guilty to knowingly transporting child pornography, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. The government dismissed the other two counts. And the district court sentenced Touset to 120 months of imprisonment and supervision for life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The evidence that Touset made three separate payments to the Western Union account associated with the Philippine phone number was not stale about a year and a half later. That evidence suggested that Touset likely received child pornography electronically and had child pornography stored on his electronic devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   Touset's judgment of conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   CORRIGAN, District Judge, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I concur in the majority opinion, except as to Part III.A. As the Court notes, the Fourth and Ninth Circuits have concluded that the Fourth Amendment requires at least reasonable suspicion for forensic searches of electronic devices at the border.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 1234, citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kolsuz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516927\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/133/#p144\">\n    890 F.3d 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144, No. 16-4687,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202122085\">\n    2018 WL 2122085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. May 9, 2018), and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cotterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3545805\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/952/#p968\">\n    709 F.3d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 968 (9th Cir. 2013). In the district court, the government agreed that the applicable Fourth Amendment test was whether there was reasonable suspicion of criminal activity such that border agents could detain Touset's electronic devices for forensic analysis. The district court found reasonable suspicion and upheld the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, on appeal, the government goes beyond its position in the district court and argues that border agents need no justification whatsoever to detain (in this case for seventeen days) and forensically\n   search electronic devices of any American citizen returning from abroad. This new-found government position presents a different and difficult question, one not addressed by the Supreme Court or (until today) any appellate court. In my view, this Court need not reach this issue to decide this case. I therefore concur only in the Court's alternative holding that \"the district court correctly denied Touset's motions to suppress because the forensic searches of his electronic devices were supported by reasonable suspicion.\" Maj. Op. at 1237.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
