This appeal presents the question whether such \"anti-assignment clauses\" are enforceable, or whether, as argued by the healthcare provider in this case whose claim was dismissed for lack of standing, they are antithetical to the Employee Retirement\n   Income Security Act (\"ERISA\") and to public policy. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that anti-assignment clauses in ERISA-governed health insurance plans are enforceable, and we will therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2015, Appellant American Orthopedic and Sports Medicine performed shoulder surgery on \"Joshua,\" a patient who was covered by a health insurance plan issued by Appellees (the \"Insurers\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the surgery, Appellant charged Joshua for the procedure. Because Appellant did not participate in the Insurers' network, it was not limited to the fee schedule prescribed by the Insurers. Instead, it charged Joshua a total of $58,400 and submitted a claim in that amount to the Insurers on Joshua's behalf. The claim form identified the various medical services rendered to Joshua and indicated that he had \"authorize[d] payment of medical benefits\" to Appellant. J.A. 38. As Appellant's charges far exceeded the plan's allowed reimbursement, the Insurers responded by processing Joshua's claim according to its out-of-network cap of $2,633, applying his deductible of $2,000 and his 50% coinsurance of $316, issuing him a small reimbursement check for the remaining $316, and informing him that he would still owe Appellant the remaining $58,083.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dissatisfied, Appellant appealed its claim through the Insurers' internal administrative process. At the same time, it arranged for Joshua to sign a document entitled \"Assignment of Benefits &amp; Ltd. Power of Attorney,\" which reflected that Joshua was assigning to Appellant his right to pursue claims under his health insurance plan for the surgery and, in the alternative, that he granted to Appellant a limited power of attorney to recover the payment on his behalf through an arbitration or lawsuit. J.A. 36. After the Insurers apparently denied the appeal, Appellant sued them in New Jersey state court for violations of ERISA and its implementing regulations, and for breach of contract. At that point, the Insurers removed the suit to federal court and moved to dismiss, pointing out that Joshua's insurance plan included an anti-assignment clause that stated, \"[t]he right of a Member to receive benefit payments under this Program is personal to the Member and\n   <em>\n    is not assignable\n   </em>\n   in whole or in part to any person, Hospital, or other entity,\" Independence Response to Court Letter *90 (filed Nov. 10, 2017) (emphasis added),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and arguing that Appellant therefore lacked standing to sue.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Appellant contends it has standing to sue here, first, because anti-assignment clauses in ERISA-governed health insurance contracts are unenforceable against healthcare providers and, second, because even if those clauses are enforceable, the Insurers waived their right to enforce it in this case. If we conclude the anti-assignment clause here is enforceable against healthcare providers, Appellant raises a third argument in the alternative, i.e., that we should remand to allow it an opportunity to correct the deficiencies in Joshua's Power of Attorney and pursue Joshua's claims on his behalf in an agency capacity. We address these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A. Enforceability of Anti-Assignment Clauses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The parties stake out opposing views on the enforceability of anti-assignment clauses, grounding their positions in ERISA's text, congressional policy, and persuasive authority from other Courts of Appeals. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that none justify a departure from the general rule that courts will enforce the terms of an agreement that was freely negotiated between contracting parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    ERISA's Text\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ERISA is a \"comprehensive legislative scheme\" designed to \"protect ... the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries,\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Health Inc. v.

But in\n   <em>\n    NJBSC\n   </em>\n   we merely held-in the absence of an anti-assignment clause-that \"when a patient assigns payment of insurance benefits to a healthcare provider, [the] provider gains standing to sue for that payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . We had no occasion to address the effect or enforceability of an anti-assignment clause, and thus, despite Appellant's heavy reliance on that case, it has little bearing here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Insurers, on the other hand, posit that if Congress had intended to prohibit anti-assignment clauses in ERISA-governed health insurance plans, it would have done so explicitly, just as it did in the pension plan context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, notably, as anti-assignment clauses have become an increasingly prominent feature of health insurance contracts in more recent years, Congress also has had ample opportunity to mandate assignability if indeed that were its intent. Yet despite repeated amendments and a largescale overhaul of the healthcare system via the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L.

In a comprehensive regulatory scheme like ERISA, such omissions are significant ones.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224652\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/825/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224652\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/825/\">\n    at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224652\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/825/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Some Courts of Appeals have concluded, based in part on that language from\n   <em>\n    Mackey\n   </em>\n   , that Congress' silence on assignability of welfare benefits means anti-assignment clauses in the health insurance context must be enforceable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davidowitz v.

The absence of statutory language prohibiting assignment in the welfare context may indicate that Congress intended to preserve the rights of individual plan beneficiaries to assign their benefits. But that silence does not necessarily mean Congress intended to permit plan trustees to extinguish those rights for all beneficiaries through a blanket contractual waiver. In fact, two considerations\n   point the other way. First, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Mackey\n   </em>\n   emphasized that Congress' intent in \"bar[ring] the alienation\" of pension benefits was to protect pensioners.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224652\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/825/\">\n    486 U.S. at 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6224652\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/825/\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet while prohibiting assignment in the pension context \"ensure[s] that the employee's accrued benefits are actually available for retirement purposes,\" H.R. Rep. No. 93-807, at 68 (1974), prohibiting assignment in the health insurance context, as Appellant argues, could disadvantage patients with shorter-term needs, limit patient choices, and eventually reduce out-of-network providers' market share. Second, unlike in the pension context, assignment of plan benefits has been \"fairly ubiquitous\" in the health insurance context-particularly assignment of claims to the service provider that performed the service for which the claim is being submitted. Gregory F. Jacob,\n   <em>\n    Provider \"Standing\" Wars Continue\n   </em>\n   , 24 No. 3 ERISA Litig. Rep., Sept. 2016, at 4. Thus, Congress may have intended a continuation of the status quo and simply perceived no need to state expressly that insureds retained a right to assign their benefits to their service providers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In short, the text of ERISA, even with the interpretations in\n   <em>\n    NJBSC\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Mackey\n   </em>\n   , is inconclusive on the question we address today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Congressional Policy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because ERISA does not clearly prohibit anti-assignment clauses, we confront a statutory gap yet to be filled. And when it comes to ERISA, \"it is well settled that Congress intended that the federal courts would fill in [such] gaps by developing, in light of reason, experience, and common sense, a federal common law of rights and obligations imposed by the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Teamsters Pension Tr.

Appellant construes \"access to care\" narrowly, focusing on whether individual patients' choices are limited, and arguing that enforcing anti-assignment clauses creates incentives for providers not to serve out-of-network patients with such clauses in their plans because providers will have no remedy for nonpayment other than to sue patients-a proposition that is both expensive and bad for business. And eventually, Appellant asserts, the widespread use of anti-assignment clauses will drive out-of-network providers out of business entirely, reducing the choices available to patients. That is because instead of being able to recover directly from the insurer, out-of-network providers will be forced to rely on the patient to recover from that insurer before seeking payment, in turn, from the patient, with each step along the way adding to the risk of default.

For those reasons, the District Court correctly held that Appellant lacked standing to proceed in federal court, and we will affirm the District Court's judgment of dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The Insurers are Independence Blue Cross Blue Shield and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, both of which are licensees of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
