We conclude the enhancement applies even when the bank robber accidentally kills someone. The enhancement does not require a separate mens rea; the only mens rea required\n   is the mens rea necessary to commit the underlying bank robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 16, 2013, Van McDuffy entered a Bank of America branch in Reno, Nevada, brandished a handgun, and demanded money from one of the bank tellers. The teller took the money from the till, put it in a plastic bag, and handed it to McDuffy. At that moment, Charles Sperry (a bank customer) attempted to grab the gun from McDuffy. However, \"as he went to grab the gun, [McDuffy] shot him in the chest.\" Sperry subsequently died from his wound. After shooting Sperry, McDuffy did not end the robbery. Instead, he calmly approached another teller and forced her to hand over the money from her till. With the money in hand, McDuffy then fled the bank. An off-duty police officer who was in the bank during the robbery pursued McDuffy and apprehended him at a nearby bus stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The government charged McDuffy with violating several sections of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 2113, which criminalize various acts of theft perpetrated against banks. Section 2113(a) criminalizes generic bank robbery,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275274\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/782/#p786\">\n    881 F.3d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (9th Cir. 2018) ; \u00a7 2113(d) provides an enhanced sentence if the bank robber assaults any person with a dangerous weapon; and \u00a7 2113(e) provides a further enhanced sentence \"if death results\" from the defendant's conduct during the bank robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 2113(e) does not contain an explicit mens rea requirement. Nevertheless, McDuffy urged the district court to read a mens rea requirement into \u00a7 2113(e). He argued that the enhancement in \u00a7 2113(e) should apply only when a bank robber \"knowingly\" kills a person in the course of a bank robbery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court rejected this argument and instructed the jury that, to find McDuffy guilty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   the government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   First, the defendant took money belonging to or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of Bank of America, using force and violence, or intimidation in doing so, and intentionally made a display of force that reasonably caused another person to fear bodily harm by using a firearm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, while doing so, the defendant killed Charles Barton Sperry; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Third, the deposits of Bank of America were then insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found McDuffy guilty. Consequently, the district court sentenced McDuffy to life imprisonment, as provided in \u00a7 2113(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   McDuffy appeals, claiming the district court misstated the law when it instructed the jury that \u00a7 2113(e) applies to accidental killings. \"Whether a jury instruction misstates the law, an element of the crime, or the burden of proof is ... subject to de novo review.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On de novo review, we find \u00a7 2113(e) does not contain a separate requirement\n   that the defendant intend the killing which results from his bank robbery (hereafter, the \"mens rea requirement\"). Thus, the enhancement applies even if a bank robber accidentally kills someone in the course of a bank robbery. In relevant part, \u00a7 2113 directs that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) Whoever by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another ... any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to ... any bank ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (d) Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person ... by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (e) Whoever, in committing any offense defined in this section ... if death results shall be punished by death or life imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d), (e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

Thus, \"[t]he common denominator to the decisions affirming convictions under \u00a7 2113(d) is that the robber\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   made one or more victims at the scene of the robbery aware that he had a gun, real or not.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9129756\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/329/1032/#p1035\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

The language of \u00a7 2113(e) does not contain an explicit mens rea requirement. However, the Supreme Court has determined that, even when a statute does not specify a mens rea, \"[s]ome indication of congressional intent, express or implied, is required to dispense with mens rea as an element of a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Staples v.

The text and structure of \u00a7 2113(e) indicate Congress intended to omit a mens rea requirement. Section 2113(e) makes no mention of a mens rea and even describes the killing in the passive voice (\"if death results\"). These facts suggest Congress intended to omit a mens rea requirement.\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p570\">\n    556 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p570\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the structure of \u00a7 2113 indicates that the omission was purposeful. \"[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p570\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p570\">\n    at 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653381\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/568/#p570\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Russello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n    464 U.S. at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6193045\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/464/16/#p23\">\n    104 S.Ct. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Congress specifically\n   included mens rea requirements in certain subsections of \u00a7 2113. For example \u00a7 2113(b) requires \"intent to steal or purloin\" and \u00a7 2113(c) criminalizes possession of property stolen from a bank but only if the defendant knows the property is stolen. In contrast, Congress was silent in \u00a7 2113(e) regarding mens rea. Thus, we conclude that Congress intended to omit a separate mens rea requirement in \u00a7 2113(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even assuming Congress's omission was not purposeful, we follow\n   <em>\n    Dean\n   </em>\n   ; there is no need to read a mens rea requirement into \u00a7 2113(e). The enhancement applies only when the defendant is guilty of an underlying \"basic crime\" such as bank robbery.
