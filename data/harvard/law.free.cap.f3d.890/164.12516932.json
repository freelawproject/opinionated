SB4 prohibits local authorities from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and it requires local officers to comply with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") detainer requests. In their pre-enforcement lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged a battery of constitutional violations: (I) SB4 is preempted by federal immigration law, (II) SB4's \"endorse\" prohibition violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, (III) SB4's ICE-detainer mandate violates the Fourth Amendment, and (IV) SB4's phrase \"materially limits\" is unconstitutionally vague under the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court issued a preliminary injunction, enjoining several of the law's provisions. Texas appeals the injunction, and the plaintiffs cross-appeal the district court's refusal to issue a broader injunction. With one exception, SB4's provisions do not, on their face, violate the Constitution. For the following reasons, we uphold the statute in its entirety except for the application of the \"endorsement\" prohibition, Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 752.053(a)(1), to elected officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Senate Bill 4\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In May 2017, the Texas Legislature enacted Senate Bill 4 to prohibit sanctuary city policies. The law imposes duties on certain state officials and provides civil and criminal liability for violations of those duties. Three parts of the law are critical to this case: (A) the immigration-enforcement provisions, (B) the ICE-detainer mandate, and (C) the penalty provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Immigration-Enforcement Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As codified at Texas Government Code \u00a7 752.053(a) - (b), SB4 forbids local entities\n   from limiting the enforcement of federal immigration law. Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of Section 752.053 provide broad prohibitions. Under subsection (a)(1), a local entity may not \"adopt, enforce, or endorse a policy under which [it] prohibits or materially limits\" immigration enforcement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.053(a)(1). After subsection (a)(1) deals with anti-cooperation \"policies,\" subsection (a)(2) further prohibits any \"pattern or practice\" that similarly frustrates enforcement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.053(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Following the general prohibitions in (a)(1) and (a)(2), subsection (b) enumerates concrete examples of immigration-enforcement activities that a local entity may not \"prohibit or materially limit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.053(b). These include (b)(1) \"inquiring into the immigration status\" of lawfully detained individuals, (b)(2) sharing immigration-status information with federal agencies, and (b)(3) \"assisting or cooperating with a federal immigration officer as reasonable or necessary, including providing enforcement assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.053(b)(1)-(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The prohibitions in Section 752.053 apply broadly to any \"local entity or campus police department.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.053(a)-(c). SB4 defines \"local entity\" to include the governing bodies of counties and municipalities as well as officers or employees of those authorities, including \"a sheriff, municipal police department, municipal attorney,[ ] county attorney[,] ... district attorney or criminal district attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.051(5)(A)-(C). But SB4 excludes hospitals, school districts, and certain community centers-as well as officers employed by these institutions-from the law's requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.052(a)-(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ICE-detainer Mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As codified at Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 2.251, SB4's ICE-detainer mandate requires law-enforcement agencies to comply with detainer requests submitted by ICE. An ICE detainer is a written request to state or local officials, asking them (1) to notify the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") as soon as practicable before an alien is released and (2) to maintain custody of the alien for up to 48 hours beyond the preexisting release date so that DHS may assume custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As of April 2017, ICE must make this request using Form I-247A, which must be accompanied by a signed administrative warrant. Form I-247A states that DHS has determined that there is probable cause that the subject of the request is a removable alien, and ICE officers check one of four boxes on the form to indicate the basis for probable cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   SB4's ICE-detainer mandate applies whenever \"[a] law enforcement agency [ ] has custody of a person subject to\" an ICE detainer. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 2.251(a). Under subsection (a), the mandate requires law enforcement agencies to \"comply with, honor, and fulfill\" ICE's requests.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . It also requires that the individual in custody be informed he \"is being held pursuant to\" an ICE detainer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 2.251(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Subsection (b) provides a lone exception to the detainer mandate: law enforcement\n   agencies need not comply with detainers if shown \"proof that the person is a citizen of the United States or ... has lawful immigration status.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 2.251(b).

Penalty Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   SB4 is enforced through civil and criminal penalties by Texas's Attorney General. Private citizens may file complaints with the Attorney General, alleging by sworn statement that a local entity is violating the enforcement provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 752.055(a). Upon determining that such a complaint is valid, the Attorney General may file suit in state court to enforce the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 752.055(b). If a court finds there has been a violation, local entities may be subject to fines of $1,000 to $1,500 for a first violation and $25,000 to $25,500 for subsequent ones, with each day of continuing violation constituting a separate violation.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 752.056(a)-(b). If the Attorney General is presented with evidence that a public officer has violated the enforcement provisions, SB4\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the Attorney General to file an enforcement action.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 752.0565(b). Public officers found guilty of violating the law are subject to removal from office.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 752.0565(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   SB4 makes certain officials' failure to comply with SB4's ICE-detainer provision a misdemeanor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 39.07(a) - (c). SB4 further requires Texas to indemnify local entities against any claim arising out of their good-faith compliance with an ICE-detainer request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 402.0241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Prior Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Before SB4 could go into effect, several Texas cities, counties, local law-enforcement and city officials, and advocacy groups challenged the law in three consolidated actions. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction, and the district court found the plaintiffs likely to prevail on the following claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   \u2022 Section 752.053(b)(3)'s assistance-cooperation provision is field and conflict preempted by federal immigration law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   \u2022 Section 752.053(a)(1)'s \"endorse\" prohibition violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it is overbroad, discriminates on the basis of viewpoint, and is unconstitutionally vague;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 Section 752.053(a)(1) and (a)(2)'s \"materially limits\" prohibitions are unconstitutionally vague under the Fourteenth Amendment; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 Article 2.251's ICE-detainer mandate violates the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Enjoining these provisions, the district court nevertheless rejected the plaintiffs' claims that SB4 was preempted more generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Following the district court's order, Texas moved this court to stay the injunction pending appeal. The stay panel granted the motion in part, finding Texas likely to prevail on the Fourth Amendment and preemption claims, and stayed the injunction as to article 2.251's ICE-detainer mandate and Section 752.053(b)(3)'s assistance-cooperation provision.\n   <em>\n    City of El Cenizo v.

The district court found that Section 1357 demonstrates Congress's intent to retain oversight over local immigration enforcement. But SB4 does nothing to strip oversight from the Federal Government. In its operation, SB4 is similar to one of the city ordinances some plaintiffs have themselves adopted. These ordinances regulate whether and to what extent the local entities will participate in federal-local immigration enforcement cooperation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   SB4 accomplishes the same goal on a state-wide level.

The plaintiffs argue\n   that this provision is preempted for three reasons: (1) it permits unilateral local immigration enforcement, (2) it authorizes local officers to perform immigration-officer functions without a 287g agreement, and (3) it conflicts with the federal purpose that local cooperation in immigration enforcement be entirely voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The plaintiffs' first argument misconstrues the statute.

SB4's assistance-cooperation provision does not permit local officials to act without federal direction and supervision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The plaintiffs' second argument suggests that subsection (b)(3) conflicts with federal law by allowing local officers to engage in immigration-officer functions absent the requirements imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). The plaintiffs stress that these requirements-a written agreement, training, and direct supervision by DHS-ensure that immigration enforcement adheres to congressional priorities and prevents the mistreatment of noncitizens. Section 752.053(b)(3) allegedly ignores these requirements, thereby undermining federal law's delicate balance of statutory objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This argument discounts the savings clause in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(10)(B), which explicitly provides that a 287(g) agreement is\n   <em>\n    not required\n   </em>\n   for states \"otherwise to cooperate ... in the identification, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States.\" This provision indicates that Congress intended local cooperation without a formal agreement in a range of key enforcement functions. The plaintiffs rely on the word \"otherwise\" to argue that permissible cooperation must categorically exclude activities allowed under 287(g) agreements. We disagree. The savings clause clarifies that a 287(g) agreement is not required \"(A) to communicate ... or (B) otherwise to cooperate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1357(g)(10)(A)-(B). In context, the word \"otherwise\" refers to subsection (A) and explains that subsection (B) permits cooperation\n   <em>\n    beyond\n   </em>\n   communication-communication itself being a form of cooperation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs are wrong to suggest that this interpretation makes 287(g)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   agreements superfluous. Under these agreements, state and local officials become de facto immigration officers, competent to act on their own initiative. By contrast, Section 1357(g)(10)(B) and SB4's assistance-cooperation provision permit no unilateral enforcement activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The plaintiffs also contend that this savings clause allows for only case-by-case cooperation. Yet a \"case-by-case\" qualifier is absent from the statute's text. DHS guidance relied on by the plaintiffs also fails to support their argument. This guidance critiques \"systematic\" local enforcement that \"conflicts with the policies or priorities set by the Federal Government or limits the ability of the Federal Government to exercise discretion under federal law whenever it deems appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   State action under SB4's assistance-cooperation provision will not conflict with federal priorities or limit federal discretion in this way because it requires a predicate federal request. DHS guidance does not suggest that subsection (b)(3) authorizes conduct beyond what is allowed by Section 1357(g)(B)(10)'s savings clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The plaintiffs' third conflict argument unnecessarily reads a preemptive purpose into federal law; they claim that subsection (b)(3) makes\n   <em>\n    mandatory\n   </em>\n   what Congress intended to be\n   <em>\n    voluntary\n   </em>\n   . To support this argument, the plaintiffs observe that Section 1357(g) refers to both a \"State\" and a \"political subdivision,\" and they infer that Congress\n   <em>\n    specifically intended\n   </em>\n   that \"political subdivisions\" be able to choose whether to cooperate in immigration enforcement. The plaintiffs support this reading by pointing to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which-somewhat like SB4's information-sharing provision-prohibits states and local entities from refusing to share federal immigration-status information. According to the plaintiffs, Section 1373 proves that Congress could have required political subdivisions to cooperate more generally, but expressly chose not to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The plaintiffs' arguments fail for two reasons. First, recent Supreme Court decisions in this area undermine this implied congressional purpose. In\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Supreme Court upheld state laws\n   <em>\n    mandating\n   </em>\n   immigration-status inquiries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 411-415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2508-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Whiting\n   </em>\n   , the Court upheld a state law\n   <em>\n    mandating\n   </em>\n   that employers check immigration status with an electronic-verification system.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12459536,5961428\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/582/\">\n    563 U.S. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12459536,5961428\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/582/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 1968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1987,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12459536,5961428\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/582/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (concluding that state law fell within the Immigration Reform and Control Act's savings clause). In neither case did federal law require these status inquiries. Yet the Supreme Court did not suggest that the states' requirements conflicted with the congressional desire for\n   <em>\n    voluntary\n   </em>\n   cooperation. Indeed, the Court has repeatedly rejected a \"freewheeling judicial inquiry into whether a state statute is in tension with federal objectives\" because \"such an endeavor would undercut the principle that it is Congress rather than the courts that preempts state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Whiting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12459536,5961428\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/582/\">\n    563 U.S. at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12459536,5961428\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/582/\">\n    131 S.Ct. at 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, and as noted earlier, the plaintiffs have admitted that, under the Tenth Amendment, Congress could not compel local entities to enforce immigration\n   law. If that is the case, Congress did not choose to make these laws voluntary; it could not have made them mandatory. Section 1373 itself has not been immune from Tenth Amendment scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of New York v.

Together with the shaky foundation of the plaintiffs' imputed purpose, the Tenth Amendment implications show that SB4's assistance-cooperation provision does not conflict with federal law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Status-Inquiry and Information-Sharing Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Section 752.053(b)(1) of the Texas Government Code, the status-inquiry provision, forbids local entities from preventing officers from \"inquiring into the immigration status of a person under a lawful detention or under arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 752.053(b)(1). Subsection (b)(2), the information-sharing provision, forbids local entities from preventing officers from maintaining immigration-status information and sharing it with federal agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 752.053(b)(2). Because the\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   Court upheld equivalent sections of a state statute, the plaintiffs' arguments are insufficient to establish a conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that subsection (b)(1) authorizes \"interrogation,\" which is an immigration-officer function under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201357\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(a)(1). But it is not clear why SB4's status-inquiry provision authorizes impermissible conduct but the provision upheld in\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   did not. In\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   , the state law required local officers to make a \"reasonable attempt ... to determine the immigration status\" of anyone who has been lawfully detained if \"reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien and is unlawfully present in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 1373, however, does not comprise any comprehensive regulatory framework with which SB4 could conflict. As noted above, the Tenth Amendment would likely preclude Congress from enforcing Section 1373 with the penalties provided by SB4. Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   Court emphasized that Congress \"has encouraged the sharing of information about possible immigration violations.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court recognized that the verbs \"promotes\" and \"presents\" were \"susceptible of multiple and wide-ranging meanings,\" which would, like a broad construction of \"endorse,\" cover much protected speech.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . To avoid the First Amendment problem, the Court used\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   to narrow \"promotes\" and \"presents\" to their \"transactional connotation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Using\n   <em>\n    noscitur a sociis\n   </em>\n   here to limit \"endorse\" to the meaning it shares with \"adopt\" and \"enforce\" renders \"endorse\" either superfluous or meaningless. To the extent that all three verbs connote the\n   exercise of government authority to develop and administer policy, \"endorse\" (as interpreted by the state to mean \"officially sanction\") adds nothing of substance to the prohibitions against an entity's actually \"adopting\" or \"enforcing\" policies at odds with SB4. Without putting action behind his \"sanction,\" an official who merely \"endorses\" impermissible policies has not \"adopted\" or \"enforced\" them, no matter the amount of speech he has devoted to that end. The official's \"sanction\" is toothless. Alternatively, if an official's \"sanction\" is functionally equivalent to \"adopting\" or \"enforcing\" impermissible policies, the word becomes wholly redundant. There is no generic context, like the \"transactional context\" noted in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , in which \"endorse,\" read to mean \"sanction,\" conveys additional meaning to this provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Second, that the clause following \"endorse\" prohibits the endorsement of \"a policy under which\n   <em>\n    the entity or department\n   </em>\n   limits the enforcement of immigration laws\" does not support the state's narrow interpretation of \"endorse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 752.053(a)(1) (emphasis added). Granted, under this qualifying phrase, SB4 does not regulate any statements approving hypothetical policies or the policies of any other entity of government. But as we have explained, the \"endorsement\" as \"sanction\" of policies contrary to SB4, without accompanying action to \"adopt\" or \"enforce\" such policies, is \"mere\" core political speech. This provision's qualifying language accentuates the overlap between \"official\" and \"individual\" speech that the state erroneously attempts to deny. As the plaintiffs point out, under the state's rationale, a local sheriff may violate SB4 by answering questions at a local town hall meeting or press conference or testifying to a legislative committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In sum, we are unpersuaded that, taken in context, \"endorse\" \"readily\" bears the restrictive meaning urged by the state. As written, SB4 proscribes core political speech when such \"endorsement\" is uttered by elected officials. The state cannot regulate the substance of elected officials' speech under the First Amendment without passing the strict scrutiny test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

They cite\n   <em>\n    Lunn v.

Here the ICE-detainer mandate itself authorizes and requires state officers to carry out federal detention requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The plaintiffs next contend that the Fourth Amendment requirement is not satisfied when officers must unthinkingly accept an agency's conclusions without taking into account facts tending to dissipate probable cause. Subsection (b) of article 2.251 allegedly fails to cure this defect because it forces local officers to make removal-status determinations, running afoul of\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Farmers Branch\n   </em>\n   . This argument proves too much. Implicitly, the plaintiffs' argument would invalidate any compliance with ICE detainers: officers\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   make their own removal-status determinations to satisfy the Fourth Amendment but officers\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   make such determinations under\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Farmers Branch\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The plaintiffs' argument misconstrues the relevant precedents. Neither\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Farmers Branch\n   </em>\n   undermines subsection (b).\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   denied state officers the power to unilaterally make removability determinations because \"[a] decision on removability requires a determination whether it is appropriate to allow a foreign national to continue living in the United States\" and such decisions \"touch on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.\"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. at 2506-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise,\n   <em>\n    Farmers Branch\n   </em>\n   invalidated an ordinance requiring building inspectors to conduct their own \"unlawful\n   presence\" inquiries.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073640\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/524/#p560\">\n    726 F.3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both cases involved unilateral status-determinations\n   <em>\n    absent federal direction\n   </em>\n   . But subsection (b) operates only when there is already federal direction-namely, an ICE-detainer request-and the subsection merely limits the scope of the officer's duty to comply with that request. It remains the ICE agent who makes the underlying removability determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The plaintiffs are also wrong to suggest that the ICE-detainer mandate requires officers to ignore facts that negate probable cause. Subsection (b) should cover the majority of cases where facts negate probable cause: indeed, it is difficult to imagine what facts other than valid forms of identification would\n   <em>\n    conclusively\n   </em>\n   negate ICE's probable cause determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that there could be such facts, Texas and the United States as\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   dispute that local officers would be required to ignore them. They argue that the verbs \"[c]omply with, honor, and fulfill\" require cooperation-not blind obedience. This seems reasonable given the assumption that ICE should have no interest in detaining aliens when local officials communicate that the original determination was flawed. Nevertheless, even if the mandate could hypothetically cause a violation, this possibility is not enough to substantiate a facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Likewise, none of the cases the plaintiffs cite indicates that the detainer mandate is facially invalid. In\n   <em>\n    Santos v. Frederick County Board of Commissioners\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit held that, \"absent express direction or authorization by federal statute or federal officials, state and local law enforcement officers may not detain or arrest an individual solely based on known or suspected civil violations of federal immigration law.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070804\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/451/#p465\">\n    725 F.3d 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 465 (4th Cir. 2013). Thus, the seizure in\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   violated the Fourth Amendment because the officers detained Santos \"before dispatch confirmed with ICE that the warrant was active.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 466. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Melendres v. Arpaio\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit rejected unilateral detention \"based solely on reasonable suspicion or knowledge that a person was unlawfully present in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3528147\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/695/990/#p1000\">\n    695 F.3d 990\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1000 (9th Cir. 2012). As in\n   <em>\n    Santos\n   </em>\n   , there was no federal request for assistance before the seizure.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, these decisions do not affect the ICE-detainer mandate, which always requires a predicate federal request before local officers may detain aliens for the additional 48 hours. The validity of this sort of compliance has been affirmed by at least one circuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ovando-Garzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308729\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/1161/#p1164\">\n    752 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1164 (8th Cir. 2014) (finding the claim that a state officer could not detain an alien on behalf of federal officers \"meritless\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Last, the plaintiffs argue that the mandate is facially invalid because it does not expressly require a probable cause determination. ICE policy may change, the plaintiffs argue. If that happens, compliance with subsequent detainer requests may violate the Fourth Amendment. In our view, this argument-that ICE policy may change-confirms that facial relief is inappropriate. It is true that ICE might change its policy such that compliance with\n   ICE's requests would violate the Fourth Amendment. It is also true that, under the current scheme, seizures may occur where probable cause was lacking. But this is no basis for facial relief under\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   . If ICE policy changes or if violations occur, the proper mechanism is an as-applied, not a facial challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. \"Materially Limits\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Section 752.053(a)(1)-(2) forbids any \"policy\" or \"pattern or practice\" that \"prohibits or materially limits\" the enforcement of the immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 752.053(a)(1)-(2). The plaintiffs contend that the phrase \"materially limits\" is unconstitutionally vague on its face. A statutory provision is facially vague when it is plagued with such \"hopeless indeterminacy\" that it precludes \"fair notice of the conduct it punishes.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The plaintiffs have not established that \"materially limits\" is facially vague under this exacting standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although the plaintiffs argue that context exacerbates the vagueness of \"materially limits,\" the opposite is true. The status-inquiry, information-sharing, and assistance-cooperation provisions of Section 752.053(b)(1)-(3) provide specific examples of what conduct local entities cannot limit. Thus, if a policy expressly limits one of these activities, then the question for a court is whether such a limitation is \"material.\" The inclusion of this qualifier makes the challenged phrase more definite, not less, and materiality standards are routine in the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Evid. 807(a)(2). Materiality is a familiar component of fraud claims, and the full phrase \"materially limit\" appears in federal securities law, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d-1(b)(1)(H)(i), and in the ABA model rules of professional conduct. Model R. of Prof'l. Conduct 1.7(a)(2), 1.10(a)(1). Materiality is not a vague concept, especially to actors subject to these provisions who are law enforcement or government officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The plaintiffs contend that Texas cannot specify any applications of the \"materially limits\" provision that are not flat prohibitions-and thus already covered by the word \"prohibits.\" We disagree. Texas identifies the Maverick County Sheriff's Office policy of refusing to \"participate or cooperate in the arrests of individuals for civil immigration violations.\" This policy does not actually flatly prohibit cooperation; it limits the circumstances in which cooperation is permissible: criminal but not civil violations. Texas also cites El Cenizo's Mayor, who contended that the city's policy \"limits the situations in which [city] ... officials engage in immigration enforcement or collect and disseminate such information.\" This, too, seems like a policy best characterized as\n   <em>\n    limiting\n   </em>\n   and not\n   <em>\n    prohibiting\n   </em>\n   the enforcement of immigration laws. Almost any limitation could be recharacterized as a partial prohibition. That is likely why SB4 includes both terms. Otherwise, supporters of the policies just described could argue that their policies\n   <em>\n    limited\n   </em>\n   but did not actually\n   <em>\n    prohibit\n   </em>\n   immigration enforcement. Thus, the putative redundancy between \"prohibits\" and \"materially limits\" likely reflects \"a sense of belt-and-suspenders caution\" on the part of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    King v. Burwell\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/#p2498\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2498,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590981\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2480/#p2498\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (Scalia, J., dissenting). It is no reason to facially invalidate the phrase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Texas also proposes several narrowing constructions. First, Texas suggests that a material limit must concern \"the enforcement of immigration laws\" and so policies relating to \"general matters like overtime and patrolling locations\" would not be covered. Under this limitation, Texas argues, SB4 will \"not prohibit immigration-neutral local policies regarding bona fide resource allocation.\" Second, Texas states that a \"policy cannot 'materially limit' immigration-law enforcement if it prohibits actions that the locality already lacks the power to lawfully perform.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   These limitations are reasonable. But the nature of the plaintiffs' lawsuit-a facial, pre-enforcement challenge-makes us unwilling to adopt limiting constructions that are not strictly necessary to preserve the constitutionality of a statute. In general, as-applied challenges brought in post-enforcement proceedings are \"the basic building blocks of constitutional adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

In contrast to the extreme circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the posture of this case calls for judicial restraint.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wash.

Commandeering Challenge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The plaintiffs raise an argument on appeal that was not presented to the district court. They begin by pointing out that the Tenth Amendment prevents the Federal Government from forcing local governments to enforce federal immigration laws. Then they state that the preemption doctrine prevents Texas from passing direct immigration-enforcement regulation. From these premises, the plaintiffs argue that, under the Texas Constitution, the state cannot preempt cities' home-rule authority without passing the sort of direct immigration regulation that would be preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   This argument is waived because it was not adequately raised below.\n   <em>\n    Keelan v.

Even if it were not waived, this argument merely recasts a state-law home-rule-city argument as a hybrid Tenth Amendment and preemption claim. The plaintiffs' briefing indicates that this argument stems from questions asked during oral argument on Texas's motion to stay. The flaw in the argument is that Texas law is clear: \"The Texas Constitution prohibits a city from acting in a manner inconsistent with the general laws of the state. Thus, the legislature may, by general law, withdraw a particular subject from a home rule city's domain.\"\n   <em>\n    Tyra v.
