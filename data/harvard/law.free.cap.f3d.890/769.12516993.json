SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 14, 2015, the Seattle City Council enacted into law Ordinance 124968, an Ordinance Relating to Taxicab, Transportation Network Company, and For-Hire Vehicle Drivers (Ordinance).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Ordinance was the first municipal ordinance of its kind in the United States, and authorizes a collective-bargaining process between \"driver coordinators\"-like Uber Technologies (Uber), Lyft, Inc. (Lyft ), and Eastside for Hire, Inc. (Eastside)-and independent contractors who work as for-hire drivers. The Ordinance permits independent-contractor drivers, represented by an entity denominated an \"exclusive driver representative,\" and driver coordinators to agree on the \"nature and amount of payments to be made by, or withheld from, the driver coordinator to or by the drivers.\" Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code \u00a7 6.310.735(H)(1). This provision of the Ordinance is the crux of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Acting on behalf of its members Uber, Lyft, and Eastside, Plaintiff-Appellant the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, together with Plaintiff-Appellant Rasier, LLC, a subsidiary of Uber (collectively, the Chamber), sued Defendants-Appellees the City of Seattle, the Seattle Department of Finance and Administrative Services (the Department ), and the Department's Director, Fred Podesta (collectively, the City), challenging the Ordinance on federal antitrust and labor law grounds. First, the Chamber asserts that the Ordinance violates, and is preempted by, section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the Ordinance sanctions price-fixing of ride-referral service fees by private cartels of independent-contractor drivers. Second, the Chamber claims that the Ordinance is\n   preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20151\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 169, under\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Garmon\n   </em>\n   preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court dismissed the case, holding that the state-action immunity doctrine exempts the Ordinance from preemption by the Sherman Act, and that the NLRA does not preempt the Ordinance. The Chamber appealed both holdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reverse the district court's dismissal of the Chamber's federal antitrust claims, and remand the federal antitrust claims to the district court for further proceedings. We also affirm the district court's dismissal of the Chamber's NLRA preemption claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ride-Referral Companies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Eastside is the largest dispatcher of taxicab and for-hire vehicles in the Pacific Northwest. Eastside provides licensed taxicab and for-hire vehicle drivers with dispatch, advertising, payment processing, and other administrative services, in exchange for a weekly fee, payable by drivers to Eastside. Relying on advertising and a preexisting client base, Eastside generates transportation requests from passengers, who call, text-message, or email Eastside to request a ride. Eastside then refers ride requests to drivers through a mobile data terminal. If a passenger uses a credit card to pay a driver, Eastside processes the transaction and remits the payment to the driver. The drivers who pay for Eastside's services are independent contractors-Eastside does not dictate how the drivers operate their transportation businesses. For example, some drivers own licensed vehicles, whereas others lease them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Uber and Lyft, founded in 2009 and 2012, respectively, have ushered ride-referral services into the digital age. Uber and Lyft have developed proprietary smartphone applications (apps) that enable an online platform, or digital marketplace, for ride-referral services, often referred to as \"ridesharing\" services. After downloading the Uber or Lyft app onto their smartphones, riders request rides through the app, which transmits ride requests to available drivers nearby. Drivers are free to accept or ignore a ride request. If a driver accepts a ride request, he or she is matched electronically with the rider, and then proceeds to the rider's location and fulfills the ride request. If a driver ignores a ride request, the digital platform transmits the request to another nearby driver. Drivers may cancel a ride request, even after initially accepting it, at any point prior to the commencement of the ride. Riders, too, may decide whether or not to accept a ride from any of the drivers contacted through the app. After a ride is completed, riders pay drivers via the Uber or Lyft app, using a payment method, such as a credit card, placed on file with Uber or Lyft.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Uber and Lyft's business models have facilitated the rise of the so-called \"gig economy.\" In order to receive ride requests through the apps, drivers contract with, and pay a technology licensing fee to, Uber or Lyft. These licensing fees are a percentage of riders' paid fares: Uber and Lyft subtract their technology licensing fees from riders' payments, and remit the remainder to drivers. Drivers' contractual agreements with either Uber or Lyft are not exclusive-in fact, many drivers use several ridesharing apps and even operate multiple apps simultaneously. Drivers may use the Uber and Lyft apps for however long and whenever they wish, if they wish to use them at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Ordinance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 14, 2015, the Seattle City Council adopted Ordinance 124968. The stated purpose of the Ordinance is to \"allow[ ] taxicab, transportation network company, and for-hire vehicle drivers ('for-hire drivers') to modify specific agreements collectively with the entities that hire, direct, arrange, or manage their work,\" in order to \"better ensure that [for-hire drivers] can perform their services in a safe, reliable, stable, cost-effective, and economically viable manner.\" Seattle, Wash., Ordinance 124968, pmbl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Ordinance requires \"driver coordinators\" to bargain collectively with for-hire drivers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(I). A \"driver coordinator\" is defined as \"an entity that hires, contracts with, or partners with for-hire drivers for the purpose of assisting them with, or facilitating them in, providing for-hire services to the public.\" Seattle, Wash., Municipal Code \u00a7 6.310.110. The Ordinance applies only to drivers who contract with a driver coordinator \"other than in the context of an employer-employee relationship\"-in other words, the Ordinance applies only to independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.310.735(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The collective-bargaining process begins with the election of a \"qualified driver representative,\" or QDR.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 6.310.110, 6.310.735(C).

In 1947, Congress enacted the Labor Management Relations Act, also known as the Taft-Hartley Act.

The legislative history of the amendment corroborates this observation. The House Report for the amendment explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   An \"employee,\" according to all standard dictionaries, according to the law as the courts have stated it, and according to the understanding of almost everyone, with the exception of members of the National Labor Relations Board, means someone who works for another for hire. But in the case of [\n   <em>\n    NLRB v. Hearst Publications\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142352\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/111/\">\n    322 U.S. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142352\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/111/\">\n    64 S.Ct. 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142352\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/111/\">\n    88 L.Ed. 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944) ], the Board expanded the definition of the term \"employee\" beyond anything that it ever had included before, and the Supreme Court, relying upon the theoretic \"expertness\" of the Board, upheld the Board. In this case the Board held independent merchants who bought newspapers from the publisher and hired people to sell them to be \"employees\". [sic] The people the merchants hired to sell the papers were \"employees\" of the merchants, but holding the merchants to be \"employees\" of the publisher of the papers was most far reaching. It must be presumed that when Congress passed the Labor Act, it intended words it used to have the meanings that they had when Congress passed the act, not new meanings that, 9 years later, the Labor Board might think up. In the law, there always has been a difference, and a big difference, between \"employees\" and \"independent contractors\". [sic] \"Employees\" work for wages or salaries under direct supervision. \"Independent contractors'' undertake to do a job for a price, decide how the work will be done, usually hire others to do the work, and depend for their income not upon wages, but upon the difference between what they pay for goods, materials, and labor and what they receive for the end result, that is, upon profits. It is inconceivable that Congress, when it passed the act, authorized the Board to give to every word in the act whatever meaning it wished. On the contrary, Congress intended then, and it intends now, that the Board give to words not far-fetched meanings but ordinary meanings. To correct what the Board has done, and what the Supreme Court, putting misplaced reliance upon the Board's expertness, has approved,\n   the bill excludes \"independent contractors\" from the definition of \"employee\". [sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   H.R. Rep. No. 80-245, at 18 (1947).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Citing the House Report, the Chamber asserts that Congress excluded independent contractors from the NLRA's definition of \"employee\" in order to leave independent-contractor arrangements to the free play of economic forces, rather than subject to collective bargaining, federal or local. However, the portion of the House Report the Chamber relies upon actually refers to\n   <em>\n    supervisors\n   </em>\n   , not independent contractors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (noting that\n   <em>\n    supervisors\n   </em>\n   have \"abandoned the 'collective security' of the rank and file voluntarily, because they believed the opportunities thus opened to them to be more valuable to them than such 'security' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The House Report's discussion of the exclusion of independent contractors shows that Congress intended to effect a return to the status quo, rather than preempt state or local regulation of independent contractors. Congress added the exclusion in order to reject the Supreme Court's erroneous \"new\" construction of \"employee\" and to return to the common-law definition of \"employee\" that was in place nine years earlier, before\n   <em>\n    Hearst\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. While the Chamber makes much of Congress's exclusion of independent contractors from the definition of \"employee,\" the legislative history does not support the Chamber's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Furthermore, the fact that a group of workers is excluded from the definition of \"employee\" in \u00a7 152(3), without more, does not compel a finding of\n   <em>\n    Machinists\n   </em>\n   preemption. As the Chamber acknowledges, \u00a7 152(2) - (3) excludes agricultural laborers, domestic workers, and public employees, all of which have been subject to state regulation.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davenport v.

In\n   <em>\n    Beasley\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court considered whether the exclusion of supervisors from the NLRA's definition of \"employee,\" which \"freed employers to discharge supervisors without violating the [NLRA's] restraints against discharges on account of labor union membership,\" \"also freed the employer from liability in damages to the discharged supervisors\" under a state law \"that provide[d ] such an action for employees discharged\n   for union membership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84696\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/653/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84696\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/653/\">\n    at 654-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84696\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/653/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2023\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the party asserting preemption, the Chamber has not met its burden to show at least an arguable case that the drivers at issue are covered by the NLRA.
