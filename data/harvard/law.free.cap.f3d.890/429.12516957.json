And indeed, Krieger's next bill reflected a $657 credit. But over a month later Krieger opened his mail to some particularly unwelcome additional information: BANA was rebilling him for the charge. He disputed it again, this time in writing, but after BANA replied that nothing would be done, he paid his monthly statement and then filed this action, alleging BANA violated two consumer protection laws: the Fair Credit Billing Act, which requires a creditor to take certain steps to correct billing errors, and the unauthorized-use provision of the Truth in Lending Act, which limits a credit cardholder's liability for the unauthorized use of a credit card to $50. The District Court granted BANA's motion to dismiss the operative complaint after determining Krieger had failed to state a claim as to either count. Because we conclude the District Court's decision was contrary to the text, regulatory framework, and policies of both statutes, we will reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Consistent with the instructions he was given earlier, he called BANA again. During that July 29 call, however, Krieger was again told BANA \"could do nothing,\" this time because Western Union had \"already authorized the payment.\" App. 29. Now \"no longer happy\" with BANA, Krieger told the representative he wished to cancel his account entirely. App. 29. That, apparently, caused BANA to reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mere hours later, BANA called Krieger back with a change in plans: BANA offered to \"credit [his] account while it conducted an investigation on the unauthorized use.\" App. 29. And within a few days, it sent Krieger a letter confirming, pursuant to that call, that it had \"issued [a] credit[ ] to [his] account for the disputed charge[ ]\" that \"w[ould] appear on [his] monthly statement,\" and that, while Western Union would \"have the opportunity to review the information and provide additional documentation to support why they feel the transaction[ ] is valid,\" BANA \"consider[ed] [the] dispute[ ] resolved.\" App. 46. On Krieger's next statement, in mid-August, a \"-$657\" credit was posted to his account, App. 49, and Krieger \"believed that the matter had been resolved,\" App. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   His belief was short-lived. In mid-September, Krieger opened the mail to find a very different letter. In this one, BANA advised him that Western Union had \"provided a copy of the sales slip[ ] as verification of the charge[ ]\" whose information \"matche[d] the home address, phone number, or email address ... listed on [his] account.\" App. 51. The slip itself, which was attached to the letter, revealed the charge had been paid out to one \"Amit Rajak,\" in \"Mumbai,\" India, App. 64, and the letter declared that the charge was \"valid\" and therefore \"w[ould] be rebilled,\" App. 51. In his amended complaint, Krieger alleged that he \"does not know anyone named Amit Rajak\" and \"has never been to India.\" App. 31. Nonetheless, the $657 charge appeared on Krieger's next statement, which he received a week later (the \"September 18 statement\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Frustrated by BANA's about-face, Krieger quickly sent the company a two-page letter describing, in detail, the entire sequence of events. In that letter, which BANA received on September 29, Krieger\n   again emphasized that the charge was unauthorized and requested it be \"remove[d] ... altogether.\" App. 57. BANA denied Krieger's request in a letter saying only that, while it had \"re-examined\" the charge, the information provided by Western Union still matched that on Krieger's account and thus BANA still considered the charge valid. App. 62. To avoid late fees and interest, Krieger paid BANA the entire $657 before turning to the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Originally filed in state court and then removed by BANA to the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Krieger's amended complaint included two claims relevant here: one under the FCBA and one under TILA's unauthorized-use provision. As the basis for his FCBA claim, Krieger alleged that he had timely submitted a written notice of billing error regarding the $657 charge and BANA had neither credited the charge nor conducted a reasonable investigation. As the basis for his unauthorized-use claim, Krieger alleged that BANA imposed liability for more than $50 by billing him the full amount when it had reason to believe the charge was unauthorized. Both claims were brought under TILA's private right of action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201640\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and, for each, Krieger requested statutory damages, costs, attorneys' fees, and \"actual damages.\" App. 35-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court, however, dismissed Krieger's complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Krieger v.

Here, the District Court rejected Krieger's claim based on its view that the 60-day period began on July 29, the first time the $657 Western Union charge ever appeared on his billing statement, making the written notice he submitted on September 29, 62 days later, untimely.\n   <em>\n    Krieger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20168161\">\n    2017 WL 168161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. On appeal, Krieger argues this was improper\n   and, because BANA removed the charge from his statement and only reinstated it on September 18, that was the date the 60-day period ran from, making his notice timely. We agree with Krieger: where, as here, a creditor removes a disputed charge from a billing statement and later reinstates that charge, the 60-day period in which a consumer must file a written dispute begins when the consumer receives the first statement reinstating the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the discussion that follows, we explain, first, why our holding finds support in the FCBA's text, relevant guidance from the CFPB, and the consumer-protection policies undergirding both TILA and the FCBA, and, second, why the District Court misapplied Regulation Z in reaching the opposite result and dismissing Krieger's FCBA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Selecting the Operative Statement in Light of the FCBA's Text, the CFPB's Guidance, and Underlying Policy Concerns\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[W]e start, of course, with the statutory text[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v.

The FCBA requires that a consumer dispute a billing error only where he \"belie[ves] that [his] statement contains a billing error.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201666\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In other words, where the statement does not contain any errors, the FCBA does not impose any obligation on the consumer at all. And that makes perfect sense. The consumer's goal in filing a written notice of billing error is to require the creditor either to correct the error or to conduct a reasonable investigation of the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1666(a)(3)(B). Where there is no error, notice would be nonsensical, as was the case here. When Krieger received his August billing statement-which not only did not list the Western Union charge, but, indeed, credited the charge to his account-there was no longer anything to dispute because Krieger had no reason to \"belie[ve] that [his] statement contain[ed] a billing error.\" To put a fine point on it, had BANA not reinstated the charge, there would have been no basis for Krieger to bring an FCBA claim nor any practical reason to do so. Only when BANA decided to reinstate the charge did the FCBA once again become relevant, and, for that reason, only then did the 60-day period begin to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This conclusion also comports with CFPB guidance. The agency has specified that, where there is a billing error but the creditor initially fails to send a billing statement, the 60-day period will begin to \"run[ ] from the time the statement should have been sent,\" but \"[o]nce the statement is provided,\" the consumer will have \"another 60 days to assert any billing errors reflected on it.\"\n   <em>\n    Official Interpretations\n   </em>\n   , para. 13(b)(1), \u00a7 1. In other words, even where there is an existing error that the consumer would have reason to dispute so that the 60-day period has started to run, the clock is reset once the charge actually appears on a statement. If the 60-day period restarts in that circumstance, it would be incongruous to hold it does not where, as here, a creditor has affirmatively removed a disputed charge (so that the consumer no longer has any reason to file a dispute) and only reinstates it on a later statement. Moreover, we perceive no reason to think allowing such an extension would prejudice unwary creditors. After all, if a subsequent statement restarts the clock even where a creditor fails to communicate the charge by mistake, surely the same result obtains where a creditor fails to communicate the charge by design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, we consider the remedial policies underlying TILA and the FCBA. Congress enacted TILA to \"require[ ] full\n   disclosure of credit charges ... so that the consumer can decide for himself whether the charge is reasonable,\" S. Rep. No. 90-392, at 1, and, together with the FCBA, to \"protect the consumer against ... unfair credit billing and credit card practices,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). We, in turn, have emphasized that, because TILA is \"designed to provide easily-understood information to ordinary consumers,\" courts should evaluate information creditors convey to consumers \"from the point of view of the consumer.\"\n   <em>\n    Rossman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393535\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/384/#p390\">\n    280 F.3d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, we consider the circumstances from Krieger's perspective and ask what a \"reasonable consumer ... would ... be entitled to assume.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9393535\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/280/384/#p390\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   So viewed, the approach we adopt today is clearly correct. The same day Krieger first contacted BANA about the charge, he was told it would be removed while the company conducted an investigation. Shortly thereafter, he received a letter stating that, while Western Union retained \"the opportunity to review the information and provide additional documentation to support why they feel the transaction[ ] is valid,\" for the time being BANA \"consider[ed] [the] dispute[ ] resolved,\" App. 46, and on his next billing statement the charge was gone. The \"only logical conclusion\" a reasonable consumer could reach at that point was that there was \"no longer a billing error,\" Appellant's Br. 21, and that, as Krieger himself believed, \"the matter had been resolved in his favor,\" App. 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To hold otherwise would saddle the consumer with an ongoing duty to file a written dispute concerning a seemingly \"resolved\" dispute or risk forfeiting all rights under the FCBA, and, at the same time, would offer creditors a path to avoid their FCBA obligations altogether by automatically removing a charge in response to a concerned consumer's call-surely a common first response when a curious charge appears on a credit card bill-and then waiting for 60 days to pass before reinstating it. We decline to take a path so antithetical to TILA's purpose of eradicating \"unfair[ness]\" and \"confusi[on]\" in the credit markets.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Ramadan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1567153\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/499/#p502\">\n    156 F.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, because the first statement on which the disputed $657 Western Union charge appeared after BANA reinstated it was the September 18 statement, and BANA received Krieger's written notice just 11 days later, on September 29, his notice was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The District Court's Reliance on an Inapplicable Regulation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In concluding that the 60-day period ran from the July 29 statement\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and dismissing\n   Krieger's claim for failure to state a claim, the District Court held it was \"compelled\" by language in Regulation Z to look only to the \"\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   periodic statement that reflects the alleged billing error.\"\n   <em>\n    Krieger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20168161\">\n    2017 WL 168161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (emphasis added by the District Court) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20226.13\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ). And in defending that reading on appeal, BANA contends that its \"later decision to rebill the Western Union Charge ... does not restart the FCBA written notice clock\" and that Krieger's contrary arguments rely only on \"policy\" and ignore \u00a7 1026.13(b)(1)'s \"plain language.\" Appellee's Br. 20, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While the language of \u00a7 1026.13(b)(1) may be plain as applied to a billing error reflected on regularly recurring statements, it has little bearing on the circumstances of this case. Section 1026.13(b)(1) provides that the consumer must provide written notice \"no later than 60 days after the creditor transmitted the first periodic statement that reflects the alleged billing error.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201026.13\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Put another way, where the consumer initially does not pay a disputed charge so that the charge is carried forward continuously in successive periods, \u00a7 1026.13(b)(1) tells us the 60-day period does not restart upon the consumer's receipt of each new \"periodic statement that reflects the alleged billing error,\" but rather runs from the receipt of the first of those statements. And wisely so. Indeed, a contrary rule, where the 60-day period restarted every month just because the charge went unpaid, would effectively read the 60-day requirement out of the statute. But reading this regulation to pertain in the circumstances presented here-where an issuer makes an alleged billing error on one statement, then eliminates that error on subsequent statements by crediting and not rebilling the charge, and then introduces the error into a new series of statements at a later date-would be in tension with \u00a7 1026.13(b)'s text and contrary to both common sense and broader policy concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We start with the regulation's text. BANA argues that \"periodic\" simply refers to billing intervals so, for example, where statements are issued monthly, the 60 days would run from the first monthly statement on which the alleged error ever appeared, regardless whether there was one or more intervening statements on which the error did not appear. But \u00a7 1026.13(b) does not run the 60-day clock from the first time an alleged error appears on \"any periodic statement\" or even from the first \"statement that reflects the alleged billing error\"; rather, it runs the clock from the first \"periodic statement that reflects the alleged billing error.\" Because \"periodic\" means \"regularly recurring,\"\n   <em>\n    NLRB v.

That is to say, where an alleged billing error appears on one or more statements, then ceases to appear because it\n   has been reversed by the issuer, there is no longer any regularly recurring set of statements \"that reflect[ ] the alleged billing error\"; only if and when the error is reintroduced and begins to appear on a new series of statements is there a set of statements that are both \"regularly recurring\" and \"that reflect[ ] the alleged billing error.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   And as it turns out, that reading is also the only one that comports with common sense and the consumer-protection policies that undergird TILA and the FCBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abramski v.

By this logic, if\n   the cardholder is sufficiently sophisticated to know his liability will be capped at $50 and the late fees and interest he incurs will be removed from his bill if he withholds payment, he will refuse to pay and force the issuer to sue him for no more than $50; but if the cardholder is not so savvy and pays his monthly bill-or has signed up for automatic payments-he is simply out of luck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Not so.
