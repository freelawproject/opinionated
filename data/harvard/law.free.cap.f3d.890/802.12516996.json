His leg was eventually amputated below the knee. Mr. Dowdy and his wife, Sharon Morris-Dowdy, sought accidental dismemberment benefits under an employee welfare benefit plan governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"). Appellee Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (\"MetLife\") denied coverage because Mr. Dowdy's injury was complicated by his diabetes, and the district court affirmed the denial. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the Dowdys are entitled to coverage because Mr. Dowdy's diabetes did not substantially cause or contribute to his injury. The judgment of the district court is therefore\n   <strong>\n    reversed\n   </strong>\n   and this case is\n   <strong>\n    remanded\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the morning of September 13, 2014, Mr. Dowdy, age 60, was driving eastbound on California State Route 4 when he lost control of his car. The vehicle struck a metal sign post, rolled onto its right side, traveled down a dirt embankment and spun clockwise before coming to rest. The California Highway Patrol (\"CHP\") officer who arrived at the scene noted that Mr. Dowdy had suffered serious injuries, including a \"semi-amputated left ankle\" and chest abrasions. After a \"prolonged\" extraction from his vehicle, Mr. Dowdy was transported by helicopter to the John Muir Medical Center and treated in the Intensive Care Unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Dowdy remained in the hospital until October 11, 2014, at which time he was discharged to a skilled nursing facility. When discharged, he was \"nonweightbearing\" due to his leg injury. The injury failed to improve, and approximately three months later Mr. Dowdy was transferred back to the hospital for treatment of persistent infection issues. On February 13, 2015, Dr. Christopher Coufal amputated Mr. Dowdy's left leg below the knee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Through Mr. Dowdy's wife's employment at Bank of the West, the Dowdys had purchased accidental death and dismemberment insurance from MetLife (\"the AD&amp;D Plan\" or \"Plan\"). The Plan is governed by ERISA. The relevant coverage language states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   If You or a Dependent sustain an accidental injury that is the Direct and Sole Cause of a Covered Loss described in the SCHEDULE OF BENEFITS, Proof of the accidental injury and Covered Loss must be sent to Us. When We receive such Proof We will review the claim and, if We approve it, will pay the insurance in effect on the date of the injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Direct and Sole Cause means that the Covered Loss occurs within 12 months of the date of the accidental injury and was a direct result of the accidental injury, independent of other causes\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (the \"Coverage Provision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plan has several exclusions, one of which provides that MetLife will not issue benefits \"for any loss caused or contributed\n   to by ... physical ... illness or infirmity, or the diagnosis or treatment of such illness or infirmity\" (the \"Illness or Infirmity Exclusion\"). The Plan also excludes coverage for infections (the \"Infection Exclusion\"), but carves out of the exclusion any \"infection occurring in an external accidental wound.\" The Plan requires claimants to submit written evidence in support of their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Dowdys filed a request for benefits under the AD&amp;D Plan for Mr. Dowdy's leg amputation, submitting information both in writing and through several telephone calls. Prior to the amputation, however, MetLife informed Ms. Morris-Dowdy that it intended to deny the dismemberment claim because an ankle fracture was not a severance. Ms. Morris-Dowdy informed MetLife that amputation was possible within the next week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   One week later, on February 16, 2015, MetLife mailed a letter denying coverage. The letter stated that \"[i]n general, dismemberment benefits are paid for severing injuries, which did not happen here.\" On March 5, 2015, Dr. Coufal wrote in a letter that Mr. Dowdy had\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   sustained significant injuries to his left lower extremity with an open grade III B pilon fracture. He had significant multiple other comorbidities and traumatic injuries. ... He had wound issues, which were complicated by his diabetes. The wound healing as well as his fracture itself was slow to heal and never had any significant healing in spite of being stabilized with the external fixator. He ended up developing deep infection ... consistent with osteomyelitis and sequestrum, which was related to original injury. Eventually, due to his comorbidities as well as type of injury he ended up proceeding to an amputation. On 2/13/15, he underwent elective left below-the-knee amputation for treatment of this infected nonunion of the left pilon fracture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Coufal's surgical report similarly stated that \"[o]ver the past several months, [Mr. Dowdy] has had very poor signs of healing .... Attempts at soft tissue coverage have been unsuccessful. Due to his multiple comorbidities as well as nonhealing wounds to his left leg and osteomyelitis, it was elected to undergo a left below-the-knee amputation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 24, 2015, a senior claims examiner at MetLife called for a \"new initial denial as now there is now an amputation, however the loss was contributed to by the diabetes.\" Correspondingly, MetLife sent a second denial letter dated April 2, 2015. The letter cited the Illness or Infirmity Exclusion, quoted above, which pertained to \"any loss caused or contributed to by ... physical or mental illness or infirmity, or the diagnosis or treatment of such illness or infirmity.\" The letter stated that Mr. Dowdy's \"amputation was contributed [to] and complicated by diabetes per Dr. Coufal,\" and that \"[u]nder the terms of the Plan a loss caused or contributed [to] by an illness or treatment for that illness is excluded by the Plan from payment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Dowdys filed an administrative appeal of MetLife's initial determination. After a further review, MetLife upheld its initial determination, concluding that the accident was not the \"direct and sole cause\" of the amputation \"independent of other causes\" as set forth in the Coverage Provision, and that the Plan's Illness or Infirmity Exclusion applied because Mr. Dowdy's diabetes contributed to the loss. As authorized by ERISA, the Dowdys then sought judicial review in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the proceedings before the district court, the parties filed cross-motions for judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52. The district court declined to\n   consider extrinsic evidence, citing the principle that review of an ERISA claim is generally limited to the administrative record. The court also found that a review of extrinsic materials was not warranted because the burden was on the Dowdys to provide evidence supporting their claim, and MetLife had not acted in bad faith in its communications with Ms. Morris-Dowdy. With respect to the merits of Mr. Dowdy's claim, the district court found that diabetes caused or contributed to the need for amputation, and affirmed the denial of benefits. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review findings of fact by the district court for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Silver v.

And with respect to the medical chart, the district court correctly concluded that it did not in fact support the Dowdys' claim. Accordingly, even assuming the district court erred in refusing to look beyond the administrative record, any such error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burgess v.

Each of these events is a cause in the so-called \"philosophic sense,\" yet the effect of many of them is so insignificant that no ordinary mind would think of them as causes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 431 cmt. a (Am.

Such evidence need not be presented with mathematical precision, but must nonetheless demonstrate that a causal or contributing factor was more than merely related to the injury, and was instead a substantial catalyst.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coleman v.

[Thus,] the Court cannot discern from the record evidence any means of determining the degree of the causal relationship.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The record here falls short of showing that diabetes was a substantial contributing factor. Dr. Coufal opined that Mr. Dowdy's \"wound issues\" post-surgery were \"complicated by his diabetes.\" He did not elaborate, even generally, on how much of\n   a role that complicating factor played in Mr. Dowdy's failure to recover. Dr. Coufal identified a host of contributors, including the original, \"significant ... pilon facture,\" \"potential bony sequestrum indicating osteomyelitis\" related to the initial injury, and a resulting \"deep infection.\" In summarizing the grounds for surgery, Dr. Coufal faulted both \"comorbidities\" and the \"type of injury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The district court concluded that coverage is barred because, as the Plan \"dictates,\" no physical or mental illness can \" 'cause or contribute' \" to the loss, and \"Mr. Dowdy's diabetes clearly contributed to his loss.\" The court also found \"that the complications of Mr. Dowdy's diabetes substantially contributed to the need for amputation.\" Although the district court cited the substantial contribution standard, its application of that standard was clear error, as it was overly strict and not consistent with the requirement that the contributing factor be, in fact, substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In sum, Congress intended for ERISA to protect the interests of plan participants and their beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 1001b(c)(3). Consistent with that policy choice, federal courts have developed a body of common law that construes coverage provisions in a manner that does not \"unreasonably limit[ ] coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   , 389 F.3d at 1184. Here, even assuming the policy language was conspicuous, we construe the Plan as providing coverage unless Mr. Dowdy's pre-existing disease \"substantially contributed\" to his injury.\n   <em>\n    McClure\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793378\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1129/\">\n    84 F.3d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based upon the evidence presented in the administrative record, Mr. Dowdy's diabetes was a complicating factor, but it was not identified as a substantial contributor to the ultimate loss. We therefore hold that coverage should not have been denied on the basis of the Coverage Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Illness or Infirmity Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because Mr. Dowdy's injury is a covered loss, we must go on to determine whether the Illness or Infirmity Exclusion bars coverage. That Exclusion states that MetLife will not pay benefits for \"any loss caused or contributed to by ... illness or infirmity.\" The plan administrator and the district court both found that this Exclusion applies because Mr. Dowdy's diabetes \"caused or contributed to\" the loss. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under general principles of insurance law, exclusions are construed narrowly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Critchlow v. First Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212699\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/246/#p256\">\n    378 F.3d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (2d Cir. 2004) (explaining that, under ERISA, exclusionary clauses \"are given strict construction\" and \"should be read narrowly rather than expansively\"). And MetLife has conceded, as it must, that it has the burden of showing an exclusion applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mario v. P &amp; C Food Mkts., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318199\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/758/#p765\">\n    313 F.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"[A]s a matter of general insurance law, the insured has the burden of proving that a benefit is covered, while the insurer has the burden of proving that an exclusion applies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We hold, for the same reasons discussed above, that the substantial contribution standard applies in interpreting the concepts of cause and contribution in this exclusion. The Illness or Infirmity Exclusion serves the same purpose as the threshold limitation on coverage to accidental injury that is the \"direct and sole cause\" of a covered loss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, to\n   satisfy the Exclusion, any cause or contribution by an illness or infirmity must be substantial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265284\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/262/295/#p312\">\n    262 F.Supp.3d at 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   standard governs even where, as here, the causation-based exclusion simply says 'caused or contributed to,' and it requires that any contribution be substantial.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Again, the record with respect to the role of diabetes in Mr. Dowdy's recovery is notably thin. The car accident resulted in a severe injury that came close to amputating his lower leg. Dr. Coufal opined that when attempts were made properly to correct the lower leg, subsequent wound issues were complicated by diabetes, and the fracture itself was slow to heal. Ultimately, however, Mr. Dowdy suffered a deep infection that Dr. Coufal considered \"related to the original injury.\" In light of this evidence, and giving the Exclusion the required strict reading, MetLife cannot meet its burden of showing that diabetes substantially caused or contributed to the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As the evidence is insufficient for MetLife to show that the Illness or Infirmity Exclusion applies, the Dowdys are entitled to benefits. This case is hereby remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision, which will include determining the amount of benefits owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    ERISA contains a savings clause that exempts from preemption \"any law of any State which regulates insurance.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(A).
