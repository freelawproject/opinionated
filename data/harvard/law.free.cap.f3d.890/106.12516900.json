The Baltimore State's Attorney's Office, led by State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, conducted an investigation into Gray's death. After the State Medical Examiner ruled Gray's death a homicide, Major Samuel Cogen of the Baltimore City Sheriff's Office criminally charged six of the police officers involved in Gray's arrest and detention.

They claim that her role in independently investigating their conduct strips her of absolute prosecutorial immunity and that their bare allegations of malice or gross negligence overcome Maryland's statutory immunity protections. We resoundingly reject the invitation to cast aside decades of Supreme Court and circuit precedent to narrow the immunity prosecutors enjoy. And we find no justification for denying Mosby the protection from suit that the Maryland legislature has granted her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because this appeal comes to us at the motion-to-dismiss stage, we recount the facts as alleged by the Officers and must accept them as true for purposes of this appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Lightsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055162\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/170/#p173\">\n    775 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (4th Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The morning of April 12, 2015, Lieutenant Rice encountered Freddie Gray, Jr., and another person walking along North Avenue in Baltimore City. After making eye contact with Rice, Gray and his companion ran. Rice pursued them and called for backup. Officers Miller and Nero responded; Miller chased Gray, and Nero chased Gray's companion. While pursuing Gray, Miller yelled that he had a taser and instructed Gray to get on the ground. Gray voluntarily surrendered with his hands up. Miller brought him to the ground and handcuffed him in a prone position. When Miller searched Gray, he found a knife and informed Gray that he was under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A police van arrived to transport Gray to the police station. Nero, who had failed to apprehend Gray's companion, and another officer placed Gray inside. Because a crowd of citizens was forming, the van and the officers-including Rice, Miller, Nero, and Officer Porter, who had arrived on the scene-reconvened one block south to complete the paperwork for Gray's arrest. At this second stop, Rice and Miller removed Gray from the van, replaced his handcuffs with flex cuffs, shackled his legs, and placed him back in the van. The van departed, and the officers returned to their patrol duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Porter received a call from the van driver requesting assistance at another location several blocks away. Porter met the van at this third location, assisted the driver with opening the van's rear doors, and observed Gray lying prone on the floor of the van. Gray asked for medical assistance. Porter informed the driver that Gray should be taken to the hospital, and then he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, Miller and Nero returned to North Avenue, where they arrested another person and called for a police van and additional units. The van carrying Gray responded to this fourth location, as did Porter and Sergeant White, who had already \"received supervisor complaints\" about Gray's arrest. J.A. 169. The second arrestee was placed in the van. Gray again communicated to Porter that he wanted medical assistance. White separately attempted to speak with Gray, but Gray did not respond. Porter and White returned to\n   their vehicles and followed the van to the Western District police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the police station, Gray was found unconscious in the back of the van. An officer rendered emergency assistance, and Porter called a medic. White confirmed that a medic was en route. Gray was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Unit, where he died due to a neck injury on April 19, 2015. The State Medical Examiner ruled Gray's death a homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 1, 2015, Major Cogen executed an application for Statement of Charges for each of the five Officers, plus the driver of the van. Each application contained the same affidavit, sworn by Major Cogen, reciting the facts supporting probable cause. The affidavit explained that Rice, Miller, and Nero illegally arrested Gray without probable cause because the knife found on him was legal: \"The blade of the knife was folded into the handle. The knife was not a switchblade knife and is lawful under Maryland law.\" J.A. 35. The affidavit further stated that the officers repeatedly failed to seatbelt Gray in the back of the van, contrary to a Baltimore City Police Department General Order. It noted that Porter observed Gray on the floor of the van, but \"[d]espite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition, no medical assistance was rendered to or summonsed for Mr. Gray at that time.\" J.A. 37. And, the affidavit asserted, \"White, who was responsible for investigating two citizen complaints pertaining to Mr. Gray's illegal arrest, spoke to the back of Mr. Gray's head. When he did not respond, she did nothing further despite the fact that she was advised that he needed a medic. She made no effort to look, assess or determine his condition.\" J.A. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A Maryland district court commissioner approved the applications and issued warrants for the Officers' arrests. Nero and Miller were each charged with two counts of assault in the second degree, two counts of misconduct in office, and false imprisonment. Rice was charged with manslaughter, two counts of assault in the second degree, two counts of misconduct in office, and false imprisonment. Porter and White were each charged with manslaughter, assault in the second degree, and misconduct in office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Later that day, State's Attorney Mosby held a press conference to announce the charges and call for an end to the riots that had erupted in Baltimore following Gray's death. She told the public, \"The findings of our comprehensive, thorough and independent investigation, coupled with the medical examiner's determination that Mr. Gray's death was a homicide ... has led us to believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges.\" J.A. 29. She then read the full statement of probable cause verbatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   During the press conference, Mosby emphasized that she and her office independently investigated Gray's death:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   It is my job to examine and investigate the evidence of each case and apply those facts to the elements of a crime, in order to make a determination as to whether individuals should be prosecuted.... [I]t is precisely what I did in the case of Freddie Gray.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Once alerted about this incident on April 13, investigators from my police integrity unit were deployed to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mr. Gray's apprehension.... [M]y team worked around the clock; 12 and 14 hour days to canvas and interview dozens of witnesses; view numerous hours of video footage; repeatedly reviewed and listened to hours of police video tape statements; surveyed the route, reviewed voluminous medical records; and we leveraged the information made\n   available by the police department, the community and family of Mr. Gray.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   J.A. 29. Mosby concluded her speech by calling for peace in Baltimore as she moved forward with the charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   To the people of Baltimore and the demonstrators across America: I heard your call for 'No justice, no peace.' Your peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [T]o the youth of the city[,] I will seek justice on your behalf. This is a moment. This is your moment. Let's insure we have peaceful and productive rallies that will develop structural and systemic changes for generations to come. You're at the forefront of this cause and as young people, our time is now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   J.A. 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On May 21, 2015, a grand jury indicted all six officers on charges substantially similar to those listed in the Statements of Charges. Porter was tried before a jury, and after the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict, the judge declared a mistrial. Nero and Rice underwent bench trials, and the judge ultimately found them not guilty on all counts. Thereafter, Mosby dismissed all outstanding charges against Miller, White, and Porter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While the criminal charges against all of the Officers were still pending, the Officers sued State's Attorney Mosby. The Officers claimed that she violated their rights by bringing charges without probable cause and defamed the Officers by making false accusations against them at the May 1, 2015 press conference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Officers filed three separate suits-one brought by Nero and Miller in the district court; one brought by Rice, also in the district court; and one brought by Porter and White in state court but removed to the district court. The district court consolidated the three cases. The Officers alleged, in relevant part, a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim for malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment, a claim for malicious prosecution under Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and common-law claims for malicious prosecution, defamation, and false light invasion of privacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Mosby moved to dismiss the Officers' claims, asserting various immunities. She asserted absolute prosecutorial immunity, or alternatively qualified immunity, for the \u00a7 1983 malicious-prosecution claim; absolute prosecutorial immunity under Maryland common law and statutory immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA) for the state malicious-prosecution claims; and MTCA immunity and common-law public-official immunity for the defamation and false-light claims. Mosby further argued that the Officers failed to state claims on which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After a hearing, the district court allowed the three malicious-prosecution claims, the defamation claim, and the false-light claim to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Nero v. Mosby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n    233 F.Supp.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (D. Md. 2017). The court held that, although Mosby was entitled to absolute immunity for her conduct\n   before the grand jury, she was not entitled to absolute immunity for any of her actions prior to convening the grand jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n    at 483-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court further concluded that the Officers had pled sufficient facts to overcome Mosby's qualified-immunity and MTCA-immunity defenses to the malicious-prosecution claims at the motion-to-dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n    at 486-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the court determined that Mosby was not entitled to any conditional privileges for the defamation and false-light claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268390\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/463/#p489\">\n    at 478-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court did not expressly address Mosby's immunity defenses to these latter two claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mosby timely appealed. She challenges the district court's denial of immunity for the \u00a7 1983 malicious-prosecution claim, the denial of immunity for the state malicious-prosecution claims, and the failure to grant immunity for the defamation and false-light claims. We address each challenge in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We begin with the Officers' \u00a7 1983 malicious-prosecution claim and State's Attorney Mosby's assertion of absolute prosecutorial immunity. We have jurisdiction to review the district court's denial of absolute immunity for this claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the collateral order doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nixon v.

They claim that Mosby included false information-e.g., that the knife found on Gray was legal, that the Officers' failure to seatbelt Gray was a crime, and that the Officers were aware Gray was in medical distress prior to arriving at the police station. And they claim that she omitted key facts-e.g., that the second arrestee placed in the police van reported Gray was conscious and banging his head against the wall, that another officer observed Gray was not in medical distress, and that the medics who examined Gray at the police station reported his neck was normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At bottom, the Officers take issue with Mosby's decision to prosecute them and her role in preparing the charging documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   These claims are barred by settled Supreme Court and circuit precedent.

Second, a police officer's opinion that Gray was not in medical distress because he observed Gray in a \"praying position\" at some unspecified time during the wagon ride-a ride that spanned at least four stops-also does not show that Gray was not in distress.

State's Attorney Mosby is an elected official. After the death of Freddie Gray, her community, her constituents, and her city faced a crisis of confidence. Baltimore's citizens had their faith shaken, not only in the police, but in the very ability of government to administer justice. As any of us would expect of our political leaders, Mosby responded to a crisis. And as all of us should demand from our political leaders, Mosby explained her actions to the public. At a press conference, she read from a charging document, praised investigators, and explained the basis of the prosecution. To say that an elected official exposes herself to liability by discharging\n   her democratic duty to justify the decisions she was elected to make is to elevate tort law above our most cherished constitutional ideals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The First Amendment requires public officials, such as the police officers who brought this suit, to make a showing of \"actual malice\" in an action for defamation relating to their official duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York Times v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    376 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    84 S.Ct. 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379234\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/254/#p279\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964). That much is not in question. But powerful speech interests arise not only when public officials bring defamation actions, but when public officials are\n   <em>\n    subject\n   </em>\n   to them. Just as\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   recognized the sacred right of the citizen to criticize his government free from the threat of legal damages, the First Amendment also protects the public official's ability to explain his actions to his constituents. This free exchange between government and governed legitimates and nourishes our democratic system. For the First Amendment was founded on the belief \"that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitney v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81088\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/274/357/#p375\">\n    274 U.S. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 375,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81088\" index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/274/357/#p375\">\n    47 S.Ct. 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81088\" index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/274/357/#p375\">\n    71 L.Ed. 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   This is not to say that a prosecutor can never face consequences for reckless public remarks. But the proper avenue for regulating prosecutorial statements is a state's ethical code governing attorneys, not private tort suits. Under Maryland's Rules of Professional Conduct, for example, a prosecutor may face discipline if he makes \"extrajudicial comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public condemnation of the accused,\" or \"extrajudicial statements that have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing an adjudicatory proceeding.\" Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 19-303.8. Notably exempt from that rule, however, are those \"statements that are necessary to inform the public of the nature and extent of the prosecutor's action and that serve a legitimate law enforcement purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .
