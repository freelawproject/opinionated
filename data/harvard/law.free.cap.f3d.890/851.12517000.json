Based on his resulting injuries, which include permanent physical disability and paralysis, Easley filed this action alleging that Macias violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   through the use of excessive force. The district court sua sponte ordered an evidentiary hearing regarding Macias' entitlement to qualified immunity. Following the two-day hearing, the district court ruled Macias was entitled to qualified immunity and granted summary judgment in his favor. Easley appeals, challenging the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment as procedurally impermissible and arguing that the record construed in the light most favorable to Easley reflects that genuine issues of material fact remain as to Macias' entitlement to qualified immunity. We affirm because the district court properly considered qualified immunity sua sponte and because, viewing the record in the light most favorable to Easley, Macias' use of deadly force was objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night of December 22, 2011, at around 8:20 p.m., Macias and his partner, Officer Anthony Watkins (\"Watkins\"), were on patrol in the 12th Street area of Riverside, California, in their police car. They noticed a pink Chevrolet Monte Carlo with what appeared to be illegally-tinted windows. Macias thought he recognized the driver, Stephania Session (\"Session\"), from a prior encounter. Easley, her husband, was a passenger in the car. As the Chevrolet passed the police car, Macias shone his flashlight into the car and the passenger leaned back in the seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Macias and Watkins began following the Chevrolet, which made a U-turn, sped up, and entered a strip mall parking lot. When the Chevrolet sped across the parking lot, fishtailing and barely avoiding hitting another car, the officers activated the patrol car's lights and sirens. The Chevrolet did not initially heed the lights and sirens, but then it suddenly stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Easley bolted out of the car and, clutching the waistband of his pants with his right hand, ran away from the patrol car. Macias and Watkins exited their patrol car and Watkins shouted \"Gun\" or \"He's got a gun.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Macias pursued Easley on foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Easley continued to clutch his waistband with his right hand. However, with his left hand he removed an object, later determined to be a gun, from his right pants' pocket and flung the item to his left. Macias fired three shots, striking Easley twice in the right arm and once in the back. Easley was shot within two to four seconds of throwing the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Easley and Session filed this action in California state court alleging, among other claims, the unreasonable and excessive use of force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, made actionable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The case was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint,\n   which Macias answered asserting that his actions \"were objectively reasonable under the circumstances\" and that he was entitled to \"qualified immunity from suit, liability and damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties negotiated a partial dismissal of some of the claims in the complaint and Macias agreed not to seek summary judgment on the remaining claims. On February 29, 2016, the district court conducted a pretrial status conference and sua sponte raised the issue of Macias' entitlement to qualified immunity. The district court ordered an evidentiary hearing on the issue, which was held on April 7 and 8, 2016. The court heard testimony from Macias, Easley, and several fact and expert witnesses. On June 1, 2016, the district court issued its order determining that there remained no genuine issue of material fact for determination by a jury and that Macias was entitled to qualified immunity and judgment as a matter of law. Easley and Session filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

It is an undisputed fact that Macias was concerned about the presence of a gun. Watkins, Macias's partner, had shouted \"Gun\" or \"He's got a gun\" when Easley ran away from the Chevrolet and the patrol car. Macias then saw Easley grab his waistband as he ran. It is undisputed that as he ran, Easley pulled an object from his right pants' pocket with his left hand and threw it away from his body. Macias shot Easley within two to four seconds of the object leaving Easley's hand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Easley stated that he threw the gun in a motion similar to throwing a Frisbee across his body; this would necessarily involve some upper body or shoulder movement. Based on these undisputed facts, a reasonable officer may have reasonably feared that Easley had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Thus, viewing the critical evidence in the light most favorable to Easley, we conclude that Macias is entitled to qualified immunity. We need not, and do not, resolve the remaining disputed issues of fact in Macias' favor to reach this result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , \"[t ]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. at 396-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court found Macias's controverted testimony to be credible, finding that Macias \"saw the profile of the gun\" when Easley removed it from his pocket and threw it away. The court went one step further and held there was \"no evidence\" to the contrary. However, significant portions of counsel's cross-examination of Macias at the evidentiary hearing was committed to circumstantial evidence suggesting Macias did not see the profile of the gun or have express knowledge of the presence of a gun. The district court erroneously either discounted or ignored the reasonable inferential value of Easley's evidence on this question when it concluded there was \"no evidence\" contrary to its finding that Macias saw the profile of the gun.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tolan\n   </em>\n   , 134 S.Ct. at 1863. We cannot consider whether Macias subjectively believed Easley carried or threw a gun; we may only consider whether the objectively identifiable profile of a gun was visible to him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inouye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2949798\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/705/#p712\">\n    504 F.3d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, in drawing all inferences in Easley's favor to conform with the law of summary judgment, we may not find or presume either (1) that the object Easley threw during the foot chase was or was not visibly identifiable or (2) that Macias did or did not \"see the profile\" of a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Additionally, the district court found that the incident occurred in a \"high-crime area.\" Macias suggests we should affirm this finding, which should support his decision to use deadly force in this case. However, the case law Macias relies upon concerning so-called \"high-crime areas\" involves reasonable-suspicion\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stops, not allegations of excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Given the limited record evidence supporting a finding of a high-crime area and the fact that such a finding relies on inference in Macias's favor rather than Easley's, I conclude that consideration of the purported \"high-crime area\" to Macias's benefit is contrary to the summary-judgment evidentiary standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The majority has avoided these two summary-judgment pitfalls, but it has joined the district court in three others. First, the district court and the majority have improperly considered the fact that Easley conceded\n   <em>\n    post facto\n   </em>\n   that the object thrown was in fact a gun. The standard is that the record must be evaluated \"from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, including what the officer knew at the time, not with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\"\n   <em>\n    Kingsley v.

The majority's consideration of knowledge gained after the incident is contrary to both the proper standard concerning reasonableness and the principles of summary-judgment evidence. Therefore, we can give no weight to Macias's claim in his briefing that he \"correctly thought [Easley] was armed,\" and I reject the majority's apparent reliance on the fact that the object thrown was \"later determined to be a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the district court and the majority fail to properly construe the record pertaining to the amount of time that elapsed between Easley disarming himself and Macias firing on him. On direct examination, Easley testified that \"maybe three to four seconds\" passed, but on cross-examination, he affirmed defense counsel's assertion that \"two or three seconds\" had elapsed. The discrepancy was not explored in the hearing, but for purposes of summary judgment, of course, this Court must construe the testimony in the light most favorable to Easley.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newmaker v.

The majority states it is an \"undisputed fact[ ]\" that \"Easley was shot\n   <em>\n    within two to four seconds\n   </em>\n   of throwing the gun.\" However, this statement is not a fact at all-it is a range of possible facts. Neither is it undisputed. Each party has flatly contradicted the other's version of the timing of events. The majority's recitation reveals it has not\n   properly construed the record in the light most favorable to Easley. Four seconds, two seconds, and zero seconds are not constitutionally equivalent in these circumstances; we cannot so easily dismiss the distinction by stating that the event occurred \"within two to four seconds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, neither the district court nor the majority acknowledge Easley's testimony-which we must accept as true-stating that throughout the chase, he did not turn to look back at Macias, did not face Macias, and did not level the object in Macias's direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having clarified these several points of departure between myself and the majority concerning the proper evidence for consideration on summary judgment, I proceed to consider whether the factual disputes are material pursuant to the law of qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Concerning the doctrine of qualified immunity, I agree in general terms with the majority's recitation of the applicable law. In essence, there are three inquiries we must perform to determine whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity: (1) whether the official's conduct violated a plaintiff's constitutional right; (2) whether the constitutional right asserted by the plaintiff was clearly established in the law as it was at the time of the official's conduct; and (3) whether the law at the time would have made it clear to a reasonable official that the alleged conduct was unlawful under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green v.

However, it is not clear which question is the dispositive one. For its part, the district court has conflated the first inquiry-whether an official's exercise of force was unreasonable and therefore a violation of a constitutional right-with the third inquiry-whether a reasonable officer would have understood particular conduct to be unlawful.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    San Jose Charter of Hells Angels Motorcycle Club v.

There remain genuine disputes about,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Macias's line of sight on the gun and the timing between Easley's self-disarming and Macia's decision to fire on him. Therefore, it is possible for a jury to conclude on this record that Macias first reasonably suspected Easley was armed, then clearly observed Easley divest himself of the suspected firearm, and finally decided-\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   sufficient time to recognize Easley was unarmed and not dangerous-to fire upon him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The district court avoided this conclusion in part by deciding that the timing of this event is immaterial for summary-judgment purposes. I disagree. It is, for example, self-evident, that if an officer observes a suspect disarm himself and then pursues the suspect on foot\n   <em>\n    away\n   </em>\n   from the discarded weapon for thirty seconds, he may not then decide to fire upon the suspect and claim in good faith that he was in fear of the suspect using the discarded weapon to hurt him. Likewise, it is clear that if an officer observes a suspect remove a firearm from his pocket toward the officer and the officer shoots the suspect before the firearm leaves the suspect's hands, the officer's fear was reasonable even if the suspect later claims it was his intent to discard the weapon. This case, then, presents a complex line-drawing exercise: at what point between these two extremes does a fear of immediate harm become unreasonable?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As the majority notes, the law is clear that \"[t ]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    490 U.S. at 396-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p395\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, at the evidentiary hearing, Macias presented expert testimony regarding the time it takes \"to identify a threat, process it, make a decision, and then execute a response.\" Macias's expert testified that the \"lag time\" that occurs \"between an action and a reaction\" consists of \"milliseconds,\" or \"anywhere from [a] quarter-second to a third of a second.\" In this case, according to the summary-judgment record, Macias had four seconds to deliberate after Easley disarmed himself before he fired the first shot. Four seconds-by pure definition-pushes past the outer bounds of the case law's provision for \"split-second judgments\" and beyond the \"milliseconds\" needed to process new information according to Macias's own expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Of course, if a jury were to determine that fewer than four seconds passed or that Macias could not have objectively seen or known that Easley had disarmed himself, this calculus changes. That is why the matters of timing and of Easley discarding his firearm remain genuine, triable issues of material fact.

This of course must be true because every individual case will present at least nominal factual distinctions. If precisely identical facts were required, qualified immunity would in fact be\n   <em>\n    absolute\n   </em>\n   immunity for government officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   With these principles in mind, I conclude that clearly established law for qualified-immunity purposes will necessarily contain both operative circumstances-i.e., the circumstances from which the constitutional violation flowed-and ancillary circumstances-i.e., the surrounding factual details of the case that bear no constitutional significance. The operative circumstances described in\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   include: (1) the suspect was not holding a gun when shot even though a gun was within his reach, (2) the suspect did not point a gun at the officers, and (3) the suspect did not turn to face the officers. These same circumstances are the foundational points of fact in the present case for summary-judgment purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Macias notes this case involved a foot chase, while\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   involved officers breaking down a door to intercept a seated suspect they believed was armed. This is indeed a factual distinction. However, both\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   and the present case involve similarly high-pressure situations for the officers. Macias has presented no principled\n   reason why he is subject to a lower threshold than the officers in\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   , who were also involved in quickly evolving and tense circumstances. Ultimately, the factual distinction Macias relies upon does not overcome the parallel operative circumstances between the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In broader terms, Macias contends the only court ruling that would satisfy the established-law inquiry would be a case holding that it is \"unconstitutional for an officer to shoot at an armed suspect who grabbed and raised an object immediately before being shot, simply because the suspect let go of the object seconds before being hit.\" This curious characterization of the present circumstances is strained and self-contradictory; it claims Easley was simultaneously armed and unarmed. But more to the point, the law does not require this level of precise factual identity for the unconstitutionality of certain conduct to be \"clearly established.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In this case, there exists a construction of the disputed facts that is controlled by the clearly established expectations for government officials both as generally set forth in\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and as specifically set forth in\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The third inquiry asks whether \"a reasonable officer would have understood her conduct to be unlawful\" in the circumstances alleged.\n   <em>\n    Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740791\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/1119/#p1123\">\n    648 F.3d at 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, this is a separate question from whether Macias's conduct was reasonable. Macias enjoys an extra layer of deference on this third inquiry insofar as he may have reasonably\n   <em>\n    believed\n   </em>\n   his conduct was permissible even if it was not. In recognition of this extra deference, \"if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue, immunity should be recognized.\"\n   <em>\n    Malley v. Briggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202676\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/335/#p341\">\n    475 U.S. 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202676\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/335/#p341\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202676\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/335/#p341\">\n    89 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   However, the proper answer to this inquiry, like that of the first inquiry, is presently lost within the contested facts. If the objective circumstances would have unequivocally informed a reasonable officer that Easley was disarmed and if four full seconds to deliberate passed between that officer's perception thereof and his decision to shoot Easley, I conclude there is no room for a reasonable officer with an understanding of\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Curnow\n   </em>\n   to assert that the use of deadly force was reasonable. Therefore, there remain genuine issues of material fact bearing upon resolution of this inquiry. Based on the summary-judgment record taken in the light most favorable to Easley, Macias's entitlement to qualified immunity is not presently established as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   My conclusion that summary judgment was improper is not equal to a conclusion that Macias is not entitled to qualified immunity. Macias may prove in further proceedings that he is so entitled. He simply has not done so at this pre-trial, summary-judgment stage. The proper resolution to this appeal, therefore, is that we should reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for resolution of the contested factual issues by a jury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zion v.

But in this case, the district court's two-day evidentiary hearing was a de facto bench trial, and Macias therefore has already suffered whatever abstract harm might result from an infraction upon his asserted immunity from suit, mooting consideration of that injury for our purposes on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   When, as here, triable issues of fact preclude resolution of an official's entitlement to qualified immunity, then the immunity question is \"transformed from a doctrine providing immunity from suit to one providing a defense at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , 873 F.3d at 823. On remand, \"special interrogatories to the jury can be used to establish disputed material facts,\" which the district court can then rely upon to determine Macias's eligibility for qualified immunity as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 823-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The requisite analyses in this case are difficult and complex; nonetheless, we must diligently and carefully perform each one to ensure that we fulfill our roles as neutral arbiters of the law in \u00a7 1983 actions alleging excessive force, which are presently subject to increased public scrutiny. Though the law is complicated, the outcome in this case is simple: there remain genuine, triable disputes concerning facts material to Macias's entitlement to qualified immunity. I therefore conclude we are prohibited from granting summary judgment at this stage in the proceedings. My conclusion in no way prejudices Macias's ability to prove his entitlement to qualified immunity at trial, and it also avoids any potential for irremediable prejudice to Easley's Fourth or Seventh Amendment rights. And because we are not permitted to weigh evidence or make credibility determinations, we may not opine as to the likelihood either that Easley will prevail on the merits of his claim or that Macias will be able to establish entitlement to qualified immunity at trial. The best course for us is to reverse and remand for further proceedings. I therefore dissent from the majority's decision to affirm the district court.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The proscription against fact-finding on summary judgment is a deceptively difficult mandate.
