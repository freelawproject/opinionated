As we recently explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   In determining whether statutory alternatives constitute elements or means, [\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ] clarified that sentencing courts should look first to state law, including judicial interpretations of the criminal statute by state courts. Alternatively, the statute itself may provide the answer. A statute might explicitly identify which things must be charged (and so are elements) and which need not be (and so are means). Moreover, if statutory alternatives carry different punishments, then under\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   they must be elements. On the other hand, if a statutory list is drafted to offer \"illustrative examples,\" then it includes only a crime's means of commission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   State law can be expected to provide a clear answer to the elements-means dilemma in many cases, but, if it does not, a sentencing court may briefly look to the record of the prior conviction. Sentencing courts encountering this situation may take a \"peek\" at the record documents for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether the listed items are elements of the offense. Indictments, jury instructions, plea colloquies and plea agreements will often reflect the crime's elements and so can reveal whether a statutory list is of elements or means. If the charging documents reiterate all the terms of the law, then each alternative is only a possible means of commission, not an element that the prosecutor must prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The same is\n   true if those documents use a single umbrella term like \"premises.\" On the other hand, the record could indicate that the statute contains a list of distinct elements by referencing one alternative term to the exclusion of all others. Only if the record indicates that the listed items are elements, not alternative means, may the sentencing courts examine the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents to determine whether the crime the defendant was convicted of constituted a generic burglary. The Court cautioned, however, that such record materials will not in every case speak plainly, and if they do not, a sentencing judge will not be able to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   's demand for certainty when determining whether a defendant was convicted of a generic offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Georgia Burglary Statute's Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to\n   <em>\n    Gundy\n   </em>\n   , the burglary statute creates three distinct and exhaustive categories of locations: \"(1) dwelling house, or (2) building, vehicle, railroad car, watercraft, or other such structure designed for use as a dwelling, or (3) any other building, railroad car, aircraft, or any room or any part thereof.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141931\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1156/#p1159\">\n    842 F.3d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further,\n   <em>\n    Gundy\n   </em>\n   held that the statute's repeated use of the disjunctive \"or\" indicates that those specifically listed locations are alternative elements of the offense. \"Each of the three subsets enumerates a finite list of specific structures in which the unlawful entry must occur to constitute the crime of burglary. In doing so, the burglary statute has multiple locational elements effectively creating several different crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141931\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1156/#p1159\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12141931\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/842/1156/#p1159\">\n    at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Focusing on the disjunctive nature of the statute does find some support in precedent. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court explained that a statute \"stating that burglary involves entry into a building\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   an automobile\" is divisible.\n   <em>\n    Descamps v.

This speculation lacks support.

He argues that because the instructions refer to the burglarized location only as \"any building or dwelling\" without listing the other locations enumerated in the statute (such as \"aircraft\"), the instructions support the conclusion that the type of location is not an element of burglary. (Appellant's Br. at 15-16 (citing Ga. Suggested Pattern Jury Instr., Vol. II, Crim. \u00a7\u00a7 2.62.10, 2.62.20 [hereinafter Ga. Crim. Jury Instr.] ).) Richardson also contrasts burglary's intent element with the locational list. Because there are two types of intent (to commit theft and to commit a felony), Georgia has two sets of jury instructions for burglary. Richardson thus surmises that the lack of separate instructions as to each location\n   enumerated in the burglary statute indicates that location is not a statutory element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, the proposed jury instructions also do not resolve the elements/means inquiry. First, it appears that the phrase \"any building or dwelling\" was intended only as a placeholder; as the instructions direct, a trial judge should \"[c]harge only the appropriate language\" from the recommended instruction and \"adapt parentheticals to the indictment and evidence.\" Ga. Crim. Jury Instr., Preamble to \u00a7 2.62.10. And the requirement that the instructions be modified to comport with the indictment is well-settled in Georgia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Childs v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1215121\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/257/243/\">\n    257 Ga. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1215121\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/257/243/\">\n    357 S.E.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (1987) (stating that it \"is error to charge the jury that a crime may be committed by either of two methods, when the indictment charges it was committed by one specific method\") (internal quotations marks, alterations, and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Second, although the relevant language of the burglary statute did not change from the pre-July-2012 version to the 2012-2017 version,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the language of the corresponding jury instructions did.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury instructions now list in parentheses each location enumerated in the statute. Thus, we would have to conclude that the statute is indivisible under one set of jury instructions (because, as Richardson argues, the instructions include the phrase \"any building or dwelling\" instead of the full list of locations) but divisible under a later version of jury instructions (because the instructions now include the full list of locations), even though the relevant language in the underlying burglary statute remained unchanged. Thus, Georgia's pattern jury instructions are also of little help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

However, neither side has established its position with certainty. Unlike the Iowa burglary statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , which relied on a clear statement from the Iowa Supreme Court that the premises listed in the statute were \"alternative method[s]\" of satisfying the locational element,\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2248\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we do not have the benefit of such a clear pronouncement from Georgia's highest court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although the parties' arguments do not definitively answer the threshold elements/means inquiry, they do establish that Georgia's burglary statute and the law interpreting it are ambiguous as to whether the different types of listed locations are elements or means of committing the offense. This is not surprising; \"the divergence of outcomes after\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   suggests that the 'elements or means' inquiry is not quite as easy as the Supreme Court thought, not the least because state legislatures and state courts do not draft their laws and craft their decisions with this particular distinction in mind.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Conversely, an indictment and jury instructions could indicate, by referencing one alternative term to the exclusion of all others, that the statute contains a list of elements, each one of which goes toward a separate crime.
