Prior to said Act, a verbal sale, accompanied by a delivery of possession, was sufficient.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-12\">Action against a Company by Name.\u2014An action can only be maintained against a company by the name under which it transacts its business, when sued by a company name. The statute authorizing suit to be brought against a company by its name is in derogation of the common law and will be strictly construed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-13\">Idem.\u2014Where, in a Justice's Court, the complaint was filed against the Independent Company, and the service, as shown by the return, was on R., a member of the Independent Company, and the summons was addressed to, and the judgment, which was by default, rendered against, the Independent Tunnel Company ; <em>held, </em>that the Court did not acquire jurisdiction of the Independent Tunnel Company, and the judgment was void.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-14\">Jurisdiction of Justice's Court.\u2014No presumptions will be indulged in favor of the jurisdiction of inferior Courts\u2014as Justices' Courts ; but it is incumbent on the party asserting a right under their judgments to show affirmatively that they had jurisdiction.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b318-15\">Color of Title.\u2014Where, under a void judgment rendered by a Justice of the Peace, a sale and deed of a mining claim were made to Gr., who assigned the deed to K. <em>held, </em>that said judgment, deed, and assignment were not competent evidence for K. to show color of title in him to the claim, under the statute relative to adverse possession.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b319-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Appeal from the District Court, Fourteenth Judicial District, Placer County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">This was an action to recover the possession of two and one half undivided sixteenth shares of the Independent Tunnel Mining Claims in Placer County. The plaintiff, in the complaint, alleged title in himself, and an ouster hy the defendant. The defendant, in answer, denied all the averments of the complaint, except the fact of his (defendant\u2019s) possession, alleged title in himself, and pleaded the Statute of Limitations. The cause was tried before, the Court with a jury. The plaintiff, in the statement of his cause at the commencement of the trial, stated his title to the demanded premises to be derived by purchase by deed or bill of sale. The plaintiff stated, as a witness in his own behalf, that the deed or bill of sale was lost, and, under the objection and exception of the defendant, gave testimony of its contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">The testimony of the witness, Deiner, was offered to show title to the demanded property in the plaintiff; the defendant objected to its introduction, on the grounds of incompetency and irrelevancy, and excepted to its admission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">The defendant deraigned title under a purchase of the demanded property by Garrison at a judicial sale, and duly excepted to the exclusion of the record of A. B. Scott, J. P., when offered to prove title in him to the demanded property; also to the judgment, the deed to Garrison, and the assignment of the deed to the plaintiff, to show color of title in plaintiff in aid of his plea of the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant appealed. The case came up on the judgment roll, containing bills of exceptions taken by the parties respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-9\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-10\"><em>C. A.

B. Scott, and the Consta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ble\u2019s deed, with its assignment to plaintiff, for the purposes\u2014 first, of showing title in plaintiff; and, second, to show color of title in plaintiff; and on the last point cited <em>Kimball </em>v. <em>Lohmas, </em>31 Cal. 154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>Jo Hamilton, </em>and W. <em>H.

The evidence of the loss was insufficient. It showed that in all probability the bill of sale was left in the plaintiff\u2019s store at Yorkville at the time the plaintiff sold out and delivered possession of the store and its contents to his nephew. His nephew, at the time of the trial, was in the county and in reach of the process of the Court, yet he was neither called as a witness as to what had become of the bill of sale, nor does it appear that he was ever questioned by the plaintiff touching the missing document. It is true that the plaintiff searched the store about a year after the nephew took possession, but that was not sufficient. Under, the circumstances detailed by the plaintiff, which are very similar to those presented in the case just cited, inquiry should have been made of the nephew for the missing document in order to sufficiently establish its loss. It does not appear that any search was made for the purpose of this trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">In view of the fact that the plaintiff acquired his interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>by purchase, as stated by his counsel in opening the case to the jury, and not by virtue of his being one of the original members of the company who located the claim, we are at a loss to perceive how the testimony of the witness Deiner as to the fact that the plaintiff had acted gs a member of the company, or of the plaintiff himself as to the payment of assessments, or of the books of the company showing that the plaintiff had acted and been received as a member of the company, can be regarded as competent and relevant. Undoubtedly this testimony would have been competent and relevant had the plaintiff claimed title as an original member of the company, for it would have tended to prove that he was a member of the company, and therefore that he held an interest in the claim by virtue of the company\u2019s location. But in view of his admission that he had acquired his interest by purchase from some one or more of the original locators, which admission does not seem to have been afterwards withdrawn, we think he was bound to make title by proof of his purchase\u2014either by the production of his deed or bill of sate, if he. had one, or by proof of a verbal sale and delivery of possession, if the purchase was made prior to the passage of the Act of April 13th, 1860. (Statutes, p. 175; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Keystone Mining Company, </em>30 Cal. <em>363; Goller </em>v. <em>Fett, </em>30 Cal. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The Court did not err in excluding the record from the Court of A. B. Scott, Justice of the Peace for Township No. 5, as evidence of the defendant\u2019s title. While the statute, in cases where two or more persons are associated in any business and transact such business under a common name, allows suit to be brought against them by such company name, it does not allow suit to be brought against them by a company name which is not the name under which they transact their business. The statute is in derogation of the common law, and must be strictly construed.\u2019 As appears upon the face of the record, the action was commenced, not against the Independent Tunnel Company, but against the Independent Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>pany, which is certainly a different name. True, the Justice addressed the summons to the Independent Tunnel Company, but this he had no right to do. On the contrary, he should have followed the style given in .the complaint, or its substitute, the account which had been filed as a complaint and which was against the Independent Company. <em>(Lamping </em>v. Hyatt, 27 Cal. 102.) The return shows that the summons was served on Randall, a member of the Independent Company, and not of the Independent Tunnel Company. This was no service upon the latter company. True, the Court entered judgment against the Independent Tunnel Company, but this the Court had no power to do, for the judgment was by default. <em>(Lamping </em>v. <em>Hyatt, supra.) </em>Had the company appeared and pleaded the misnomer in abatement, if it was a misnomer, or waived it by not pleading it, the result might have been different. But as it is, the record fails to show either an action against or a service upon the Independent Tunnel Company, and the judgment was therefore utterly null and void. <em>(Mayo </em>v. <em>Ah Loy, </em>32 Cal. 477.) Nothing can be presumed in favor of the jurisdiction of the Court. Being an inferior Court, its jurisdiction must be made to appear affirmatively. The defendant was bound to show that the Court had j urisdiction. This the record offered did not prove, but quite the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Hor did the Court err in excluding the judgment, the Constable\u2019s deed to Garrison, and the assignment of the Constable\u2019s deed by Garrison to the defendant, when offered as tending to show color of title under the statute in relation to adverse possession. The instrument from Garrison to the defendant was not a deed of the mining claim, but merely an assignment of \u201chis right, title and interest in and to \u201d the Constable\u2019s deed, and not to the land therein described. Title passes by deed and not by an assignment of the deed to the assignee. Whether, had Garrison conveyed to the defendant, the judgment and Constable\u2019s deed in connection with such conveyance would have been admissible as showing color of title in aid of the defendant\u2019s plea of the Statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Limitations, it is therefore unnecessary to determine. But upon this point see <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>1 Cow. 286, and <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Peru Iron Company, </em>7 Wend. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Judgment reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
