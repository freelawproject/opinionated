and the like considerations require that the innkeeper should be held to the responsibilities which, by his representations, he induced his guests to believe ho would assume.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-6\">Who are Guests.\u2014A traveller who enters an inn as a guest does not cease to be a guest by proposing to remain a given number of days, or by ascertaining the price that will be charged for his entertainment, or by paying in advance for a part or the whole of the entertainment, or paying for what he has occasion for, as his wants are supplied.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-7\">For what Property of Guest Innkeeper is Responsible.\u2014The responsibility of-the innkeeper for the safe keeping of his guests' property extends equally to such as the guests have with them, in their immediate possession, at the moment of arrival at the inn, and that which subsequently arrives at the inn; and the rule is in nowise different where the property is acquired by the guests subsequently to arrival at the inn.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-8\">Idem.\u2014Where, by general notice, the guests of an inn were requested not to leave money or articles of value in their rooms, but to deposit the same for safe keeping in the safe at the office, and a deposit of money and gold dust is made at the office by a guest, -which is placed by the innkeeper in the safe, kept to receive the valuables of guests, this, in the absence of any other motive or reason shown for the transaction, will be deemed to be a deposit made by the guest and received by the innkeeper in pursuance of said general notice, and to enable the innkeeper the better to give that care and security to the property which is required of him in that capacity by law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-9\">Innkeeper Insurer of Guests' Property.\u2014The rule is, that an innkeeper is liable as an insurer of the goods of his guests committed to his care.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-10\">Amount and Kind of Property Innkeeper Responsible for.\u2014Where the innkeeper gave notice to his guests to deposit their money and valuables, without any limits specified, for safe keeping, and that ho would not otherwise be responsible therefor, and accordingly a guest had deposited a large amount of money and gold dust, which had been received without objection by the innkeeper and put in the usual place of deposit at the inn of valuables for safe keeping; in such a case it is too late for the innkeeper, when the property has been stolen, to object as to the kind or amount of the property so deposited, for the purpose of defeating or reducing a recovery for its value.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-11\">For wiiat Property and whose acts Innkeeper is Responsible.\u2014The responsibility of the innkeeper extends to all his domestics and servants, and to all the moveable goods and chattels and moneys of his guest which are placed within the inn, and is therefore liable for all losses of the property of his guest occurring within the inn, except those occasioned by the act of God or the public enemy, or the neglect or fraud of the guest.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b558-12\">Judgment in Gold Coin for Money Lost at Inn.\u2014A guest who had deposited with an innkeeper his money, consisting of gold coin, is entitled under the Specific Contract Act to recover judgment therefor payable in gold coin only.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b558-13\">Appeal from the District Court, Twelfth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The defendant was sued as an innkeeper to recover for the loss of one hundred and sixty-eight ounces of gold dust, the property of the plaintiff;

They came to San Eran cisco by steamer, and arrived on the first day of Hovember, 1865, having no business here at all. It was a convenient route, and afforded them the opportunity of travelling by ste\u00e1na from Victoria to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>San Francisco, and from the latter place to Few York. They immediately went to the hotel called the \u201cWhat Cheer House,\u201d of which the defendant was proprietor, and very shortly afterwards engaged passage hy the Ficaragua route to Few York, on' the steamship America, which sailed on the 13th of Fovember, 1865, and expected and intended to embark on her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b569-5\">Walker had fifteen hundred dollars in gold coin, and the others had* their respective bags of gold dust, the amounts being the same that are particularly stated in the complaint.

The plaintiff claims to recover from the defendant the value of 395J ounces of gold dust and $1,500 in gold coin, alleged to have been placed in defendant\u2019s hands as an innkeeper by plaintiff and others, while guests at his inn, a few days previous to the 13th day of November last, and while they were travelling and on their way .from the British Possessions on the Pacific Coast to their home in Canada. Plaintiff sues as well for money, etc,, claimed by himself, as for that of certain others who have assigned their several demands to him. No question is made about the <em>bona Jides </em>of the respective assignments. Defendant, among other things, claims that he was not an innkeeper; that the valuables in question were received by him through his employes, not for hire or reward, but as a matter of accommodation to plaintiff and others whose claims he represents; that the same were put into a safe by him for that purpose provided, and carefully guarded; and, while so in his custody and guarded, the said safe, on the night of the 12th of November, was opened by thieves and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the contents stolen, including plaintiff\u2019s treasure, without the fault or negligence of himself or his servants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-5\">\u201cAn early inquiry by you will be to determine from the proofs whether or not defendant, at the time alleged, was an innkeeper. The Court understands, and so charges you, that an inn, as known to the law, and defined in this class of actions, is a public place of entertainment for all travellers who choose to visit it. It is distinguished from a private lodging or boarding house mainly in this : that the keeper of the latter is at liberty to choose his guests, while the innkeeper is obliged to entertain and furnish all travellers of good conduct and means of payment, everything which they have occasion for as such travellers, whilst on their way. A house becomes an inn by the mere custom of receiving persons transiently as guests, without a definite agreement as to time. But a mere restaurant or place of eating is not one. It is immaterial, in determining whether one was an innkeeper at any given time, to inquire in what way, as to the particular agencies employed by him to accomplish it, the desired entertainment to the traveller, whether in part or in whole, was furnished. Such agencies or <em>means </em>are unimportant. A material fact to determine, in any given case, is whether the alleged innkeeper professed to supply the travelling public at his public house with what travellers have necessary occasion for; and, if it be found that he did, and, further, that he entertained travellers for hire, it is entirely without importance to know whether the lodging department was conducted by one set of the innkeeper\u2019s servants, and. the provisions made by him for the traveller\u2019s eating are through a <em>restaurant </em>in the same building, wherein the innkeeper\u2019s actual interest was only that of a partner. Business arrangements of the innkeeper, as to the mode of supply, are neither of the concern of the traveller nor do they in any way affect the legal relations between the innkeeper and his travelling guests, either as to their reciprocal obligations or liabilities while that relation lasts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b583-6\">\u201c Should you find that the defendant was, at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>alleged, an innkeeper within the meaning of that term as defined to you by the Court, and you further find that the plaintiff and his assignors were travellers and guests of defendant as such innkeeper, and that plaintiff and his assignors, while at defendant\u2019s inn as such travellers and guests, placed in charge of defendant, through his servants and employ\u00e9s by him thereto authorized, money or other valuables for safe keeping during their temporary sojourn, as alleged in complaint, and the same, while so left in his charge, were lost by theft or robbery, and through no fault or negligence of plaintiff, his assignors, or the act of God, or that of the public enemy, then, and in such case, the' defendant, as an innkeeper, is held to extraordinary liability therefor, on grounds of public utility growing out of his vocation. In such case he is holden to warrant the safe keeping of the property of his travelling guests; his liability is that of an insurer, and as such insurer of the property delivered to him, he is liable for loss or damage happening to it while in his possession, except when such loss or damage is occasioned by the act of God, or the public enemy, or through the fault of the owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-6\">. \u201c The principle of public utility which underlies this most salutary rule of the law, touching an innkeeper\u2019s liability to his travelling guests, is supported by manifest reason. It has been early and often expressed by distinguished jurists, and, it is thought, has commended itself at all times to the just and enlightened, on all occasions where expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b584-7\">\u201c \u2018 If he be not held to this strict rule of accountability, it would be in his power to combine with robbers, or to pretend a robbery, or some other accident, without the possibility of remedy to the party injured, inasmuch as the combination could be effected in such a clandestine manner as would render discovery practically impossible; \u2019 and it is added, \u2018 the law will not expose him to so great a temptation.\u2019 Again, it has been forcibly said, \u2018 that in case goods should be lost or injured by the grossest negligence of the innkeeper or his servants, or stolen by them, or by thieves in collusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>with them, the owner would be unable to prove either of these causes of loss.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-5\">\u201c These considerations are the basis of the law which obtains in the best adjudged cases as to the liability of innkeepers ; they are confessedly those on which the liability of common carriers rests; and if salutary as to common carriers, they are equally so as to innkeepers. Carriers and innkeepers are under legal obligations\u2014the former to accept property offered for transportation, the latter such travelling guests as present themselves, with their goods; and they are entitled to demand a reasonable compensation, and they have a lien on the property therefor. The carrier may demand recompense commensurate with his extraordinary liability; so, too, may the innkeeper. Indeed, they stand' alike in all substantial points of duty, obligations and rights, as well public as private.\u2019 Unless we are at liberty to make a distinction in favor of innkeepers which clearly impugns a principle conceded by all to properly apply to common carriers, innkeepers cannot be relieved from the rule which holds them liable as insurers, with the exceptions previously stated, against loss and damage to the goods of their travel-ling guests, occurring when in their possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-6\">\u201c We further charge you, that if you believe, from the evidence, that the defendant, at the time alleged in the complaint, was the keeper of an inn, and as such, and as a part of his business as an innkeeper, had been and was in the habit of receiving moneys, gold dust, or other valuable packages from his guests for safe keeping, and for such guests\u2019 accommodation, and kept a book for the registry thereof, and that plaintiff and his assignors, as travelling guests of defendant, delivered at the inn, to the clerk of defendant having charge of such valuables and registry, money and gold dust, or either of them, for safe keeping, and the same has been lost while so in the custody of defendant, which loss was not caused by the act of God nor by that of the public enemy, nor by that of plaintiff or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>assignors, then defendant, as such innkeeper, is liable for the actual value of what was so lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-6\">\u201c Should you find that the defendant was not an innkeeper at the time charged, and that he received plaintiff\u2019s and his assignors\u2019 coin and dust for safe keeping, without reward received or to he received therefor, then and in such case defendant was only hound to use such care in the safe keeping thereof as a prudent man, under similar circumstances, is reasonably expected to employ in the preservation of his own property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">\u201c Should you find that defendant was not an innkeeper, and that the alleged valuables were left with him, not for reward, and that the same were lost through no fault or negligence of himself or servants, then defendant is not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">\u201c Should you find for plaintiff, then, in estimating the value of the gold dust alleged to have been lost, you are not at liberty in your calculations to recognize any mercantile difference in value between gold and silver, as distinguished from United States legal tender notes, since, in law, the dollar of the one is the equivalent of the dollar of the other. \u2019'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-9\">A verdict and judgment were rendered and entered for the plaintiff for ten thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars.

The defendant insists that the \u201c What Cheer House,\u201d kept by him, was not, in November, 1865, at the time plaintiff and his assignors put up there, an inn in the common law definition of the term, and hence the liability of an innkeeper with reference to said property did not attach to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-12\">\u201c An innkeeper is one who holds himself out to the public \u00bfs engaged in the business of keeping a house for the <em>lodging and-entertainment </em>of travellers and passengers, <em>their horses and attendants, </em>for <em>reasonable </em>compensation.\u201d <em>(Howth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>20 Texas, 801; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>3 Barnwell &amp; Alderson, 283.) Story on Bailments, Sec. 475, uses the same language, citing Bacon\u2019s Abridgement, Inns and Innkeepers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-14\">But the keeper of a mere coffee house is not deemed an innkeeper. (Story on B., See. 476, citing <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Lanning, </em>4 Camp. 77.) A lodging house keeper is not an innkeeper. (Story on B., Sec. 476; Bell\u2019s Com. 469.) \u201c One taking lodgers to lodge and diet in his house, and letting stables for their horses, is not an innkeeper. <em>(Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>1 Salkeld, 388; <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>1 Hilton, N. Y., 193; 3 E. D. Smith, 149; Jacob\u2019s Law Dic. 452; 12 Mod. 255; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>12 Cooley, Mich., 54.) Assuming the cases of <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>3 E. D.

Monroe, 75, it was said: \u201cAnd certainly a man professing to be the keeper of a boarding house, or a licensed coffee house, is not, though he also entertain travellers, liable to his boarders as an innkeeper is liable to his travelling guests. * * The Court should have submitted to the jury whether plaintiff was a mere boarder,\u201d etc. If Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, in the last case, correctly expounded the difference between an innkeeper and a boarding or lodging house keeper, the Court below should have submitted to the jury the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth instructions requested by defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-10\">II. Was plaintiff (and his assignors, respectively,) a guest at an inn kept by defendant at the time of the deposit and loss ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-11\">An innkeeper cannot make any terms or conditions with his guest. (6 Term R 17; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>10 Wend. 269.) The guest must be a traveller. (1 Roll. Abr. 394; 2 Broome, 254; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Luellin, </em>12 Mod. 445; <em>Ingoldsbee v. Wood, </em>36 Barb. 451; Bacon\u2019s Ab., Inns, C, 5; <em>Parkhurst </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>1 Salkeld, 383-388.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-12\">One entertained on a <em>special contract </em>to sojourn for a time is not a guest of the inn, but a boarder. .(Story on B., Sec. 477.) Plaintiff lodged and occupied rooms in the \u201cWhat Cheer House \u201d \"under a special contract, <em>i. e. </em>at two dollars per week, without any obligation, express or implied, to eat in the \u201c What Cheer Restaurant,\u201d or to pay aught but the two dollars. If he elected to eat at the restaurant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>instant lie called for a dish enumerated on the bill of fare he entered into the following special contract: The proprietors of the restaurant undertook to furnish any such dish at the price fixed thereon, and the plaintiff agreed to pay per terms of the bill. \u00a1Nothing can be plainer than that plaintiff was not entertained as a traveller guest from day to day upon an implied contract, and furnished with everything he had occasion for on the way. Pay, or the right to charge, is the criterion of the innkeeper\u2019s liability. (26 Ver. 384.) Could defendant have been indicted, as at common law, for not furnishing plaintiff with meat and drink for himself and horse ? If not, he was not an innkeeper. We submit, the Court should have given to the jury the nineteenth, twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth instructions, as correct legal rules which the jury should take into consideration in determining the question presented by the twenty-seventh instruction, and by the first, second, third, and fourth instructions given at the request of plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">III. Did defendant receive such coin and gold dust as a bailee without hire, or in the character of innkeeper ? Plaintiff arrived at the house November 1st; he did not deposit his one hundred and sixty-eight ounces of gold dust until November 11th, in defendant\u2019s safe.</p>\n<p data-order=\"159\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">Defendant could be a bailee without hire, independent of the character of an innkeeper. <em>(Burgess </em>v. Clements, 4 Maule &amp; Selwyn, 306; <em>Howth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>20 Texas, 801.) Had plaintiff regarded defendant as an innkeeper, he would have made such deposit on arriving at the house; whereas, he only made the deposit in defendant\u2019s safe after having become acquainted with the manner defendant received and kept deposits, the mode in which the house was conducted, etc., and evidently because he considered it a safe place of deposit. There was no necessity for making the deposit with defendant; it was made in pursuance of the card posted about the house. (See <em>Meeker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Cal. 230, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"160\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The thirty-seventh instruction, refused, should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"161\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">IV. Was the money, etc., lost by a forcible robbery, without fault, carelessness, negligence, or connivance of defendants, his servants or guests ? Testimony was given tending to prove that the property, etc., was in a Tilton &amp; McFarland safe, which was locked, the key in the pocket of the clerk, the house guarded by a night watchman, a gaslight burning within three or four feet of the safe, two other lights within fifteen feet, the whole room visible from Sacramento street, a public thoroughfare much frequented at all hours of night; two men entering, knocked the clerk down, rendering him insensible, rifled his pockets of the keys, opened the safe, and carried off its contents, amounting to thirty thousand dollars and upwards. Jones on Bailments, after laying down the liability of innkeepers, concludes (p. Ill): <em>\u201c </em>In all cases, however, it is competent for the innholder to repel the <em>presumption </em>of his knavery or' default by proving that he took <em>ordinary </em>care, or that the <em>force </em>which occasioned the loss or damage was truly irresistible.\u201d (See Story on Bailments, Sec. 472; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>5 Term R. 276; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>5 Blackford, 323; Jones on Bailments, 96.) Thus, although a <em>common </em>carrier is liable for all losses occasioned by an armed mob, (not being public enemies,) an innkeeper is not (as it should seem) liable for such a loss. <em>(Morse </em>v. <em>Slue, </em>1 Vent. 190, 238; Hob., Case 30; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Kneeland, </em>Cro. Jac. 320; 12 Mod. 480.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"162\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">Neither is he liable, as it should seem, for a loss by robbery and burglary by persons from without the inn. <em>(Burgess </em>v. <em>Clements, </em>4 Maule &amp; Selwyn, 306; <em>Calye\u2019s Case, </em>8 Co. 32; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., Secs. 40, 593, 3; <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Chamey, </em>48 Eng.

Monroe, 74: \u201c But he is not liable if the loss be occasioned by external force or robbery\u201d \u201c where property committed to the custody of an innkeeper by his guest is lost, the presumption is that the innkeeper is liable for it, but he can relieve himself from that liability by showing that he has used <em>extreme diligence.\u201d (Howth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>20 Texas, 798.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-7\">Mr. Justice Redfield, in <em>McDaniels </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>26 Vt. 336, is of the same opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">In <em>Laird </em>v. <em>Eichold, </em>10 Indiana: \u201c The cases of <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Chamey, </em>48 Eng.

There may be a distinction between the liability of the keeper of an inn and of a mere boarding house, where none are received but for a certain time and on certain terms; but the house of the defendant clearly was not of the latter class. <em>(Wintermute </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>5 Sandf., S. C., 247; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Monnot, </em>4 Duer, 117.) As to who are the guests of an innkeeper, see 1 Parsons on Con. 627. The length of time a man is at the inn makes no difference.

Under the circumstances of- this case the authorities before referred to fully demonstrate the truth of the affirmative. A number of authorities are cited by appellant to show that the guest must be a traveller. If the plaintiff and his friends were not travellers in the strictest sense of the term, travellers are rarely to be found. But it is said that terms and conditions were imposed by the defendant, and that an innkeepter cannot make any terms or conditions with his guests. If this be true, then the terms and conditions are simply void, and his common law duty to his guests remains with all his common law liability. But there was no spiecial contract between plaintiff and his assignors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>defendant. A payment in advance or by the week does not amount to a special contract. (See 7 Cush. <em>417; </em>1 Parsons on Con. 627-8.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"189\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">Did the defendant receive the coin and gold dust as a bailee without hire, or in the character of innkeeper ? The defendant\u2019s counsel on this point maintains that it was not as innkeeper, on the single proposition that Pinkerton and Walker each arrived and put up at the \u201c What Cheer House \u201d on the 1st of November, but did not bring their coin and dust until the 11th of November. Because of this, it is urged that the treasure was not received as innkeeper. What were these travellers, under the circumstances, to do with their property ? They were travelling with it; it was the very object of their journey. They took it to their inn, and there was the notice. (Exhibit A, annexed to the answer.) 4 E. D. Smith, 94, is directly applicable here, and not less so lb. 55 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"190\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">A new trial will not be granted merely because the Court refused to give \"instructions which might have been properly given. <em>(Breckenridge </em>v.Anderson, 3 J.

(See the numerous cases cited in 3 Gra. &amp; Wat., N. T., 862 <em>et seq ; </em>also, <em>Merle </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>26 Cal. 467, and cases cited.) These views, we submit, are conclusive, not only as to the thirty-seventh instruction, but also as to the other instructions refused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"191\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\">Was the money, etc., lost by a forcible robbery, without fault, carelessness, negligence, or connivance of defendant, his servants or guests ? Under this head the appellant\u2019s counsel contends that the liability of an innkeeper depends upon the degree of care which he uses, and that if he has exercised <em>ordinary </em>care and diligence he is not liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"192\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-9\">But we contend that the true rule is that the innkeeper is an insurer against everything but the act of God or the public enemy, or -the neglect or fraud of the owner of the property.

It probably would not now be regarded as essential to an inn that wine or spirituous or malt liquors should be provided for the guests. At an inn of the greatest completeness entertainment is furnished for the traveller\u2019s horse as well as for the traveller, but it has long since been held that this was not essential to give character to the house as an inn. (See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Lacy, supra; </em>2 Kent, 595; 1 Smith Lead. Cases, notes to <em>Coggs </em>v. <em>Bernard; </em>Sto. on Bail. Sec. 475; <em>Kisten </em>v. <em>Hildebrand, </em>9 B. Mon. 74.) <em>In Wintermute </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>5 Sandf. 247, an inn is defined as a public house of entertainment for all who choose to visit it. The defendant insists that the \u201c What Cheer House \u201d was a lodging house and not an inn; because, as he says, the eating department was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tinct from the lodging department. It appears that in the basement of the \u201cWhat Cheer House,\u201d and connected with it by a stairway, there was a restaurant, which was conducted by the defendant and two other persons jointly, and that the three shared the profits. Where a person, by the means usually employed in that business, holds himself out to the world as an innkeeper, and in that capacity, is accustomed to receive travellers as his guests, and solicits a continuance of their patronage, and a traveller relying on such representations goes to the house to receive such entertainment as he has occasion for, the relation of innkeeper and guest is created, and the innkeeper cannot be heard to say that his professions were false, and that he was not in fact an innkeeper. The rules regulating the respective rights, duties and responsibilities of innkeeper and guest have their origin in considerations of public policy, and were designed mainly for the protection and security of travellers and their property. They would afford the traveller but poor security if, before venturing to intrust his property to one who by his agents, cards, bills, advertisements, sign, and all the means by which publicity and notoriety can be given to his business, represents himself as an innkeeper, he is required to inquire of the employes as to their interest in the establishment, or take notice of the agencies or means by which the several departments are conducted. The same considerations of public policy that dictated those rules demand that the innkeeper should be held to the responsibilities which, by his representations, he induced his guest to believe he would assume. We think the jury were fully warranted by the evidence in finding that the \u201c What Cheer House \u201d was an inn, and that the defendant was an innkeeper; and the Court correctly instructed the jury in respect to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">II. Very little need be said upon the question whether the plaintiff and his assignors were guests at the defendant\u2019s inn. A traveller who enters an inn as a guest does not cease to be a guest by proposing to remain a given number of days, or by ascertaining the price that will be charged for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Ms entertainment, or by paying in advance for a part or the whole of the entertainment, or paying for what he has occasion for, as his wants are supplied. We see no reason why the innkeeper may not require payment in advance or why the guest may not pay in advance for lodgings for a part or all the time he intends to remain as a guest at the inn. There can be no doubt from the evidence that the plaintiff and his assignors went to the \u201c What Cheer House \u201d as travellers and intended to have left for Hew York on the day the robbery was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">HI. Did the defendant receive the coin and gold dust as a bailee without hire, or in the character of innkeeper ? In <em>Matter </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Cal. 221, it is held that that was a question of fact, and the question was directed to he submitted to the jury. It was shown, beyond all controversy, that the gold dust was taken to the inn several days after the plaintiff arrived there as a guest. If that circumstance would have relieved the defendant of responsibility as an innkeeper, the question would not have been directed to be submitted to the jury, for it would be useless to find that he received it as innkeeper unless he could be held responsible in that capacity. That case is authority that the innkeeper may be held responsible for the property of the guest, placed under his care, after the owner of the property has become a guest at the inn. Two of the guests, in this case, deposited their gold dust with the defendant on their arrival at the hotel, and the others\u2014the plaintiff and Walker \u2014made their deposits after they had been at the hotel ten days. Ho reason is perceived why the responsibility of the innkeeper, for the safe keeping of his guests\u2019 property should be limited to such property as the guest may have in his immediate possession at the moment of his arrival at the inn. The relation of innkeeper and guest, out of which springs the responsibility, is the same, whether the guest\u2019s baggage is conveyed to the inn with him, or at a subsequent time; or whether he then has in his possession or afterwards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>procures the money, clothing, etc., that he may need on his journey.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The guests of the house were requested not to leave money or articles of value in their rooms, but to deposit the same for safe keeping in a safe at the office, and there is nothing in the case to show that the deposits were made by the guests or received by the innkeeper for any other reason or purpose than in pursuance of such request, and the better to enable the innkeeper to give that care and security to the property which are required of him by law. In <em>Needles </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 55, and <em>Stanton v. Leland, </em>4 E. D. Smith, 94, the material questions arising upon this point were very fully considered and the conclusion reached was adverse to the position of the defendant. The instruction requested by the defendant on this point was liable to the objection stated by the Court as the ground of its refusal, that it was likely to mislead the jury. The kind of bailment denominated in the instruction \u201c ordinary bailment,\u201d is not defined or in any way distinguished from that bailment which arises when a guest places his property in the custody of an innkeeper in the customary mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">IV\". The fourth point as stated by the defendant is, \u201c Was the money, etc., lost by a forcible robbery, without fault, carelessness, negligence, or connivance of defendant, his servants or guests ?\u201d We think the jury were justified in answering the question in the negative, because of the neglect of the defendant\u2019s clerk to turn on the safe the combination lock. But under this point counsel have discussed the question whether an innkeeper is an insurer of the property of his guest, committed to his care. The authorities do not agree upon this question. Some of the cases hold that the innkeeper is not responsible when the loss was occasioned by inevitable casualty, by irresistible force, by superior force, or by robbery or burglary, committed by persons from without the <em>inn; </em>and some go even further and hold that the presumption of negligence may be rebutted, by showing that there was no negligence in point of fact on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>part, or that of his servants. But the preponderating weight of authority, from the time of the decision in <em>Calye\u2019e Case, </em>8 Coke, 82, to the present time, is in favor of the rule that he is liable as an insurer. The rule is thus stated in 1 Pars, on Cont. 628 : <em>\u201c </em>Public policy imposes upon an innkeeper a severe liability. The later, and on the whole, prevailing, authorities make him an insurer of the property committed to his care, against everything but the act of God, or the public enemy, or the neglect or fraud of the. owner of the property. He would then be liable for a loss occasioned by his own servants, by other guests, by robbery or burglary from without the house, or by rioters or mobs.\u201d The rule is carried to the same extent in <em>Maker </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 Cal. 221. We deem it unnecessary at this time to enter upon a review of the cases, or to recapitulate the argument or reasons in support of the rule, as this has very fully been done in <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>31 Maine, 478; <em>Sibley </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>33 N. H. 553; <em>Hulet </em>v. <em>Swift, 42 </em>Barb. 249, S. C.; and 33 N. Y. 571. (See, also, <em>Grinnell </em>v. <em>Cook, 3 </em>Hill, 485; <em>Thickstone </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>8 Blackf. 535 ; <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Manny, </em>21 Wend. 282; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>9 Pick. 280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">V. The fifth point is that the defendant is not liable for an amount beyond what is sufficient for the reasonable travelling expenses of the plaintiff and his assignors. The gold dust was not money, any more than are bank bills, or Government stocks or securities; but it was so readily convertible into money at San Francisco that for the purposes of this question it may be treated as money. The doctrine of <em>Mateer </em>v. <em>Brown </em>is opposed to the limited liability contended for. It would be altogether impracticable for the Court to lay down any rules for determining what would be reasonable travelling expenses. One person might choose to make the trip in the cheapest manner, and another might indulge in the most lavish expenditures. The contingencies to which the party might be subject on his journey could not be anticipated, nor the expenses, calculated with any certainty. -But if the innkeeper is authorized in any case to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>supervise the expenditures of. his guest there was nothing of that character manifested here. The notice to the guests was that the innkeeper would not hold himself responsible for their money or articles of value unless they were deposited in the safe at the office. There was no limit indicated as to the amount or value that might be deposited; and it appears that at the time the safe was robbed it contained money and gold dust, deposited by guests, of about the amount of thirty thousand dollars. These deposits were being made every day, and entries thereof were made in a book kept for that purpose. The evidence shows that the receipt and entry of such deposits was a part of the regular and usual business of the hotel. The plan was devised and carried on, not only for the innkeeper\u2019s protection, but to induce travellers to patronize the hotel, by offering them greater security for their property. After having thus offered, as an innkeeper, to take charge of the money of his guests, and having received it on deposit and placed it where such property was usually kept, he cannot avoid responsibility for its loss, by saying that the guest deposited too much money. It is too late to raise the objection that the amount of money was larger than the guest might -need for his reasonable expenses after the money deposited according to the rules of the inn has been stolen, even admitting that the objection would be good before the deposit was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Several of the cases cited by the defendant support the position that the innkeeper is not responsible for everything that the guest may choose to bring to the inn; but we apprehend that he would not have been relieved of responsibility in any of those cases had the property at his request been committed to his special care and custody. In <em>Calye\u2019s Case </em>it was resolved that \u201c if one brings a bag or chest, etc., of evidences into the inn, or obligations, deeds, or other specialities, and by default of the innkeeper they are taken away, the innkeeper shall answer for them.\u201d The language of Mr. Chancellor Kent is equally strong: \u201c The responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Mlity of the innkeeper extends to all his servants and domestics, and to all the movable goods and chattels and moneys of his guest which are placed within the inn.\u201d (2 Kent, 593.) There are many cases in which it is held that his responsibility extends to money and chattels other than such as are provided by the guest for his necessary or convenient use while travelling. In <em>Clute </em>v. <em>Wiggins, </em>14 Johns. 175,. the guest recovered for certain bags of wheat and barley. In <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Manny, </em>21 Wend. 282, the recovery was for a tub of butter. In <em>Snider </em>v. <em>Geiss, </em>1 Yeates, 34, the innkeeper was held liable for two hundred and thirty Spanish milled dollars. In <em>Hulett </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>33 N. Y. 571, the plaintiff recovered the value of his horses, wagon and a load of buckskin goods. In <em>Townson </em>v. <em>Havre de Grace Bank, </em>6 Har. &amp; John. 47, the property in controversy was one thousand dollars, in bank bills. In <em>Mateer </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>the amount deposited was five thousand five hundred dollars, in gold dust. The doctrine laid down in <em>Purvis </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>21 N. Y. 112, applies with very decided force to the question here. A sum of money, four hundred sovereigns, was stolen from the plaintiff\u2019s trunk, which was in a room in the hotel, assigned to the plaintiff. \u00a1Notice, in fact, had been given to the plaintiff, on his arrival, that the defendants had provided a saf\u00e9 for the deposit of the valuables of their guests, and that they would not be liable for their loss, unless they were deposited in the safe. The Court declared that \u201c at common law the defendants were liable for all losses of the property of their guests <em>infra hospitium,\u201d </em>excepting, of course, those occasioned by the act of God or the public enemy, or the neglect-or fraud of the guest; but that the Legislature had modified this strict liability at common law, by enacting that if tl-iA nrnnriAtrh- nf <em>a. </em>hnt.Al should furnish a safe at the other valuables of his guests, and should notify them thereof by posting notices in the rooms occupied by his guests, he should not be liable for any loss of money or valuables, etc., if the guests should neglect to deposit the same in such safe. keeping of the money and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The Court affirmed the judgment for the defendants on two grounds. 1st, that the actual notice was sufficient under the statute without proof of the constructive notices, by posting the notice in the room of the guest; and 2d, that the guest having received the notice in fact, and failing to comply with it, was guilty of negligence, and must bear the loss. A majority of the Court concurred on the first ground, and the whole Court concurred on the second ground. One purpose of the Act, it was held, was to enable the host to relieve himself of his common law liability\u2014that is, of liability for the loss of the money or the valuables of the guest who neglected compliance with the notice. That was the main object of the Act, although it was at the same time intended to provide for the security of the guest. That was precisely the purpose of the notice in this case, which was given to the guests by posting the rules of the house in the rooms occupied by them. The statute of Hew York was, in truth, only declaratory of the law in such cases, except only in respect to constructive notice, which is made equivalent to actual notice. In passing upon the second ground, it was held that, when the notice in fact was given, independently of the statute, the innkeeper would not be responsible for the loss when the guest neglected to comply with the requirements of the notice. It necessarily follows that he would have been responsible for the loss had the guest made the deposit in compliance with the notice. The statute, then, conferred upon him no right or privilege but that of imparting notice by posting the same in the manner therein prescribed, and neither added to nor diminished the responsibility that he would have incurred had he received the money on deposit, in pursuance of a notice in fact, and in the course of the usual and customary business of the hotel. Ho thing is said in that case as to their being an excess of money beyond what was needed for travelling expenses and personal use, but if there is anything in the point it was obvious, from the amount of money involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The authorities cited by the defendant throw some light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>on the question. Thus in <em>Orange County Bank </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>9 Wend. 85, the plaintiff sought to recover from a common carrier for the loss of eleven thousand dollars, which the plaintiff\u2019s agent was conveying in his trunk. He stated to the officers of the boat that the trunk was valuable, but not that it containd money. He placed the trunk in the office, as he was directed by the clerk, and it was stolen from that place. Mr. Justice Helson, in delivering the opinion of the Court, said: <em>\u201c </em>How upon the ground that the defendants in this case have received no compensation or reward from the plaintiffs or any other person for the transportation or risk of the money, and that they were deprived of such reward by the unfair dealing of the agent of the plaintiffs with the defendants, I am of opinion that the plaintiffs cannot recover, and that they were properly nonsuited on the trial.\u201d <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Cattle, </em>19 Com. L. R., 333, cited in that case, was decided on the same ground\u2014that the defendant was entitled to compensation for the transportation and risk of the money, but it was carried among the baggage of the passengers without informing the defendants. The same principle was applied in <em>Pardee </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>25 Wend. 459, when the attempt was made to have merchandise transported as baggage, without disclosing its presence. See also <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>6 Hill, 588, where the same doctrine is announced. It was held\u2014 Mr. Justice Bronson delivering the opinion\u2014that the contract to convey the baggage of the passenger was implied from the usual course of business, and that the price paid for fare is considered as a compensation for carrying the baggage;- but that baggage did not include money or merchandise. In respect to innkeepers, none of the eases in which the grounds of the liability is considered, hold that he is entitled to any separate compensation for the care of the guest\u2019s property, and as he is not entitled to separate compensation on account of the property, we cannot see how he can complain that the guest has in his trunk or has deposited in the safe more money than was reasonable for his travelling expenses. His implied contract covers it all, whatever it may be. <em>Berk</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>shire Woolen Co. </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>7 Cushing, 423, is decisive, as authority, of this question. The sum of five hundred dollars was stolen from the trunk of the plaintiff\u2019s agent, which was in a room occupied by him in the defendant\u2019s hotel. This question was fully considered by the Court, and it was held that \u201c the responsibility of innkeepers for the safety of the goods and chattels and money of their guests is founded on the great principle of public utility, and is not restricted to any pai\u2019ticular or limited amount of goods or money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Here there is no ground for saying that the guest manifested a lack of care, for he placed his money where the innkeeper assured him it would be safe. He, as innkeeper, notified his guest to deposit his money in the safe and he received it as an innkeeper in the usual course of his business, and he must respond as an innkeeper for its loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Wilkins </em>v. Earle, 4 Am. Law Reg., New Series, 742, is cited by the defendant, as very cogent authority in support of his position. The decision may be sustained, perhaps, upon the ground upon which it was placed, but some of the views advanced we think are unsound and are not supported by the authorities cited. The plaintiff, in compliance with a general notice from the innkeeper, delivered to the clerk, to be deposited in the safe, a sealed package marked only with his name, and in reply to an inquiry as to what it contained, replied merely \u201c Money.\u201d The notice required the property deposited to be \u201c properly labelled,\u201d and the clerk informed the plaintiff\" that they made their guests describe their property before redelivery. The Court considered that the case resolved itself into the question, \u201cWhether the plaintiff by depositing in the safe of the defendants the package, which he delivered to the clerk, under the circumstances under which he so deposited it, and with no more notice of its value than was given in his conversation with such clerk at the time of such delivery, was not guilty of such negligence or did not so violate the implied condition of the liability of defendants as to exempt them entirely therefrom ?\u201d and both branches of the inquiry were answered in the affirma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tive. The neglect on the part of the plaintiff was in failing to disclose the amount of money in the package, but we shall not consider whether that omission was in violation of the notice, or the spirit of the Act in relation to innkeepers. The Court, after citing many cases, still feeling a doubt as to the extent of the liability of innkeepers, endeavors to determine the point by the cases relating to carriers of passengers, they being considered by the Court as analogous in principle. But, as we have already remarked, the analogy fails because the carrier of passengers. is under the implied obligation to carry with the passengers, without extra compensation, only his baggage; and that, as it is held, does not include money, except what is necessary for travel-ling expenses, and some cases hold that even that cannot be properly included as baggage. The carrier has a right to demand compensation for conveying property that is not baggage, and by custom the charge depends on the value as well as the weight or bulk, and it would be a fraud upon him to attempt to saddle him with the risk, without giving him the compensation for transporting it. If the passenger chooses to carry a large amount of money he assumes the risk of its own loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The Court, evidently appreciating the hardship of the case, as other Courts have done\u2014and there is equal hardship, whether the loss falls on the host or the guest\u2014were of the opinion that the innkeeper is held liable for clothing, ornaments of the person, including a reasonable amount of jewelry, and sufficient money to pay the travelling and other reasonable daily expenses of the guest, and that beyond those things he is not liable, unless he has voluntarily and knowingly undertaken the care and custody of them. If any argument can legitimately be drawn from the cases of passenger carriers, in support of the limitation of the liability of an innkeeper, the latter must surely be held liable \"for what, as against the forum, is regarded as the baggage of the passenger. The cases cited by the Court include as baggage a watch, article^ of jewelry, a gun and the tools of a trade, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>carried in a trunk, and generally everything destined for the personal use, convenience, and even instruction and amusement of a passenger. Suppose two travellers on their way to the same destination, the one having in liis possession a watch, jewelry and some other of the articles above mentiomed, and the other having the money with which he intends to purchase articles similar to those possessed by his comrade, and both are robbed at an inn. We are unable to see why the innkeeper should not be responsible to the latter as well as the former. How can it make any difference in Ms liability because the one chooses to wear his gold \u201c specimen \u201d in the form of a pin, and the other carries Ms in his purse ? Both are entitled to the same care and protection, and any attempt to discriminate between the liability of the innkeeper for these respective cases leads to inconsistencies if not to absurdities. This case was decided at about the same time as <em>Hulett </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>33 New York, 571, though neither case is referred to in the other; but we prefer to follow the higher, and, in our opinion, the better authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">VI. It is claimed that the Court erred in ordering that fifteen hundred dollars of the judgment be paid in gold coin. The verdict is general. The amount deposited by Walker, there can be no doubt, constituted a part of the gross sum of the verdict. That amount is alleged in the complaint to have been deposited in gold coin. The answer admits that he deposited a purse containing gold coin, but cannot state the amount, and denies that it exceeded one thousand dollars in value. This is an admission that the money deposited was gold coin. The Specific Contract Act provides that in an action against, any person for the recovery of money received by such person in a fiduciary capacity, or to the use of another, judgment for the plaintiff, whether the same be by default or after verdict, may be made payable in the same kind of money or currency so received by such person.\u201d The kind of money received by defendant not being in issue, and he having received the Same in a fiduciary capacity, it was proper for the Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>upon a verdict for the amount of money, to order judgment in the kind of money received by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">VII. The value of the gold dust at its highest market value, and the \"coin, do not equal the verdict by the sum of one hundred and thirty-one dollars and twenty cents. It is claimed by the plaintiff that this is accounted for by interest allowed by the jury, by way of damages. But the sum does not tally with the interest on the value of the gold dust and the coin nor on the coin or gold dust alone. The jury were not instructed that they could allow interest, and there is. nothing that indicates that they have done so. The verdict is excessive in the amount mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial, unless plaintiff within twenty days after receiving written notice that the remittitur is filed in the Court below, release one hundred and thirty-one dollars and twenty cents of the judgment, and if such release is filed then the judgment shall stand affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
