Defendant was hot a party to that suit, and his title was in no way affected by it. That portion conveyed to Ruffin A. Moore does not appear to have ever been reconveyed to plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore, shows no right to recover as to any of the land in dispute, and that part of the judgment against the defendant, and from which he appeals, is correct and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Mr. Justice Shafter did not express an opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
