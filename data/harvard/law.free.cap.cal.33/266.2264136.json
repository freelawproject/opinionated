The construction of the second section of the Homestead Act. 2d. If the construction of the District Judge is correct, then as to the constitutionality of that section of the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">By the statute of 1860, page 311, the Homestead Act was very materially amended. The first section provided for a new manner of claiming homesteads by doing away with the uncertainty of oral testimony, and requiring a declaration to be filed in the Recorder\u2019s office. The second section provided as follows : \u201c Such exemption shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s, or vendor\u2019s -lien,.lawfully obtained, but no mortgage or alienation of any kind, made for the purpose of securing a loan or indebtedness upon the homestead property shall be valid for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">Under the Act of I860,-there can be no doubt that the Legislature intended to render null and void all mortgages executed as in this ease. This object was attained only in the language above quoted, and in no other part of the Act. The Legislature of 1862 amended the second section, leaving out all that portion prohibiting the giving of a mortgage to secure a loan. In amending this section, (Statutes 1862, p. 519,) it is true that the Legislature did not express its intention as plainly as it could have been done; but, nevertheless, taken in connection with what the statute was, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>the express language upon that point, which was left out by the amendment, there does not seem to be any ground upon which to base two opinions in regard to the validity of the mortgage in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-6\">If, however, the Court should differ with us as to the construction of this section, the question then arises, is not the Act in violation of section one, Article one, of the Constitution. The first section of the Homestead Act vests the title, upon the filing of the declaration, jointly in the husband and wife. But, if they have no power to mortgage, then they cannot sell, and they must remain the owners of the property until the death of one vests the title in the other, or until the wife voluntarily abandons the property by filing the declaration of abandonment. This, certainly, cannot be considered otherwise than as a prohibition upon that free use and disposition of property which the Constitution guarantees to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-7\"><em>Blanchard &amp; Irwin, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">As the law stood under the Homestead Act of 1860, no sale, alienation, conveyance, or mortgage could be made of the homestead property, without first executing, acknowledging, and recording a declaration of abandonment, except a mortgage to <em>secure the purchase money, </em>or an alienation to pay the purchase money. The effect of this was to compel parties desirous of selling their homestead to first incur the unnecessary expense and trouble of executing and recording an abandonment before they could make- a legal sale of the property; and hence, for the purpose of obviating that difficulty, the Legislature of 1862 amended the second section of the Act of 1860, (Stats. 1862, p. 519;) which amendment, although expressed in different language, still substantially retains the prohibitions of the statute of 1860 in regard to mortgages, and confining them to the purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-9\">The language of section two of the Act of 1862 is : \u201c Such exemption shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s, or vendor\u2019s lien, lawfully obtained, nor to any mortgage or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>other lien lawfully taken or acquired <em>to secure, the purchase money for said homestead </em>.\u201d It proceeds to point out the manner in which not only such mortgage or lien, but all other alienations, sales, or conveyances of the homestead, shall be <em>executed; </em>and then, to remedy the Act of 1860, by providing that alienations, sales, conveyances, mortgages, and liens may be executed without first executing the declaration of <em>abandonment; </em>and this latter was the only particular in which the Legislature of 1862 intended to or did amend the second section of the Act of 1860, leaving in full force the prohibition upon mortgaging the homestead for any other purpose than for the purchase money, contained in the Act of 1860. And this, too, upon the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius, for the language of section one is, that \u201c the homestead * * * shall not be subject to forced sale on <em>execution </em>or any <em>final process from any Court </em>for any debt or liability contracted,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-7\">In section two it is expressed that \u201c such exemption shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s, or vendor\u2019s lien lawfully obtained, nor to any mortgage or other lien lawfully taken or acquired to <em>secure the purchase money </em>for said homestead,\u201d which upon the principle above quoted <em>excludes </em>all other mortgages, or mortgages given to secure the payment of any other kind of indebtedness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-8\">The Act is not in violation of the Constitution, but was enacted in strict compliance with the requirements of that instrument. Article two, section fifteen, of the Constitution, says : The Legislature shall protect by law <em>from forced sale </em>a certain portion of the homestead and other property of all heads of families.\u201d A foreclosure sale is a <em>forced sale </em>under the meaning of the law, as much so as any sale under execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">The object the Legislature framing the present homestead law had in view, was to secure to heads of families and their minor children the homestead property as an immunity, and which never should by the act or permission of the husband and wife, or either of them, be sold by <em>process of laxo. </em>This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>beneficent intention would be wholly defeated if the husband and wife could mortgage it for the purpose of business or speculation, by which the homestead property might become frittered away and wholly lost to the family.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-6\">By the Court, Rhodes, J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Henry Miller, and Catharine, his wife, on the 5th of April, 1865, executed to the plaintiff a mortgage of certain real estate, to secure the payment of a promissory note given by Miller to the plaintiff for a sum of money loaned by the plaintiff to Miller. In 1861 Miller made a declaration of homestead upon the premises that were subsequently mortgaged to the plaintiff. The only question is whether, under the provisions of the Homestead Act of this State, the mortgage is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The first section of the Homestead Act of 1851 provided that \u201c the homestead * * * shall not be subject to forced sale on execution, or on any other final process from a Court,\u201d etc.; and the third section, providing that \u201c such exemption shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s, or vendor\u2019s lien, or to any mortgage lawfully obtained,\u201d is not limited to mortgages for the purchase money, but comprehends all that the parties may execute for any purpose. The section proceeds to declare how such mortgages (as well as sales and other alienations) shall be executed\u2014that is to say, if the owner is a married man, and his wife is a resident of this State, she also must execute and acknowledge the mortgage, unless it be a mortgage to secure the purchase money, in which case her signature is unnecessary. Ho provision is made in this Act for a written declaration of abandonment of homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Several changes in the system were wrought by the Act of 1860. (Stats. 1860, p. 311.) Section one provides that the homestead to be selected by the husband and wife, or either of them, or other head of a family, shall not be subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>forced sale on execution or other final process ; and provides for the selection of the homestead by a declaration in writing, and then declares that the husband and wife shall hold the same as tenants in common. It is provided by section two that \u201c such exemption shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s lien, lawfully obtained, hut no mortgage or alienation of any kind, made for the purpose of securing a loan or indebtedness upon the homestead property, shall be valid for any purpose whatever, provided that a mortgage or alienation to secure the purchase money shall he valid if the signature of the wife be obtained to the same and acknowledged by her separately and apart from her husband.\u201d Following this is a provision for the abandonment of the homestead by a declaration in writing, and the further provision that the signature of the wife, who is a non-resident of the State, is not essential to the validity of a mortgage or alienation of the homestead before it has become the homestead. It thus appears that under the Act of 1860 the homestead must be acquired and abandoned by the written declarations of the parties; that no mortgage to secure a loan or indebtedness was valid except a mortgage to secure the purchase money, and the latter must be signed and acknowledged by the wife. Under the Act of 1851 a mortgage of the homestead to secure a loan was valid if executed and acknowledged by the wife, hut under the Act of 1860 it was declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The Act of 1862 (Stats. 1862, p. 519) amended the second section of the Act of 1860 in several particulars. It is provided that \u201c such exemption [from forced sale on execution or other final process] shall not extend to any mechanic\u2019s, laborer\u2019s or vendor\u2019s lien lawfully obtained, nor to any mortgage or other lien lawfully taken or acquired to secure the purchase money for said homestead.\u201d The term <em>\u201c </em>mortgage or other lien \u201d was intended to embrace every possible form or character of security for the purchase money that might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>become a charge upon the premises, except, perhaps, the vendor\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The next clause of the section is that \u201c no alienation, sale, conveyance, mortgage or other lien of or upon the homestead property shall be valid or effectual for any purpose whatever, unless the same be executed by the owner thereof, and be executed and acknowledged by the wife, if the owner be married and the wife be a resident of this State, in the same manner as provided by law in ease of the conveyance of her separate real property.\u201d The words \u201c mortgage or other lien \u201d mentioned in this clause are intended as descriptive of all other mortgages and liens than those enumerated in the first clause. If it is held to include a mortgage for the purchase money, and to declare that it must be executed by the \u2022 husband and wife, then, by the same reasoning, it is necessary for them to execute a mechanic\u2019s, a laborer\u2019s and a vendor\u2019s lien. That involves an absurdity, if not an impossibility. The phrase \u201c mortgage or other lien \u201d most clearly is not limited to those made or given for the purchase money. There is no such qualification expressly annexed to it, and such a limitation is not indicated, even remotely, by the context. The terms \u201c alienation, sale, conveyance, mortgage or other lien,\u201d are comprehensive enough to include most, if not all of the modes in which parties may by their own act convey, create a lien upon, or otherwise affect real estate; and seem to have been inserted to confirm and conserve the right of voluntarily alienating or incumbering of the homestead, but requiring the sale, lien, etc., to be made in writing, and in order to protect the wife of the owner, if the owner be a married man and his wife a resident of this State, to be signed and acknowledged by her. It will not be presumed that the Legislature intended to take away the right of the husband and wife to deal with the homestead in any of the accredited modes by which real estate is conveyed or may be affected; and nothing short of the clearest and most unmistakable terms will justify us in holding that so unnecessary and unusual a restraint upon alienation was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The Act of I860- went much further in this respect than that of 1851 or that of 1862, it being provided in section two, as already mentioned, that no mortgage or alienation of any kind, except for the purchase money, should be valid. That provision was under trial for two years, and was found to work badly. Parties continued, as they had formerly done, to borrow money and give mortgages on the homestead as security, and to sell portions of the homestead premises; and, to accomplish either of these purposes, the husband and wife were burdened with the useless expense of filing a declaration of abandonment, and then, immediately after the execution of the mortgage or conveyance, of filing a new declaration of homestead. The Legislature of 1862, in order to save parties this inconvenience and useless expense, repealed the prohibitory clause just mentioned, and in its place enacted the second clause of the second section of the Act of 1862, which we have cited at length. And to make assurance doubly sure, a third clause was added, declaring that <em>\u201c </em>for the purpose of making or creating such alienation, sale, conveyance, mortgage or lien as aforesaid, it shall not be necessary that the declaration of abandonment of the homestead be executed, as herein provided for, nor that the homestead be actually abandoned.\u201d Whether the term \u201c mortgage or other lien \u201d in the second clause includes the \u201c mortgage or other lien \u201d mentioned in the first clause, or not, the declaration of abandonment could not by any possibility be deemed necessary by any one in order to give effect to a mortgage for the purchase money, executed cotemporaneously with conveyance of the premises to the mortgagor, for the mortgage must .of necessity have priority over the homestead claim, for that could not be made until after the purchase was effected; and, if executed subsequently to the declaration of homestead, it would be held by any Court in which it might be foreclosed, upon the plainest principles of equity, to have priority over the homestead claim, unless the Court was prepared to hold that the Act was a legislative device to enable purchasers to swindle vendors. The provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sion must be considered as having relation to other mortgages than those given for the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Whether the phrase \u201c mortgage or other lien\u201d in the second clause includes the mortgage or other lien mentioned in the first clause, or not, it is clear that it comprises all mortgages other than those executed to secure the purchase money. The husband and wife, therefore, are not restrained by the Act from mortgaging the homestead to secure the payment of a loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">It is urged, however, that the first clause of section two enumerates certain liens which may be enforced against the homestead by forced sale on execution or other final process; that, therefore, the enumeration is exclusive, and consequently non-enumerated liens are void. The point is more plausible than real. The error arises from a misinterpretation of the phrase \u201c forced sale on execution or other final process.\u201d The effect of the qualifying word \u201c forced\u201d seems to be overlooked. The Constitution (Article XI, Section 15) provides that: \u201c The Legislature shall protect bylaw, from forced sale, a certain portion of the homestead and other property of all heads of families.\u201d The several Homestead Acts were enacted to give effect to this provision. A \u201c forced sale\u201d is not synonymous with a \u201csale on execution,\u201d etc. The latter may be and often is voluntary in every respect. When the owner consents to a sale under the execution or other legal process, the sale is not forced, but it is as voluntary, within the full import of the term, as it is when he directly effects the sale and executes the conveyance. Its quality, as being voluntary or forced, depends not upon the mode of its execution, but upon the presence or absence of the consent of the owner. If those terms were synonymous or were so understood by the Legislature, the provision would have been that the homestead shall not be subject to sale under execution or other legal process. As the clause now stands, and with the interpretation contended for, no meaning or effect can be given to the word \u201c forced.\u201d The meaning of a sale on execution or other final process is plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>and needs no interpretation, and the word \u201cforced,\u201d unless it is to be rejected as insensible, must qualify the phrase with which it is connected. If it is rejected from the statute, it must have the same fate in the clause of the Constitution directing the enactment of the statute. But we think there can be no question that enforced sale means a sale against the will of the own\u00e9r. It is apparent, upon reading the whole Act in connection with the constitutional provision, that it was not the intent either of the framers of the Constitution or of the Legislature to prevent the owner or owners of the homestead property from voluntarily alienating, changing or otherwise affecting it. The homestead was not forced upon him, but he was at liberty to avail himself of its protection or not, at his election, and if accepted to waive it at his election\u2014the consent of his wife, if he was a married man, being required in order to secure to her, also, the protection of the homestead exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We remarked that where the owner of the homestead consents to a sale under execution or other legal process, it is not a forced sale. It makes no difference in respect to its being forced or voluntary, whether he consents directly to the sale or does the same indirectly by consenting to or doing those acts or things that necessarily or usually eventuate in a sale. A foreclosure sale, whether under the power of sale contained in the mortgage or in pursuance of a decree, is not a forced sale within the meaning of the Constitution or the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">There are other views which we think decisive of this question. The statute of 1860 declared a mortgage of the homestead to secure a loan void. The clause containing this \u2019prohibition was repealed by the Act of 1862. This is tantamount to a declaration that such mortgage thereafter executed in conformity to law should be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The statute of 1862, as we have already said, affirmed the power of the owner to mortgage the homestead for other purposes than to secure the purchase money. It would be doing violence to the plainest rules of statutory construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to hold that the Legislature, while conserving to the owner the power to execute the mortgage, intended to deprive the mortgagee of the right of foreclosure and sale. It would be a misnomer to call such an instrument a mortgage, and a strange perversion of terms to say that it was <em>valid. </em>Concede to the owner of the homestead the power to give the morfc gage, and the remedy for its enforcement by foreclosure and sale necessarily follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In conclusion, we do not think the Act, which might well have been improved by the omission of certain words and phrases\u2014inserted apparently through excess of caution\u2014is rendered so obscure as to leave in doubt the intent of the Legislature. The unnecessary mention of cases in which the property may be subjected to a forced sale\u2014a vendor\u2019s lien, which necessarily attaches before the homestead claim is passable, and a mortgage or other lien to secure the purchase money, which is valid, in spite of the homestead\u2014does not make a sale under legal process a forced sale, without regard to the presence or absence of consent of the homestead claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The point that the complaint is defective because it is not alleged that the claim was presented to the administrator for allowance, must be disposed of on the authority of <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Woodwoorth, </em>28 Cal. 567.
