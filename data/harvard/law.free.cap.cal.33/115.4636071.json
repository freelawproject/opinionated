(Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851.) Defendant was acquitted of the charge of receiving stolen property. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 496.) The prosecutor also charged two prior felony convictions for the purpose of sentence enhancement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)), and to preclude probation (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203, subd. (e)(4)). These were admitted by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">The primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in ruling that if the defendant testified, he could be impeached by the prosecutor asking whether defendant had ever been convicted of a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d This is but the latest twist involving the propriety of admitting prior felony convictions for the purpose of impeachment. We conclude that where similar offenses are involved, the technique of \u201csanitizing\u201d the prior felony is ineffective to dispel the prejudice in admitting evidence of the prior conviction. Therefore, the procedure is unacceptable, and the trial court erred in permitting it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>On May 29, 1980, about 8:30 p.m., Deputy Sheriff Bennallack received a report that a man was lying in the front seat of a vehicle parked in the northwest corner of the otherwise empty Rubidoux courthouse parking lot. Bennallack went to the location and discovered defendant in a 1969 Datsun. Bennallack attempted to awaken defendant by calling to him and shaking the vehicle. After several unsuccessful attempts, he was able to unlock the vehicle and shake defendant awake.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Bennallack asked defendant his name and what he was doing in the area. Defendant stated that he was waiting for a friend, got tired, pulled the vehicle over and went to sleep. He told the officer that the car belonged to a friend, but he could not provide the friend\u2019s name. Defendant identified himself as \u201cSteven Johnson,\u201d but he did not produce any identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Bennallack returned to his patrol car to check the ownership of the Datsun. Unsure of the correct spelling of \u201cJohnson,\u201d the officer returned to the Datsun and asked defendant for the correct spelling of his last name. Defendant replied \u201cB-A-R-R-I-C-K. \u201d Bennallack smelled alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath and asked if he had been drinking. Defendant replied that he had consumed some beers and marijuana at a party earlier in the evening. Defendant thought that the marijuana had been \u201csprayed with something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Bennallack returned to his vehicle and learned that the Datsun was stolen. The owner had reported the theft in the morning that same day. Defendant was arrested, advised of his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights, and placed in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">A defense witness testified that defendant had been at a party earlier in the evening, where he had consumed beer and marijuana mixed with PCP. The witness testified that he observed defendant getting very intoxicated, and that defendant left the party about 5:30 or 6 p.m., stumbling down the street. Defendant\u2019s brother testified that their mother\u2019s house, where defendant stayed occasionally, was within eyesight of the parking lot where defendant was found. Testimony from prosecution witnesses revealed that a different ignition switch and toggle switch had been installed in the vehicle and the locked gas cap was bent. Defendant\u2019s wallet was found beneath the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Before trial, defense counsel made a motion to prohibit the prosecutor from impeaching defendant with a prior felony conviction of automobile theft. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1].) The trial court recognized the potential prejudice in telling the jury that defendant had been previously convicted of automobile theft. In an attempt to avoid that prejudice, the court ruled that should the defendant testify, the prosecutor could ask him if he had ever been convicted of \u201ca felony involving theft.\u201d At that point, defense counsel indicated that he would advise his client not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">We granted a hearing to consider the propriety of impeaching a defendant by a \u201csanitized\u201d reference to a prior conviction as a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We begin by examining the statutory authorization for allowing impeachment by prior felony convictions, and the statutory and judicial limitations on that authority. Evidence Code section 788 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[f]or the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, it <em>may </em>be shown by the examination of the witness or by the record of the judgment that he has been convicted of a felony . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) This authorization of judicial discretion is tempered, however, by Evidence Code section 352, which permits the trial judge to exclude otherwise admissible evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of undue prejudice . . . .\u201d We first examined the relationship between these sections in <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 441, where we held that read together, sections 788 and 352 \u201cclearly provide discretion to the trial judge to exclude evidence of prior felony convictions when their probative value on credibility is outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 453.) This court adopted the discussion by Judge (now Chief Justice) Burger in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1967) 383 F.2d 936, identifying some of the more important factors for the trial court to consider in exercising its discretion whether to allow evidence of the prior felony conviction for the purpose of impeachment: \u201c \u2018In common human experience acts of deceit, fraud, cheating, or stealing, for example, are universally regarded as conduct which reflects adversely on a man\u2019s honesty and integrity. Acts of violence . . . generally have little or no direct bearing on honesty and veracity. A \u201crule of thumb\u201d thus should be that convictions which rest on dishonest conduct relate to credibility whereas those of violent or assaultive crimes generally do not. . . . The nearness or remoteness of the prior conviction is also a factor of no small importance. Even one involving fraud or stealing, for example, if it occurred long before and has been followed by a legally blameless life, should generally be excluded on the ground of remoteness. [Par.] A special and even more difficult problem arises when the prior conviction is for the same or substantially similar conduct for which the accused is on trial. Where multiple convictions of various kinds can be shown, strong reasons arise for excluding those which are for the same crime because of the inevitable pressure on lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>jurors to believe \u201cif he did it before he probably did so this time.\u201d As a general guide, those convictions which are for the same crime should be admitted sparingly. . . . [Par.] .... One important consideration is what the effect will be if the defendant does not testify out of fear of being prejudiced because of impeachment by prior convictions. Even though a judge might find that the prior convictions are relevant to credibility and the risk of prejudice to the defendant does not warrant their exclusion, he may nevertheless conclude that it is more important that the jury have the benefit of the defendant\u2019s version of the case than to have the defendant remain silent out of fear of impeachment. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 453, fns. and citations omitted.) <em>Beagle </em>was premised on the thesis that the Legislature did not intend to \u201c \u2018exempt section 788 from the general evidentiary provisions [of Division 3 of the Evidence Code] applicable to all rules of admissibility.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d atp. 453.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodard </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 329, 336, fn. 4 [152 Cal.Rptr. 536, 590 P.2d 391].) These general evidentiary provisions declare that only \u201crelevant evidence\u201d is admissible in a court proceeding. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300, 350.)  Before admitting evidence of the prior felony conviction, courts have the duty to determine whether the proffered evidence has \u201cany tendency in reason to prove or disprove\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 210) the defendant\u2019s credibility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodard, supra, </em>at p. 336, fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Evidence Code section 786 provides that the sole trait relevant to the witness\u2019 credibility is truthfulness: \u201cEvidence of traits of his character other than honesty or veracity, or their opposites, is inadmissible to attack or support the credibility of a witness.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 786.) Thus, if a prior felony conviction does not reflect on the trait of truthfulness, it must be excluded as irrelevant under Evidence Code section 350, which provides that \u201c[n]o evidence is admissible except relevant evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodard, supra, </em>at p. 335.) However, not all felony convictions reflecting on the truthfulness of the defendant are equally probative of that issue. \u201c[Different felonies have different degrees of probative value on the issue of credibility. Some, such as perjury, are intimately connected with that issue; others, such as robbery and burglary, are somewhat less relevant; ...\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 109, 118 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771].) Thus, even when a prior conviction is conceded to adversely reflect on the defendant\u2019s honesty, the court, when ruling on the <em>Beagle </em>motion, must make an initial determination as to the \u201cdegree of probative value\u201d that the prior conviction has on the question of the defendant\u2019s honesty or veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The initial determination regarding the probative value of the prior felony conviction is made by examining the elements of the offense itself.  Unless the conviction contains an element reflecting on defendant\u2019s honesty, it may not be admitted. \u201cOnly a conviction which has as a necessary element an intent to deceive, defraud, lie, steal, etc., impacts on the credibility of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>witness.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spearman </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 107, 115 [157 Cal.Rptr. 883, 599 P.2d 74].) It is not sufficient that the prior offense shows a \u201cdisrespect for law\u201d or a \u201ccharacter trait of willingness to do anything.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, 20 </em>Cal.3d at p. 117, italics omitted.) Some theft offenses, such as robbery, contain elements that are both larcenous and assaultive, and thus bear only in part on the individual\u2019s veracity. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211, 220 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833].) Hence, such offenses are entitled to somewhat less weight in the balancing process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 222, 229 [155 Cal.Rptr. 194, 594 P.2d 19].) However, the mere removal of the noncredibility aspects of certain theft offenses does not increase the probative value of the credibility-bearing elements of the offense. \u201cEven those elements of a robbery conviction which do reflect on a witness\u2019 credibility are less probative of that issue than the elements of other convictions, such as perjury. Thus, while a robbery or other theft conviction may be relevant to credibility, it is entitled to less weight in the <em>Beagle </em>balancing process than such other offenses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>at pp. 229-230, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Thus, we see that it is the obligation of the trial judge to make an initial determination whether the prior felony conviction is sufficiently probative of the question of credibility for the jury to consider it in assessing the truthfulness of tire defendant. This is but the threshold question in the balancing test required by <em>Beagle </em>and its progeny. Of course, once this determination is made, and assuming that the remaining conditions to admissibility are satisfied, it is for the jury to make the final determination to what extent the prior conviction affects credibility in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 109, defendant, who was charged with receiving stolen property, had previously been convicted of soliciting another to commit murder. The trial court permitted impeachment of the defendant by allowing the prosecutor to ask defendant if he had ever been convicted of a felony, without revealing the nature of the prior conviction. We found this attempt to lessen the prejudicial effect of the prior conviction ineffective because, although it removed the direct prejudice caused by identifying the prior crime, it created other risks of harm equally severe. First, the technique of not identifying the prior crime \u201cfrustrates a prime function of the jury.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 118.) That function is to make a final determination as to the credibility of the witness. One of the factors that the jury considers in assessing that credibility is the persuasiveness of the prior conviction. Although the trial judge must make an initial determination as to the probative value of the prior conviction, the jury cannot weigh the probative value of the particular prior conviction if it is deprived of knowledge of the identity of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Another problem caused by not revealing the prior conviction is that stating only that the defendant has been convicted of \u201ca felony\u201d will arouse the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>curiosity about the identity of the prior offense: \u201cNormal human curiosity will inevitably lead to brisk speculation on the nature of that conviction, and the range of such speculation will be limited solely by the imaginations of the individual jurors.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, </em>at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The second factor for the trial court to consider is the nearness or remoteness in time of the prior felony conviction. Courts have approved admission of felonies four years old <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lassell </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 720 [166 Cal.Rptr. 678]), five years old <em>(People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1978) 88 Cal.App.3d 150 [151 Cal.Rptr. 354]), and six years old <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boothe </em>(1977) 65 Cal.App.3d 685 [135 Cal.Rptr. 570], disapproved on another point in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brigham </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 283, 292 [157 Cal.Rptr. 905, 599 P.2d 100]), as not being so remote as to require exclusion. In this case, the prior conviction occurred two years prior to the trial. Thus, this factor would point toward admissibility of the prior felony conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The third factor to be assessed in applying the balancing formula, crucial to the determination in this case, is the \u201c \u2018special and even more difficult problem [that] arises when the prior conviction is for the same or substantially similar conduct for which the accused is on trial. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 453.) This problem arises when the witness whose testimony is sought to be impeached is also the defendant. In such a case, the trial court must exercise extreme caution in assessing the potential prejudice because \u201c[s]uch circumstances present a unique risk of undue prejudice and confusion of issues. Despite limiting instructions, the jury is likely to consider this evidence for the improper purpose of determining whether the accused is the type of person who could engage in criminal activity. This is particularly likely where the prior conviction is for the same crime as that which forms the basis of the charges against defendant. [Citing <em>Beagle, supra, </em>at p. 453.] The probability of such misuse also increases where the prosecution\u2019s case is weak. (Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (1972) Special Problems Related to Relevancy, \u00a7 22.2, p. 297.) In these circumstances, only the most disciplined minds would be able to restrict their use of the prior felony evidence to assessing the defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness and disregard its obvious implications with respect to his tendencies in the area of unlawful conduct.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79, 97 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Moreover, \u201c[t]here is also the \u2018obvious danger\u2019 that the jury will decide that based on his prior convictions, the accused \u2018ought to be put away without too much concern with present guilt.\u2019 (McCormick, [Evidence (2d ed. 1972)] \u00a7 43, p. 89.) Further, the admission of prior convictions often confuses the issues at trial and \u2018draw[s] [the jurors\u2019] minds away from the real issue\u2019 of guilt or innocence. (Bo<em>yd </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1892) 142 U.S. 450, 458 [35 L.Ed. 1077, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>1080, 12 S.Ct. 292]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 97.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">A strict limitation on the admission of similar prior convictions is thus necessary because \u201c[w]hile the risk of undue prejudice is substantial when any prior conviction is used to impeach the credibility of a defendant-witness, it is far greater when the prior conviction is similar or identical to the crime charged. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 230.) \u201cA jury which is made aware of a similar prior conviction will inevitably feel pressure to conclude that if an accused committed the prior crime he likely committed the crime charged.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rist, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">In <em>Rist </em>we found the admission of a similar prior conviction to be an abuse of discretion when there were dissimilar prior convictions available for the purpose of impeachment. This court did not, however, imply that a similar or identical conviction should be admitted merely because no dissimilar prior conviction is available to impeach credibility. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 222, defendant was charged with robbery. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his prior robbery conviction. We reversed the conviction, holding that the trial court erred in permitting the defendant to be impeached by use of a prior identical felony conviction. Thus, the rule emerges that identical prior offenses may not be used; similar prior convictions should only be used sparingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Betts </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 225 [167 Cal.Rptr. 768], the trial court attempted to \u201csanitize\u201d the prior conviction by allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant if he had ever been convicted of a felony involving the trait of honesty. In concluding that the trial court erred in allowing the question, the Court of Appeal relied on <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 109, noting that although some speculation is removed, \u201cit is yet the case the trier of fact could well imagine \u2018that the [appellant\u2019s] prior conviction[s] [were] similar to or identical with the charge for which he [was] on trial\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Betts, supra, </em>at p. 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The Attorney General relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Moultrie </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 77 [160 Cal.Rptr. 51], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Madaris </em>(1981) 122 Cal.App.3d 234 [175 Cal.Rptr. 869], as support for the procedure used by the trial court to \u201csanitize\u201d the prior conviction in this case. In <em>Moultrie, </em>defendant was charged with robbery. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s <em>Beagle </em>motion to disallow evidence of his prior attempted robbery conviction, but the trial court only allowed the prosecutor to ask the defendant, if he testified: \u201cHave you ever been convicted of a felony involving theft?\u201d The Court of Appeal sustained this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>procedure as an acceptable method of introducing the prior conviction without prejudicing defendant, and as striking a fair and reasonable balance between the effect of a defendant not testifying out of fear of being prejudiced because of impeachment by a prior conviction and clothing him with \u201ca false aura of veracity.\u201d (99 Cal.App.3d at p. 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In our view, the method used in this case, and approved in <em>Moultrie </em>and <em>Madaris, </em>does not avoid the prejudice warned against in <em>Rollo </em>and <em>Fries, </em>and despite the facile evenhandedness, \u201cthe scales remain sharply weighted against the defendant. \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The effort to \u201csanitize\u201d the prior auto theft conviction as a \u201cfelony involving theft\u201d was an attempt to tread between the pitfalls of identifying the prior conviction as an offense similar or identical to the charged offense (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d 222), and not identifying the felony at all. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 109.) We conclude that the technique, while having a superficial appeal as an acceptable accommodation of the competing interests of the prosecution and the defense, does not avoid creating a \u201csubstantial danger of undue prejudice. \u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.) Although the partial identification in this case would forestall the possibility that the jury would assume that the undisclosed prior offense was heinous (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d at p. 119), the technique only increased the possibility that the jury would assume that the undisclosed prior offense was indeed identical to the crime charged. Why else, when defendant is charged with a theft-type offense, reveal that he had previously been convicted of a felony involving theft? The flaw in the procedure is that it not only does not remove the speculation warned against in <em>Rollo, supra, </em>but it in fact tends to focus the speculation toward the conclusion that the prior crime was identical, which inevitably leads to the improper presumption that \u201cif he did it once, he will do it again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Indeed, the procedure whereby the jury is suggestively led to speculate that the prior offense was similar to the one charged may be as detrimental to the fact-finding process as explicitly identifying the prior crime as identical to the current charged offense. For these reasons, we disapprove <em>People </em>v. <em>Moultrie, supra, </em>99 Cal.App.3d 77, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Madaris, supra, </em>122 Cal.App.3d 234, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Even were we to conclude that the technique used by the trial court is a generally acceptable method of revealing the credibility-bearing aspect of the prior conviction without creating the substantial danger of undue prejudice, we cannot sanction the approach in this case. Although \u201csanitized,\u201d the prior conviction closely resembled the offense for which the defendant was on trial. There is no doubt that defendant\u2019s conviction of auto theft is similar to the charged offense of violating Vehicle Code section 10851 (theft and unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>driving or taking of a vehicle).  Indeed, \u201cVehicle Code section 10851 is a lesser included offense of Penal Code section 487, subdivision 3, grand theft, auto. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buss </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 781, 784 [162 Cal.Rptr. 515].) In <em>Buss, </em>the Court of Appeal reversed a conviction of violating Vehicle Code section 10851 after the trial court denied defendant\u2019s <em>Beagle </em>motion to exclude a prior out-of-state felony conviction of auto theft. For purposes of balancing the probative value against creating a substantial risk of undue prejudice, we find no distinction in the fact that the prosecutor in this case would have excluded the word \u201cauto\u201d in referring to the prior \u201ctheft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The instruction given in this case describing the elements of a violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 differ from the instructions given in a case charging violation of Penal Code section 487, subdivision 3, only in that the latter offense requires a specific intent to <em>permanently </em>deprive the owner of his or her property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From the jury\u2019s point of view, the offense charged in this case is nearly identical to, if not the equivalent of, the charge of auto theft. The jury would, in all likelihood, consider the charged offense to be a \u201ctheft.\u201d Thus, there can be no lessening of the prejudicial effect in describing a prior conviction as a \u201cfelony involving theft\u201d when defendant is charged with the similar offense of \u201ctheft and unlawful driving or taking of a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Finally, <em>Beagle </em>teaches that the trial court must also consider in the balancing equation the effect if the defendant does not testify out of fear of being prejudiced because of impeachment by prior convictions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 453.) We have previously noted that even if the first three factors suggest admissibility of the prior conviction, the trial judge may nevertheless decide that it is \u201c more important that the jury have the benefit of defendant\u2019s version of the case than to have the defendant remain silent out of fear of impeachment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Several reasons compel this heightened significance of the fourth factor. Like the third factor, this one becomes particularly important when the witness whose testimony is sought to be impeached is also the defendant. In such a case, the loss of the defendant\u2019s testimony will undoubtedly have a greater impact on the fact-finding process than would the failure to testify of a nondefendant witness. The threat of impeachment by a prior felony conviction has significant coercive force when the witness\u2019 liberty is at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In addition, the defendant\u2019s constrained silence has a detrimental impact on our criminal justice system. When \u201cthe accused elects not to testify in order to keep the evidence of prior convictions from the jury, the jury is deprived of competent, probative evidence\u2014the testimony of the accused. For example, an accused\u2019s testimony might be necessary to give a complete picture of the events, since he may be the sole witness or the defense witness with the most complete knowledge of the events underlying the charges. If a specific intent crime is involved, or if defenses of diminished capacity, unconsciousness or insanity are proffered, an accused\u2019s testimony may well be the most direct evidence of his mental state. Further, his testimony may add weight and credibility to testimony of other witnesses that may otherwise appear to the jury to be unconvincing or suspect.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Third, despite limiting instructions, the defendant\u2019s silence caused by the threat of impeachment by prior convictions may itself tend to prejudice the defendant. \u201cAn accused\u2019s failure to testify may itself be misperceived by the jury, since \u2018his silence alone will prompt the jury to believe him guilty.\u2019 (McCormick [Evidence (2d ed. 1972)], <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 43, p. 89.) The jury \u2018will expect the defendant to present all the evidence he can to escape conviction, and it will naturally infer that his failure to explain or deny evidence against him when the facts are peculiarly within his knowledge arises from his inability to do so. \u201cSuch an inference is natural and irresistible. It will be drawn by honest jurymen, and no instruction will prevent it.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Modesto </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 436, 452 [42 Cal.Rptr. 417, 398 P.2d 753].) [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 228-229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Finally, if the trial court errs in admitting the prior felony conviction and the defendant does not testify, it is extremely difficult for an appellate court to measure the impact that defendant\u2019s testimony might have had. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>at p. 228.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Our holding that the prejudicial effect of the \u201csanitized\u201d prior conviction outweighs its probative value does not mean that we are encouraging \u201ca form of blackmail by defendants\u201d or permitting the defendant to be clothed with \u201ca false aura of veracity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beagle, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 453.) \u201cThe exclusion of a prior conviction to impeach credibility does not prevent a prosecutor from subjecting a defendant-witness to piercing cross-examination, \u2018the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019 (5 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1974) \u00a7 1367, p. 32.) Through cross-examination, the prosecutor can raise doubts as to the general truthfulness of the witness and question the credibility of his version of the facts. Also, the defendant\u2019s memory and capacity for observation can be challenged. Prior inconsistent statements may be used to impeach credibility.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Because we agree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in allowing defendant, if he testified, to be impeached by a \u201csanitized\u201d felony conviction, we do not address the claim that permitting impeachment pursuant to Evidence Code section 788 violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to testify in his or her own defense, or otherwise violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Having concluded that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude evidence of his prior conviction as \u201csanitized,\u201d we must determine whether this error affected the judgment so as to require reversal. The evidence supporting the conviction was largely circumstantial. Defendant was found asleep in a recently stolen automobile. The record reveals that following the ruling on the <em>Beagle </em>motion, the attorney for the defendant advised him not to testify. This court has no way of knowing what defendant\u2019s testimony would have been, thus, we have no basis for concluding that such testimony would not have affected the result. \u201c \u2018[Errors at a trial that deprive a litigant of the opportunity to present his version of the case . . . are . . . ordinarily reversible, since there is no way of evaluating whether or not they affected the judgment. \u2019 (Traynor, [The Riddle of Harmless Error (1970)] at p. 68.) A conviction under such circumstances is a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 within the meaning of article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>[(1956)] 46 Cal.2d [818, 836,] 837 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gainer </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 835, 855 [139 Cal.Rptr. 861, 566 P.2d 997]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries, supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at pp. 233-234.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Spearman, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Several subsidiary issues require our discussion.  First, defendant claims that the trial court erred in ruling inadmissible his exculpatory statements made to the officer after defendant was arrested and <em>Mirandized. </em>On direct examination, Officer Bennallack testified that when he woke the defendant, he told Bennallack that he was waiting for a friend, got tired and pulled the vehicle over. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel attempted to elicit testimony Bennallack had given at the preliminary examination. That testimony was that immediately after he was arrested and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, defendant told the officer that he did not know how he got in the automobile or to the location, and that all he could remember was that he had been to a party in Riverside. The trial court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection, concluding that the line of testimony went beyond the scope of direct examination, was exculpatory, and did not aid in understanding defendant\u2019s prearrest statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Defendant asserts that the statement was connected with his prearrest statements to rebut, qualify, and explain them under Evidence Code section 356. That statute provides: \u201cWhere part of an act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse party; when a letter is read, the answer may be given; and when a detached act, declaration, conversation, or writing is given in evidence, any other act, declaration, conversation, or writing which is necessary to make it understood may also be given in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The postarrest statement would thus be admissible if it were part of the same conversation that took place before his arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reception of such evidence is not barred by the hearsay rule.  \u201c \u2018In the event a statement admitted in evidence constitutes part of a conversation . . ., the opponent is entitled to have placed in evidence all that was said ... by ... the declarant in the course of such conversation . . ., provided the other statements have some bearing upon, or connection with, the admission or declaration in evidence and are not excluded by a rule of law <em>other than the hearsay rule. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Wittenborn </em>(1960) 178 Cal.App.2d 846, 852 [3 Cal.Rptr. 459], italics added; <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 559, 565 [119 Cal.Rptr. 210, 531 P.2d 778].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Although defendant\u2019s postarrest and prearrest statements both served the same purpose\u2014they explain his presence in the automobile\u2014they were separated by a series of events. Defendant identified himself as Steven Johnson and the officer went to his patrol car to check the ownership of the Datsun. Officer Bennallack then returned to defendant to obtain the proper spelling of his last name, and smelled alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. The officer learned that defendant\u2019s name was Barrick and that he had been drinking and smoking mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>juana. Bennallack returned to his patrol car, learned that the Datsun was stolen, and then returned again to defendant and arrested him. It was only after these events and the admonishment of his rights that defendant volunteered the latter statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The act of advising defendant of his constitutional rights in particular is intended to give a defendant pause, to cause him to reflect on his situation and, recognizing that anything he says can be used against him, to remain silent or to speak with care. Whatever defendant said after the delay in arrest and after having been warned of his rights thus is not simply a continuation of the prior conversation, but a distinct and separate interrogation. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in excluding defendant\u2019s postarrest statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Defendant also claims that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the defense of unconsciousness by involuntary intoxication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As we noted earlier, the arresting offier had to rouse defendant from a sound sleep allegedly induced by defendant\u2019s consumption of beer and marijuana mixed with PCP. Defendant suggests that although he voluntarily consumed the beer and marijuana, he unknowingly consumed the PCP that had been mixed with the marijuana, causing him to become \u201cunconscious\u201d at the time and place of commission of the alleged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The court must give a requested instruction only if the defendant proffers evidence sufficient to \u201cdeserve consideration by the jury, i.e., \u2018evidence from which a jury composed of reasonable men could have concluded\u2019 \u201d that the particular facts underlying the instruction did exist. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1], quoting from <em>People </em>v. <em>Carr </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 287, 294 [104 Cal.Rptr. 705, 502 P.2d 513].)  There was no direct evidence indicating unconsciousness of the defendant at the time and place of the charged offense. Moreover, there was no evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that defendant was unconscious at the time of the charged crime. Thus, we conclude that there was no error in failing to instruct according to CALJIC No. 4.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In addition, the jury was instructed according to CALJIC No. 4.21,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the effect that \u201c[i]f the evidence shows that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the alleged offense, the jury should consider his state of intoxication in determining if defendant had . . . [the] specific intent [to deprive the owner of her title to or possession of her vehicle].\u201d By finding defendant guilty of the charged offense, the jury necessarily rejected defendant\u2019s claim that he was unconscious due to intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Finally, defendant urges that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the asserted lesser included offense of joyriding in violation of Penal Code section 499b.  Generally, two tests are used to determine whether in a particular case a crime is a necessarily and lesser included offense of another crime. The first test looks to the elements of the crime: if, as a matter of legal definition, the greater offense cannot be committed without concomitantly satisfying the elements of the lesser offense, the latter offense is a necessarily lesser included offense. Secondly, a crime is a necessarily lesser included offense if it is within the offense specifically charged in the accusatory pleading. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cannady </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 379, 390 [105 Cal.Rptr. 129, 503 P.2d 585]; <em>People </em>v. <em>St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 536 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 121, 127-130 [23 Cal.Rptr. 161, 373 P.2d 97], this court held that joyriding under Penal Code section 499b was not a necessarily lesser included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851 under the elements of the crime and the accusatory pleading filed in that case. On reexamination of the question, we conclude that <em>Thomas </em>correctly held that joyriding is not intrinsically a necessarily included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851.  We also conclude, however, that <em>Thomas </em>erred in holding that the charging allegation in that case did not render joyriding a necessarily included lesser offense within the charged violation of Vehicle Code section 10851. In our opinion the pleadings in both <em>Thomas </em>and the present case, by accusing defendant of driving <em>and </em>taking a vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission, necessarily charged both a violation of Vehicle Code section 10851 and of Penal Code section 499b.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The Legislature has enacted three statutes dealing with the taking of an automobile without the owner\u2019s consent: \u201cgrand theft-auto\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 487, subd. 3); \u201cdriving or taking a vehicle\u201d (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851); and \u201cjoyriding\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 499b). As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 121, 125-126: \u201cthe physical conduct prohibited by the three enactments is substantially the same, but. . . there purports to be a distinction as to the intent with which the act is done in each instance. It may be presumed that the Legislature intended by these sections to deal with problems which are properly distinguishable.....The distinction ... is admittedly a subtle one, and would present a rather difficult problem if it were required that a court instruct a jury as to the distinction in a given situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We are here concerned with two of these enactments, Vehicle Code section 10851 and Penal Code section 499b.  The principal difference between them is that section 10851 requires a driving or taking with the specific intent to deprive the owner permanently or temporarily of title or possession of the automobile (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 694, 699 [13 Cal.Rptr. 1].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Penal Code section 499b, the joyriding statute, does not require a specific intent to deprive the owner of title or possession of a vehicle (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Orona </em>(1946) 72 Cal.App.2d 478, 484 [164 P.2d 769]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Neal </em>(1940) 40 Cal.App.2d 115, 116-119 [104 P.2d 555]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the section does require a \u201cpurpose\u201d or \u201cintent\u201d of \u201ctemporarily using or operating the same.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bailey </em>(1946) 72 Cal.App.2d Supp. 880, 883 [165 P.2d 558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Because one could conceivably \u201ctake\u201d a vehicle in violation of section 10851 without the purpose of using or operating it in violation of section 499b, the latter is not a necessarily included offense under section 10851. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 121, 128.) As the <em>Thomas </em>court stated: \u201cIt is obvious that the owner of a vehicle could be deprived of possession in many ways which would not necessarily require that the offender use or operate the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Such instances would seem to be rare; but, for example, a vehicle could be towed with the specific intent to deprive the owner of possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>without being towed for the purpose of using or operating the vehicle. Thus, so long as the charging allegation alleges merely a taking with the intent to deprive the owner of possession, violation of section 499b is not necessarily included.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Section 10851 speaks in the alternative: a person can violate that section by driving <em>or </em>taking a vehicle. The acts constituting driving a vehicle and taking a vehicle are separate and distinct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jaramillo </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 752, 759, fn. 6 [129 Cal.Rptr. 306, 548 P.2d 706]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Donnell </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 762, 769 [125 Cal.Rptr. 310].) As we have seen, a person can take a vehicle without having the purpose of using or operating it. However, one cannot <em>drive </em>a vehicle without the purpose of using or operating it, because to drive an automobile is to operate it. (See'Webster\u2019s New Internat. Diet. (3d ed. 1961) p. 692.) Thus, a complaint which charges a defendant with \u201cdriving and taking\u201d an automobile necessarily charges that he took the automobile \u201cfor the purpose of temporarily using or operating the same\u201d and thus violated section 499b.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, although we agree that <em>Thomas </em>correctly held that Penal Code section 499b is not a necessarily included offense within Vehicle Code section 10851, we conclude that the charging allegation in this case does allege facts that necessarily include the former section within the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The question remains whether the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury on this issue.  The trial court is obligated to give instructions on lesser included offenses that the evidence tends to prove. <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at pp. 532-533.) However, there is no obligation to instruct on a lesser included offense when there is no evidence that the offense was less than that charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703, 715-716 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913].) The Attorney General argues that because the evidence in this case showed that the ignition switch in the victim\u2019s car had been substantially altered, a more serious offense than joyriding was shown. In our view, the evidence relating to the tampered ignition does not reflect on whether the defendant had the specific intent to deprive the owner of the possession of her car or a mere intent to use or operate the vehicle, but merely shows the method by which the automobile was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">We therefore hold that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on the lesser offense of violation of Penal Code section 499b. Since we have previously determined that the court committed reversible error in its ruling that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction was admissible to impeach his testimony, we need not decide whether the additional error in failing to instruct on a lesser included offense would also require reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Newman, J., and Reynoso, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Trials occurring after June 8,1982, may be affected by new article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution, passed by initiative as part of Proposition 8. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cAny prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used without limitation for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding.\u201d Our analysis in this case does not consider the impact of that section on the law regarding the use of prior felony convictions. Briefs were filed on the issue after oral argument, and the issues are undoubtedly important. However, rather than rushing to resolve speculative questions not now before us, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>orderly development of the law will be better served by leaving to future cases questions regarding the validity and impact of particular sections of Proposition 8.

Section 788 of the Evidence Code (further statutory references are to that code, unless otherwise indicated) provides that for the purpose of attacking credibility, it may be shown that the witness has been convicted of a felony. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441, 453 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1], we held that a trial court, in applying section 788, should exercise its discretion in accordance with the guidelines expressed in section 352 wherein probative value is measured against prejudice. In five successive cases, <em>People </em>v. <em>Spearman </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 107 [157 Cal.Rptr. 883, 599 P.2d 74], <em>People </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 222 [155 Cal.Rptr. 194, 594 P.2d 19], <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 109 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771], <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Antick </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 79 [123 Cal.Rptr. 475, 539 P.2d 43], \u201cthe majority has steadily and unnecessarily circumscribed the application of section 788 to the point where little remains of a clear legislative expression. \u201d <em>(Spearman, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 120 [dis. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">In the present case, the majority continues its lamentable trend, holding that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to ask defendant (who had been charged with car theft and receiving stolen property) if he had ever been convicted of a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d Because defendant had committed a prior car theft felony, the trial court used this device in a laudable attempt to avoid prejudicing defendant by disclosure to the jury of an identical prior conviction, yet precluding him from assuming that \u201cfalse aura of veracity\u201d which we condemned in <em>Beagle, 6 </em>Cal.3d at page 453. The majority has disapproved the attempted compromise. (See <em>Rollo, supra, </em>20 Cal.3d 109, wherein the majority invalidated a similar procedure.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">No useful purpose would be served by repeating my views, extensively expressed in dissent in each of the above five cases, to the effect that the majority\u2019s restrictions upon the admissibility of prior convictions were unwarranted. I do observe, however, that, by reason of the passage of Proposition 8 at the June 1982 election, and the adoption of new section 28, subdivision (f), of article I of the state Constitution, in future cases, including this defendant\u2019s retrial, \u201cAny prior felony conviction of any person in any criminal proceeding, whether adult or juvenile, shall subsequently be used <em>without limitation </em>for purposes of impeachment or enhancement of sentence in any criminal proceeding. ...\u201d (Italics added.) Assuming that this new constitutional provision is not misconstrued, persons such as defendant upon taking the witness stand will no longer be able to suppress the fact of their prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b97-5\">KLAUS, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak8\">I agree with Justice Richardson that the trial court did not err in permitting the prosecutor to ask defendant if he had ever been convicted of a \u201cfelony involving theft.\u201d I do not believe that it is necessary at this time to decide what effect Proposition 8 will have on the resolution of similar issues in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I agree with the majority that the failure to instruct on joyriding was error. Since the majority does not reach the question of prejudice, there is no need for me to express my view on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"pAd\">Respondent\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied January 27, 1983. Richardson, J., and Kaus, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
