The Court held a hearing on these motions on June 14, 2019. For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Dropbox's motion for summary judgment, and thus\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Synchronoss's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case concerns two patents related to data synchronization: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,671,757 (\"the '757 Patent\") and 7,587,446 (\"the '446 Patent\") (collectively, \"the Asserted Patents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The '757 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The '757 Patent is titled \"Data Transfer and Synchronization,\" and claims a system and method for \"efficiently, quickly and easily synchronizing devices which can couple to the Internet, or any network.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '757 Patent, 3:23-25. Synchronoss alleges that Dropbox directly infringes claims 1, 8, 9, 14, 16, 21, 24, 26, and 28 of the '757 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 316-6 (\"Alpaugh Report\") \u00b6 2(i). Independent claim 1 provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Claim 1\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. A system for synchronizing data between a first system and a second system, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a first sync engine on the first system interfacing with data on the first system to provide difference information in a difference transaction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   a data store coupled to the network and in communication with the first and second systems; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a second sync engine on the second system coupled to receive the difference information in the difference transaction from the data store via the network, and interfacing with data on the second system to update said data on the second system with said difference information;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   wherein each said sync engine comprises a data interface, a copy of a previous state of said data, and a difference transaction generator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The '757 Patent's two other independent claims, claims 16 and 24, include similar limitations as claim 1:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Claim 16\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   16. A system, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   a first device including at least a first data file and first differencing code, the first device having an input and an output coupled to a network to receive first device data change transactions from, and provide change transactions generated by the first differencing code based on said at least one data file to, said network;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   a data store coupled to the network having at least one data structure coupled to store change transactions; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a second device including at least a second data file and second differencing code, the second device having an input and an output coupled to the network to receive said first device data change transactions from, and provide second change transactions generated by the second differencing code based on said at least second data file to, said data store;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   wherein said first differencing code includes a first sync engine having a first data interface, a first copy of a previous state of said data, and a first difference transaction generator, and said second differencing code includes a second sync engine having a second data interface, a second copy of a previous state of said data, and a second difference transaction generator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Claim 24\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   24. An Internet synchronization system, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a storage server having an Internet connection;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a first device coupled to the Internet and including a first device sync engine interfacing with data on the first device, the first device in communication with at least the storage server; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a second device coupled to the Internet and including a second device sync engine interfacing with data on the second device, the second device in communication with at least the storage server;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   wherein each said device sync engine comprises a data interface, a copy of a previous state of said data, and a difference transaction generator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In short, the '757 Patent discloses a system and method for synchronizing data between two systems or devices by transmitting from one system to another certain\n   \"difference information,\" which the parties agree means \"information that comprises only the changes to one system's data which have occurred on that system, and instructions for implementing those changes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 168 at 3. This difference information is transmitted through what is called a \"data store.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '757 Patent, 3:43-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The '446 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The '446 Patent incorporates the '757 Patent in its entirety, and is titled \"Acquisition and Synchronization of Digital Media to a Personal Information Space.\" The invention \"comprises a method for acquiring and maintaining a digital music store in personal information space, comprising: maintaining a personal information space identified with a user including data capable of being used on a client device, and transferring at least a portion of the data from the personal information space to an Internet-coupled device in response to a user request.\" '446 Patent, 3:45-51. Synchronoss alleges that Dropbox directly infringes claims 1, 2, 6-15, 18 and 19 of the '446 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alpaugh Report \u00b6 2(ii).

DROPBOX'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Dropbox moves for summary judgment on three grounds: (1) Dropbox does not directly infringe the asserted patents; (2) the Dropbox system does not satisfy each limitation of the asserted '757 Patent claims; and (3) the asserted '446 Patent claims are invalid and otherwise not infringed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Direct Infringement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning first to whether there is direct infringement, which is a threshold issue, Dropbox argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on all asserted claims because Synchronoss has not identified any evidence to establish that Dropbox has directly infringed either the '757 or '446 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Direct Infringement of the '757 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As to the '757 Patent, Synchronoss's expert characterizes the infringement as relating to a three-part system: a \"first and second system,\" which operate on \"Dropbox desktop client\" machines, and a Dropbox central server.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Alpaugh Report \u00b6\u00b6 96, 100, 105, 142, 148, 154, 182, 188, and 192. These systems correspond to the three common aspects of the asserted claims: (1) a first \"system\" or \"device\" comprising specific software-specifically, a first \"sync engine,\" \"differencing code,\" or \"device sync engine,\" depending on the claim at issue; (2) a second \"system\" or \"device\" comprising similar software; and (3) a central \"data store\" or \"storage server\" through which synchronization occurs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '757 Patent, 46:58-47:8, 48:1-24, 48:51-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dropbox contends that it is entitled to summary judgment that it does not directly infringe the asserted '757 Patent claims because \"there is no genuine dispute that\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dropbox\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   does not make, use, sell, or offer to sell the accused system.\" Dropbox Mot. at 8. In particular, Dropbox argues that only its customers \"use\" the patented system for purposes of infringement, because only Dropbox customers \"put the invention into service,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , control the system as a whole and obtain benefit from it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Centillion Data Sys., LLC v. Qwest Commc'ns Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085538\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1279/#p1284\">\n    631 F.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ). Nor does Dropbox \"make,\" \"sell,\" or \"offer to sell\" the accused system, according to Dropbox, for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11. First, the required configuration of two systems or devices in communication with a data store or storage server only exists after the user downloads and installs the desktop client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. In other words, Dropbox does not make, sell, or offer to sell an infringing \"complete invention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rotec Indus., Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11221281\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/1246/\">\n    215 F.3d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1252 &amp; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ). Second, the accused system requires both software and hardware, but Dropbox undisputedly does not make, sell, or offer to sell any hardware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Synchronoss responds to Dropbox's arguments in three ways. First, although Synchronoss does not dispute that to directly infringe, Dropbox must make, sell, or offer to sell a \"complete invention,\" Synchronoss nonetheless contends that\n   Dropbox's argument \"misreads the claims and rejects the Court's claim construction.\" Dropbox Opp. at 7. In particular, Dropbox relies on the Court's construction of the term \"[first/second] system,\" which is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   a collection of elements or components organized for a common purpose, and may include hardware components of a computer system, personal information devices, hand-held computers, notebooks, or any combination of hardware which may include a processor and memory which is adapted to receive or provide information to another device; or any software containing such information residing on a single collection of hardware or on different collections of hardware\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. No. 168 at 9-10. Synchronoss focuses exclusively on the language \"or any software containing such information residing on a single collection of hardware or on different collections of hardware\" to argue that Dropbox directly infringes the '757 Patent by making, selling, and offering for sale software that infringes once it is \"in residence\" on a user's hardware.

Synchronoss does not allege that Dropbox forms a joint enterprise with its users. Nor has Synchronoss put forward any evidence that Dropbox adequately directs or controls the user's performance. For example, Synchronoss does not contend that Dropbox conditions its users' receipt of a benefit upon performing certain actions that manifest infringement. Instead, Synchronoss merely relies on Dropbox's provision of instructions for using its software to demonstrate Dropbox's control. Dropbox Opp. at 9. But those facts, at most, might support a theory of induced infringement, a theory of liability Synchronoss does not advance in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a final salvo, Synchronoss argues that summary judgment is at least unwarranted because Dropbox has admitted to using the accused software on its own hardware. Dropbox Opp. at 7. But the only factual support for this is a passing deposition statement that Dropbox employees have stored PDFs on Dropbox.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

No one argues, however, that storage alone constitutes infringement of the '757 Patent, and thus this statement alone does not warrant denying Dropbox's motion for summary judgment as to direct infringement of the '757 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because there is no genuine dispute that Dropbox does not make, use, sell, or offer to sell a complete infringing invention, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Dropbox's request for summary judgment that it does not directly infringe the '757 Patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The '446 Patent contains both system and method claims. As to the system claim (claim 11 and corresponding dependent claims), Dropbox argues that it does not directly infringe \"for the same reason it does not directly infringe the claims of the '757 Patent : they recite a system that includes both hardware and software elements configured in a certain way, and Dropbox neither sells nor configures the complete accused system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. In particular, claim 11 requires a \"processing device.\" And yet, Synchronoss only maintains that the \"processing device\" limitation is satisfied in Dropbox's accused system by a \"computer ... together with the Dropbox desktop client.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alpaugh Report \u00b6 262. As was true with the '757 Patent, however, there is no dispute that Dropbox's customers complete the system by supplying their own computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Synchronoss's only response concerning the system claims is to repeat its characterization of the Court's claim construction order and the phrase \"any software containing such information residing on a single collection of hardware or on different collections of hardware.\" Dropbox Opp. at 11 (\"As discussed above, this limitation is met once the Dropbox software is in residence on any hardware ... and where the software resides has no impact on whether Dropbox infringes.\"). As discussed above, the Court finds this argument unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As to the '446 Patent's method claims (claim 1 and corresponding dependent claims), Dropbox contends that under\n   <em>\n    Akamai\n   </em>\n   , direct infringement of a method claim only \"occurs where all steps of a claimed method are performed by or attributable to a single entity.\" Dropbox Mot. at 12;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331183\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/1020/\">\n    797 F.3d at 1022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, claim 1 includes a step of \"generating a first version of the media data,\" which Dropbox contends that Synchronoss's expert admits is performed by the Dropbox user.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   '446 Patent, 13:53-54,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Alpaugh Report \u00b6 222 (noting that this is accomplished through \"[u]ploading one or more photo or video files to Dropbox\"). As Synchronoss responds, however, Dropbox takes claim 1 out of context. Although it may be necessary for a user to upload a photo or video before Dropbox's software begins functioning, that does not necessarily mean that the generation of a first version of the media data is performed by the user. Instead, as Synchronoss's expert states, the Dropbox software does the generation once it receives the uploaded photo or video. Alpaugh Report \u00b6 222. It is thus not undisputed that Dropbox is entitled to summary judgment as to the asserted method claims of the '446 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because there is no genuine dispute that Dropbox does not make, use, sell, or offer to sell a complete infringing invention, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Dropbox's request for summary judgment that it does not directly infringe the '446 Patent's systems claims. But the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Dropbox's request for summary judgment on this ground as to direct infringement of the '446 Patent's method claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Invalidity and Non-Infringement of the '446 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Dropbox further argues that summary judgment is warranted in its favor as to all asserted claims of the '446 Patent because: (1) the claims are invalid as indefinite; and (2) Dropbox does not infringe the claims for various reasons. For reasons that follow, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Dropbox's request for summary judgment as to the '446 Patent on the grounds that the\n   relevant claims are invalid as indefinite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court thus does not reach Dropbox's alternative arguments concerning non-infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As to definiteness, Dropbox contends that one particular impossibility permeates all of the claims: the claims require \"generating a [single] digital media file\" that itself \"compris[es] a directory of digital media files.\" Dropbox Mot. at 20-23. Claim 1 demonstrates this dispute, and thus is worth repeating here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Claim 1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   1. A method of transferring media data to a network coupled apparatus, comprising:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (a) maintaining a personal information space identified with a user including media data comprising a directory of digital media files, the personal information space being coupled to a server and a network;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (b) generating a first version of the media data in the personal information space;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   (c) generating a digital media file, in response to an input from the user, comprising a second version of the media data in a same format as the first version in the personal information space, the second version including an update not included in the first version;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (d) obtaining difference information comprising differences between the first version of the media data and the second version of the media data; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (e) transferring a digital media file over the network containing the difference information from the personal information space to the network coupled apparatus in response to a sync request made from a web browser at the network-coupled apparatus by the user.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As written, (c) requires generating \"a digital media file ... comprising a second version of the media data in the same format as the first version.\" The \"first version of the media data\" referenced in (b), however, relates back to (a), which is described as \"comprising a directory of digital media files.\" Thus, according to Dropbox, the claims recite an impossibility, as a single generated digital media file cannot itself comprise a directory of digital media files.

The clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of Defendant and to close the file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Because the Court grants Dropbox's request for summary judgment that it does not directly infringe the '757 Patent, the Court need not consider Dropbox's alternative ground for summary judgment: that the Dropbox system does not satisfy each limitation of the asserted '757 Patent claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Because the Court otherwise grants Dropbox's request for summary judgment as to the '446 Patent's system claims, the Court here need only address the '446 Patent's method claims. The analysis that follows, however, applies equally to the system and method claims. Thus, even if Dropbox did not prevail on its direct infringement argument, summary judgment in Dropbox's favor as to the system claims would be warranted on these independently sufficient grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
