Ross, United States District Judge\n   Presently before the Court are several matters. The Court's rulings and conclusions are set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises from an interpleader action involving $418,145.57 in excess funds generated from a tax sale of real property located at 270 17th Street, N.W., Unit 4406 in Atlanta, Georgia (\"the Subject Property\"). As an overview, in 2011, Iphigenia McGrue purchased the Subject Property by Limited Warranty Deed. However, in 2012, the ad valorem taxes were not fully paid. As a result, two (2) Tax Fieri Facias (\"Fi. Fas.\"), or liens, were issued and recorded on the Subject Property, one (1) for the City of Atlanta and one (1) for Fulton County/Georgia. On September 1, 2015, the Fulton County Sheriff conducted a tax sale pursuant to the City of Atlanta Fi. Fa. only (\"the Tax Sale\"). At the Tax Sale, the Subject Property was purchased for $420,000. The difference between the ad valorem taxes evidenced by the City of Atlanta Fi. Fa. and the amount paid for the Subject Property was $418,145.57. This amount represents the excess funds at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On October 3, 2016, the Fulton County Sheriff filed a Petition for Interpleader to determine how the excess funds of $418,145.57 should be paid. Petition [Doc. 1-1]. Five (5) Parties responded to the Petition: Iphigenia McGrue, Wellington &amp; Associates, LLC, PHH Mortgage Company, the United States Internal Revenue Service; and the Georgia Department of Revenue. This order addresses the priority of the claims to the $418,145.57 in excess funds asserted by these Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The detailed facts are as follows. On November 18, 2011, Iphigenia McGrue acquired the Subject Property by Limited Warranty Deed recorded in Fulton County, Georgia. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 6; 78-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; 81-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; 82-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2]. The Settlement Statement for the closing reflects that McGrue purchased the Subject Property for $518,700. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 4; 81-1 at \u00b6 4; 82-1 at \u00b6 4]. To finance the purchase, McGrue executed and recorded a first priority security deed in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") as nominee for Equity Loans, LLC, in the principal amount of $324,058 (\"the Security Deed\"). [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 7; 78-1 at \u00b6 5-6; 81-1 at \u00b6 5-6; 82-1 at \u00b6 5-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2012, McGrue transferred title to the Subject Property, by quitclaim deed, to Wellington &amp; Associates, LLC (\"Wellington\") and recorded the transfer. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 9; 78-1 at \u00b6 8; 81-1 at \u00b6 8; 82-1 at \u00b6 8]. The quitclaim deed reflects a date of August 1, 2012, but it was not actually signed by McGrue until December 3, 2012. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; 81-1 at \u00b6 9; 82-1 at \u00b6 9]. Wellington is a Georgia limited liability company with its sole members being McGrue and her son, Shawn Jones. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 10; 81-1 at \u00b6 10; 82-1 at \u00b6 10]. Wellington was formed for the benefit of McGrue's son but conducts no business. [Doc. 75-1 at \u00b6 10]. Besides forms filed with the Georgia Secretary of State, Wellington has no other governing documents. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 10; 81-1 at \u00b6 10; 82-1 at \u00b6 10]. Wellington has not paid any federal or state income taxes, though it may have had some \"minimal income\" in the past. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 11; 81-1 at \u00b6 11; 82-1 at \u00b6 11]. Wellington has never borrowed money, and has no bank accounts, credit or\n   credit history, or credit approvals. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 11; 81-1 at \u00b6 11; 82-1 at \u00b6 11]. McGrue is the only source of funds for Wellington, and she pays the mortgage and expenses associated with the Subject Property. [Doc. 75-1 at \u00b6 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    i. The Tax Sale\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the year of 2012, the ad valorem taxes on the Subject Property were not fully paid. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 14; 81-1 at \u00b6 15; 82-1 at \u00b6 14]. As a result, on January 11, 2014, two (2) Tax Fi. Fas. were issued and recorded, one (1) for the City of Atlanta and one (1) for Fulton County/Georgia. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 14; 81-1 at \u00b6 15; 82-1 at \u00b6 14]. Immediately upon recording, these Fi. Fas. were transferred to Investa Services of Ga Christiana Trust as Custodian (\"Investa\"). [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 15; 81-1 at \u00b6 16; 82-1 at \u00b615].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 1, 2015, the Fulton County Sheriff conducted a Tax Sale pursuant to the City of Atlanta Fi. Fa. only. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 14; 78-1 at \u00b6 16; 81-1 at \u00b6 17; 82-1 at \u00b6 16]. The Subject Property was purchased for $420,000 by Deed Co. LLC, which obtained a tax deed for the Subject Property. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 14; 78-1 at \u00b6 16; 81-1 at \u00b6 17; 82-1 at \u00b6 16]. The tax deed was recorded on October 7, 2015. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 14; 78-1 at \u00b6 16; 81-1 at \u00b6 17; 82-1 at \u00b6 16]. The difference between the ad valorem taxes evidenced by the City of Atlanta Fi. Fa. and the amount paid by Deed Co. LLC for the tax deed was $418,145.57, representing the excess funds at issue in this case. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 16; 78-1 at \u00b6 19; 81-1 at \u00b6 20; 82-1 at \u00b6 19]. At the time of the Tax Sale, PHH Mortgage Corporation was servicing the mortgage loan underlying the Security Deed, and CoreLogic Tax Services, LLC was its tax servicer. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 17; 81-1 at \u00b6 18; 82-1 at \u00b6 17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Meanwhile, Investa retained the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. and did not send it to the Sheriff for a levy or sale. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 20; 81-1 at \u00b6 21]. Instead, on September 17, 2015, about two (2) weeks after the Tax Sale, Investa as Custodian for GSRAN-Z, LLC (\"GSRAN-Z\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   paid $504,000 to Deed Co. LLC for the redemption of the Subject Property in favor of Wellington. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 20; 81-1 at \u00b6 21]. The Quitclaim Deed of Redemption and Notice of Super Priority Lien referencing this transaction were recorded on October 14, 2015 (the \" 'Super-Priority' redemption lien\"). [Doc. 74-2 at \u00b6 28].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. PHH Mortgage Obtains \"Super-Priority\" Redemption Lien and Remaining Fi. Fa.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 5, 2016, MERS as nominee for Equity Loans, LLC assigned the Security Deed to the Subject Property to PHH Mortgage Corporation, recording the transfer. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 7; 78-1 at \u00b6 21; 81-1 at \u00b622; 82-1 at \u00b6 5]. On February 15, 2016, PHH caused the tax servicer, CoreLogic Tax Services, LLC, to tender the full $520,043.91 that would have been sufficient to satisfy both the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien and the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Tax Fi. Fa, which at that time were held by GSRAN-Z. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 24; 81-1 at \u00b6 25]. The same day, GSRAN-Z executed and assigned the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien to PHH, which was recorded. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 26; 81-1 at \u00b6 27]. Also on February 15, 2016, GSRAN-Z, executed and assigned to PHH the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 27; 81-1 at \u00b6 28]. By virtue of these three (3) transfers-the (1) assignment of the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa., the (2) assignment of the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien, and the (3) assignment of\n   the Security Deed-PHH makes claims to the $418,145.57 in excess funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. McGrue's Unpaid Taxes and Resulting Liens\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 12, 2013, amidst the above-mentioned transfers regarding the Subject Property, a delegate of the United States Secretary of Treasury recorded a Notice of Federal Tax Lien in Fulton County, Georgia against Iphigenia McGrue. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 5; 78-1 at \u00b6 13; 81-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; 82-1 at \u00b6 13]. The lien was for unpaid federal income taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. [Docs. 75-1 at \u00b6 5; 78-1 at \u00b6 13; 81-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14; 82-1 at \u00b6 13]. The 2010 tax liability bears a September 5, 2011 date of assessment; the 2011 tax liability bears a May 21, 2012 date of assessment; and the 2012 tax liability bears a June 17, 2013 date of assessment. [Doc. 75-1 at \u00b6 2-4]. McGrue currently owes the United States at least $89,818.74 in unpaid federal income taxes for the 2000, 2011, and 2012 tax years. [Doc. 75-1 at \u00b6 1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Similarly, McGrue owes the State of Georgia approximately $197,711.93 in state income taxes for tax years 2009 through 2014. [Doc. 74-2 at \u00b6 1]. During two (2) of these years, McGrue filed tax returns under two (2) different social security numbers, one ending in -1746 and the other ending in -0040. [Doc. 74-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11-12]. The tax years and dates of assessments for the two social security numbers are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-23\">Tax Date of Assessment for Social Date of Assessment for Social Year Security Number -1746 Security Number -0040 2009 August 31, 2012 &amp; October 21, N/A 2016 2010 August 31, 2012 &amp; October 21, N/A 2016 2011 October 21, 2016 October 21, 2016 2012 October 21, 2016 October 21, 2016 2013 N/A October 21, 2016</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ] As a result of McGrue's unpaid taxes, the Georgia Department of Revenue recorded three (3) state tax executions in Fulton County, Georgia against McGrue. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ] The first occurred on November 1, 2012, was under McGrue's social security number ending in -1746, and was for the 2009 and 2010 tax years. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4]. The second occurred on October 24, 2016, was under McGrue's social security number ending in -1746, and was for tax years 2009 thru 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9]. The third occurred on October 24, 2016, was under McGrue's social security number ending in -0040, and was for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 tax years. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16]. Due to McGrue's unpaid taxes, the United States IRS and the Georgia Department of Revenue (collectively \"the Government Respondents\") assert claims to the $418,145.57 in excess funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 3, 2016, the Sheriff for Fulton County, Georgia filed a Petition for Interpleader to determine how the $418,145.57 in excess funds should be distributed. Petition [Doc. 1-1]. The Petition\n   alleges that six (6) parties may have claims or liens of record upon the excess funds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) Iphigenia McGrue, by virtue of ownership of the Subject Property at the time of the Tax Sale;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) Wellington &amp; Associates, LLC, by virtue of ownership of the Subject Property at the time of the Tax Sale;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) PHH Mortgage Company by virtue of an \"Assignment of Security Deed, Assignment of Claimed Super First Priority Tax Deed Redemption Lien, and Assignment of All Right, Title and Interest in Excess Proceeds of Tax Sale;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) The United States IRS by virtue of a federal lien for unpaid federal income taxes owed by Iphigenia McGrue;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (5) The Georgia Department of Revenue by virtue of a \"State Execution Number REV 120176653; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (6) FDS Holdings Inc. d/b/a First Data Merchant Services by virtue of a Judgment Lien owed by Iphigenia McGrue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-22. Each of these Parties, except FDS Holdings, Inc., have appeared as Respondents in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On November 2, 2016, the United States, as a named party to the Petition, timely removed the action to this Court. Notice of Removal [Doc. 1]. On the same day, Wellington, McGrue, and the Georgia Department of Revenue\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed answers. [Docs. 2, 5]. Wellington and McGrue requested that the excess funds be disbursed to them [Doc. 2], while the Georgia Department of Revenue requested a judgment in the amount of $ 177,041.70, plus further interest, in the \"highest priority available under the law.\" [Doc. 5]. On November 9, 2016, PHH filed an answer requesting the entirety of the excess funds based upon its three (3) interests, or, alternatively, under a theory of an equitable lien. [Doc. 4]. Finally, on December 5, 2016, the United States filed an answer requesting judgment in the amount of $125,378.72, plus statutory interest, and that the Court accord the lien of the United States the highest priority available under the law. [Doc. 11].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The $418,145.57 in excess funds are currently deposited in the Court's registry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pending now before the Court are three (3) motions for summary judgment filed respectively by the United States [Doc. 67], PHH [Doc. 73], and the Georgia Department of Revenue [Doc. 74]. In addition, McGrue and Wellington jointly filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File Response to PHH Mortgage's Motion for Summary Judgment. [Doc. 77]. These motions have been fully briefed and are now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion for Extension of Time [Doc. 77]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court turns first to the procedural matter presented in McGrue and Wellington's\n   Motion for Extension of Time to Respond to PHH's Motion for Summary Judgment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In this motion, McGrue and Wellington request the Court for an eleven (11) day extension by which to file their response to PHH's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a review of the motion, and opposition to the same [Doc. 80], the Court finds good cause for an extension of the deadline and grants the motion. [Doc. 77]. Because the Court grants this motion, and McGrue and Wellington filed their response within their requested eleven (11) day window [Doc. 82], the Court will consider their filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court turns now to the three (3) motions for summary judgment filed respectively by the United States [Doc. 67], PHH [Doc. 73], and the Georgia Department of Revenue [Doc. 74]. Each of these three (3) Respondents request some form or priority over the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A Court may grant summary judgment only if the record shows \"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

PHH argues that because the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. is entitled to priority over the Security Deed on the Subject Property pursuant to Georgia law, PHH may take advantage of this statute which also gives such liens priority over federal tax liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court disagrees. The plain language of this statute references real property.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206323\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6) (\"[w]ith respect to real property....\"). As determined,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the $418,145.57 in excess funds in this case are personal property.\n   <em>\n    DLT List II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461298\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/131/#p135\">\n    301 Ga. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461298\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/131/#p135\">\n    800 S.E.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, PHH may not rely upon this statute which gives priority based upon real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, PHH argues the because it holds the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien, it is entitled to the excess funds. [Doc. 73-2 at 7]. However, like their first argument, this contention relies on the excess funds being characterized as real property. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13]. Because the Court concludes that the $418,145.57 in excess funds are personal property, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Third, PHH argues that it is entitled to the excess funds based on its Security Deed to the Subject Property. [Doc. 73-2 at 3-4]. Specifically, PHH contends that \"liens on the land attach to the sales proceeds upon a forced sale of the land.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15]. PHH characterizes this contention as \"longstanding [under] Georgia law,\" but fails to account for key principles applicable when property is redeemed from a tax sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In Georgia, \"if a property owner fails to pay ... property taxes, the [taxing entity] may issue a writ of fieri facias and conduct a sale of the property to satisfy the unpaid taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    DLT List I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802518\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/335/318/#p322\">\n    335 Ga.

Thus, in the event of redemption, the existing liens on the property remain, as opposed to being wiped out after the redemption period expires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that the property was redeemed in favor of Wellington. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6 20; 81-1 at \u00b6 21]. Thus, the liens that existed prior to the tax sale remain against the underlying real property. As such, PHH's interest based on its Security Deed, which was attached to the property prior to the Tax Sale, remains on the Subject Property and does not attach to the excess funds. It follows then that PHH does not have a claim in the $418,145.57 excess funds based upon its Security Deed. Consequently, all related arguments put forth by PHH concerning its interest in the excess funds as created by the Security Deed must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In sum, after assessing the arguments and evidence, the United States' claims to the excess funds based on its federal tax liens are awarded complete priority over the claims by PHH, McGrue, and Wellington. Additionally, the United States' claims to the excess funds for its 2010 and 2011 federal tax liens are awarded higher priority than the claims by Georgia Department of Revenue. However, the United States' claim based on its 2012 federal tax lien must yield to the Georgia Department of Revenue's claims for state tax executions for tax years 2009 and 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Priority of Respondent Georgia Department of Revenue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having determined that the Georgia Department of Revenue's claims regarding its state tax executions for tax years 2009 and 2010 have higher priority than that of the United States' 2012 federal tax lien, the Court now turns to a determination of the Georgia Department of Revenue's priority vis a vis PHH.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This analysis requires a determination of the priority between the Georgia Department of Revenue's state tax executions on the one hand, and PHH's three (3) interests (i.e. the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa., the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien, and the Security Deed) on the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court looks to state law to determine the priority of liens among non-federal lienors.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Frazier v.

Ga. Oct. 14, 1992) (noting that claims separate from those of the federal government \"must be determined by State law\"). As previously determined, PHH's \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien does not entitle it to the $418,145.57 in excess funds, because excess funds from a tax sale are personal property.\n   <em>\n    DLT List II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461298\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/131/#p135\">\n    301 Ga. at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12461298\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/301/131/#p135\">\n    800 S.E.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, for the above-stated reasons, PHH's Security Deed does not provide an interest in the $418,145.57 in excess\n   funds. However, the Court reaches a different result as to PHH's first interest, the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As to PHH's claim to the excess funds based upon 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa., PHH and the Georgia Department of Revenue agree that Georgia law affords that claim general priority since it arose on January 1, 2012, prior to any of the Georgia Department of Revenue's state tax executions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 48-2-56 (d) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1 PINDAR'S GEORGIA REAL ESTATE LAW AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 4:47 (7th ed. 2013) (describing that \"ad valorem real property tax becomes a lien on the land as of January 1 of each year, even though the valuation, rate, and amount remain to be fixed during the remainder of the year\"). PHH and the Georgia Department of Revenue also agree that ad valorem tax liens \"extend[ ] not only to the property giving rise to the tax obligation, but also to all other property owned by the taxpayer.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulligan v. Sec. Bank of Bibb County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823714\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/280/248/#p249\">\n    280 Ga.

However, these Respondents disagree as to the amount of priority the Court should afford the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Georgia Department of Revenue, citing O.C.G.A. \u00a7 48-2-56, argues that because the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. is in the name of both the State of Georgia and Fulton County [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 73-16], only the \"Georgia portion,\" that is, the state portion of the taxes owed, has priority over its claims, while any amounts owed to Fulton County has no such priority. [Doc. 78 at 4]. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 48-2-56, \"[l]iens for taxes shall rank among themselves as follows: (1) Taxes due the state; (2) Taxes due counties of the state....\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 48-2-56 (b). \"[B]y adopting this statute, the [Georgia] legislature intended to assign priority to tax liens based upon the status of the taxing entity, regardless of the date the lien was created.\"\n   <em>\n    Vesta Holdings I v.

Thus, pursuant to Georgia law, state tax liens take priority over those imposed by the county, thereby elevating only the state portion of PHH's 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. above the Georgia Department of Revenue's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   PHH disagrees, asserting that the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. has complete priority over Georgia Department of Revenue's later recorded state execution tax liens. [Doc. 73-2 at 6]. To support this contention, PHH relies upon\n   <em>\n    In re Tuggle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6116809\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/30/718/#p719\">\n    30 B.R. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1983). However, PHH's reliance on this case is premised upon its Security Deed creating an interest in the $418,145.57 in excess funds. Having already determined the Security Deed does not create an interest in the $418,145.57 in excess funds from this tax sale because the Subject Property has been redeemed,\n   <em>\n    Tuggle\n   </em>\n   does not apply. PHH presents no other case law to warrant a result that is different from the direct application of the statute. Thus, the Court concludes that only the state portion of the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. has priority over the claims by the Georgia Department of Revenue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In sum, the claims asserted by the Georgia Department of Revenue are subordinate to the United States' federal tax liens for 2010 and 2011. However, the Georgia Department of Revenue's claims from its state tax executions for tax years 2009 and 2010 have a higher priority than that of the United States' 2012 federal tax\n   lien. Then, as to PHH's 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa., only the state portion of the taxes owed takes priority over the Georgia Department of Revenue's claims. As to PHH's other interests, and as to McGrue and Wellington, the Georgia Department of Revenue claims are afforded complete priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Priority of Respondent PHH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court turns last to a determination of the priority of PHH. Having already determined PHH's priority vis a vis the Government Respondents, the Court now assesses its priority against McGrue and Wellington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Wellington holds a quitclaim deed to the Subject Property. [Docs. 78-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; 81-1 at \u00b6 9; 82-1 at \u00b6 9]. As previously determined, because McGrue exercises dominion and control over Wellington, Wellington holds title to the Subject Property as McGrue's nominee. Conversely, PHH holds the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa., the \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien, and the Security Deed. Because the Court has already determined that PHFPs \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien and Security Deed do not create an interest in the $418,145.57 in excess funds, the Court focuses only upon its priority regarding the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court finds that PHH's claim regarding the 2012 Fulton/Georgia Fi. Fa. has priority over any claims to the excess funds asserted by McGrue and Wellington. Ad valorem tax liens \"extend[ ] not only to the property giving rise to the tax obligation, but also to all other property owned by the taxpayer.\"\n   <em>\n    Mulligan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823714\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga-app/280/248/#p249\">\n    280 Ga.

[Doc. 82 at 7-10]. Instead they contend that PHH, as the current holder of the Security Deed, now has this obligation, and may not make a claim to the excess funds to complete it. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court cannot reach this issue. As PHH correctly points out, the legal issue in this case is the relative priorities of the Respondents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    School Bd. of Broward County v. JV Constr.

Here, it is undisputed that PHH holds the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. [Doc. 82-1 at \u00b6 27]. Thus, the Court must determine the relative priorities based on this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In sum, the claims asserted by PHH based upon its \"Super-Priority\" redemption lien and the Security Deed do not provide an interest in the $418,145.57 of excess funds. PHH's claim based upon the 2012 Fulton County/Georgia Fi. Fa. has partial priority over the claims by the Georgia Department of Revenue and complete priority over the claims to the excess funds by McGrue and Wellington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   After a review of the Parties' arguments contained within their motions for summary judgment, the Court determines that the priority of the Respondents' claims to the excess funds is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   1.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 4 at 15-16; 73-2 at 1]. Because the time for filing summary judgment motions has passed, the Court is prepared to move forward with a trial on PHH's alternative claim.

The other Respondents are permitted to file a response to that notice within the time set out by the Local Rules of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In the event that PHH does not file a notice, the Court directs the Parties to file a joint motion for disbursement in accordance with the relative priorities listed above.

Additionally, even though the Georgia Department of Revenue mentioned in their Motion for Summary Judgment that the United States \"has not claimed any proceeds from the surplus to satisfy McGrue's 2009 federal tax lien\" [Doc. 74-1 at 9], the United States made no arguments to the contrary.
