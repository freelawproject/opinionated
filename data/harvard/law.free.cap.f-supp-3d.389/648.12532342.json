LANGE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs, Joseph Sapienza and Dr. Sarah Jones Sapienza, built a house and then had to tear it down to comply with an injunction issued against them in a state court action. The Sapienzas' insurer, Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual), defended them in the state court action but refused to indemnify them for the costs of complying with the injunction. The Sapienzas sued Liberty Mutual in this Court, alleging breach of contract and bad faith. Doc. 1. Liberty Mutual moved to dismiss, arguing that the Sapienzas failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Doc. 9. For the reasons stated below, this Court grants in part and denies in part Liberty Mutual's motion to dismiss and certifies a question to the Supreme Court of South Dakota.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, the Sapienzas purchased a home in the McKennan Park Historic District in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. They decided to raze the existing house and build a new home on the property. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 7. They hired an architect to design the home and submitted a proposal to the Sioux Falls Board of Historic Preservation (the Board). Doc. 1 at \u00b6 8-9. The Board approved the proposal and the Sapienzas hired a contractor to build their home. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During construction, the Sapienzas' neighbors, Pierce and Barbara McDowell, became concerned about the size and location of the new home.\n   <em>\n    McDowell v.

In early May 2015, the McDowells' lawyer sent the Sapienzas a cease-and-desist letter maintaining that the home violated height and setback regulations.\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n    906 N.W.2d at 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sapienzas did not stop construction, so the McDowells sued them in state court in mid-May 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 1 at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The McDowells' complaint alleged that the height and proximity of the Sapienzas' home prevented the McDowells from using their fireplace, blocked the natural light the McDowells previously enjoyed, and decreased the value of their home. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 11; Doc. 1-1 at 4-5. Count 1 of the complaint sought a permanent injunction requiring the Sapienzas to modify or relocate their house. Doc. 1-1 at 5-6. Count 2, entitled \"Negligence,\" sought this same injunctive relief and, in the alternative, damages. Doc. 1-1 at 6-7. Count 3 alleged that the Sapienzas' home was a nuisance and requested an injunction and damages. Doc. 1-1 at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sapienzas retained a South Dakota attorney (defense counsel) to defend them against the McDowell suit. Doc. 14 at 2; Doc. 11-1. Defense counsel filed an answer\n   for the Sapienzas on June 12, 2015. Doc. 11-1. The Sapienzas notified their insurer Liberty Mutual of the McDowell suit on August 24, 2015. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 14 at 2; Doc. 1-5 at 3. Liberty Mutual insured the Sapienzas under a Homeowner's Policy and an Excess Policy. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-17; Docs. 1-2, 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Several sections of these Policies are relevant to the Sapienzas' claims and Liberty Mutual's motion to dismiss. In brief, the Homeowner's Policy required Liberty Mutual to defend and indemnify the Sapienzas against a suit for damages because of \"property damage.\" Section II of the Homeowner's Policy describes the coverage provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE E - Personal Liability\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If a claim is made or a suit is brought against an \"insured\" for damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence\" to which this coverage applies, we will:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   Pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the \"insured\" is legally liable. Damages include prejudgment interest awarded against the \"insured\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n   Provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our duty to settle or defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the \"occurrence\" equals our limit of liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Doc. 1-2 at 18. The Homeowner's Policy defines \"property damage\" as \"physical injury to, destruction of, or loss of use of tangible property.\" Doc. 1-2 at 8. The Homeowner's Policy in its exclusions states that \"\n   <strong>\n    Coverage E - Personal Liability,\n   </strong>\n   does not apply to: ... b. 'Property damage' to property owned by the 'insured.' \" Doc. 1-2 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Excess Liability Policy provides additional coverage to the Sapienzas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE - PERSONAL EXCESS LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   We will pay all sums in excess of the\n   <strong>\n    retained limit\n   </strong>\n   and up to our limit of liability for damages because of\n   <strong>\n    personal injury\n   </strong>\n   or\n   <strong>\n    property damage\n   </strong>\n   to which this policy applies and for which the\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   is legally liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Doc. 1-3 at 7. The Excess Liability Policy defines \"property damage\" as \"(a) injury to or destruction of tangible property; (b) injury to intangible property sustained by an organization as the result of false eviction, malicious prosecution, libel, slander or defamation.\" Doc. 1-3 at 7. The Excess Liability Policy \"does not apply to:\n   <strong>\n    property damage\n   </strong>\n   to: (1) property owned by any\n   <strong>\n    insured.\n   </strong>\n   \" Doc. 1-3 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Liberty Mutual agreed to defend the Sapienzas from the McDowell suit under a reservation of rights, and defense counsel previously retained by the Sapienzas continued defending the Sapienzas with Liberty Mutual then paying the attorney's fees. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 1-5. Nevertheless, the Sapienzas allege that Liberty Mutual \"controlled the defense by, among other things, implementing a Comprehensive Litigation Program, issuing instructions to defense counsel concerning actions to be taken (or not taken), failing to retain an independent expert architect or contractor to offer opinions regarding the home, and refusing to pay for certain activities.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 18; Doc. 1-4 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The McDowell suit went to trial in June 2016. Doc. 1-4 at 2. The state trial judge issued a decision and order in December 2016 granting the McDowells a mandatory injunction against the Sapienzas. The injunction required the Sapienzas to bring their house into compliance with federal and state regulations for buildings in historic\n   districts or rebuild it. Doc. 1-4 at 2-3, 25, 29. The state trial judge did not order the Sapienzas to pay any monetary damages to the McDowells. Doc. 1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Liberty Mutual sent the Sapienzas a letter in early March 2017 stating that it would \"continue to provide a defense to you for the Lawsuit, including any appeal,\" but that it would not provide any coverage for the \"injunctive relief\" ordered by the state trial judge. Doc. 1-5 at 2. According to Liberty Mutual, the injunctive relief and the costs of complying with it did not constitute \"damages\" under the Policies. Doc. 1-5 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed the state trial court's order of injunctive relief in early 2018.\n   <em>\n    McDowell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n    906 N.W.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court affirmed that regulations concerning construction in historic districts applied to the Sapienzas' house and that the house violated these regulations because it was more than eight feet taller than the permitted height.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n    at 405-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the injunction, the Court held that \"[p]ecuniary compensation would not provide adequate relief\" for the harm the Sapienzas' home caused to the McDowells and the McKennan Park District.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12338288\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/906/399/#p403\">\n    at 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Doc. 1 at \u00b6 26. The new application included structural changes to the Sapienzas' home to bring it into compliance with the regulations for historical districts. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 26. Defense counsel, who had continued to represent the Sapienzas during their appeal to the Supreme Court of South Dakota, did not attend the hearing before the Board. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 27. According to the Sapienzas, the Board refused to approve the new application and, based on arguments by the McDowells' lawyer, prohibited the Sapienzas from submitting any future plans for approval. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In May 2018 the state judge issued a writ of execution giving the Sapienzas thirty days to demolish their home. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 29. The Sapienzas complied with the writ and incurred in excess of $60,000 in demolition-related expenses. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Sapienzas sued Liberty Mutual in this Court in September 2018. Count 1 of their complaint is for breach of contract, alleging that Liberty Mutual breached its duty to defend and indemnify them. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-35. Counts 2, 3, and 4 of the Sapienzas' complaint essentially allege that Liberty Mutual's handling of the McDowell suit and refusal to indemnify the Sapienzas constitute bad faith. Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 36-48. Liberty Mutual moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Doc. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept a plaintiff's factual allegations as true and make all inferences in the plaintiff's favor, but need not accept a plaintiff's legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Retro Television Network, Inc. v.

This minority rule is unnecessary, the Restatement reasoned, because defense counsel is in the best position to prevent harm from his or her own malpractice and because an attorney with adequate liability insurance is just as able as the insurer to spread the risk of loss.

According to the Sapienzas' complaint, Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend when it \"took control of the defense of the Lawsuit and responsibility for payment of counsel,\" issued \"instructions to defense counsel concerning actions to be taken (or not taken),\" failed \"to retain an independent expert architect or contractor to offer opinions regarding the home,\" and refused to \"pay for certain activities, all to the ultimate detriment of\n   the Sapienzas.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 18. The Sapienzas also allege that Liberty Mutual breached the duty when defense counsel \"did not attend\" the Board's hearing on the Sapienzas' new application. Doc. 1 at \u00b6 27. Liberty Mutual argues that these allegations fail to state a claim because, among other things, the Sapienzas do not allege that Liberty Mutual overrode defense counsel's independent professional judgment and have not adequately alleged that Liberty Mutual's actions caused them damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This Court agrees with Liberty Mutual that the Sapienzas' allegations fall short in several respects. To begin with, the Sapienzas' allegations that Liberty Mutual issued \"instructions to defense counsel\" and refused \"to pay for certain activities\" are too vague to support the reasonable inference that Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braden v.

The Sapienzas do not allege what Liberty Mutual instructed defense counsel to do or for what activities Liberty Mutual refused to pay. Nor have the Sapienzas made any allegations suggesting that Liberty Mutual's instructions and refusal to pay overrode defense counsel's independent professional judgment or caused the Sapienzas harm. In short, the Sapienzas' allegations about instructions to defense counsel and the refusal to pay for certain services constitute \"naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement,\" and are therefore insufficient to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Sapienzas' claim about lack of a retained expert suffers from similar problems. Again, the Sapienzas allege that Liberty Mutual \"controlled the defense by ... failing to retain an independent expert architect or contractor to offer opinions regarding the home.\" Doc. 1 at \u00b6 18. This allegation does not plead sufficient facts to draw a reasonable inference mat Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Sapienzas do not allege that defense counsel wanted to hire an expert or that Liberty Mutual overrode defense counsel's professional judgment that an expert was necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement of the Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 12 cmt. e, illus. 5 (explaining that an insurer would not be liable for the failure to hire an expert when defense counsel independently chose not to hire the expert without consulting the insurer). Moreover, nothing in the complaint indicates that the failure to hire an expert hurt the Sapienzas' defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Sapienzas' final claim is that Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend when defense counsel \"did not attend\" the Board's hearing on the Sapienzas' new application. Doc. 18 at \u00b6 27. The Sapienzas fail to state a claim on this basis because they do not allege that Liberty Mutual engaged in any wrongdoing. That is, the Sapienzas do not allege that Liberty Mutual caused defense counsel to fail to attend the hearing or somehow overrode defense counsel's judgment that his attendance at the hearing was necessary. Absent any such facts, this Court cannot reasonably infer under Eighth Circuit precedent that Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Braden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495155\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/585/#p594\">\n    588 F.3d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   This Court recognizes that the Sapienzas make somewhat different assertions about breach of the duty to defend in their brief. In briefing, the Sapienzas assert that Liberty Mutual \"directed counsel's course of action through affirmative statements and the refusal to pay for certain activities\n   associated with the case,\" \"failed to allow counsel to retain an independent expert to evaluate the home or make recommendations\" and \"failed to require or otherwise direct counsel to appear at the court-ordered hearing before the Historic Board.\" Doc. 14 at 7.

Supp. 3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 856 n.1 (D.S.D. 2018) (considering factual assertions in a pro se plaintiff's brief on a motion to dismiss). These cases do not help the Sapienzas, however, as the factual assertions in their brief still fall short of stating a claim for breach of the duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   First, the Sapienzas' additional allegations about Liberty Mutual directing defense counsel's conduct and refusing to pay for certain activities remain too vague to support a reasonable inference that Liberty Mutual breached the duty to defend. Second, the Sapienzas' allegation that Liberty Mutual \"failed to allow counsel to retain an independent expert\" comes closer to alleging the necessary misconduct by Liberty Mutual, but still stops short of alleging that Liberty Mutual refused counsel's request to hire an expert or overrode his professional judgment. In any event, the Sapienzas' brief does not include any facts suggesting that the failure to hire an expert caused them damage. Third, the Sapienzas' allegation that Liberty Mutual \"failed to require or otherwise direct\" counsel to attend the hearing is not a viable theory of breach of the duty to defend. As explained above, courts and the draft of \u00a7 12 of the Restatement have rejected the notion that insurers are vicariously liable for any malpractice committed by defense counsel. The authors of the Restatement found no cases \"holding a liability insurer liable for the torts of counsel on a theory of apparent authority or negligent supervision.\" Restatement of the Law of Liability Insurance \u00a7 12 reporters' note d. None of the Sapienzas' allegations allow for the plausible inference that Liberty Mutual was so closely involved in the Sapienzas' defense that it could be liable for failing to require or direct counsel to attend the Board hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rather than dismissing the Sapienzas' breach of the duty to defend claim now, this Court will give the Sapienzas 14 days from the date of this opinion to seek leave to amend their complaint if indeed there is a basis under the facts' for a claim for breach of the duty to defend. This approach is more appropriate than immediate dismissal as the Sapienzas may not have contemplated in the absence of settled South Dakota precedent application of the most recent draft of \u00a7 12 of the Restatement to dismiss their breach of the duty to defend claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count 1: Breach of Duty to Indemnify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Sapienzas' other claim in Count 1 is that Liberty Mutual breached the terms of the Policies by refusing to indemnify them for the damages resulting from the McDowell suit. Liberty Mutual argues that this claim fails as a matter of law because the costs the Sapienzas incurred to comply with the injunction do not constitute \"damages\" under the Policies. Both parties cite authority which they claim supports their interpretation of the word \"damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Liberty Mutual cites several cases in which courts have held that the term \"damages\" in an insurance contract refers\n   to legal damages rather than claims for equitable relief.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ellett Bros., Inc. v.

It also appears that there are no controlling decisions by the Supreme Court of South Dakota on this question.

Moreover, cases on this issue from some other jurisdictions support Liberty Mutual's decision to deny coverage to the Sapienzas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellett Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454387\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/384/#p387\">\n    275 F.3d at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the costs of complying with an injunction do not constitute damages);\n   <em>\n    Hanna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"56300\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/224/499/#p503\">\n    224 F.2d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    O'Brien\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20Ill.%20Dec.%20761\">\n    210 Ill.Dec. 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20N.E.2d%20956\">\n    653 N.E. 2d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Ladd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20Ill.%20Dec.%20305\">\n    29 Ill.Dec. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=391%20N.E.2d%20568\">\n    391 N.E. 2d at 571-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). Although the Sapienzas cited cases adopting a broader view of damages, these cases merely show that there is a split of authority on the issue, not that Liberty Mutual lacked a reasonable basis for its decision. Indeed, the cases the parties cite provide good arguments both for and against concluding that the costs of complying with an injunction constitute damages recoverable under the Policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Sapienzas contend that it would be premature to dismiss Count 4 because \"there is no information in the record regarding Liberty Mutual's investigation of the claim,\" and such information \"is essential to the inquiry into whether or not\" Liberty Mutual had a reasonable basis to deny coverage. Doc. 14 at 14. But this Court does not need to know about Liberty Mutual's investigation to conclude that it did not act in bad faith in declining to pay for costs to remove the home. After all, there is no dispute that the state court awarded the McDowells only injunctive relief and did not require the Sapienzas to pay the McDowells any monetary damages. And whether this injunctive relief constituted \"damages\" under the Policies is a legal question rather than a factual\n   one. Thus, even if Liberty Mutual's investigation somehow was inadequate, it would still have a reasonable basis under South Dakota law for denying coverage for costs the Sapienzas incurred in complying with the injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

The Sapienzas' complaint claims that they incurred in excess of $60,000 in demolition costs, yet generally allege damages of in excess of $75,000 without elaborating on what other damages are sought. Liberty Mutual thinks that the Sapienzas are trying to recover both the building and demolishing costs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 12 at 15. If the Sapienzas are seeking to recover for the construction costs as well, that seems to be a novel issue of damages appropriate to address on certification. If the Sapienzas are not seeking benefits under the Policies exceeding demolition costs, then, in light of the failure to state other claims at this time, their case may belong in state court anyway as less than $75,000 exclusive of interest in costs would be at issue under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    This Court is treating Counts 2 and 3 as one bad faith claim concerning the alleged inadequate defense the Sapienzas received.
