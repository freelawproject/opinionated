It appears to be prompted by the impending sentencing of Mr. Rosario, who has pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to charges of illegal reentry and separate charges of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On December 17, 2008, I sentenced Mr. Rosario to 60 months incarceration, the mandatory minimum sentence, followed by\n   four years of supervised release. Mr. Rosario was released from Bureau of Prisons (\"BOP\") custody on September 22, 2011 to a detainer issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\"). He was thereafter deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now having at some point illegally made his way back into the United States, Mr. Rosario seeks to vacate his guilty plea before me in light of evidence that Annie Dookhan, a chemist working at a Massachusetts state testing laboratory, falsified the results of several drug tests. Mr. Rosario argues that the Government's failure to disclose information concerning Ms. Dookhan's fraudulent actions violated its obligations under\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963), and rendered his guilty plea unknowing and involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated below, I will deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and anticipatorily indicate my disinclination to grant a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   if it was to be presented to me on this record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Factual Background Regarding Mr. Rosario's 2006 Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 1, 2007, Oscar Alphonso Rosario was charged along with fifteen other defendants in a sealed complaint assigned to me in this court with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine. The Complaint detailed an extensive investigation conducted by the Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") and Massachusetts State Police (\"MSP\") into a cocaine distribution network operating in Massachusetts. During the course of the investigation, law enforcement officers executed multiple wire taps and recorded several phone calls between members of the distribution network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As pertinent to Mr. Rosario's involvement in the conspiracy, law enforcement officers intercepted a series of telephone calls between Mr. Rosario and two other members of the conspiracy, Plinio Vizcaino and Yefrey Rodriguez,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   discussing the purchase and sale of a multi-kilogram quantity of cocaine. During the first call, on December 10, 2006, Mr. Vizcaino asked Mr. Rosario whether he had \"a couple of whole cards,\" referring to kilogram quantities of cocaine. Mr. Rosario responded that he did not, and Mr. Vizcaino told him he needed \"at least three.\" Mr. Rosario said that he would \"call 'him' and let Vizcaino know\" about the price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the second phone call on December 14, 2006, Mr. Rosario requested a kilogram of cocaine from Mr. Vizcaino and asked if \" 'the cards' [referring to the cocaine] were 'white' (high quality) and not 'beige.' \" Mr. Rosario then asked Mr. Vizcaino if he would bring \"the cards\" to Mr. Rosario. Later that day, Mr. Rosario again spoke to Mr. Vizcaino and indicated that a \"Marlon\" was going to buy \"four cards\" from Mr. Rosario. Mr. Rosario said he would get three from a friend and that he \"was counting on 'the one' from\" Mr. Vizcaino. Intercepted phone calls suggest that Mr. Vizcaino did, in fact, sell one kilogram of cocaine to Mr. Rosario. On December 16, 2006, Mr. Vizcaino delivered another 400 grams of cocaine to Mr. Rosario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Though intercepted calls reveal that Mr. Rosario and Mr. Vizcaino continued to purchase and sell cocaine from one another at least through the end of December 2006, the Government focused its case against Mr. Rosario on the two transactions on December 14 and 16, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Rosario's only involvement beyond December 2006 were two phone calls from February 21, 2007, during which he asked Mr. Vizcaino if he had met with \"Fiera.\" In these calls, Mr. Vizcaino told Mr. Rosario that he was \"working\" and that he would \"be 'a few seconds',\" but there is no indication that Mr. Rosario was looking to buy or sell drugs or was personally involved in any other drug transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the course of the investigation, law enforcement agents also made four seizures of cocaine between February and April 2007. In total, agents seized seventeen kilograms of cocaine. Two kilograms seized on February 22, 2007 were transmitted to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for testing. The drugs were positively identified as cocaine by Chemists Della Saunders and Annie Dookhan on March 19, 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in the record connected these two kilograms of cocaine to Mr. Rosario: the two kilograms were seized as part of the execution of a search warrant for an apartment where co-Defendants Luis Castillo, Luis Rosario, and Carlos Bravo were arrested. There is no evidence that Mr. Rosario was present at that apartment or had any contact with Mr. Castillo, Luis Rosario, or Mr. Bravo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government has consistently conceded before me that the 4.4 kilograms of cocaine discussed in the intercepted phone calls between Mr. Rosario and Mr. Vizcaino were never recovered by law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Procedural Background and the Present Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Original Prosecution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 14, 2007, a grand jury in this district charged Mr. Rosario, along with fifteen co-defendants, with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the time, Mr. Rosario was already in custody, having self-surrendered on May 10, 2007. On August 14, 2008, Mr. Rosario, along with his co-defendant Devir Leal, pled guilty without a formal plea agreement with the Government. During the plea colloquy, the Government stated that, had the case proceeded to trial, it would have relied on the conversations between Mr. Rosario and Mr. Vizcaino to establish that Mr. Rosario intended to purchase and sell cocaine and that he was accountable for 4.4 kilograms of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the sentencing phase, Mr. Rosario objected to the quantity of drugs attributed to him but did not contest the fact that he purchased drugs from Mr. Vizcaino or that the drugs were, in fact, cocaine. In particular, Mr. Rosario argued that his statement to Mr. Vizaino that he would get three kilograms of cocaine from\n   someone else was puffery and that he should be held responsible for only 1.4 kilograms of cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mr. Rosario filed his initial sentencing memorandum on November 12, 2008, in which he raised this objection to the quantity of drugs, along with objections to the calculation of his criminal history category and to the Government's denial of a safety valve proffer. On November 20, 2008, I held the initial sentencing hearing and heard arguments from both parties with respect to the quantity of drugs and to Mr. Rosario's eligibility for a safety valve proffer. In response to representations from counsel that they would discuss further the possibility of a safety valve proffer, I continued the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On December 11, 2008, Mr. Rosario filed a supplemental sentencing memorandum, raising similar arguments concerning the calculation of his criminal history category. On December 17, 2008, he filed a letter stating that he did not go forward with the safety valve proffer. That same day, following further hearing, I sentenced Mr. Rosario to 60 months incarceration followed by a four-year term of supervised release with credit for time served. As I reported in the Judgment papers, I adopted the factual findings detailed in the Pre-Sentence Report, specifically the drug weight of 4.4 kilograms. However, I varied from the Guideline Range and sentenced Mr. Rosario only to the mandatory minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Rosario was released from Bureau of Prisons custody to an ICE detainer on September 22, 2011 and was deported on November 17, 2011. Since the Probation Office received no information that he reentered the country, his period of supervised release was terminated on September 21, 2015, its original expiration date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Present Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 30, 2017, a criminal complaint issued in the Southern District of New York against Mr. Rosario for illegally reentering the United States, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United\n   </em>\n   States v.

That motion was denied by Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York on November 5, 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Dkt.

Mr. Rosario subsequently pled guilty in the Southern District of New York on February 26, 2019 and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 24, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Dkt.

I also ordered the transcripts of certain prior proceedings in this court be produced on an expedited basis. The transcripts of the Plea Colloquy and the November 2008 Sentencing hearing were produced and the parties have completed filing their submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

His period of supervised release was formally terminated on September 21,\n   2015, more than three years before the present petition for habeas relief was filed and more than one year before he returned to BOP custody in the Southern District of New York in connection with the separate charge now pending against him there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rosario\n   </em>\n   , Criminal Action No. 18-00009-ER, Dkt.

Any period of incarceration or supervision imposed after September 21, 2015 was imposed by a New York court in conjunction with a prosecution against him for his actions in that state, not in connection with the 2008 conviction in this court. While it is certainly possible that Mr. Rosario's freedom\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been restricted after his return to the United States as a result of my judgment imposing supervision in this case, no such restriction was, in fact, imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Furthermore, the only restriction that remained in force and limited Mr. Rosario in any way when he returned to the United States was the order of removal that that I signed after his sentencing.

Section 2255 imposes a one-year statute of limitations on all petitions for habeas relief that starts to run from the latest of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action; (3)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Mr. Rosario filed his habeas petition on February 11, 2019, almost a decade after his conviction became final following entry of judgment and expiration of time to appeal. There is no allegation that the Government affirmatively prevented Mr. Rosario from seeking habeas relief, even if it did not inform Mr. Rosario personally of Annie Dookhan's misconduct. Nor does Mr. Rosario rest his claim on some new rule of constitutional law. Consequently, the present petition is timely only if the \"the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence\" on or after February 11, 2018, one year before the date on which the present petition was filed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   That is not the circumstance here. To be sure, Mr. Rosario could not reasonably have discovered the underlying factual predicate for his claim - that Annie Dookhan falsified laboratory results - before August 2012, when news of her misconduct came to light. However, given the publicity surrounding the allegations against Annie Dookhan, I cannot say that, had Mr. Rosario been present in the United States, he would have been unable to find information about Annie Dookhan, and about its potential relation to his case, through an exercise of due diligence prior to 2018. At the latest, Mr. Rosario would have been on notice by 2014 - when two of his co-defendants, Carlos Bravo and Luis Rosario, sought to withdraw their plea of guilty on the basis that the fraud perpetuated by Annie Dookhan rendered their pleas unknowing and involuntary - that something was amiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I recognize the statute of limitations under \u00a7 2255 is not unyieldingly rigid. Both the Supreme Court and the First Circuit have held that the \"one-year limitations period is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate instances.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramos-Martinez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198933\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/315/#p322\">\n    638 F.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322 (1st Cir. 2011) (applying the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Holland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641601,12454867\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/631/\">\n    560 U.S. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641601,12454867\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/631/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641601,12454867\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/631/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (holding that the one-year limitations period applicable to state prisoners seeking habeas relief is subject to equitable tolling)).

I am not unsympathetic to this argument, especially because Mr. Rosario did not voluntarily leave the country at the conclusion of his period of incarceration: he was removed pursuant to an ICE detainer. I am not convinced, however, that this constitutes an \"extraordinary circumstance\" that warrants equitable tolling, even if there was some evidence of record - or even some suggestion - that Mr. Rosario had otherwise been diligent in pursuing his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, if the statute of limitations could be equitably tolled while Mr. Rosario was out of the country, the clock certainly started to run once he returned. At the absolute latest, then, Mr. Rosario had one year from August 1, 2017, when he returned to federal custody, to seek habeas relief in this court. He failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Formally, Mr. Rosario's petition under \u00a7 2255 is time-barred.

First, the Government during the plea colloquy indicated that, had the case gone to trial, the only evidence against Mr. Rosario would have been a series of phone calls in December 2006 discussing the purchase and sale of cocaine. It stated explicitly that it would not have relied on\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cocaine seizures and certainly did not seek to introduce evidence of the cocaine seized on February 22, 2007 and subsequently tested by Annie Dookhan. Though Mr. Rosario argues that he discussed the cocaine seized on February 22, 2007 with Mr. Vizcaino during a recorded phone call, there is no indication that the Government planned to use that phone call, or the drugs, as evidence against Mr. Rosario.

As discussed above, Mr. Rosario was charged with an inchoate offense and the charges were supported through evidence of a series of phone calls that demonstrated Mr. Rosario's intent to purchase cocaine from Mr. Vizcaino and sell it to a third party. There is no indication that Mr. Rosario was connected to the cocaine that was seized on February 22, 2007 and tested by Ms. Dookhan with a colleague, or that any information concerning that seizure influenced his decision to plead guilty to conspiracy. The Government made clear that it did not intend to introduce evidence related to cocaine testing in support of its case-in-chief. Consequently, I cannot say that newly-discovered evidence of Annie Dookhan's wrongdoing would have been material to Mr. Rosario's decision to plead guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In that connection, I find and conclude that Annie Dookhan's conduct, though certainly egregious, does not give rise\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   to the kind of fundamental error that would entitle Mr. Rosario to a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   . This is especially true since I have found that the Government presented sufficient evidence - in the form of the December 2006 phone calls - from which a jury could find Mr. Rosario guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine irrespective of any testimony regarding Annie Dookhan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based upon the record, I offer an indicative ruling that, even if a request was properly before me, I would decline to issue a writ of error\n   <em>\n    coram nobis\n   </em>\n   in this case to vacate the guilty plea the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered before me.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the petition for a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2255 is\n   DENIED.

However, the amount of cocaine informed my calculation of where to sentence Mr. Rosario in relation to the Guideline range, even if I ultimately decided to depart or vary. Because I found Mr. Rosario was accountable for 4.4 kilograms of cocaine, he had a base offense level of 30 and a total offense level of 27, after accounting for his acceptance of responsibility. [PSR at \u00b6\u00b6 23-30]. Based on this calculation, and his criminal history category, Mr. Rosario faced a Guideline sentence of 78 to 97 months.
