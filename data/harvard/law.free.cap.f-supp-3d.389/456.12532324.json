The '089 Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The '089 patent relates to \"an apparatus and associated method for transmitting, receiving, storing, processing and digitally re-transmitting ... information\" from a data collection device to a remote receiving device via any personal communication system that employs a digital control channel. '089 patent, col. 1, ll. 12-22. The specification of the '089 patent discusses two general embodiments of the invention. The first embodiment \"describes the use of the digital control channel to transmit data from one device to another using a drop and add packet technique.\" The second embodiment describes \"the use of the short message portion of the personal communications system transmission protocol to transmit data from one device to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 11, ll. 31-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. First Embodiment: the Drop and Add Packet Technique\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The specification explains that under existing wireless network technologies, such as Global Standards for Mobile Communications (GSM), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) Technology, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), and Personal Access Communications System (PACS), \"there are 8 logical channels per radio frequency channel which are available for communication\" between devices.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, ll. 44-46;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 1, ll. 17-22. Of the 8 logical channels, \"7 channels are used for voice/data transmission and 1 channel is used as a control channel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, ll. 46-48. According to the specification, the control channel \"is normally used by the GSM, PACS, PDMA, CDMA or TDMA network to verify the caller's identification and billing information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, ll. 48-50. Given those limited functions, there are periods of time when the control channel is not is use. During periods when the control channel is not being used for those purposes, it \"is capable of transmitting data over the network system without interfering with other control channel transmission.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6, ll. 54-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Data transmission during periods of non-use is accomplished using the \"drop and add packet\" technique. That technique repurposes the mechanism by which data is transmitted over the control channel. The '089 specification explains that because the control channel is generally underutilized, many of the transmission packets sent over the control channel contain no wireless network transmission information. Those packets are known as \"dummy packets.\" The invention described in the first embodiment entails removing dummy packets that contain no transmission information and replacing them with \"diverted transmission\" packets. The diverted transmission packets contain data and instructions that can be used to enable the remote device to control individual data collection devices. In addition, the\n   diverted transmission packets can contain data that the data collection devices collect and then transmit back to the remote device.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 5, ll. 53-61; col. 6, ll. 29-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Second Embodiment: the Short Message Portion of the Personal Communication System Transmission Protocol\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning with column 11, the '089 specification describes an alternative embodiment for transmitting, receiving, storing, processing, and digitally re-transmitting information directly to a remote receiving device. That embodiment \"employs the use of the short message portion of a personal communications system transmission protocol.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 11, ll. 34-35. The short message service uses a portion of the control channel of a personal communications system \"to send a protocol specific number of characters of data to and from a mobile subscriber (MS).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 11, ll. 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In that embodiment, when a request for data is made, a remote device \"encodes the request in the short message service portion of the control channel.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%206%2C150%2C955\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 12, ll. 12-14.

Claim 7 states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   7. A method for transmitting a data sequence via a personal communications system transmission protocol comprising the steps of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   automatically collecting data at a data collection unit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   composing at least one data packet including said collected data, said at least one data packet including said collected data being in a form which conforms to conventional short message data packets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   inserting said at least one data packet including said collected data in a short message service portion of a control channel of the personal communications system transmission protocol as one or more short messages; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   transmitting said at least one data packet including said collected data to an access point via said short message service portion of the control channel of the personal communications system transmission protocol as one or more short messages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Claim 8, which is generally similar to claim 6, adds the step of \"stamping [the] collected data with a date and time that said data was collected by said collecting step.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. UPS's Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   UPS filed a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss FCM's complaint. Dkt. No. 19. In that motion, UPS argues that the asserted claims of the '089 patent are patent-ineligible under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claimed method of \"requesting, collecting, and transmitting data using generic computers and conventional SMS protocols,\" according to UPS, is directed to abstract ideas, and \"[r]eciting those abstract ideas using well-known, conventional, off-the-shelf devices and transmission protocols\" does not transform the abstract ideas into patent-eligible subject matter.

First, the court must determine \"whether the claims at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept,\" such as an abstract idea.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20208\">\n    573 U.S. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, if the claims are directed to an abstract idea, the court must decide whether there is an \"inventive concept\" in the claims at issue. The Supreme Court characterized an \"inventive concept\" as \"an element or combination of elements\n   that is 'sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the [ineligible concept] itself' \"; the presence of an \"inventive concept,\" the Court explained, is enough to \" 'transform the nature of the claim' into a patent-eligible application.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayo Collaborative Servs. v.

The Federal Circuit has identified functional claiming as an indicator of abstractness in a number of recent section 101 decisions. In those cases, the Federal Circuit, treating the term \"abstract\" as an antonym of \"concrete\" or \"specific,\" has analyzed whether the claims before it are sufficiently concrete or specific to be directed to a patent-eligible process rather than a patent-ineligible result. For example, in\n   <em>\n    SAP America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517925\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/1161/#p1167\">\n    898 F.3d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court asked whether the claim had \"the specificity required to transform [it] from one claiming only a result to one claiming a way of achieving it.\" To answer that question, the Federal Circuit has directed courts to \"look to whether the claims focus on a specific means or method, or are instead directed to a result or effect that itself is the abstract idea and merely invokes generic processes and machinery.\"\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media Ltd. v.

The specification makes clear that the technology on which the claims rely is conventional and well known. The claims are not directed to a technological solution to a technological problem, but merely look to the use of known technology to communicate information of a type that, according to FCM, has not previously been transmitted using that technology.

Claim 1 of the '089 patent reaches any method of requesting and receiving information that uses the short message service protocol-an extremely common method of personal communication that includes, for example, text messaging. Claim 7 likewise covers any method of automatically collecting data and transmitting that data using the short message service protocol-also a broad claim that would encompass many uses of the known short message service technology. While the limitations of claims 6 and 8 narrow the scope of claims 1 and 7 somewhat by restricting them to transmissions of data that are date and time stamped, date- and time-stamping are sufficiently common practices that the potential preemptive effect of the '089 patent would be broad, raising the types of concerns that the Supreme Court alluded to in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For the reasons given, the Court concludes that asserted claims of the '089 patent are directed to abstract ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Step Two: Whether the asserted claims of the '089 patent recite an inventive concept\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Applying step two of the two-step test from\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Court must determine what, if any, inventive concepts are described and claimed in the '089 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As noted above, the specification describes two separate embodiments. The first uses the \"drop and add packet technique\" and is described in columns 4 through 10 of the specification. The second, which is disclosed in columns 11 through 13 of the specification, uses the short message portion of a communications control channel to transmit data between a\n   mobile subscriber (for example, where a utility meter is located) and a remote device, from which data collection instructions are sent and to which the collected data is returned.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 11, ll. 54-64; col. 12, ll. 12-44. The specification acknowledges that the short message system was designed to compose and interpret short messages consisting of a limited number of characters, and that the invention made no technological changes to the short message system, but merely used that system for transmitting particular data requests and responses to those requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 12, line 61, through col. 13, line 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The first embodiment-the \"drop and add packet\" embodiment-is not recited in the claims of the '089 patent. Instead, the '089 claims are directed solely to the second embodiment. They expressly refer to data packets that are \"in a form which conforms to conventional short message data packets,\" and transmissions of data \"via a short message service portion of a control channel of [a] personal communications system transmission protocol.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 14, ll. 17-18, 19- 23. Furthermore, the Abstract of the '089 patent describes the invention of that patent as a \"method for transmitting data to and from a data collection device using the short message service functionality of the control channel of a personal communications system transmission protocol is disclosed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Rather than being covered by the claims of the '089 patent, the \"drop and add packet\" embodiment is described and claimed in the '955 patent, the parent of the '089 patent. The specification of the '955 patent is nearly identical to the first 10 columns of the '089 patent, and the claims of the '955 patent specifically call for the use of the \"drop and add packet\" technique, providing for the replacement of the information in the dummy packets with messages that are used to transmit instructions and data between the meter reader and the remote device that collects the meter readings. The short message service embodiment was disclosed and claimed for the first time in the '089 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Although much of FCM's argument is based on the detail set forth in the specification, and in particular in portions of the specification that are not directed to the short message service embodiment, that material has no bearing on the issue of the patentability of claims 6 and 8, for two reasons: First, that portion of the specification is not directed to the short message service claims. Second, it is the claims, not the specification, that must contain the inventive concept necessary to render the claims patentable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/#p1337\">\n    874 F.3d at 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To save a patent at step two, an inventive concept must be evident in the claims ....

Cir. July 5, 2019). In that case, the Federal Circuit affirmed a decision dismissing a complaint on grounds of patent ineligibility. The patent in that case was directed to a method of processing data sent from the user of a client computer over a network. One step of the method was embedding an alphanumeric string in an extensible field of a data packet, in which the extensible field was a portion of a normally unused HTTP header field of the data packet. The Federal Circuit rejected the patentee's argument that the limitation satisfied the \"inventive concept\" step from\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   . The court wrote that the specification made it clear that HTTP headers were known and that their use to store information was conventional in the art.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202896449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at ----, slip op. 18. The court concluded that it was clear that there was \"no novelty in this method of storing data.\" Rather, the limitation \"merely instructs the user to store information in a known portion of the conventional header field that is not already holding information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202896449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Even if the embedding process was novel, the court added, it did not render the claims eligible for patenting.

Like the process of embedding data in an HTTP header field, the process of transmitting data by the short message service protocol was well known. The asserted inventive concept in\n   <em>\n    Bridge &amp; Post\n   </em>\n   was to use the underutilized HTTP header to transmit information about a user, a use to which the HTTP header had purportedly not been put before. Yet the fact that the patent claimed the transmission of a different type of data by a recognized mode of data transmission was not sufficient to constitute an inventive concept. Similarly, the fact that the well-known short message system protocol was being used to transmit a different type of data-in the case of the '089 patent, sending requests for data and returning the collected data-is not enough to constitute an inventive concept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It is well recognized that the use of conventional information transmission technology that differs from the prior art only in that it is being used to transmit different information is not patentable subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Praxair Distribution, Inc. v.

In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Bridge &amp; Post\n   </em>\n   , the communications technology is not new.

Dkt. No. 23, at 8-9. For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that this case does not raise any factual question as to that issue. The claims of the '089 patent recite functional limitations that are tied to the short message service portion of the control channel of a personal communications system. The invention simply entails a conventional use of the short message service to transmit particular information. As the '089 specification makes clear, the personal communications systems used in the invention were well known and the use of the short message service portion of the control channels of those telecommunications systems was also well known. All that is purportedly novel is the contents of the short message system messages. And, as noted above, the use of a conventional communication protocol to transmit information is not patentable simply because the subject matter of the information is new. Moreover, as discussed, time-stamping computer generated records is well-known, so the addition of a limitation directed to time stamping data as of the time of its collection is not sufficient to raise a factual question as to whether the subject matter of the claims is well-recognized, routine, and conventional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In this case, FCM's general position with respect to the \"inventive concept\" step of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   inquiry is that the combination of elements recited in each of the asserted claims amounts to an inventive concept. That is, the assertedly \"inventive concept\" is the abstract idea itself. As noted, however, the \"inventive concept\" element of the section 101 analysis requires \"significantly more\" than the abstract idea itself. FCM asserts that the factual issues with respect to claims 6 and 8 of the '089 patent are whether the limitations of each of those claims would be well-understood, routine, or conventional to a skilled artisan. But that is merely asking whether the claim as a whole is the inventive concept. Because FCM has not suggested that there is a factual issue as to whether the asserted claims are directed to something significantly more than the abstract idea itself, FCM has failed to point to a discrete factual issue on which the presence of an \"inventive concept\" in claims 6 and 8 would turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   cases do not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff can avoid dismissal simply by reciting in the complaint that the invention at issue is novel and that the inventive concept resides in the abstract idea itself. As Judge Moore explained in her opinion concurring in the orders denying rehearing en banc in the\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   cases,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516929\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/1354/#p1359\">\n    890 F.3d 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1359 (Fed.
