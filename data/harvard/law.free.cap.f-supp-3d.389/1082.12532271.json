Plaintiff Richard Ernest Anderson, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard Edward Anderson, responded to Defendants' Motion on January 10, 2019 (DE 57), and Defendants replied on January 17, 2019 (DE 60). The Court heard oral argument on Defendant's Motion on February 27, 2019. (DE 70). Upon full consideration of the submissions of the Parties, the record, and the applicable law, Defendants' Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 28, 2016, Martin County Sheriff's Deputies Ronald Manganiello (\"Manganiello\"), Robert Calarco (\"Calarco\"), and Defendant Ben Fennell (\"Fennell\") responded to emergency calls at the residence of Plaintiff Richard Ernest Anderson (\"Plaintiff\"). Plaintiff had called 911 because his twenty-three-year-old son, Richard Edward Anderson (\"Ricky\" or \"Decedent\") was threatening to hurt himself. On that day, Plaintiff twice called 911 for help with Ricky-the first time, the\n   Deputies left without taking Ricky into custody for an involuntary examination pursuant to Florida's Mental Health Act (the \"Baker Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20394.463\">\n    Fla.

Ricky's self-inflicted wounds proved fatal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff brings two causes of action against Defendants: count 1 arises out of the Deputies' response to the first 911 call and states a negligent wrongful death claim against Sheriff Snyder under Florida's Wrongful Death Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20768.16\">\n    Fla.

The Factual Circumstances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The First 911 Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the facts set forth herein are undisputed. On August 28, 2016, Plaintiff called 911, reporting that his twenty-three-year-old son Ricky had not taken his medicine and was threatening to hurt himself. (DE 46-1, DE 46-11 at 112:10-18). Plaintiff informed the dispatcher that Ricky had attempted to commit suicide nine months prior, and that Ricky was currently agitated and angry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response to Plaintiff's phone call, Deputies Manganiello, Calarco, and Defendant Fennell arrived at the Andersons' residence. (DE 46-3 at 4:4-5:11; DE 46-4 at 5:22-26; DE 46-5 at 16:2-17:2). Defendant Fennell spoke to Plaintiff and his wife, Lori Anderson (\"Mrs. Anderson\"), outside the home, but left shortly after arriving to respond to an unrelated call. (DE 46-5 at 17:17-19:8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly thereafter, members of Martin County Fire Rescue, including Brian Robertson (\"Robertson\"), arrived at the Anderson residence. (DE 46-2 at 55:17-21). Fire Rescue personnel took Ricky's vital signs. (DE 46-6 at 62:20-63:11). Throughout the Deputies' interaction with Ricky, Ricky seemed calm and behaved normally. (DE 46-3 at 9:8-12, DE 46-4 at 12:17). Deputies Manganiello and Calarco asked Ricky if he wanted to hurt himself or anyone else. (DE 46-3 at 10:3-7, DE 46-4 at 13:5-7). Ricky answered that he did not. (DE 46-3 at 10:3-8, DE 46-4 at 13:5-7). Robertson also asked Ricky if he was suicidal, and Ricky responded that he was not. (DE 46-6 at 106:25-107:6). Ricky indicated to the Deputies that he had plans for the future-to move out from his parent's home and to have a girlfriend. (DE 46-4 at 12:25-13:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is undisputed that Plaintiff insisted to the Deputies that Ricky was going to commit suicide and needed to be taken to the hospital. (DE 46-11 at 101:23-102:2.). One of the Deputies told Plaintiff that the Deputy did not believe that Fire Rescue would take Ricky into custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:4-6). Plaintiff alleges that one of the Deputies told Plaintiff that he had no authority to determine whether Ricky would be taken to the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 46-11 at 101:23-102:11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The parties do not dispute that, while the Deputies were at the Anderson residence,\n   Ricky stated that he was willing to go to the hospital if his dad wanted him to go. (DE 46-3 at 14:4-14). Ultimately, however, Ricky signed a Refusal Form, which Mrs. Anderson also signed as a witness, indicating that Ricky had refused transport by Fire Rescue to the hospital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 46-8). The Fire Rescue personnel and the Deputies left the Anderson residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Parties agree about much of what occurred while Deputies Manganiello and Calarco were at the Andersons' residence, but they dispute whether the Deputies properly understood their authority under the Baker Act to take Ricky into custody for an involuntary examination. According to Plaintiff's characterization of the events, the Deputies allowed the Fire Rescue personnel to take over the evaluation of whether or not Ricky should have been involuntarily examined pursuant to the Baker Act. (DE 58 \u00b6 33). Defendants insist that the Deputies made the determination not to take Ricky into custody pursuant to the Baker Act. (DE 59 \u00b6 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is also some question about what the Deputies were told by the police dispatcher about their role in responding to Plaintiff's emergency call, particularly whether the Deputies were dispatched as an assist to Fire Rescue. It is unclear from the record what information was transmitted from the 911 dispatcher to the Deputies regarding the situation at the Anderson residence. The Parties did not submit for the record the notes from the dispatcher that were transmitted to the Deputies, and when the Deputies were deposed, they did not have a clear recollection of what information was given to them. (DE 46-3 at 7:1-3, DE 46-4 at 12:6-14). Deputy Manganiello, for example, testified that he could not recall if he had fully read the dispatch notes before arriving at the Anderson residence. (DE 46-3 at 7:1-3). Deputy Calarco testified that he \"believe[d]\" the emergency call was relayed \"as an assist to fire rescue. It was a kid not taking his medication ... [and] [f]ire rescue requested law enforcement dispatch.\" (DE 46-4 at 12:6-9). Ultimately, however, this factual question is immaterial to the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Second 911 Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Immediately after Fire Rescue personnel and the Deputies left, Ricky became agitated again. (DE 61:10-62:6). Plaintiff called 911, informing the dispatcher that he had previously called and that Ricky was now holding a knife and threatening to stab himself. (DE 46-9). Defendant Fennell responded to the second 911 call and arrived at the Anderson residence. (DE 46-5 22:22-25). Hearing voices in the backyard, Defendant Fennell walked to the backyard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There, he observed Plaintiff and Ricky talking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:1-3). Ricky had a knife in his hand, and Plaintiff was attempting to calm Ricky down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:1-8). Ricky said, \"I just want to talk to my dad.\" (DE 46-11 at 132:19-20). Defendant Fennell ordered Ricky to put down the knife. (DE 46-2 at 63:13-15). The Parties dispute precisely how events unfolded thereafter, but it is agreed that Ricky turned away from Defendant Fennell and began moving away from him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DE 46-10). Defendant Fennell then deployed his taser on Ricky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The taser failed to incapacitate\n   Ricky, who quickly stabbed himself four times in the chest. (DE 46-2 at 64:6-8). Ricky's self-inflicted wounds proved to be fatal. (DE 31 \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Duty Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In determining whether the Sheriff owed a duty of care to Decedent, I must first determine whether the Sheriff's actions constitute a category II or category IV activity. For the reasons explained below, I conclude that the police function of responding to emergency calls pursuant to the Baker Act is a category II, law enforcement activity, for which the police owe a duty to the general public rather than to individual citizens. Accordingly, Defendants' Motion is granted as to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Trianon\n   </em>\n   , the Florida Supreme Court described category II activities as those by which \"a governmental entity, through its officials and employees, exercises its discretionary power to enforce compliance with the law duly enacted by a government body.\"\n   <em>\n    Trianon\n   </em>\n   , 468 So.2d at 919. These governmental decisions are \"a matter of governance, for which there never has been a common law duty of care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The decisions involved in implementing the Baker Act-determining when a person meets the statutory criteria to be taken to a receiving facility for an involuntary examination-are discretionary decisions of how to implement the Baker Act and enforce compliance with it. The Baker Act itself, which allows for involuntary examinations of individuals who are substantially likely to cause \"serious bodily harm to himself or herself\n   <em>\n    or others\n   </em>\n   ,\" demonstrates that such decisions are made at least in part for the purpose of protecting public safety.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20394.463\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 394.463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b)(2). Decisions made by police officers pursuant to the Baker Act are therefore paradigmatic law enforcement decisions, for which there is no duty owed to individual citizens. As the Florida Supreme Court has stated, \"[t]he responsibility to enforce the laws for the good of the public cannot engender a duty to act with care toward any one individual, unless an official assumed a special duty with regard to that person.\"\n   <em>\n    Pollock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9193528\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/882/928/\">\n    882 So.2d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The law enforcement actions at issue here are unlike the public safety check at issue in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   . The police officers in\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   were not acting pursuant to any statute or attempting to enforce any law.\n   <em>\n    Wallace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8177683\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/3/1035/#p1044\">\n    3 So.3d at 1049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A police officer's response to a call pursuant to the Baker Act, however, clearly involves the enforcement of that law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the factual circumstances of both this case and of\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   demonstrate that, responding to a Baker Act call is unlike performing a simple safety check. Because one of the Baker\n   Act's criteria for involuntary examinations is that the individual is\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   likely to cause\n   <em>\n    serious bodily harm\n   </em>\n   to himself or others, officers responding to Baker Act calls may frequently find themselves facing unstable, potentially armed individuals and must be prepared for potentially violent encounters like that in\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   . Responding to these calls is thus clearly within an officer's law enforcement responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having found that the Deputies were performing a category II activity, I must now determine whether they assumed a special duty of care with respect to Decedent. I find that they did not. A special tort duty arises \"when law enforcement officers become directly involved in circumstances which place people within a 'zone of risk' by creating or permitting dangers to exist, by taking persons into custody, detaining them, or otherwise subjecting them to danger.\"\n   <em>\n    Pollock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9193528\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/882/928/\">\n    882 So.2d at 935\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Where a defendant's conduct creates a foreseeable zone of risk, the law generally will recognize a duty placed upon defendant either to lessen the risk or see that sufficient precautions are taken to protect others from the harm that the risk poses.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaisner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7561399\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/543/732/\">\n    543 So.2d at 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Kaisner v. Kolb\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Florida Supreme Court found that police officers owed a duty to Glen Kaisner, who had been stopped by police because his truck had an expired inspection sticker.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7561399\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/543/732/\">\n    543 So.2d at 733-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Florida Supreme Court held that, because Kaisner was \"sufficiently restrained of liberty\" during the police stop \"to be in the 'custody' or control of the police,\" the police owed him a duty of care for the duration of time he was in their custody. In\n   <em>\n    Henderson v. Bowden\n   </em>\n   , the Florida Supreme Court found that, when the police instructed an intoxicated driver to drive to a nearby gas station, they created a foreseeable zone of risk that gave rise to a legal duty of care.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11540362\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/737/532/#p536\">\n    737 So.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 536 (Fla. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There are, however, no facts in this case that would suggest that the Deputies' actions placed Decedent within a zone of risk such as would confer a special duty of care. The Deputies did not take Decedent into custody or exercise control over him. Nor did the Deputies' actions subject Decedent to danger. It is undisputed among the Parties that, for the duration of Deputies Calarco and Manganiello's interaction with Decedent, Decedent was calm and seemingly stable. They asked him whether he was suicidal, and he responded that he was not. He indicated that he had plans for the future. The Deputies, having had a seemingly normal interaction with Decedent, did not place Decedent in a foreseeable zone of risk when they left the Anderson residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Accordingly, I find that there was no duty of care owed to Decedent. Accordingly, Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment is granted as to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count 2: Excessive Force\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In Count 2, Plaintiff brings a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that Deputy Fennell's actions in response to the second 911 call violated Decedent's rights under the Fourth and Eighth Amendments. (DE 31 \u00b6 29). The Parties agree that Defendant Fennell is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claim that Defendant Fennell violated Decedent's Eighth Amendment rights. (DE 57 at 15). However, Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claim against Defendant Fennell remains. Defendant Fennell argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity for his actions. For the reasons stated below, I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Qualified immunity offers complete protection for government officials sued in their individual capacities as long as their conduct violates no clearly\n   established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

First, a constitutional right may be clearly established if there is an existing decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Eleventh Circuit, or Florida's Supreme Court that would give officers \"reasonable warning\" that their conduct violated constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , 834 F.3d at 1291 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Holloman ex rel.
