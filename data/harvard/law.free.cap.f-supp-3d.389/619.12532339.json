The officers performed a U-turn, located the possible stolen vehicle, and confirmed with KCPD dispatch that the vehicle was, in fact, reported stolen; the information regarding the stolen vehicle matched that of the green Honda Civic, license plate number of DK1D4J, the officers were following. (Docs. 54, 45-2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4.

Defendant asks the Court to suppress the firearm, methamphetamine and glass pipe found in his jacket, and any incriminating statements he may have made while detained by the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Legal Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Initial Detention\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The crux of Defendant's arguments appears to be the timing of Defendant's arrest and the controlling legal standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 54 at p. 2 n.2). Defendant argues he was arrested immediately upon exiting the car. (Doc. No. 57 at p. 3). The Government argues Defendant was arrested after the firearm was retrieved from his pocket. (Doc. No. 57 at p. 4). Importantly, however, both of these events occurred before the methamphetamine and glass pipe were recovered from Defendant's jacket. Sequential examination of the events preceding the search of Defendant's person reveals that law enforcement's actions were\n   lawful under both a reasonable suspicion and probable cause analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Reasonable Suspicion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant argues law enforcement lacked reasonable suspicion to detain him as a passenger in a stolen vehicle, and therefore his detention was unlawful. Defendant further argues that even if his detention were lawful, there was no reason for the officers to believe he was armed and dangerous and, therefore, there was no basis for the officers to conduct a frisk of his outer clothing for weapons. The Government maintains that the officers had information that the vehicle was stolen, which justified the investigatory stop; and that the officers could reasonably believe that that individuals in a stolen vehicle may be armed, which justified Defendant's frisk for weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

An investigatory stop is lawful if (1) it is based on a reasonable belief by a police officer that the person being detained is committing or has committed a crime and (2) the officer reasonably suspects that the person may be armed and dangerous.

This argument is unpersuasive for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   First, there is no precedent in the Eighth Circuit or Missouri state law that supports the Ninth Circuit's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Rohde.\n   </em>\n   The issue in\n   <em>\n    Rohde\n   </em>\n   was whether the passenger in a stolen vehicle could be arrested under the same statute as the driver - Oregon's unauthorized use of a motor vehicle statute. The Oregon statute provided that \"[a] person commits the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle when: (a) The person takes, operates, exercises control over,\n   <em>\n    rides in or otherwise uses\n   </em>\n   another's vehicle ... without consent of the owner[.]\" Or. Rev. Stat. 164.135(1) (emphasis added). Although the statute on its face appears to apply to both drivers and passengers of stolen vehicles, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that the police only had probable cause to arrest the driver of a stolen vehicle under the Oregon statute, not the passenger, because there was no evidence of a relationship more substantial than that of a driver and passenger. In the Ninth Circuit's discussion of why the Oregon statute did not apply to the passenger of the stolen vehicle, the Court gave no indication that the passenger's arrest could have been considered under any other Oregon statute besides the unauthorized use statute. This contrasts with Missouri law where there are two separate provisions, one for a driver and one for a passenger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of Mo. v. Davidson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385722\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/521/637/#p643\">\n    521 S.W.3d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643-648, 649 n.4 (Mo.

(2) [k]nowingly receives, possesses, sells, or unlawfully operates an automobile, ... without the consent of the owner thereof.\" V.A.M.S. \u00a7 569.080.1(2). Had Defendant been the driver of the stolen vehicle in this case, the officers would have had probable cause to arrest him for First Degree Tampering.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McIntyre v. Caspari\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524260\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/338/#p342\">\n    35 F.3d 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342 (8th Cir. 1994) (Missouri law charging First Degree Tampering is a lesser included offense for a driver charged with stealing a car). But, because Defendant was the passenger in the stolen vehicle, the government asserts that the officers had probable cause to arrest him for Tampering in the Second Degree. Tampering in the Second Degree is a misdemeanor, and provides that a crime is committed when a person \"unlawfully rides in or upon another's automobile.\" V.A.M.S. \u00a7 569.090.1(2). The difference between the laws applicable to occupants in stolen vehicles in Oregon and Missouri renders the Ninth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Rohde\n   </em>\n   decision inapposite here. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rohde\n   </em>\n   failed to cite to any statute or case law in support of the finding that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest a passenger in a stolen\n   vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1144-45.

Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    414 U.S. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    94 S.Ct. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11715586\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/218/#p235\">\n    38 L.Ed.2d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). The subsequent search and recovery of drugs and drugs paraphernalia from Defendant's jacket thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Inevitable Discovery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Even if the Court were to find that probable cause did not exist to arrest Defendant for Second Degree Tampering, the methamphetamine and glass pipe would still be admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine. The \"inevitable discovery doctrine allows for the admission of evidence that would have been discovered even without the unconstitutional source.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah v. Strieff\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2061\">\n    136 S.

Evidence need not be suppressed where the \"two prongs of the inevitable discovery doctrine are proved by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) there is a reasonable probability the evidence would have been discovered by lawful means, in the absence of police misconduct, and (2) the government was actively pursuing a substantial, alternative line of investigation at the time of the constitutional violation.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Munoz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504038\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/916/#p923\">\n    590 F.3d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (8th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In this case, both prongs are satisfied. The officers were actively investigating Defendant in connection with the stolen vehicle. As discussed above, reasonable suspicion existed for law enforcement to detain Defendant and frisk him for weapons. Upon locating the firearm, Officer Payne stated they would need to determine whether Defendant was a felon. (Gvt. Exh. 2 at 8:23:33 p.m.). The resulting criminal history check revealed Defendant had a prior felony conviction. The Court finds there is a reasonable probability that Defendant would have been arrested for being a felon in possession. Once arrested, Defendant would have been searched incident to that lawful arrest, and the methamphetamine and glass pipe would have been discovered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
