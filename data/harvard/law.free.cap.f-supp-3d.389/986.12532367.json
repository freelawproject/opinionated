(Civil Doc. # 1; Cr.

Griham's \u00a7 2255 motion is therefore due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is Griham's second motion to vacate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court therefore provides a brief history of Griham's initial convictions, sentence, and first \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Among other crimes, Griham was convicted in 2007 of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

Griham appealed his convictions, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Griham's \u00a7 2255 motion requires the court to decide two issues. The first is whether the court has jurisdiction to consider the motion. If the court lacks jurisdiction, the second question is whether the court should transfer this matter to a court of competent jurisdiction (here, the Eleventh Circuit) pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201631\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court concludes both that it lacks jurisdiction and that transfer to the Eleventh Circuit under \u00a7 1631 is impermissible. Griham's \u00a7 2255 motion is therefore due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Consider Griham's Second \u00a7 2255 Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A federal prisoner seeking to file a \"second or successive\" \u00a7 2255 motion must seek authorization from the Eleventh Circuit before a district court may consider the motion.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), 2244(b)(3)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Holt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8945947\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/1172/#p1175\">\n    417 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1175 (11th Cir. 2005). When a prisoner fails to seek or obtain such authorization, a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of the motion.\n   <em>\n    In re Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5928116\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/830/1273/#p1277\">\n    830 F.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1277 (11th Cir. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Farris v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9114328\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/1211/#p1216\">\n    333 F.3d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (11th Cir. 2003). The question here is whether Griham's instant \u00a7 2255 motion is \"second or successive\" within the meaning of the relevant provisions of AEDPA. If it is, then this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion because the Eleventh Circuit has not authorized it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Griham's instant \u00a7 2255 motion (filed in 2016) is of course second in time to his first \u00a7 2255 motion, which he filed in 2009. But that does not necessarily mean his motion is \"second or successive\" for AEDPA purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3415381\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/856/#p857\">\n    646 F.3d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 857 (11th Cir. 2011). Under Eleventh Circuit precedent, an application\n   for postconviction relief\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   is only \"second or successive\" if it follows an application that was previously disposed of in a \"judgment on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054928\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1298/#p1302\">\n    754 F.3d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1302 (11th Cir. 2014). This court denied Griham's first \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely under AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. The question is thus whether that denial of Griham's first \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely was a \"judgment on the merits\" that renders his second motion \"successive\" and therefore subject to the strictures of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) and 2244(b)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has never held in a published decision that the denial of an application for postconviction relief as untimely is a judgment on the merits that renders subsequent applications second or successive. But in unpublished decisions, three panels of the Eleventh Circuit have reached that conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boykin v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346204\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/592/809/#p812\">\n    592 F. App'x 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (11th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Candelario v. Warden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349658\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/592/784/\">\n    592 F. App'x 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 785 n.1 (11th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

App'x 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 410 (11th Cir. 2010). Additionally, at least six other federal courts of appeals have likewise concluded (in published or unpublished opinions) that the denial of a habeas petition or \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely renders subsequent applications for postconviction relief successive.\n   <em>\n    Villanueva v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090940\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/55/#p61\">\n    346 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61 (2d Cir. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    Rohn v.

For the reasons explained below, the court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit's unpublished panel decisions and the decisions of the Second, Third, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits are correct. The denial of an application for postconviction relief as untimely under AEDPA's statute of limitations is a judgment on the merits that renders subsequent applications second or successive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Though the Eleventh Circuit has not squarely confronted this issue in a published opinion, this court does not write on an entirely blank slate. The Eleventh Circuit has explained that the dismissal of an application for postconviction relief\n   <em>\n    without prejudice\n   </em>\n   does not render later applications successive under AEDPA.\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054928\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1298/#p1302\">\n    754 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1302 ;\n   <em>\n    Dunn v.

There are several reasons an application for postconviction relief might be dismissed without prejudice, including (1) to allow the prisoner to exhaust state postconviction remedies,\n   <em>\n    Slack v.

In these instances of dismissal without prejudice, the application for postconviction relief is not adjudicated \"on the merits\" and therefore does not render subsequent applications successive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054928\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/1298/#p1302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the other hand, the dismissal of an application for postconviction relief\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    prejudice\n   </em>\n   ordinarily does render subsequent applications successive under AEDPA.\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639571\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/440/\">\n    168 F.3d at 441-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question this case presents is simply whether the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely is a \"dismissal with prejudice\" or \"judgment on the merits\" that renders subsequent applications for postconviction relief successive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It has long been recognized that a dismissal \"with prejudice\" denotes the adjudication of a claim \"in a way that finally disposes of a party's claim and bars any future action on that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    With Prejudice\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). Usually, a dismissal with prejudice means the court adjudicated the substance of the party's claim and found it to be without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dismissal\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (defining \"dismissal with prejudice\" as \"[a] dismissal, [\n   <em>\n    usually\n   </em>\n   ] after an adjudication on the merits, barring the plaintiff from prosecuting any later lawsuit on the same claim\"). But not always. Sometimes, a court may dismiss an action without reaching the substantive merits of a party's claim in a way that nonetheless \"finally disposes of a party's claim and bars any future action on that claim.\"\n   <em>\n    With Prejudice\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). One example of this scenario is when a court dismisses an action as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Though it is not necessary for a court to delve into the \"merits\" of an untimely claim (at least in the colloquial sense of that word), a dismissal on statute-of-limitations grounds is still \"with prejudice\" and constitutes a \"judgment on the merits\" for res judicata purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4441, pp. 213-14, 217 (2d ed. 2002) (identifying the \"clearly correct rule that dismissal of a prior action as barred by the statute of limitations precludes a second action on the same claim in the same system of courts\" and explaining that \"a limitations dismissal is a judgment on the merits that bars a second action on the same claim\"); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 19 cmt. f (1982) (explaining that a judgment for the defendant on statute-of-limitations grounds bars another action by the plaintiff on the same claim in the same jurisdiction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The well-settled meanings of the terms \"with prejudice\" and \"judgment on the merits\" apply with equal force in the postconviction-relief context as they do in ordinary civil actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Felker v.

When a court reaches and rejects the substantive merits of a prisoner's constitutional claims, its decision \"finally disposes of\" the prisoner's claim,\n   <em>\n    With Prejudice\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019), and therefore results in a dismissal with prejudice that renders subsequent applications for postconviction relief successive,\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11639571\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/168/440/\">\n    168 F.3d at 441-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And likewise, the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely\n   under AEDPA also \"presents a 'permanent and incurable' bar to federal review\" of the motion, thereby finally disposing of the prisoner's claim.\n   <em>\n    Villanueva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090940\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/55/#p61\">\n    346 F.3d at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second and alternatively, even if a \u00a7 2255 motion were a civil action, transfer in this case would be futile in light of AEDPA's requirement that a prisoner seek authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the court of appeals \"\n   <em>\n    [b]efore\n   </em>\n   [such motion] is filed in the district court.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Because \u00a7 1631 only authorizes the transfer of a \"civil action,\" which means a noncriminal litigation, that provision does not authorize the transfer of this matter to the Eleventh Circuit. There is simply no \"civil action\" before the court which it may transfer under \u00a7 1631.

Only if both requirements are satisfied\n   may the district court transfer the matter. The Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   held that the first requirement (want of jurisdiction) was not met and therefore returned the matter to the district court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220721\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/1195/\">\n    215 F.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   thus did not (and could not have) implicitly established that \u00a7 1631's\n   <em>\n    second\n   </em>\n   requirement was satisfied in that case.

Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   court at most could have held only that the \u00a7 1631 transfer in that case was plausibly correct; it could not have determined, de novo, that \u00a7 1631 transfers are available whenever a prisoner improperly files a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in federal district court without first seeking authorization from the court of appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus, the question whether \u00a7 2255 motions may be transferred under \u00a7 1631 is still an open one in this Circuit.

The Eleventh Circuit has previously observed that this plain language in \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) may prohibit the transfer of a successive application for postconviction relief under \u00a7 1631.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guenther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11630191\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/1328/#p1330\">\n    173 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1330 n.4. That observation was spot on. Even if available, transfer under \u00a7 1631 would be futile here because AEDPA's plain language requires prisoners to seek authorization from the court of appeals\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   filing a successive application for postconviction relief. Griham did not seek such advance authorization here, and no \u00a7 1631 transfer can now cure that defect: any authorization from the Eleventh Circuit following a \u00a7 1631 transfer would come necessarily come\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   , not before, Griham filed his \u00a7 2255 motion-which would flatly contradict the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). This court therefore could not consider Griham's \u00a7 2255 motion even if transfer to the\n   Eleventh Circuit were authorized under \u00a7 1631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the usual context in which \u00a7 1631 applies (ordinary civil litigation), there is typically no statutory requirement that a litigant first obtain authorization from one court before seeking relief in another. That requirement is seemingly unique to the AEDPA context. Usually then, when a litigant asks a court to transfer a civil action to another court under \u00a7 1631, the only question is which of the two courts properly has jurisdiction of the cause.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Christianson v.

Griham does not seek a \u00a7 1631 transfer to the Eleventh Circuit so that he can litigate his \u00a7 2255 motion in that court to its conclusion. Rather, he seeks a \u00a7 1631 transfer now because he previously failed to comply with AEDPA's requirement that prisoners filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions first seek authorization from the court of appeals before filing the successive motion in district court. And he intends to return to this court (presumably through yet another \u00a7 1631 transfer) to litigate the merits of his \u00a7 2255 motion if the Eleventh Circuit grants him authorization to do so. The question is thus whether \u00a7 1631 may be employed in this manner to circumvent AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), 2244(b)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The restrictions AEDPA imposes on second or successive applications for postconviction relief reflect Congress's considered judgment that, absent narrow, specified circumstances, prisoners should generally be limited to a single opportunity to collaterally attack their sentences in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCarthan v.

But in addition to imposing substantive limits on\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   a prisoner may collaterally attack his sentence for a second time, AEDPA also imposes procedural requirements regulating\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   prisoners may mount successive collateral attacks. One of those procedural requirements is that the court of appeals screen successive \u00a7 2255 motions before district courts be required to consider them.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), 2244(b)(3)(A).

Thus, even a \u00a7 1631 transfer would not enable Griham to comply with \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A)'s mandatory temporal requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is no answer to say that a \u00a7 1631 transfer will allow this court to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   Griham's successive \u00a7 2255 motion after the Eleventh Circuit has authorized it to do so. Section 2244(b)(3)(A)'s text requires Griham to seek circuit-court authorization before his successive motion is \"\n   <em>\n    filed in\n   </em>\n   the district court\"-not before it is\n   <em>\n    considered by\n   </em>\n   the district court.

And, because it would not benefit Griham, a \u00a7 1631 transfer would not be \"in the interest of justice\" even if it were available.\n   <em>\n    Guenther\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11630191\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/1328/#p1330\">\n    173 F.3d at 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court recognizes that other courts of appeals have held that \u00a7 1631 transfers of \u00a7 2255 motions are permissible in these circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liriano v.

But those per curiam decisions did not scrutinize the text of either \u00a7 1631 or the relevant subsections of \u00a7\u00a7 2255 and 2244, and they are unpersuasive for that reason.\n   <em>\n    Liriano\n   </em>\n   , decided shortly after AEDPA's enactment, did not so much as mention the term \"civil action\" apart from quoting the text of \u00a7 1631, let alone analyze how a \u00a7 2255 motion qualified as a civil action. Nor did it provide even a cursory analysis of \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A)'s mandatory requirement that prisoners seek circuit-court authorization\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion in district court.\n   <em>\n    Liriano\n   </em>\n   instead reads more like the report of a policymaking body addressing what procedures\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   govern successive applications for postconviction relief than a judicial opinion deciding what procedures Congress\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   established for successive applications.

Those decisions thus offer no reason to doubt either of the court's alternative holdings: (1) that a \u00a7 2255 motion is not a \"civil action\" subject to transfer under \u00a7 1631 and (2) that a \u00a7 1631 transfer would be futile in this case because Griham did not\n   seek authorization from the Eleventh Circuit before filing his successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
