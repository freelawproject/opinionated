Plaintiff is a 61-year-old African-American woman who was employed with the RCSD starting in April of 2015 as a Central Office Coordinating Administrator of Special Education (\"CASE\") as a probationary employee. Plaintiff's position was terminated in March 2017 along with twenty-two other CASE employees as a result of budgetary concerns. Plaintiff was then placed on a preferred eligibility list for seven years, meaning she could be recalled and resume employment if a position were open, just as the other CASE employees could.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was offered another probationary appointment on June 14, 2017 as a \"TCOSE\" with a decreased salary after she lost her initial CASE position. Plaintiff declined this offer and was eventually recalled from the preferred eligibility list and rehired by the RCSD on November 20, 2017 as a probationary CASE employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In addition to her multiple complaints filed in the NYSDHR, two of which have been dismissed with prejudice, plaintiff has now filed a total of three lawsuits in federal court against the RCSD and Deane-Williams.\n   <em>\n    See Malcolm v. Rochester City School Dist., et al.\n   </em>\n   , 17-CV-6873 (W.D.N.Y. 2017) (action alleging discrimination by the RCSD and an assortment of district employees);\n   <em>\n    Malcolm v.

Upon receipt of her right to sue letter from the EEOC in her fifth charge filed in the NYSDHR, plaintiff then filed the present lawsuit (\n   <em>\n    Malcolm III\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the present lawsuit, plaintiff alleges defendants discriminated against her with respect to her employment in violation of the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. ; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\"ADEA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; New York Human Rights Law (\"NYHRL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20290\">\n    N.Y.

In addition to asserting similar claims to those made in her prior two lawsuits, plaintiff also pleads facts alleging retaliation following her recall to the RCSD. Plaintiff alleges that the RCSD has been retaliating against her by, among other things, allegedly recording their conversations, changing her marital status on tax forms, and hacking into her personal cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In lieu of an answer, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed.

Instead of waiting for a ruling on her motion to amend the complaint in both lawsuits, plaintiff instead filed the present lawsuit adding additional factual contentions to the ones she had made in her prior filings. In fact, plaintiff does not attempt to distinguish this case from her other two, noting that the current action should be stayed pending the same NYSDHR proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While plaintiff does not necessarily copy the same exact text from her prior complaint as she did in the two prior cases, here she details many of the same instances and events that she has pled in suits in the past. Her complaint rests on the same nucleus of operative facts: whether or not plaintiff was discriminated against during the course of her employment at the\n   RCSD.

In the dismissal letter that plaintiff received from the NYSDHR that she attached to her complaint, plaintiff is notified her claims have already been addressed in her other NYSDHR charges. While plaintiff claims that she has been issued a right to sue letter in her other NYSDHR claims and therefore has properly filed suit, plaintiff's claims are indistinguishable from case to case and many of the claims plaintiff alleges in the current complaint are clearly the same as alleged in her first NYSDHR charge which is still pending. Plaintiff even details proceedings with the NYSDHR in her current complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As for the claims occurring after plaintiff was recalled, plaintiff does not detail if, when or how she followed any grievance procedure as required. She failed to allege filing a complaint with the proper administrative authority, or even that she made an informal complaint to any of her supervisors regarding the alleged discriminatory and retaliatory conduct now raised in this complaint. Plaintiff continues to make bald assertions that she has \"exhausted her administrative remedies\" yet she does not detail how she did so. Plaintiff's NYSDHR complaint that she is appealing in this action was filed before she was recalled to her position and did not include any claims regarding any alleged retaliation after she was recalled. Due to plaintiff's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies against the RCSD and her ongoing administrative proceedings, plaintiff's ADEA, Title VII, and NYSHRL claims against RCSD are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As for plaintiff's NYSHRL individual claims against Deane-Williams, plaintiff did not allege direct participation in conduct that gave rise to her discrimination claim anywhere in her complaint. Deane-Williams is\n   only mentioned five times in the complaint.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 58, 156, 321, 328.

Because plaintiff has failed to allege any new facts that Deane-Williams' actions deprived plaintiff of any constitutional right, plaintiff's fourth and sixth causes of action against Deane-Williams are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While RCSD could be deemed to act under color of state law as a public school district, plaintiff does not detail how the RCSD's actions deprived plaintiff of any constitutional rights based on her new allegations. Plaintiff claims that the RCSD subjected her to disparate treatment but does not provide any factual basis for such claims. Instead of pleading specific instances of retaliatory conduct or disparate treatment, plaintiff details computer and email issues she was having, a time she was locked out of a bathroom, police presence at her job, and payroll errors that plaintiff attributes to a conspiracy to discriminate by RCSD employees against plaintiff. Plaintiff even makes multiple accusations of tax fraud against the defendants and her former employer, the Honeoye Falls-Lima Central School District, all without providing any factual basis or tying it to any of her causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff continues to assert vague and speculative accusations without any factual\n   support and fails to link any of her allegations to any form of discriminatory or retaliatory animus. For these reasons, I find that plaintiff has failed to state an equal protection claim against the RCSD and her fourth and sixth causes of action are therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff also makes a claim under the New York Constitution, Article I \u00a7 8. The provision protects freedom of speech. In order to allege a violation under Section 8 and the First Amendment, the plaintiff must allege that (1) she engaged in a protected First Amendment activity, (2) suffered an adverse action, and (3) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee-Walker v.

Ed. 2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). Plaintiff does not plead any protected first amendment activity, nor does she make any argument as to how the defendant's actions of alleged discrimination, harassment and retaliation limited her freedom of speech. For this reason, plaintiff's Article I \u00a7 8 claims are also dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Plaintiff's Breach of Contract, Breach of Collective Bargaining Agreement, and New York Education Law \u00a7 3020-a claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In order to have a breach of contract claim, plaintiff must have been operating under some contract. Plaintiff does not plead that she and RCSD were bound by any employment contract or that there was some contract that was actually breached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ifill v.

Supp. 2d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Plaintiff alleges that the RCSD failed to adhere to the collective bargaining agreement by failing to provide her notice of termination but does not allege what portion of the agreement was breached, nor does she assert how such a failure to notify plaintiff would amount to a breach. Because plaintiff has not alleged any actual breach of contract or any collective bargaining agreement, such claims are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff also claims the RCSD breached its collective bargaining agreement and wrongfully terminated plaintiff with respect to New York Education Law \u00a7 3020-a. However, this statute covers tenured teachers, and plaintiff, by her own admission, was a probationary employee and had not received tenure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Plaintiff's Request to Stay Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff requested, as part of her complaint, to stay the current proceedings until her unexhausted claims are resolved within the NYSDHR and EEOC. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. When considering a request for a stay of proceedings, the court should consider whether (1) plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits, (2) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if no stay is granted, (3) other parties will suffer substantial harm if no stay is granted; and (4) public interest supports a stay.\n   <em>\n    Rochester-Genesee Reg'l Transp.

Supp. 2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (W.D.N.Y. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff argues that a stay is warranted because she is confident she will prevail on the merits. Plaintiff admits that\n   the NYSDHR has jurisdiction over the claims and that a hearing is still pending, but instead is seeking additional relief here in federal court before completing the hearing process in the NYSDHR. As defendants suggest in their motion to dismiss, public interest instead calls for a denial of plaintiff's request to stay, as plaintiff should be required to exhaust her administrative remedies just like every other litigant who files a claim with the NYSDHR and the EEOC. Dkt. #2. Because I conclude that the causes of action should be dismissed above for failure to exhaust administrative remedies upon which plaintiff bases her request to stay, and plaintiff's complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, her request to stay proceedings is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Plaintiff's Motion to Amend the Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff also has moved to amend the complaint. Dkt. #12.

Supp. 2d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure detail the baseline for what is necessary in order to request leave to amend, including a notice of motion and a statement \"with particularity the grounds for seeking the order\" which may include a proposed amended complaint. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a), 6(c)(1), 7(b)(1)(B). Failing to attach a proposed amended complaint may warrant dismissal. L. R. Civ. P. 15;\n   <em>\n    Murray v.

Supp. 2d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (W.D.N.Y. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff has not submitted a proposed amendment to her complaint that would warrant leave to amend. While plaintiff has asserted additional factual contentions in her later declarations and memoranda (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #12), none are presented in the form of a proposed amended complaint, and none indicate plaintiff has exhausted her administrative remedies or suggest any additional claims of discrimination. Plaintiff also continues to clarify her other complaints as she files new lawsuits, all while failing to plead actual factual allegations. Because I conclude that the complaint must be dismissed, and plaintiff has not suggested any proposed amendments that address any of defendants' arguments, amendment of the complaint would be futile. Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION: MALCOLM III\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I find that Plaintiff has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies and failed to state a claim against any defendant with respect to her Title VII, ADEA, NYSDHR and Equal Protection claims. Accordingly, defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint (Dkt. #2) is granted, and the complaint is dismissed, with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
