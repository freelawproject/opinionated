(ECF Nos. 1, 14.) On January 28, 2019, the Court entered an Order temporarily restraining Defendants from applying the August 2018 Policy Memorandum to the individual Plaintiffs, Jia Ye (\"Ye\") and Sen Li (\"Li\") (collectively, \"Individual Plaintiffs\"), pending the Court's resolution of the below motions.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that, for over twenty years, F, J, and M nonimmigrant visa holders\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who entered the United States for \"duration of status,\" as opposed to a fixed time period, would begin to accrue unlawful presence\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"on the day after a government official or immigration judge adjudicates the individual as out-of-status.\" (ECF No. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.) On August 9, 2018, Defendants issued the subject Policy Memorandum\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides, in part, that, for F, J, and M nonimmigrant visa holders, the USCIS was \"changing its policy on how to calculate unlawful presence\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \"INA\"). (ECF No. 14-1 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 \u00b6 97.) Plaintiffs allege that \"[p]ursuant\n   to this new policy, USCIS will start the unlawful presence clock\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on the date that an individual on an F, J, or M visa is adjudicated as being out-of-status.

Defendants, on the other hand, move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).

Here, the Court finds that Individual Plaintiffs-Ye and Li- have standing to sue. Specifically, Ye and Li have sufficiently alleged injury arising from the August 2018 Policy Memorandum. Both individual Plaintiffs are foreign nationals who entered the United States\n   on F-1 nonimmigrant student visas, and subsequently either graduated, or withdrew, from school. (ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10; ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10.) Ye and Li have been recruited by the U.S. Army to enter the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (\"MAVNI\") program because they both \"possess language skills in high demand by the [U.S.] military.\" (ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6 6.) In exchange for their enlistment in the U.S. Army through the MAVNI program, Individual Plaintiffs would be granted United States citizenship. (ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6 6.) Ye and Li have each signed an enlistment contract with the Army and they are awaiting orders to report to Basic Combat Training.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.) Individual Plaintiffs were \"told by the Army not to leave the United States while [they] wait for basic training.\" (ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants argue that because, to date, neither Ye nor Li has received an official determination that he is out of status, \"[it] remains entirely speculative whether [Individual Plaintiffs] will ever find themselves inadmissible\" under the INA. (ECF No. 32 at 16.) Defendants further argued at the April 4 hearing that \"something actually needs to happen to [Individual Plaintiffs] before they can go into court.\" (Tr. at 43.) However, the Supreme Court has made clear that \"where threatened action by\n   <em>\n    government\n   </em>\n   is concerned, we do not require a plaintiff to expose himself to liability before bringing suit to challenge the basis for the threat.\"\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    549 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128-29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p128\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Here, pursuant to the new policy set forth in the Policy Memorandum which started the accrual of unlawful presence for out-of-status nonimmigrants on August 9, 2018, it is likely that Individual Plaintiffs are presently accruing unlawful presence given that they are no longer enrolled in a course of study. (ECF No. 14-1 at 4-5.) Ye's 180-day clock expired on February 5, 2019, and Li's expired on February 20, 2019. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 10,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6 10,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14-1 at 4-5.) Consequently, Ye and Li are likely to be subject to at least a three-year reentry bar if they are later adjudged to be out of status. Therefore, based on the allegations and the evidence presently before the Court, the change in policy set forth in the August 2018 Policy Memorandum directly affects Ye and Li's concrete interest,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , their ability to depart the United States and return without imposition of a reentry bar. Moreover, this could occur to each individual Plaintiff absent any notice that departing the United States would result in a bar to their reentry. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Individual Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged harms to their concrete interests traceable to the August 2018 Policy Memorandum which will likely be redressed by the relief requested by Plaintiffs. Thus, at this preliminary phase, Individual Plaintiffs have met their burden of demonstrating standing to challenge the August 2018 Policy Memorandum in this action.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NAACP v.

To effect this new change in policy, USCIS has inserted its revised definition of unlawful presence, as reflected in the Policy Memorandum, into its USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual. (ECF No. 14 \u00b6 99; ECF No. 14-1 at 10.) The USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual, in turn, states that \"policy material is binding upon\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   employees of USCIS, unless or until it is specifically superseded by other policy material.

Here, based on the explicit language of the Policy Memorandum, its stated purpose, its designation as policy material as described in the USCIS Adjudicator's Field Manual, and its binding effect on\n   adjudicators, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the August 2018 Policy Memorandum is a legislative rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For a legislative rule to be valid however, it must have been promulgated in compliance with the APA's notice and comment procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Individual Plaintiffs, Ye and Li, allege that USCIS may maintain that their student status lapsed prior to August 9, 2018 and August 24, 2018, respectively. (ECF No. 16-1 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 16-2 \u00b6 10.) Therefore, under the terms of the August 2018 Policy Memorandum, as of February 6, 2019 and February 21, 2019, respectively, Ye and Li appear to have exceeded 180 days of unlawful presence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14-1 at 4-5.) The AFT likewise alleges that some of its members present in the United States on F or J nonimmigrant visas may likely fall out of status and accrue unlawful presence without their knowledge due to technical status violations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16-4 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, 12-13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 \u00b6\u00b6 48-49, 137-40, 149-50.) Pursuant to the terms of the Policy Memorandum, such members will likely be forced to depart the United States, or be subject to a reentry bar if they depart the United States without knowing that they have exceeded 180 days of unlawful presence. Absent injunctive relief, upon departure from the United States, Ye and Li, as well as AFT members on F or J nonimmigrant visas, will likely be subject to imposition of a three or ten-year reentry bar before having an opportunity to cure any status violations. Moreover, once the reentry bar has been imposed, judicial review will likely be precluded by the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, which holds that \"courts lack jurisdiction to review a consular officer's decision to grant or deny a visa.\"\n   <em>\n    Int'l Refugee Assistance Project v.
