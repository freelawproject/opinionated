(doc. 15-7 at 41-42; 46-47). The email also noted that the rates for additional cabins had increased, but a previously quoted-rate would be honored if Plaintiff would \"put the deposits down today.\" (doc. 15-7 at 41.) On the same day, Plaintiff spoke with a salesperson on the phone who said that payment of the deposit guaranteed his group reservation, and \"nobody could take these cabins from [him].\" (doc. 15-1 at 2). He alleges that by paying the deposit, he entered into an oral contract with the salesperson, who \"guaranteed [him] the biggest room on the ship along with approximately 30 other cabins at a heavily discounted rate....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"The only other term was that [he] had the option of paying the balance due approximately 90 days before sailing or [he] could cancel the cruise with full refund by giving notice of cancellation approximately 90 days before sailing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He claims that at no point during the phone conversation did the salesperson discuss an arbitration agreement or make any reference to the terms and conditions of a ticket contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Later the same day, the salesperson emailed Plaintiff that his group reservation was completed. (doc. 15-7 at 26).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She also confirmed that \"all monies are completely refundable all the way up until that date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She stated that she had \"transferred [his] individual reservation into [his] group as well.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The salesperson noted that she sent Plaintiff a \"group invoice\" that \"summarize[d] [his] group as it stands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She further advised Plaintiff to be on the lookout for a \"group agreement\" that would be sent to him in the next two days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She explained that it \"will summarize your group and go over your group amenities a little further.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She finally noted that Plaintiff should fill out and return the attached \"group function request form\" \"with all the information for your group event.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the same day, Plaintiff received two automated emails from Defendant with attachments, including an invoice (Group Invoice) and receipt (Receipt) for the group reservation on the January 2018 Cruise.

Both emails also included download instructions and the contact information for the Reservations Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Receipt referred to a group reservation for the\n   \"Jackson Group\" on the January 2018 Cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24.) It noted that a total payment of $6,200 was charged, with payment posted on January 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first page of the 16-page Group Invoice stated that $6,450 in total payments had been paid.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a separate paragraph on the bottom of the page was the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   This group booking and each individual booked as part of your group shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Cruise/Cruisetour Ticket Contract.

(doc. 15-7 at 7-12.) The email advised Plaintiff to review the Group Agreement and \"sign and return it via fax or email by the date indicated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The first page of the Group Agreement stated that the rates quoted would apply thru February 25, 2017, and would be based on inventory availability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.) The last page of the 4-page agreement included the following statement: \"All guests traveling in the Group agree to the terms and conditions as stated in the Cruise Ticket Contract.\" (doc. 15-7 at 10.) Unlike the Group Invoice, there were no instructions or comments on how to access or review the terms and conditions in the Cruise Ticket Contract (Ticket Contract). The next paragraph provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HERE IN SHALL NOT BE VALID UNLESS THIS AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED BY THE GROUP LEADER AND RETURNED TO THE CRUISELINE, ON OR BEFORE 02/03/2017.

On the bottom of the last page are blanks for the \"group leader's\" name, signature, and date, as well as the return address for the executed agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not review or execute this agreement. (doc. 15-1 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In February of 2017, Plaintiff continued corresponding with Defendant's employees regarding wedding details, as well as the confirmation of certain requested functions and amenities for the group reservation. (doc. 15-7 at 48-52; 59-60; 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Plaintiff received four separate automated emails from Defendant. (doc. 15-7 at 102, 122, 135, 141). As with the prior automated emails, the body of each email began with the following statement: \"Please find the documents you requested below.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The emails also included download instructions for the documents, as well as the contact information for the Reservations Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Attached to each email was a Receipt, two Group Invoices, and a Group Confirmation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100-41.) The Receipt stated that payments totaling $6,200 were posted on May 10, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100-01.) Both Group Invoices were dated May 9, 2017, and included additional expenses related to the wedding and other requested amenities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105-21; 125-34.) They also contained the same paragraph referencing and incorporating the terms of the Ticket Contract, as well as its availability on Defendant's website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Group Confirmation consisted of five pages. (doc. 15-7 at 136-40.) The first four pages of the Group Confirmation contained general information about the itinerary, payment and cancellation schedule, the stateroom numbers, the group amenities booked, and government passenger requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136-39.) Under the heading \"Other Special Remarks\" on the last page of the document, was the following paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   This group booking and each individual booked as part of your group shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Cruise/Cruisetour Ticket Contract. A copy of the most current version of that contract can be viewed at\n   <em>\n    www.RoyalCaribbean.com/cruiseticketcontract.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 140.) Unlike the notice paragraphs contained in the other documents, this paragraph provided the direct URL address to the Ticket Contract, and the website address was underlined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Plaintiff called Defendant to transfer his reservation from the January 2018 Cruise to another ship departing from Galveston on September 17, 2018 (September 2018 Cruise). (docs. 15-1 at 2; 8-1 at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As with the prior reservation, the parties orally agreed that Plaintiff would be guaranteed thirty-one cabins at a \"heavily discounted rate\" if he paid a deposit to secure the reservation. (doc. 15-1 at 2-3.) The salesperson confirmed that the new reservation would be subject to the same terms agreed to in the previous reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The parties also orally agreed that Plaintiff was to pay the remaining balance approximately ninety days before the departure date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) Per Plaintiff's request, Defendant cancelled the reservation on the January 2018 Cruise and transferred his deposit to a new group reservation on the September 2018 Cruise. (docs. 15-1 at 4; 8-1 at 2.) Plaintiff maintains that at no point during the phone conversation did the salesperson discuss an arbitration agreement, or reference the terms and conditions of a ticket contract. (doc. 15-1 at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Later the same day, Plaintiff received four automated emails from Defendant with attachments, including a Confirmation of Cancellation of the January 2018 Cruise, as well as a Group Invoice, Guest Manifest, and Receipt for the September 2018 Cruise. (doc. 15-7 at 74-98.) As with other automated emails sent to Plaintiff, the body of each email began with the following statement: \"Please find the documents you requested below.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78, 79, 81, 98.) Each email also included download instructions and the contact information for the Reservations Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Receipt identified the September 2018 Cruise and noted that $6,450 in payments were posted on October 3, 2017. (doc. 15-7 at 74-77.) The first page of the 16-page Group Invoice was a summary of the new reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82-97.) The net charge for the September 2018 Cruise was listed at $18,905.20. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82.) The total amount of payments on record was $12,650, and the remaining balance due was $6,255.20. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Like the group invoice for the January 2018 Cruise, the bottom of the first page included the same language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   This group booking and each individual booked as part of your group shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the Cruise/Cruisetour Ticket Contract. A copy of the most current version of\n   that contract can be viewed at www.RoyalCaribbean.com.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff also received an updated Group Agreement for the September 2018 Cruise with blanks for his name and signature and the date. (doc. 15-7 at 69-72.) The standard terms of the Group Agreement remained the same, and it also included the following statement on the last page of the 4-page agreement: \"All guests traveling in the Group agree to the terms and conditions as stated in the Cruise Ticket Contract.\" (doc. 15-7 at 72.) There were no instructions or comments on how to access or review the terms and conditions in the Ticket Contract, however. The Group Agreement further provided that Plaintiff was to execute and return it to Defendant on or before October 11, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not review or execute this agreement, however. (doc. 15-1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In January 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant notified Plaintiff that it was cancelling his reservation because it was repositioning the ship for the September 2018 Cruise to another port. (docs. 15-1 at 4.) Defendant offered Plaintiff either a full refund of the cruise or to re-book his group on another cruise. (docs. 15-1 5-6; 8-1 at 3.) Defendant claims it offered him \"a $100 credit per standard stateroom and a $200 credit for suites\" if he agreed to re-book on another cruise. (doc. 8-1 at 3.) Plaintiff claims that \"at no time did [Defendant] offer $100 per stateroom or $350 per suites to me.\" (doc. 15-1 at 6.) Plaintiff did not re-book on another cruise, and on January 18, 2018, Defendant refunded the $12,650 he paid for the group reservation. (doc. 8-1 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On May 21, 2018, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against Defendant in the 116th District Court of Dallas County, Texas, claiming breach of contract, breach of implied-in-fact contract, bad faith denial of the existence of a contract, common law fraud, Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act violations, and loss of bargain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-3.) On June 28, 2018, Defendant removed this action to federal court on the basis of federal question, diversity of citizenship, and admiralty jurisdiction.

Moreover, in its answer, Defendant expressly denied that \"Plaintiff has fully performed all conditions and obligations under the terms of the contract for booking and reserving the wedding cruise including paying the deposit of $12,650 to Defendant.\" (doc. 3 at 6.) Defendant has not met its initial burden to compel arbitration based on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Even assuming that Defendant satisfied its initial burden, Plaintiff has shown that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to his purported assent to the Ticket Contract. His declaration states that the only agreement he entered into with Defendant was an oral contract, and that the only terms applicable to their agreement were the ones the parties discussed and agreed to on the phone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (doc. 15-1 at 3.) Those terms were the discounted rate for the rooms, the final payment deadline, and the cancellation date.

(doc. 15-1 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Further, on at least two separate occasions, Plaintiff declined to provide his express acknowledgment of, and assent to, the Ticket Contract and its terms and conditions. After Plaintiff made both group reservations, Defendant sent him a Group Agreement for his signature. (doc. 15-7 at 7-12, 69-72.) Both agreements referenced the Ticket Contract and stated that its terms applied to all the guests traveling under each group reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 72.) Each agreement provided a date that Plaintiff was to sign and return it or \"THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HERE IN SHALL NOT BE VALID.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not execute either agreement before its respective deadline.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 1-3.) A paragraph in the invoice provides that the group booking \"shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the ...

(doc. 8-1 at 2.) A similar invoice was emailed to him after he booked the earlier group reservation on the January 2018 Cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The invoice for the January 2018 Cruise included the same paragraph referencing the Ticket Contract and Defendant's website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The declaration states that \"[the Ticket Contract] can be found by clicking the 'Cruise Contract' link at the bottom of [Defendant's] homepage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Attached to it is a copy of the Ticket Contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-14.) Section 10 of the Ticket Contract includes an agreement to arbitrate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) The declaration states that the \"Ticket Contract has not changed since Plaintiff booked his cruises.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendant argues that \"[i]n this electronic age, courts have held that websites can provide one with fair opportunity to review terms and conditions referenced in invoices and other contracts.\" (doc. 8 at 7.) It claims that Plaintiff received two invoices that referenced the Ticket Contract and its accessibility on its website, that the very top of the Ticket Contract expressly signaled its importance, and that its express language \"states the mandatory requirement for arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 9.) Because Plaintiff does not dispute that those invoices were emailed to him, Defendant argues that the evidence establishes that he received notice of the terms of the Ticket Contract.

A detailed factual recount of\n   <em>\n    Specht\n   </em>\n   is instructive. There, Netscape sought to compel arbitration of a class action dispute involving a \"plug-in\" program it offered to enhance the functioning of its separate browser program. The plug-in program and the browser program were subject to two separate license agreements. Each license agreement had its own arbitration provision. Although the browser program could have been obtained independently of the plug-in program, the plaintiffs downloaded and installed both programs at the same time. The class action lawsuit was limited to claims involving the plug-in program, however.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Each plaintiff visited Netscape's website and accessed a webpage that displayed a button to be clicked to download the browser and the plug-in. Below that button was text that would only have been visible to the plaintiffs had they continued to scroll down to the bottom of the webpage. The text advised the user to review and agree to the terms of the plug-in software agreement before downloading and using the software. The text was embedded with a hyperlink that would direct the user to that agreement. The plaintiffs testified that they did not see this text before clicking on the download button.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   After the plug-in program was downloaded and opened by the user, the installation of the browser program was initiated. Unlike with the download of the plug-in, the entire text of the browser program's license agreement was immediately shown to the user. To continue with the installation, the user was required to scroll through the entire agreement and\n   then click on a \"Yes\" button to indicate that they accepted the browser's license terms. A user could not install the browser without clicking the \"Yes\" button.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Netscape argued that the plaintiffs had reasonable notice of the plug-in license agreement because a reference to its terms was on the same webpage used to download the program, which they would have seen had they scrolled to the bottom of the page before clicking the download link.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p20\">\n    306 F.3d at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, the reference to the Ticket Contract and its terms was not presented to Plaintiff at the time he booked either group reservation. Reference to it were contained in invoices emailed to him after he paid the deposit for the first booking, and after his deposit was transferred for the second booking. Nothing in either invoice required Plaintiff to manifest assent to the terms of the Ticket Contract, however. When booking both reservations, Plaintiff was \"required neither to express unambiguous assent to\" the Ticket Contract, \"nor even to view [its] terms or become aware of their existence before proceeding with\" each booking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Specht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p20\">\n    306 F.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though invoices containing a reference to the Ticket Contract were eventually emailed to Plaintiff after each booking, the reference was not immediately displayed in those emails, but inside separate attachments. \"A reference to the existence of [ ] terms on a submerged screen is not sufficient to place consumers on inquiry or constructive notice of those terms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p20\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437423\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/17/#p20\">\n    at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The emails themself would not give a reasonably prudent person sufficient notice that the attached documents contained contractual terms and conditions, including an agreement to arbitrate. In effect, the terms of the Ticket Contract were \"submerged\" in attachments to the emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendant has not shown that Plaintiff was expressly advised that either reservation would be subject to additional terms at any point, and none of the emails sent to him stated that the attachments were contractual agreements or contained contractual terms. Accordingly, Plaintiff did not have reasonable notice that his agreement with Defendant would be subject to the terms of the Ticket Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendant has not shown the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Plaintiff having reasonable notice of the reference to the terms of the Ticket Contract. It has failed to demonstrate that notice of the terms of the Ticket Contract, as presented in the invoices emailed to Plaintiff, was reasonable. For this reason alone, its motion to compel should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

(doc. 8 at 8.) It notes that Plaintiff previously booked the January 2018 Cruise, and an invoice was emailed to him. It also notes that he was able to cancel that reservation without penalty as provided for in the terms of the Ticket Contract. Defendant states that a second invoice with the same reference to the Ticket Contract was sent to Plaintiff after he booked the September 2018 Cruise. Because \"the circumstances show that he had twice been presented with notice of the terms of the Ticket Contract,\" Defendant argues that his consent to the Ticket Contract can be implied from and evidenced by their prior conduct and course of dealing. (doc. 8 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In support of its argument, Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Haws &amp; Garrett General Contractors, Inc. v. Gorbett Brothers Welding Co.\n   </em>\n   , which recognized that the circumstances of a particular transaction may give rise to an implied contract in light of the prior dealings between the parties.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9943624\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/480/607/#p609\">\n    480 S.W.2d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In such a case, the element of mutual assent can be inferred from those circumstances. In that case, a dispute arose between a contractor and an equipment rental company regarding damage to a bridge allegedly caused by the company's crane. The contractor telephoned the company to rent cranes for a bridge project and a work order form was printed by the company after the phone call. The work order contained an indemnity agreement and was signed by the contractor's employee, but the signature was obtained after the bridge was damaged. The company argued that because the contractor previously leased equipment from it under similar circumstances, \"the contract of indemnity ... arose out of the circumstances of the particular transaction in question in the light of prior dealings between the parties.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9943624\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/480/607/#p609\">\n    480 S.W.2d at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Even though there was evidence that the contractor leased equipment from the company \"on prior occasions in a similarly informal manner,\" the court found that the evidence failed to give rise to an implied contract because there was insufficient evidence that the parties agreed to the indemnity\n   terms in their prior dealings.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9943624\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/480/607/#p609\">\n    480 S.W.2d at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because there was no evidence of mutual assent in those prior dealings, the circumstances did not constitute evidence to support a finding of mutual assent in a subsequent transaction between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Likewise, in this case, Defendant argues that the first group reservation constitutes a course of conduct or prior dealing between the parties, to be used as evidence that Plaintiff accepted the terms of the Ticket Contract in the second reservation. There is no conclusive evidence that Plaintiff expressly assented to the terms of the Ticket Contract at the time of the first reservation, however. Without evidence of Plaintiff's express assent when he booked the January 2018 Cruise, course of conduct and prior dealing will not support evidence of mutual assent of the Ticket Contract at the time of the second reservation. While an invoice referencing the Ticket Contract was sent to Plaintiff after two separate reservations, Defendant fails to provide evidence that Plaintiff agreed to the Ticket Contract after either booking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Even if Defendant met its initial burden on the existence of an implied contract, Plaintiff provides evidence of a genuine dispute, as shown by the two Group Agreement forms sent to Plaintiff that he never executed. The record shows that on the two occasions that Plaintiff was presented with the Ticket Contract, and his express assent to be bound was requested, he did not assent. There is a genuine issue of material fact on whether Plaintiff actually rejected the terms of the Ticket Contract when he failed to executed and return each agreement by its respective deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Accordingly, Defendant has failed to meet its summary-judgment-like burden of showing the lack of a genuine issue of material fact surrounding Plaintiff's acceptance of the Ticket Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Contractual Benefits Obtained\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff took advantage of a cancellation provision in the Ticket Contract that allowed him to cancel the first group reservation without penalty because it was cancelled more than ninety days before the sail date. (doc. 8 at 8.) The prior reservation was cancelled, and the deposit from that reservation was applied to the new reservation. (doc. 15-7 at 82.) Defendant's supporting declaration states that \"[p]er the terms of the Ticket Contract, [Plaintiff] was able to cancel his cruise without incurring a cancellation fee.\" (doc. 8-1 at 2.) By taking advantage of the cancellation provision in the Ticket Contract, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has acknowledged the Ticket Contract and accepted its remaining terms and conditions including the arbitration provision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To the extent Defendant argues that Plaintiff's receipt of a benefit under the Ticket Contract establishes mutual assent, it fails to provide any authority in support of the argument. Nevertheless, Plaintiff presents a genuine issue of material fact precluding a summary judgment finding on this issue. In his affidavit, Plaintiff admits that he was able cancel the January 2018 Cruise without incurring a penalty and that all of his deposits were refunded. (doc. 15-1 at 2.) He counters that he did not take advantage of any cancellation provision contained in the Ticket Contract, but was acting under the terms of the parties' oral contract. (doc. 15 at 6.) He states that he was not aware of the Ticket Contract until after the commencement of this lawsuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff's evidence supports his claim that he was able to cancel his reservation under the terms of an oral agreement. Even though Defendant's representative's\n   declaration states that the reservation was cancelled under the terms of the Ticket Contract, there is no evidence that it was communicated to Plaintiff that the penalty-free cancellation of the first group reservation was done in accordance with the terms of the Ticket Contract. In fact, the group cancellation notice that was emailed to Plaintiff simply stated that the group reservation on the January 2018 Cruise \"was canceled according to group policy or at your request.\" (doc. 15-7 at 80.) \"Group policy\" is not defined, and there are no references to the Ticket Contract in this notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   At minimum, there is a genuine fact dispute on whether Plaintiff received a benefit under the terms of the Ticket Contract, or that the penalty-free cancellation was done in accordance with an oral agreement.\n   <em>\n    Goad v. St. David's Healthcare P'ship, L.P., LLP\n   </em>\n   , No. 1-16-CV-044 RP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202853573\">\n    2016 WL 2853573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (W.D. Tex. May 13, 2016) (concluding the existence of a genuine fact issue regarding the validity of the arbitration agreement between the parties precluded the court from determining as a matter of law whether the arbitration agreement was valid and enforceable). Given the evidence and Plaintiff's unequivocal assertions that he has been proceeding under the terms agreed to in the parties' oral contract, Plaintiff's prior cancellation does not show that he obtained a benefit under the Ticket Contract, and does not constitute undisputed evidence that he agreed to be bound by the terms of the Ticket Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendant has failed to demonstrate that Plaintiff agreed to arbitrate under the terms and conditions of the Ticket Contract.

His declaration states that he entered into an oral agreement with Defendant's salesperson on January 15, 2017, to reserve \"30 plus cabins at a heavily discounted price\" on the January 2018 Cruise. (doc. 14 at 8.) He paid Defendant a deposit and the salesperson \"confirmed that they had received payment\" and his \"heavily discounted cabins were guaranteed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On October 2, 2017, he entered into an oral agreement with Defendant's salesperson to transfer his reservation and deposit to the September 2018 Cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant's salesperson confirmed that the same terms applicable to the January 2018 Cruise reservation, would also apply to the reservation on the September 2018 Cruise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) Defendant transferred his $12,650 deposit to the September 2018 Cruise reservation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff contends that Defendant's representative's declaration and an invoice from Defendant provides\n   additional summary judgment evidence of the parties' oral contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 25-30.) Plaintiff has met his summary judgment burden to show the existence of an oral contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The burden now shifts to Defendant to show a genuine issue of material fact for trial regarding the existence of an oral contract. Defendant argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because a factual disagreement about the contract at issue exists. (doc. 19 at 6). Defendant also refers to its representative's declaration. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It acknowledged that Plaintiff was able to cancel the group reservation on the January 2018 Cruise and re-book the reservation on the September 2018 Cruise, and states that the cancellation and re-booking was done in accordance with the terms of the Ticket Contract. (doc. 14 at 25.) It provides evidence supporting Defendant's claim that the Ticket Contract is the actual agreement between the parties. (doc. 19 at 6.) Because the declaration raises a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the identity of the contract in this dispute, Defendant has sustained its burden to avoid summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1531374\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/780/1190/#p1194\">\n    780 F.2d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment on his breach of contract claim should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Attorneys' Fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff also seeks summary judgment on his claim for attorneys' fees on his breach of contract claim under Tex.
