STANTON, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the People of the State of New York brought this action alleging violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act and New York law for deceptive advertising of a dietary supplement (\"Prevagen\") purporting to improve one's memory. Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for lack of personal jurisdiction over Mark Underwood and Michael Beaman. For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are as alleged in the Complaint (Dkt. No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Quincy Bioscience Holding Company, Inc. (\"Quincy\") is a Wisconsin corporation. Defendants Quincy Bioscience, LLC, Prevagen, Inc., and Quincy Bioscience Manufacturing, LLC are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Quincy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants Mark Underwood and Michael Beaman are Quincy's co-founders and two largest shareholders; Mr. Underwood owns 33% and Mr. Beaman owns 22% of its stock. Mr. Underwood is Quincy's President and Mr. Beaman is its Chief Executive Officer and former President. Each is also a director of Quincy Bioscience, LLC, Prevagen, Inc., and Quincy Bioscience Manufacturing, LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants manufacture and sell a dietary supplement known as Prevagen. Prevagen's active ingredient, apoaequorin (pronounced: a-poe-e-kw\u00f4r-in), is a dietary protein originally derived from the jellyfish\n   <em>\n    Aequorea victoria\n   </em>\n   . Prevagen is sold to consumers through Defendants' websites and various pharmacies and retail establishments. Between 2007 and mid-2015, sales of Prevagen in the United States totaled $165 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants advertise Prevagen on their websites and through infomercials, short-form television commercials, social media, newspapers, and magazines. Their advertising includes representations that \"Prevagen improves memory,\" that it \"has been clinically shown to improve memory,\" that \"A landmark double-blind and placebo\n   controlled trial demonstrated Prevagen improved short-term memory, learning, and delayed recall over 90 days,\" that Prevagen \"Helps with memory problems associated with aging,\" that it \"is clinically shown to help with mild memory problems associated with aging,\" and that it can support \"healthier brain function, a sharper mind and clearer thinking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Those representations rely primarily on the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled human clinical study called the Madison Memory Study, which tested 218 subjects who were given either 10 milligrams of Prevagen or a placebo. The subjects were assessed on nine computerized tasks to assess cognitive skills like memory and learning at various intervals over a period of 90 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Madison Memory Study did not show a statistically significant improvement in the treatment group over the placebo group as a whole on any of the nine computerized tasks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The researchers conducted more than 30\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   analyses of the study's results, looking at data broken down by several variations of smaller subgroups for each of the nine computerized cognitive tasks. The researchers found a few positive findings on isolated tasks for small subgroups of the study population, but the majority of the\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   comparisons failed to show statistical significance. Nevertheless, Defendants cited the Madison Memory Study as support for the claims made in their Prevagen advertisements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Additionally, Defendants' claims about Prevagen rely on the theory that its dietary protein, apoaequorin, enters the human brain to supplement proteins that are lost during the aging process. However, Defendants do not have evidence showing that orally-administered apoaequorin can cross the human blood brain barrier and enter the brain. Rather, Defendants' studies show that apoaequorin is rapidly digested in the stomach and broken down into amino acids and small peptides like any other dietary protein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On April 6, 2017, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the following grounds: (1) the complaint fails adequately to allege that the representations in the advertising materials violate sections 5(a) and 12 of the FTC Act; (2) the complaint fails adequately to allege that the representations violate section 63(12) of the New York Executive Law and sections 349 and 350 of the New York General Business Law ; (3) the relief sought amounts to an unconstitutional restraint on commercial speech; (4) the action was commenced\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   as the FTC lacked a quorum to authorize it; (5) the court lacks personal jurisdiction over Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman; and (6) the complaint fails adequately to allege a claim for individual liability against Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 28, 2017, this court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim under the FTC Act, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the New York law claims, and did not address Defendants' other arguments. On April 15, 2019, the Second Circuit vacated that ruling and remanded to this court, stating \"We note that Defendants-Appellees have raised several grounds for affirmance that the district court did not consider. We express no opinion on these arguments, and the district court may consider them in the first instance on remand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss on those grounds, and have withdrawn their argument that this action constitutes an unconstitutional restraint on commercial speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This court now considers the remaining issues on the motions to dismiss: (1) the\n   validity of the FTC quorum, (2) personal jurisdiction over Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman, and (3) the individual liability of Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Validity of the FTC Quorum\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The FTC has five seats. When the FTC authorized this lawsuit, there were three appointed Commissioners and two vacant seats. Two Commissioners voted in favor of issuing the Complaint, and the third stated that she was \"not participating.\" Tabor Decl. (Dkt. No. 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants argue that a quorum of three Commissioners is required as a majority of the five \"members of the Commission.\" They argue that only two Commissioners voted, that a two-person quorum is invalid, and that this action was thus commenced\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The word \"quorum\" does not describe the number of votes. It defines the number of persons required to be present in order for the business of the meeting to be conducted. As defined in\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014), it is \"The smallest number of people who must be present at a meeting so that official decisions can be made; specif., the minimum number of members (a majority of all the members, unless otherwise specified in the governing documents) who must be present for a deliberative assembly to legally transact business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the case of the FTC, Rule 4.14(b) of its Procedures and Rules of Practice states, \"A majority of the members of the Commission in office and not recused from participating in a matter (by virtue of 18 U.S.C. 208 or otherwise) constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business in that matter.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053296\">\n    70 Fed.

That determination was well within the FTC's power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falcon Trading Group, Ltd. v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3697529,7636563\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/102/579/\">\n    102 F.3d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (dealing with identical situation at Securities Exchange Commission).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The three Commissioners present comprised the quorum: the \"number of people who must be present at a meeting so that official decisions can be made,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . The actual FTC voting record on the motion to approve the filing of the Complaint shows that none of the three Commissioners in office was absent; two voted in favor of issuing the Complaint, and the third stated that she was \"not participating.\" Tabor Decl. That voting was the conduct of the business; it was valid because there was a quorum to conduct it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In fact, the outcome would be the same even if the \"not participating\" member had voted against the filing of the Complaint: the majority vote of two to one would uphold it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Personal Jurisdiction Over Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that the court does not have personal jurisdiction over Mr. Underwood or Mr. Beaman because they are not residents of New York and have not engaged in any direct, personal business transactions in New York. Plaintiffs argue that the individual defendants' contacts with New York are irrelevant because section 13(b) of the FTC Act authorizes nationwide service and nationwide personal jurisdiction over Mr. Underwood and Mr. Beaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 13 of the FTC Act \"empowers this Court to grant injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent and remedy violations\n   of any provision of law enforced by the FTC and authorizes service in an action brought by the FTC wherever the defendant 'may be found.' \"\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. 1263523 Ontario, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9406039\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/205/205/#p208\">\n    205 F.

P. 4(k)(1)(C), \"Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant ... when authorized by a federal statute.\" Plaintiffs argue that because Congress provides for nationwide service of process wherever the defendant \"may be found\" under the FTC Act, it permits nationwide personal jurisdiction over defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dynegy Midstream Servs. v.

In support of that argument, Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Daniel v. Am.

The Second Circuit explained that the phrase \"in such cases\" \"plainly refers to those cases qualifying for venue in the immediately preceding clause,\" and \"It is 'in such cases,' i.e., such venued cases, that Section 12 makes worldwide service of process available.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1280352\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/428/408/#p423\">\n    428 F.3d at 423-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Second Circuit also distinguished the Clayton Act from the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\"RICO\") Act, which has a service of process provision that operates independently from the statute's venue provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   While Section 12 of the Clayton Act discusses venue and service of process in one sentence, RICO separates these provisions into non-sequential, lettered subsections.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2022\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201965\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (d). More important still is a textual difference between the two statutes. The language of RICO's service of process provision does not limit its application to \"such cases\" as are referred to in the statute's venue provision. Rather, in RICO, Congress specifically provides for the service of process provision to apply \"in any action or proceeding\n   <em>\n    under this chapter\n   </em>\n   ,\" that is, the chapter dealing with racketeering. Given that the Clayton Act served as a model for RICO, these language and structural differences between the two statutes in their treatment of venue and process only reinforce the conclusion that Congress was rendering independent under RICO concepts that it had plainly linked under Clayton Act Section 12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201965\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201965\">\n    at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The language in the FTC Act is similar to that of the RICO Act, not the Clayton Act. First, it does not discuss venue and service of process in the same sentence. Second, it does not limit the application of the service of process provision to \"such cases\" in which the venue provision is satisfied. Rather, it states that nationwide service can be effectuated \"in any suit under this section,\" which refers to section 13 of the FTC Act (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), which is the section of the statute dealing with false advertising, injunctions, and restraining orders. Because this action seeks injunctive and other relief for false advertising, it is a \"suit under this section,\" and the nationwide service provision applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because the FTC Act provides for nationwide service and nationwide personal jurisdiction, the relevant inquiry is not whether the individual defendants have minimum contacts with the state of New York but rather whether they have minimum contacts with the United States.

Underwood coordinates advertising claim language review with counsel, translates scientific data into marketing language, and directs research programs and activities. Underwood has appeared in infomercials aired nationwide, including in New York, touting Prevagen's memory improvement benefits and has co-authored studies on Prevagen. Underwood also authored the \"Brain Health Guide,\" a user guide disseminated nationwide, including in New York, that describes how Prevagen works and the purported science behind this dietary supplement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The statements that Mr. Underwood made final decisions on advertising claims, wrote advertising materials, and appeared in Prevagen advertisements sufficiently allege that Mr. Underwood participated directly in the alleged false advertising of Prevagen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The allegations that he directed the research, translated scientific data into marketing language, and wrote a user guide explaining the science behind Prevagen support an inference that he knew what the research and studies concluded and thus had knowledge of the deceptive nature of the advertisements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim for individual liability against Mark Underwood under both the FTC Act and New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Like Mr. Underwood, Mr. Beaman also has the authority to control the corporate defendants' advertising practices. He is a co-founder, former President, and current CEO of Quincy, Quincy Bioscience, LLC, and Prevagen, Inc. He is the Chair of the Board of Directors for Quincy Bioscience, LLC, Prevagen, Inc., and Quincy Bioscience Manufacturing, LLC. He is the second largest shareholder of Quincy, owning 22% of shares. He also pre-approved research proposals and reviewed the corporate defendants' advertising.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   However, the Complaint does not adequately allege that Mr. Beaman participated in the alleged deceptive acts or had knowledge of them. Other than its conclusory statement that Mr. Beaman \"participated in the acts and practices of Quincy ... including the acts and practices set forth in this Complaint,\" the Complaint merely alleges that he \"has given media interviews, signed research agreements, pre-approved research proposals, and reviewed Defendants' advertising.\" Those assertions are insufficient to show that he knew the results of the research or participated in the false advertising. Accordingly, the claims against Michael Beaman are dismissed, with leave to replead facts supporting an inference that he had knowledge of and participated in the alleged deceptive scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The motion to dismiss the Complaint with respect to the validity of the FTC quorum and against Mark Underwood are denied. The motion to dismiss the claims against Michael Beaman is granted, with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   So ordered.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
