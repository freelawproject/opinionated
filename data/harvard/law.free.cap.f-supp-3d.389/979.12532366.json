Compl. \u00b6 8, ECF No. 3-1 at 2.) The Divorce Decree provided, in part, that Betty \"waived her interest in [Gregory's] retirement accounts.

(1:18-cv-98, ECF No. 5.) In the Complaint filed in that case, the Plaintiffs alleged that Gregory \"executed a TSP-3 change of beneficiary form identifying Plaintiffs as the new beneficiaries of his TSP retirement account.\" (1:18-cv-98, Compl. \u00b6 17, ECF No. 2 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Hillary Diamond Evans, the Estate of Gregory C.

This case was given case number 2:18-cv-722 and was assigned to the undersigned on that day. (ECF No. 1.) Betty filed a Motion to Dismiss on that day as well. (ECF No. 3.)

In their Opposition, Plaintiffs provided that \"[f]or purposes of this litigation, Plaintiffs do not dispute Betty is the beneficiary of the TSP retirement account.\" (ECF No. 8 at 11.)
