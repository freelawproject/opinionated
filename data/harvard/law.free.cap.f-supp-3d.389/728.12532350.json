Ortiz also testified that \"once we saw certain people were better at certain tasks than others, we would assign them to that type of a task.\" (Meckley Decl., Ex. B, Ortiz Depo. at 80:25-81:3, 87:19-88:9, 89:11-90:12, 98:20-99:4.) He also conducted \"stand-up\" meetings at which he and the other employees discussed opportunities and challenges and which he sometimes used for coaching opportunities.

(Tr. at 9:3-13.) The Court concludes it is undisputed about that Ortiz engaged in tasks that normally would be considered \"managerial\" and, thus, exempt. However, Ortiz also testified that during his shift he would replace batteries, move pallets and boxes, \"work in the path,\" and do the same tasks Tier 1 associates were assigned, such as unloading and sorting and moving and staging racks for drivers. (Meckley Decl., Ex. B, Ortiz Depo. at 81:9-82:18.)

For example, the Ninth Circuit found that employees who spent 90% percent of their time on nonexempt duties fell within the scope of the executive exemption under the FLSA.\n    <em>\n     Baldwin v. Trailer Inns, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     266 F.3d 1104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1113-14 (9th Cir. 2001).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Baldwin,\n    </em>\n    the plaintiffs managed a trailer park and argued they were not exempt under the FLSA. The court stated that it would not presume the executive exemption failed \"where, as here, managerial duties are packaged in employment with non-managerial tasks, and the management function cannot readily and economically be separated from the nonexempt tasks.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     at 1114\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Therefore, the court weighed the other factors listed in the regulations. It determined that the evidence showed plaintiffs' \"principal value\" to the defendant \"was directing the day-to-day operations of the park,\" including being \"on-call twenty-four hours a day to handle emergencies and to exercise their managerial discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     at 1115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court reasoned those facts demonstrated the relative importance of the plaintiffs' managerial tasks in comparison to the manual labor they performed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     at 1114-15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The court also determined that the plaintiffs \"frequently had the power to exercise discretionary powers in their management of the park\" and did so without constant oversight from the owners. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs did have to adhere to company policies and to follow a checklist. Nonetheless, the court concluded the evidence regarding this factor weighed in favor of a finding that their primary duty was management.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     at 1115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Finally, the court found that plaintiffs earned more than non-exempt employees and were eligible for bonus compensation. The court determined those facts also weighed in favor of concluding that the plaintiffs' primary duty was management.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500609\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/266/1104/#p1113\">\n     at 1115-16\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Similarly, in the\n    <em>\n     Wilbur\n    </em>\n    case, the court concluded the plaintiff's \"primary duty\" was management.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203863700\">\n     2008 WL 3863700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7-*8. In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that the job description and statements on plaintiff's resume showed he engaged in managerial duties. The court also relied on the fact that plaintiff admitted that he observed and directed actions of other employees using his peripheral vision about fifty-percent of the time. The court reasoned that, although \"the percentage of time spent on non-exempt duties [was] of greater importance\" to the plaintiff's state law claims, plaintiff's admissions and \"other factors\" supported a finding that his primary duty was exempt work.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203863700\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203863700\">\n     2008 WL 3863700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.106\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) (setting forth example of assistant manager who serves customers, cooks food, stocks shelves and cleans establishment and noting that assistant manager could supervise employees and serve customers \"at the same time without losing the exemption,\" so long as \"the assistant manager's primary duty is management\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Ortiz's Job Description focused on managerial type duties, and he focused on those duties in the statements on his resume, to the exclusion of manual labor. Those facts support a conclusion that Ortiz's \"principal value\" to the Defendants, as in the\n    <em>\n     Baldwin\n    </em>\n    case, was his role in directing the Tier 1 associates. The record shows that Ortiz often was the only manager on duty at the delivery facilities. As in the\n    <em>\n     Wilbur\n    </em>\n    case, those facts demonstrate Ortiz was relatively free from direct supervision while he was on duty at the delivery facilities.\n    <em>\n     Wilbur\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%203863700\">\n     2008 WL 3863700\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8 (noting\n    that \"[p]laintiff was in charge of a given crew for the duration of his shift\"). The undisputed evidence also demonstrates that Ortiz was paid an annual salary of $ 68,500, or approximately $ 1,317 per week, whereas an entry level Tier-1 associate earned approximately $ 14.00 per hour.

Because the Court concludes Defendants have met their burden to prove each element of the executive exemption under the FLSA and concludes Ortiz has not overcome that showing, the Court GRANTS Defendants' motion on Ortiz's claim for overtime under the FLSA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS, IN PART, AND DENIES, IN PART, Defendants' motion for summary judgment.
