RAY, II, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case comes before the Court on Defendant Six Continents Hotels, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim [Doc 26]. For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 27, 2017, Plaintiff Valentine Communications, LLC (Valentine) filed its original complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against a non-existent entity. [Doc 1]. After its original filing, Valentine amended its complaint to name IHG Resources as a Defendant. [Doc 7]. IHG Resources filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, transfer the present case to this Court. [Doc 13]. Valentine consented to the transfer. [Doc 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the present case was transferred to this Court, Valentine amended its complaint to drop IHG Resources as a defendant and add Six Continents Hotels, Inc. (SCH) in its place. [Doc 22]. Thereafter, SCH filed the Motion to Dismiss that is presently before the Court. [Doc 26].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case concerns alleged patent infringement by SCH. In its Second Amended Complaint, Valentine alleges that SCH infringes two patents: United States Patent Nos. 8,567,672 (the '672 Patent) and 8,590,785 (the '785 Patent). [Doc 22 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11, 29-33]. Valentine asserts that SCH infringes Claim 18 of the '672 Patent and Claim 1 of the '785 Patent (the Asserted Claims). [Doc 22 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 33]. No other claim of either patent is at issue, and neither party identified any other claim that the Court should assess under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At their core, the Asserted Claims are directed to the same economic practice: the idea of presenting discounts or offers for goods and services based on certain criteria, such as a user's location. For example, the Background to the '672 Patent states: \"The present invention relates to an e-commerce multiple criteria buying\n   and selling methodology and more particularly to a method and apparatus of using the e-commerce multiple criteria buying and selling methodology to conduct business electronically.\" '672 Patent at 1:21-25. Likewise, the '785 Patent states: \"Briefly described, the subject disclosure pertains to systems and methods directed toward universal discount and demand aggregation.\" '785 Patent at 2:55-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Asserted Claim 18 of the '672 Patent is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having embodied thereon instructions executable by a processor, the instructions corresponding to a method for providing a discount to a user associated with a user device, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   receiving real-time location information of the user device when the user has consented to having information associated with the user device collected by a third party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   receiving user-defined criteria sent by the user device, wherein the criteria includes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a quantity of a product or service, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   at least one date range having a minimum value and a maximum value indicating a time period during which the product must be delivered to the user or the service must be performed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   receiving a discount offered by at least one seller, the discount including pricing information associated with a product or service offered by the seller and a quantity of the product or service available for delivery or performance within a given date range from the at least one date range;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   matching the discount to the user based on:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   the quantity of the product or service,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   the date range, wherein the date range matches one or more of the user-defined date ranges, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a location specified by the user, wherein the location indicates where the product will be delivered or the service will be performed regardless of the current location of the user or the mobile device;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   accessing by way of the user device an account with past transactional information and a stored payment method associated with the user; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   presenting the discount that requires the user to redeem the discount within a preset time period or based on availability of the product or service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Asserted Claim 1 of the '785 Patent is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A mobile device, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   a non-transitory computer readable storage medium having embodied thereon instructions executable by a processor to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   prompt a user to accept terms and conditions on the mobile device as a requirement to activate a service with at least one service provider, wherein the terms and conditions provide notice to the user regarding:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   how information collected by way of the mobile device will be used,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   how the information collected by way of the mobile device will be protected, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   the fact that collection of at least some of the information by way of\n   the mobile device cannot be blocked by the user,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   generate purchasing data associated with the user that includes information about products or services purchased by way of a credit or debit card;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   a location-based service module executable to generate location-based data, wherein the location-based data corresponds to activities associated with the user of the mobile device; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   a wireless transmitter that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   transmits the location-based data to a third party,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   automatically transmits at least a subset of the purchasing data, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   receives an offer for the product or service in response to the transmission of the subset of purchasing data and in accordance with a search function that allows the user to input location and delivery time criteria associated with the product or service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Stripped of verbiage, the patents claim a fundamental economic practice and a way to conduct business electronically. Specifically, Claim 18 of the '672 Patent uses a \"non-transitory computer-readable storage medium,\" such as a hard drive, with instructions to be executed via a computer processor to (i) receive a user's location; (ii) receive buying criteria from a user, including the quantity of a product or service and the date range of delivery; (iii) receive a discount from a seller with specified selling criteria including price, quantity, and the date range of availability; (iv) match buyers and sellers based on quantity, date range, and location; (v) access a user's account with stored payment and past transactional information; and (vi) present a discount to the user that expires at a certain time or based on product availability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Claim 1 of the '785 Patent recites a mobile device that comprises (i) a \"non-transitory computer readable storage medium\" with instructions executable by a computer processor to prompt a user to accept terms and conditions and generate purchase data for the user about products or services that have been purchased by a credit card; (ii) a \"location-based service module\" to generate location data relating to the user; and (iii) a wireless transmitter that transmits the location-based data and a subset of the purchasing data, and receives an offer for the product or service in response to the transmission of the purchase data, in accordance with a user search function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Both patent specifications make clear that no non-conventional hardware or software is necessary to implement these processes and, instead, propose a generalized means of realizing the claims. Specifically, the '672 Patent discloses that \"[i]t is to be appreciated that\n   <em>\n    any programming methodology and/or computer architecture suitable for carrying out the present invention\n   </em>\n   may be employed........\" '672 Patent at 25:28-31 (emphasis added). The '672 Patent also discloses that \"the present invention may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture\n   <em>\n    using standard programming and/or engineering techniques\n   </em>\n   to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 6:65-7:1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   More specifically, to implement the abstract business idea of the '672 Patent, Claim 18 uses a standard hard drive (\"computer readable storage medium\") and a computer processor to conduct conventional computing functionality-such as receiving data, matching data, accessing data, and then presenting data. The '672 Patent describes \"computer readable media\n   [that] can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips.....), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD) ...), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 7:5-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the '785 Patent adds additional components, the specification also describes them as standard components. Specifically, Claim 1 of the '785 Patent recites a \"mobile device\" with a \"non-transitory computer readable storage medium\" (to store program instructions), a \"processor\" (to process data), a \"location-based service module\" (to generate location data) and a \"wireless transmitter\" (to transmit data). The '785 Patent specification states \"all or portions of the subject innovation may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article of manufacture\n   <em>\n    using standard programming and/or engineering techniques\n   </em>\n   to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement the disclosed innovation.\" '785 Patent at 20:28-33 (emphasis added). The '785 Patent also states the \"Internet has been a delivery tool to provide these solutions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at 5:39-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As with the '672 Patent, the '785 Patent specification generically describes each of the components specified by Valentine's asserted claim.

[Doc 26-2 at 1]. Reduced to its conceptual essence, SCH argues that Claim 18 of the '672 Patent comprises a hard drive with instructions executed by a processor to (i) receive a user's location; (ii) receive buying criteria from a user, including the quantity of a product or service and the date range of delivery; (iii) receive discount information from a seller, including selling criteria; (iv) match the buyer's and seller's criteria; (v) access past transactional and stored payment information; and (vi) provide a time-sensitive discount for those products or services. [Doc 26-2 at 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   SCH also argues that the Asserted Claim of the '785 Patent is a mobile device that comprises computer storage that (i) prompts a user to accept terms and conditions and generates purchase data; (ii) transmits information about a user's purchases, location, and delivery time criteria; and (iii) receives an offer for products or services in response. [Doc 26-2 at 6-10]. In view of these claims, SCH argues, both of Valentine's patents are directed to the abstract idea of offering goods and services based on buying and selling criteria, including a customer's actual or desired location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On the other hand, relying on the Federal Circuit's holdings from\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, Valentine argues that the Asserted Claims cover patent eligible subject matter because they \"are rooted in computer technology and improvements to a technological process.\" [Doc 29 at 11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court disagrees with Valentine's characterization of the claims as \"rooted\" in computer technology. The Asserted Claims of the '672 and '785 Patents are directed to the economic and business practice of presenting discounts or offers for goods and services based on certain criteria, such as a user's location. In its briefing, Valentine characterized its patents as disclosing \"a method of providing a discount to a user associated with a user device that utilizes consumer location information\" ( '672 Patent) and a \"method for transacting business electronically\" ( '785 Patent). [Doc 29 at 2]. When asked to describe the '672 and '785 Patents at oral argument, Valentine also described each in economic terms: as either a \"virtual deal room\" or a way to match buying and selling criteria to provide aggregate offers of goods and services to customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Moreover, the Asserted Claims do not \"overcome[ ] a problem specifically arising in the realm of computer networks,\" as Valentine contends. [Doc 29 at 2]. The purpose of the Asserted Claims is not to provide a technical solution to a technical problem; rather, it is to address economic issues using what both patents describe as \"standard programming and/or engineering techniques.\" '672 Patent at 6:66-67; '785 Patent at 20:30-31. Neither the patents, nor Valentine in its briefs or at oral argument, actually identify a technical problem that the Asserted Claims attempted to solve. Likewise, while Valentine claims its invention improves an existing technological process, neither Valentine nor its patents identify what that process is or how it was improved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To the contrary, the Asserted Claims show the claimed components provide a forum in which to practice the abstract idea of buying and selling based on certain criteria. Valentine characterizes its patents as providing an economic solution when it states the patents are \"directed to an improvement in the art whereby users of the inventions are given the opportunity to choose among buying and selling criteria.\" [Doc 29 at 15]. The Asserted Claims are consistent with that economic description. Claim 18 of the '672 Patent, for example, covers \"instructions\" that are run on a standard computer processor, where each \"instruction\" is just the receiving, processing, or presenting of information. Those steps collectively implement the abstract economic idea of offering a good or service to a customer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '627 Patent at 1:21-25. They are not directed to an improved technical process, such as a better way to receive, process, or present information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The other Asserted Claim, Claim 1 of the '785 Patent, covers conventional technology that Valentine does not claim to have invented: (i) a \"non-transitory computer readable storage medium\" (e.g., a hard drive); (ii) a \"processor\"; (iii) a \"location-based service module\" (e.g., GPS); and (iv) a \"wireless transmitter\" (e.g., a cell phone antenna). '785 Patent at 22:44-23:8. These components are not being improved by the Asserted Claim; instead, they are acting as a tool to execute the economic practice of offering goods or services to customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Thus, both of the Asserted Claims are abstract because they use standard computing equipment to conduct economic practices rather than improve that computing equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mobile Telecomms. Techs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346159\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/173/1324/#p1330\">\n    173 F.

Whether the Patents Contain an \"Inventive Concept\" (Alice Step II)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because the Court has found that the patents concern an abstract idea, the Court turns to the second step of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   test. This step asks whether the patents disclose an \"inventive concept\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that although the patent claims an abstract idea the patent claim in practice \"amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%20208\">\n    573 U.S. at 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and alternations omitted). \"Simply reciting 'the performance of some business practice known from the pre-Internet world along with the requirement to perform it on the Internet' or a computer is insufficient to transform an abstract idea into an inventive concept.\"\n   <em>\n    TAGI Ventures, LLC v.

For example, the '672 Patent acknowledges that \"any programming methodology and/or computer architecture suitable for carrying out the present invention may be employed....\" '672 Patent at 25:28-31. The '672 Patent also states that \"the\n   <em>\n    present invention\n   </em>\n   may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture\n   <em>\n    using standard programming and/or engineering techniques\n   </em>\n   to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.\" '672 Patent at 6:65-7:1 (emphasis added). Likewise, the '785 Patent specification states that \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   or portions\n   <em>\n    of the subject innovation\n   </em>\n   may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article of manufacture\n   <em>\n    using standard programming and/or engineering techniques\n   </em>\n   to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement the disclosed innovation.\" '785 Patent at 20:28-33 (emphasis added). The '785 patent also states the \"Internet has been a delivery tool to provide these solutions.\" '785 Patent at 5:39-43. In other words, both patent specifications admit that the computer components used to carry out the claimed invention are well-known, conventional, and routine components.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v.
