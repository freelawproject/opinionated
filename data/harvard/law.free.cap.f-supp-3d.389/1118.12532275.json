Romaguera (\"Sgt. Romaguera\")'s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") (D.E. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   THE COURT has reviewed the Motion and pertinent parts of the record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Motion is granted as to the sole federal claim, and the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 8, 2018, Plaintiff Chantal Georges\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this action\n   against Sgt. Romaguera and the City of Miami Gardens (the \"City\"), based on the events of July 12, 2016. D.E. 1. The City was dismissed from the case on July 5, 2018. D.E. 34. And Plaintiff consented to dismissal of Count III of the operative Amended Complaint (D.E. 24) (the \"Complaint\"). D.E. 29 at *3; D.E. 35. The remaining counts against Sgt. Romaguera are: (1) a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   premised on an alleged Fourth Amendment violation [Count I]; (2) a claim for assault and battery under Florida law [Count II]; and (3) a claim for false imprisonment under Florida law [Count IV].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his Motion, Sgt. Romaguera asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment on Count I because the \u00a7 1983 claim is barred by qualified immunity and, alternatively, Plaintiff has not stated a Fourth Amendment violation. He also asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment on Count IV because Plaintiff had reasonable means of escape from the hotel in which she was allegedly falsely imprisoned. Sgt. Romaguera does not seek summary judgment on Count II. However, he also seeks a summary judgment ruling as to Plaintiff's present and future damages, based on Plaintiff's deposition testimony disclaiming any mental distress or emotional injury because of Sgt. Romaguera's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Motion is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. EVIDENTIARY DISPUTES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Sgt. Romaguera correctly notes that \"Plaintiff did not file a statement of material facts comporting with Local Rule 56.1.\" D.E. 94 at 1. Local Rule 56.1 requires a party opposing summary judgment to file an opposing statement of material facts that corresponds with the order and paragraph numbering scheme used in the movant's statement of material facts. S.D. Fla. L.R. 56.1(a). \"Additional facts which the party opposing summary judgment contends are material shall be numbered and placed at the end of the opposing party's statement of material facts; the movant shall use that numbering scheme if those additional facts are addressed in the reply.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rule 56.1's \"clear procedural directive is intended to reduce confusion and prevent the Court from having to scour the record and perform time-intensive fact searching. The rule thus reflects a clear policy that it is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   the court's obligation to scour the record for a factual dispute that precludes summary judgment. Rather, it is the nonmovant's obligation to specifically bring the factual dispute to the court's attention by rebutting the movant's factual statements on a paragraph by paragraph basis and with specific citations to the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Joseph v.

As a result, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e) and Local Rule 56.1(b), the Court disregards these facts.

Even if Sgt. Romaguera failed to give Plaintiff a room key to the hotel room, nothing reasonably stopped Plaintiff from leaving. Plaintiff argues that she \"had no place\" else \"to go,\" D.E. 92 at *12, but this is similar to the kind of bus encounter addressed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Drayton\n   </em>\n   . \"A bus rider's movements are confined in this sense, but this is the natural result of choosing to take the bus; it says nothing about whether the police conduct is coercive.\"\n   <em>\n    Drayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p203\">\n    536 U.S. at 201-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254966\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/194/#p203\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, if Plaintiff stayed in the hotel room because she needed a place to stay, that was the natural result of her living arrangement; it says nothing about whether Sgt. Romaguera's conduct was coercive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff argues that she was \"ordered\" to stay in the room, D.E. 92 at *12, but no record evidence supports this. To the contrary, Plaintiff herself testified: \"He said, if you are not going to have sex with me, I will give you until Wednesday. Wednesday you need to get out.\" Plaintiff's Dep. at 82:1-3;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:13-15 (\"He told me, I'll give you until Wednesday for you to get out - leave the hotel because I didn't want to have sex with him.\"). This was permission to stay until Wednesday, not an authoritative command to not leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   And no reasonable juror could find a genuine dispute in Plaintiff's claim that she was somehow locked inside the hotel room. Plaintiff has not explained how it is that she came to be locked in. To the contrary, she has testified that she \"didn't know how to open the door because...[Sgt. Romaguera] was the one with the key,\" and that even if she had a key, she would not have been able to figure out how to open the door from the inside: \"because the place to\n   insert the card was on the outside. So even if there had been a key, I would not have been able to open the door to leave.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Dep. at 91:23-92:24. Any reasonable fact-finder with experience in a hotel room knows that while a room key is needed to get into the hotel from the outside, no key is needed to get out from the inside. Plaintiff's subjective, mistaken belief that she could not leave is not an objective seizure. She has not stated a Fourth Amendment violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    The unwanted groping does not rise to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To reiterate, Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claim rests only on the unreasonable seizure prong of the Fourth Amendment. As to Sgt.

However, the physical contact \"did not show an objective purpose to restrain [the plaintiff's] freedom of movement beyond the instant of contact.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, no seizure occurred.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Sgt.

Further, Plaintiff did not yield to Sgt. Romaguera's show of authority with respect to the groping. She expressly told him to stop, and he did-leaving the hotel room moments later.
