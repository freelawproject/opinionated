Newman, United States Magistrate Judge\n   This is a Social Security disability benefits appeal for which the parties have consented to entry of final judgment. At issue is whether the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") erred in finding Plaintiff not \"disabled\" and therefore unentitled to Disability Insurance Benefits (\"DIB\"). This case is before the Court on Plaintiff's Statement of Errors (doc. 11), the Commissioner's memorandum in opposition (doc. 13), Plaintiff's reply (doc. 14), the administrative record (doc. 7),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the record as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The ALJ issued a written decision on December 22, 2017 finding Plaintiff not disabled. PageID 57-67. Specifically, the ALJ found at Step Five that, based upon Plaintiff's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform work at all exertional levels but with certain non-exertional limitations, \"there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that [Plaintiff] can perform[.]\" PageID 61-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, the Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's non-disability finding the final administrative decision of the Commissioner.

PageID 542. On March 3, 2017, Dr. Songer found that, due to her impairments, Plaintiff had \"marked\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    limitations in areas of concentration, persistence, or maintaining pace, including \"the ability to ignore or avoid distractions while working\"; in areas of adapting or managing oneself; in relating to and working with supervisors, co-workers, and the public; in the ability to focus attention on work activities and to stay on task at a sustained rate; and in the ability to regulate her emotions, control her behavior, and maintain well-being in a work setting. PageID 542-43. Dr. Songer ultimately determined that Plaintiff would not be able to perform regular full-time work without missing work more than two times per month, being off-task 15% of the workday, or needing additional breaks due to her impairments. PageID 543.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    On May 25, 2017, Dr. Songer authored a second opinion on Plaintiff's mental impairments. In this second opinion, he identified similar signs and symptoms, including \"difficulty thinking or concentrating,\" \"mood disturbances,\" and \"hostility and irritability.\"\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    PageID 541\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    PageID 560. Though there are some discrepancies in his second opinion, Dr. Songer continued to opine that Plaintiff had \"marked\" limitations in areas of concentration, persistence, or maintaining pace; in areas of adapting or managing oneself; in relating to and working with supervisors, co-workers, and the public; in the ability to focus attention on work activities and to stay on task at a sustained rate; and in the ability to regulate her emotions, control her behavior, and maintain well-being in a work setting. PageID 561-62. Dr. Songer also confirmed his opinion that Plaintiff would not be able to perform regular full-time work without missing work more than two times per month, being off-task 15% of the workday, or needing additional breaks due to her impairments. PageID 562.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The ALJ determined that Dr. Songer's treating opinions were not entitled to \"controlling weight,\" but rather afforded \"little weight to [his] opinions.\" PageID 64. In so doing, the ALJ found that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n    [T]hese opinions are inconsistent with the medical record as a whole, including the claimant's mostly unremarkable reported symptoms to treating sources such as Dr. Songer, without evidence of hallucinations, delusions, obsessions, compulsions, cognitive disorder, current suicidal/homicidal ideation, or other serious issues, her positive response to psychiatric medications and treatment, and her mostly normal activities of daily living. Finally, there is no explanation for the change in functioning between the two assessments that were completed two months apart, with Dr. Songer concluding that the claimant was less limited in certain areas in the second assessment, and more limited in other areas.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20506979\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The undersigned finds multiple errors in the ALJ's assessment.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    First, while the ALJ purports to contrast Dr. Songer's opinion against Plaintiff's \"unremarkable\" reported systems, the record does not support such an assertion. Indeed, Dr. Songer's treatment notes are replete with Plaintiff's subjective complaints and objective findings that are consistent with his opinion. For example, Dr. Songer observed that Plaintiff had a depressed, anxious, or irritable mood and affect at nearly every treatment session.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    PageID 497, 503, 507, 513, 516, 526,\n    527, 533, 536, 545, 550, 555, 566, 577, 583, 589, 592, 598. Dr. Songer also noted that Plaintiff \"remains emotionally labile\u2026[is] very verbally impulsive\"; she \"remains anxious, impulsive, volatile\"; her \"depression remains a major issue\"; she is \"easily distractible, very impulsive\"; \"too much contact even with family does not go well [and she] reacts poorly to environmental stimulus\"; and she has an \"irritable edge\u2026exacerbated with social contacts.\" PageID 536, 545, 550, 555, 566, 575. In concluding that Plaintiff had no other \"serious issues\" the ALJ also seemingly overlooked that Plaintiff reported two different instances of road rage, one of which led to an arrest, and that her therapist recommended she take medical leave from her prior job to cope with her symptoms. PageID 431, 510, 545.

While treatment did alleviate some of Plaintiff's symptoms, the record demonstrates that she nevertheless continued to suffer from distractibility, depression, and anxiety. Specifically, Dr. Songer's treatment notes state \"Adderall seems to calm [her] a bit but not sufficiently when placed in the wrong situation\"; she \"was doing well today but had a major meltdown yesterday\"; \"ADD symptoms helped by Adderall but distractibility and poor focus are daily issues\"; \"ADD medicine helps to a certain degree, but residual symptoms remain prominent\"; \"depression mostly well controlled, though can break down with minimal provocation\"; a noted \"depressed\" mood despite that she \"was doing well\"; and \"anxiety has dissipated to a large degree as well, but is far from absent.\" PageID 501, 533, 545, 550, 555,575, 592.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Thus, the ALJ erred in selectively focusing on Plaintiff's improvement and in conflating her improvement with an ability to perform full-time work on a sustained basis.\n    <em>\n     Hawthorne v.
