Citing the Eleventh Circuit's recent published opinion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    916 F.3d 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019), Mr. Curry argues that the mandate is no longer viable and that a different result is required in his case. The Government maintains that\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   does not apply and that the Court must follow the mandate, requiring Mr. Curry to return to prison for the last fifteen years of his original sentence. After careful review of the record,\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , and the parties' arguments,\n   the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   applies and that Mr. Curry meets the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   standard. For the reasons stated below, the Court finds the most judicious approach is to grant Mr. Curry's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which held that the ACCA's residual clause was unconstitutional. On July 1, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit granted leave, finding that Mr. Curry could only have two qualifying ACCA offenses, the Georgia assault conviction and the Florida drug conviction, and thus he made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that the Court may have relied on the ACCA's residual clause. [Case No. 16-13231, Order Granting Application, at 7 (11th Cir.).]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Curry filed his Amended \u00a7 2255 Motion on September 1, 2016 asserting his burglary convictions no longer qualified as ACCA crimes of violence and that his Georgia conviction for aggravated assault may have been improperly counted as multiple ACCA offenses. [DE 10; DE 11.] On October 14, 2016, the Magistrate Judge's Report recommended granting the Motion on two bases: (1) Mr. Curry met the burden of proof outlined in\n   <em>\n    In re Chance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4349672\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/1335/\">\n    831 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2016), requiring a showing that the sentencing judge\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   have used the residual clause;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Florida burglary no longer qualified under the ACCA because Florida defines \"burglary\" more broadly than the ACCA's enumerated clause. [DE 14.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Court's Order Granting the \u00a7 2255\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 30, 2016, this Court granted Mr. Curry's \u00a7 2255 Motion, finding he met the\n   <em>\n    In re Chance\n   </em>\n   standard and that there was a \"reasonable likelihood\" his sentence was \"in fact\" based on the residual clause. [DE 16 at 7 n.8.] The Court noted that because there was long-standing precedent that Florida burglary encompassed both generic and non-generic burglary, courts were required to articulate a reason for enhancing a sentence under the enumerated clause. [\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the December 21, 2016 re-sentencing, the Court considered that Mr. Curry had no disciplinary actions, held responsible work positions, finished his GED, ministered spiritually to others, and obtained a culinary degree. [CR-DE 104, Sent. Tr., 8:11-20.] Because Mr. Curry had a Criminal History Category III, the guideline range was 111-123 months' imprisonment. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   4:22-25; 5:1-4.] Thus, because Mr. Curry had already served 139 months and 27 days, the Court re-sentenced him to time served with a six-year term of supervised release.

United States\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the Government appealed the granting of the \u00a7 2255 Motion. [DE 99.] On September 22, 2017, before the Government's reply was due, the Eleventh Circuit issued\n   <em>\n    Beeman v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266600\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1215/\">\n    871 F.3d 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017), which rejected\n   <em>\n    In re Chance\n   </em>\n   and required a movant to show it was more likely than not that the sentence was based\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on the residual clause as a historical fact. On March 2, 2018, without oral argument, the Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded to dismiss the \u00a7 2255 Motion holding that Mr. Curry did not meet the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   standard because the record was silent as to the basis for the ACCA enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Curry v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414053\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/714/968/\">\n    714 F. App'x 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 7, 2018, this Court entered a Notice to the Parties clarifying that the undersigned-who sentenced Mr. Curry-used the residual clause at his sentencing. [DE 25.] The Court's practice was to apply an enhancement based on the enumerated clause\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   it was readily determined that the enumerated clause applied. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.] If not, then the Court used the residual clause because of its broad language. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Court would have detailed its reasoning on the record prior to the Eleventh Circuit's opinion if the Government had lodged a more than general objection at the 2016 re-sentencing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.] In light of the general objection, and because, prior to\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , the law did not require a specific basis to be articulated when applying the residual clause, the Court had no need to explain its reasoning. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 13, 2018, Mr. Curry sought rehearing in the Eleventh Circuit, citing this Court's Notice to the Parties. He argued that the Eleventh Circuit misapplied\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , and requested a remand for further findings if the record was unclear. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition, at 7, 19 (Case No. 17-10822, 11th Cir.).] Without mentioning the Notice\n   to the Parties, the Eleventh Circuit denied the request in a one-page Order on May 22, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 25, 2018, Mr. Curry moved to stay the Eleventh Circuit's mandate due to the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. Although the Government opposed, the Eleventh Circuit issued a stay on May 31, 2018. On August 20, 2018, Mr. Curry filed his Petition with the Supreme Court, which the Government opposed. The Petition was denied on January 7, 2019. The Eleventh Circuit's mandate issued on January 9, 2019. [ (Case No. 17-10822).] On February 20, 2019, before this Court was able to carry out the mandate, the Eleventh Circuit published\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In answering this question, the Eleventh Circuit applied the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   \"historical fact\" test by looking at the record and caselaw at the time of sentencing. It found the record was silent and that the caselaw showed the convictions \"almost certainly qualified\" under the residual clause, but there were \"no firm answers\" about the elements clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 964-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Faced with this uncertainty, the\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   court was unable to conclude that the district court\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   relied on the residual clause and thus found the defendant failed to meet the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   burden of proof.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   However, the Eleventh Circuit remanded the case to allow the parties to address the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   standard since that decision was issued after the defendant was resentenced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In directing the district court to apply\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged the sentencing judge was \"obviously in a better position\" to evaluate what happened at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Resolving this conundrum requires the Court to not follow controlling law, in one way or another. The law of the case doctrine is well-established and operates to create finality, and a district court has an obligation to carry out an appellate court's mandate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Both district courts granted \u00a7 2255 relief applying the\n   <em>\n    In re Chance\n   </em>\n   standard. Mr. Curry's case went further however, because the Court stated that there was a reasonable likelihood that he also met the\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   standard. [DE 16 at 7 n.8.] Mr. Curry and Mr. Pickett had served over a decade in prison prior to being re-sentenced to time served. The government appealed both cases prior to\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   ; neither defendant was able to present a\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   argument to the district court. Thus, up until the appellate level, the cases were procedurally identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Therefore, in continuing to determine whether the cases are distinguishable, the Court will ascertain whether the reasoning and holding in\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   apply to Mr. Curry's case. The Eleventh Circuit's decision to remand\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   was based on two grounds: (1) the parties' lack of opportunity to address\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   at the district court, and (2) the inability of the Eleventh Circuit to ascertain what the judge had in mind at sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    916 F.3d at 961, 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mr. Curry Had Less of a Chance to Address\n    <em>\n     Beeman\n    </em>\n    Than Mr. Pickett\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As to the first ground, Mr. Curry, just like Mr. Pickett, did not have an opportunity to be heard on\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   at the district court level. However, Mr. Pickett was able to address\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   in his response to the Eleventh Circuit. [Answer, Case No. 17-13476 (11th Cir. Mar. 20, 2018).] Mr. Curry, on the other hand, had already filed his response in the Eleventh Circuit when\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   issued, so while the Government was able to address\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   in its reply, Mr. Curry was only able to address\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   in his petition for rehearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Reply,\n   Case No. 17-10822 (11th Cir. Oct. 23, 2017); Petition for Rehearing, Case No. 17-10822 (11th Cir. Apr. 13, 2018).] Therefore, if Mr. Pickett was not sufficiently heard despite including\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   in his response to the Eleventh Circuit, it follows that Mr. Curry was not sufficiently heard on\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , even more so than Mr. Pickett.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mr. Curry's Sentencing Judge's Thought Process Shows Use of Residual Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The second ground for remand in\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   was because the appellate court was unable to determine the district court's thought process. In trying to make this determination, the Eleventh Circuit applied the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   \"historical fact\" test, looking to the record and caselaw at the time of sentencing to discern what the district court had in mind.\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    916 F.3d at 961, 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking to determine if a conviction\n   <em>\n    only qualified\n   </em>\n   under the residual clause, but rather, what the sentencing judge \"actually had in mind.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the silent record and the uncertain caselaw at the time of sentencing, the Eleventh Circuit remanded because the sentencing judge was in a \"better position than we are to evaluate what likely happened.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like Mr. Pickett, Mr. Curry did not have the benefit of this Court's thought process prior to his appeal. The record was silent at that time, and no explanation by the sentencing judge had been given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , because the undersigned was Mr. Curry's sentencing judge, the Court will explain what it \"actually had in mind\" when it sentenced Mr. Curry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   When initially sentencing Mr. Curry, the undersigned applied the residual clause to enhance Mr. Curry's sentence. The Court routinely relied on the residual clause whenever it was not readily determined that the enumerated clause applied. Moreover, the record was silent at the time of sentencing because the law did not require the Court to specify a basis for applying the residual clause. A judge only had to articulate its basis when using the enumerated clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9437095\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/290/1341/#p1347\">\n    290 F.3d 1341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1347 (11th Cir. 2002). No such basis was put on the record here because the Court determined Mr. Curry's convictions did not readily qualify under the enumerated clause, and thus, the Court used the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   By now placing its reasoning on the record, this Court has answered the main inquiry in\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , which was to determine what the district court had in mind, and as such, an analysis of the record and caselaw is not necessary. However, because the controlling authority exception to the mandate rule requires the Court to determine if\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   is indistinguishable from Mr. Curry's case, the Court will review the record and the caselaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Both Cases have an Unclear Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In trying to determine the district court's thought process, the\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   court first considered the record. In\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , the parties agreed that there was nothing in\n   the record to tell the court which clause the district court \"had in mind\" when it applied the ACCA enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    916 F.3d at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly the parties in Mr. Curry's case do not dispute that the original sentencing record was silent. Therefore, both cases have an unclear record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Caselaw in Both Cases Unclear\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit next reviewed the caselaw at the time of Mr. Pickett's sentencing to determine what the district court had in mind and found Mr. Pickett's convictions \"almost certainly\" qualified under the residual clause, though \"no binding precedent said as much at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520239\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/916/960/\">\n    at 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

[DE 16 at 7]. At those times, Florida burglary was defined as \"entering or remaining in a structure\n   <em>\n    or conveyance\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20810.02\">\n    Fla.

Thus, looking at the plain language of the Florida statute, because Florida burglary was broader than the generic offense, this Court found that not every Florida burglary conviction would qualify under the enumerated clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Yet, the Government maintains that Florida burglary always qualified under the enumerated clause and takes out of context the statement in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The uncertainty in the law at that time is underscored by the changes in the law shortly after Mr. Curry's sentencing. A week after Mr. Curry was sentenced, the Eleventh Circuit found\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   Florida burglary only qualified under the residual clause, and in 2006, held that Florida third-degree burglary qualified under the residual clause.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If the law was clear, those published decisions would not have been necessary. Therefore, just like Mr. Pickett's case, the caselaw at sentencing was unclear regarding whether Mr. Curry's burglary convictions qualified under the enumerated clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Based on the uncertain caselaw in\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit found Mr. Pickett did not meet the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   burden, but remanded the case to give the parties a chance to meet\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   by showing what the sentencing judge was thinking. Similarly,\n   the Eleventh Circuit found Mr. Curry did not meet his\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   burden. Therefore, because the present Motion is at the district court level and before the original sentencing judge, the Court will determine if Mr. Curry meets his\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   burden by setting out the ACCA analysis it undertook in sentencing Mr. Curry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

If he had not pled guilty, the Court would have had to review Mr. Curry's 1985 indictment for burglary, his 1989 indictment for burglary, and the jury instructions provided in 1985 and 1989. If he had pled guilty, the Court would have had to review the terms of the charging document and his plea agreement, a plea colloquy transcript, or some other comparable judicial record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, the Government provided none of these documents to the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   They were not in the record at the time of Mr. Curry's sentencing and are still not in the record. Accordingly, they have never been reviewed by the Court.

Therefore, the absence\n   of these documents in the record establishes as a matter of historical fact that the undersigned used the residual clause in sentencing Mr. Curry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is a direct conflict in the outcomes for Mr. Pickett and for Mr. Curry. Both had a silent record, unclear caselaw at the time of initial sentencing, new sentences entered prior to\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , appellate findings that they did not meet\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   , and no opportunity to address\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   - Mr. Curry more so than Mr Pickett. Yet, one case was remanded for dismissal and the other remanded for further proceedings. Mr. Curry is in a more compelling situation than Mr. Pickett because this Court's 2016 Order granting the \u00a7 2255 Motion stated there was a reasonable probability that he would meet the higher standard\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   adopted, and as this Order establishes, Mr. Pickett does indeed meet the\n   <em>\n    Beeman\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although the Court recognizes its responsibility to enforce the Eleventh Circuit's mandate in Mr. Curry's case, it cannot ignore the Eleventh Circuit's decision to publish\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   . The Eleventh Circuit puts careful thought into selecting cases with the most precedential value for publication because its policy is to use \"imaginative and innovative resourcefulness\" to \"reduce the volume of published opinions,\" and therefore, \"opinions the panel believes to have no precedential value are not published.\" 11th Cir. I.O.P. 36. Thus, the Eleventh Circuit's deliberate decision to give\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   precedential value by its choice to publish it must be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit's emphasis in\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   was what the district court actually had in mind. The undersigned recognizes that the Notice to the Parties detailing her thought process was entered outside of the record on appeal. Thus, although Mr. Curry's petition for rehearing mentioned the Notice, the Eleventh Circuit was under no obligation to review it and it is not mentioned in its one-page denial. Additionally, the Government specifically asked the Supreme Court to not consider the Notice, and in its denial, the Supreme Court did not comment on the Notice. As such, the record is not clear that any higher court ever reviewed or considered the Notice. Given the weight placed by\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   on the state of mind of the sentencing judge, the undersigned is troubled that potentially no court has taken its reasoning into consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds itself in a difficult situation. While following the mandate is the easiest path to follow, that path has been blocked by the publishing of\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   , which is undeniably similar to Mr. Curry's case and this Court cannot find any significant difference between the two. As such, the only option available to the Court to ensure that Mr. Curry's case is given a full review, particularly in light of the weight\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   places on the sentencing judge's mindset and the historical facts that prove that this Court relied on the residual clause, is to grant Mr. Curry's Motion to ensure the correct application of\n   the law to Mr. Curry's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Pickett\n   </em>\n   is intervening controlling authority that specifically and unquestionably applies, this Court is authorized to decline to enforce the mandate and therefore it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   ORDERED THAT Movant's Motion for Relief from Mandate [DE 36] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   DONE AND ORDERED in Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    10\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of May, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The resulting guideline range was 262 to 327 months plus a mandatory sixty-month consecutive term for Count 3.
