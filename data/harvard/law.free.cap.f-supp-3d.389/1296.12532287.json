If, on the other hand, the printing is not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods, then the goods should be classified as \"Other printed matter\" under subheading 4911.99.80, HTSUS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court first construes the words of the tariff to discern its meaning. The relevant language of Note 2 to Section VII presupposes that the subject goods will have a function, and that to fall under Chapter 49, the printing will be more than merely incidental in relation to that function. The words \"to the primary use\" in Note 2 link the \"incidental\" inquiry to the function of the goods. To fall under Chapter 49, HTSUS, the printing may be the primary function or use of the goods, or it may be something less than, or subordinate to, that primary use, but it cannot be merely incidental to that primary use. Thus, the court construes the tariff provisions in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Printing that is \"not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods\" as referenced in Note 2 means any printing that is not of minor importance or not unimportant in relation to something else. Indeed, \"incidental\" means something of lesser or secondary importance, or a minor accompaniment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   794 (J.A.

Occurring or likely to occur as an unpredictable or minor accompaniment. 2. Of a minor, casual, or subordinate nature:\n   <em>\n    incidental expenses\n   </em>\n   .);\n   <em>\n    Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1350 (Oxford University Press 6th Ed. 2007) (\n   <em>\n    Incidental\n   </em>\n   : 1. Liable to happen to; naturally attaching\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   . 2. Occurring as something casual or of secondary importance; not directly relevant\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   ; following (\n   <em>\n    up\n   </em>\n   )\n   <em>\n    on\n   </em>\n   as a subordinate circumstance.) (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1142 (Philip Babcock Gove, Ph. D. &amp; Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff eds., 2002) (\n   <em>\n    Incidental\n   </em>\n   : subordinate, nonessential, or attendant in position or significance ....). These definitions convey both that an incidental happening is one that has a relationship to something else (\"subordinate\" or \"in conjunction\" or \"attaching to\") and that, in comparison, its significance is minor (\"minor\" or \"nonessential\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Printing in the context of Chapter 49 is of minor importance or unimportant when it does not relate to the essence of the product. Heading 4911, HTSUS encompasses \"Other printed matter,\" a phrase that is broad. Note 2, however, limits the heading by excluding printed matter where the printing is merely incidental (or of minor importance relative to something else). The General Explanatory Note to Chapter 49 clarifies what would be considered of minor importance relative to something, providing that, save for a few exceptions not relevant here, Chapter 49 \"covers all printed matter of which the essential nature and use is determined by the fact of its being printed with motifs, characters or pictorial representations.\" Therefore, only printing that is non-essential in nature should be excluded from Chapter 49. Essential means relating to the essence of a product, necessary, something basic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   777 (Philip Babcock Gove, Ph. D. &amp; the Merriam-Webster Editorial Staff eds., Unabridged 2002) (\n   <em>\n    Essential\n   </em>\n   : 1: of or relating to an essence: as\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n   : having or realizing in itself the essence of its kind: having or consisting of the basic, most fundamental nature, property, quality, or attribute peculiar to or necessary or indispensable to its kind.\n   <strong>\n    b\n   </strong>\n   : forming or constituting the essence of something: making up or being the constituent or intrinsic character or very nature of a thing);\n   <em>\n    Shorter Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   865 (Oxford Univ. Press 6th Ed. 2007) (\n   <em>\n    Essential\n   </em>\n   : 1. That is such in absolute or highest sense. 2. Of or pertaining to a thing's essence). Therefore, if the printing does not relate to the essence of the product, then the product cannot be classified under Chapter 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Where printing has a communicative purpose, the printing comprises part of the essence of the product. Indeed, where a product's printing has a communicative purpose, one can reasonably surmise that the product as a whole is intended to carry out that communicative purpose. Logically, a communicative printed component is meant to transfer information. The product is the medium for the message, regardless of what other purpose it might have. Whatever the other functions of the product, the printed component becomes part of the essential nature of the product. The product not only serves whatever utilitarian function it may have, it also carries the message of the printing upon it to its recipient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Conversely, printing that is merely decorative-and thus lacks a communicative purpose-would not form part of the essence of a product. The General Explanatory Note to Chapter 49 also uses the term \"merely incidental\" in describing Chapter 49's exclusions, stating that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   On the other hand, besides the goods of heading 48.14 or 48.21, paper, paperboard or cellulose wadding, or articles thereof, in which the printing is merely incidental to their primary use (e.g., printed wrapping paper and printed stationery) fall in Chapter 48.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   General Explanatory Note Chapter 49. These examples describe printing that may be aesthetically pleasing, but not communicative. The printed wrapping paper and printed stationery examples make clear that a printed component that is merely decorative-and does not serve any purpose beyond aesthetics-should be considered incidental to the primary use. In the wrapping paper example, the primary use would be wrapping a gift, while in the\n   stationery example, the primary use would be writing on the stationery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant argues that dictionary definitions for the word \"incidental\" support its view that for merchandise to be classified under Chapter 49, \"the printing on the silicone bands has to be of greater importance than the functional uses of the bands.\" Def.'s Br. at 19. The definitions Defendant invokes do not support this view; although they establish that something incidental is less important, they do not specify the extent to which something must carry less importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. at 18-19 (citing\n   <em>\n    The Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/incidental (last visited May 9, 2019) (\"Happening by chance, or in connection with something of greater importance.\")), 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    The Collins COBUILD Advanced English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/incidental (last visited May 9, 2019) (\"If one thing is incidental to another, it is less important than the other thing or is not a major part of it.\"), 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    The MacMillan Dictionary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/incidental_1 (last visited May 9, 2019) (\"Related to something but considered less important.\"). All the definitions cited by the Defendant explain \"incidental\" as less important, similar to the definitions proffered by Plaintiff and found by the court. Defendant's suggestion that incidental includes anything the slightest bit less important than the primary use, however, is unfounded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 19. In fact, the definitions Defendant invokes include such language as \"happening by chance\" or \"not a major part of it.\" These words suggest that incidental means not just less important, but minor. Certainly, nothing in these definitions suggests that incidental includes everything but the primary use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, had Congress intended \"merely incidental\" to mean simply not the primary use, it could have said so expressly. Specifically, Note 2 could have read: \"plastics, rubber and articles thereof, articles with motifs, characters or pictorial representations, which are not less important than the primary use of the goods, fall in chapter 49.\" Congress did not draft Note 2 as such. Instead, Congress adopted the phrasing \"not merely incidental to,\" suggesting something more nuanced than a simple weighing of importance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant also seems to argue that where the merchandise serves a utilitarian function, that function constitutes the essential nature, regardless of what the printing conveys.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 15. Defendant's view of the General Explanatory Note to Chapter 49 is overly narrow. Where a product's printing component has a communicative purpose-even concurrently with a utilitarian function-its essence is more complex than Defendant suggests. Moreover, Defendant's interpretation of the General Explanatory Note would risk reading the Explanatory Notes in a manner that conflicts with the plain language of the tariff provision, a practice against which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has cautioned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    StoreWALL, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5649599\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/644/1358/#p1363\">\n    644 F. 3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1363 (citing\n   <em>\n    Airflow Tech., Inc. v.

Cir. 2008) ). The General Explanatory Note merely states that the chapter covers printed matter \"of which the essential nature and use is determined by the fact of its being printed.\" It does not state that wherever a product also serves a utilitarian function, printing may not constitute part of that product's essence, and the court will not read it as such. Defendant's construction of the Explanatory\n   Note is thus unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The dispositive factor is therefore whether the printing component has a communicative purpose. Where the printing component is designed to communicate information, it cannot be considered merely incidental to the primary use of the goods and should therefore be classified under Chapter 49. Such a reading is consistent with the meaning of the tariff terms and the language of the General Explanatory Note to Chapter 49 and the examples provided. Unlike a printed component that is merely decorative, such as that of wrapping paper or stationery, one that is designed to have a communicative purpose carries greater importance than something that could reasonably be considered merely incidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Merchandise at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   There is no dispute as to the nature of the subject merchandise. As described, the articles in dispute consist of ten different kinds of silicone bands, each larger than wristband size, and each containing some form of printed wording or motif. Compl. \u00b6 8; Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6 27. The court considers each individual band in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Production Order Q2201\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Production Order Q2201 consists of black silicone bands that are 279 millimeters (\"mm\") in circumference, 15.24 mm wide. Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6 29. The bands were ordered by a furniture company to bind together a stack of two to six heavy cardstock cards without making the cards buckle under the tension of the bands, while also displaying the company's logo as large as possible on both sides of the band. Def.'s 56.3 Statement [as clarified by Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, Jan. 29, 2018, ECF No. 53 (\"Pl.'s 56.3 Statement\")] \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30. The bands are imprinted with the company's logo, which consists of a square with the company's initials appearing inside the square, separated by a diagonal line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Entry Diagrams [attached as Def.'s Ex. 3] at 10, Dec. 23, 2017, ECF No. 49-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, the printing component is not merely incidental to the bands' primary use. The bands are customized such that the company's logo and initials appear twice on the outside of the cardstock cards. Further, the logo is printed as large as possible on the bands and spaced such that it may appear on both sides of the cards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Entry Diagrams [attached as Ex. 3] at 10, Dec. 23, 2017, ECF No. 49-1. The printing has a communicative purpose because it alerts whomever sees the bands to the fact that the cards pertain to the relevant company. Although the bands have a dual purpose-to bind the cards and to communicate a message-the printing of the company's logo and initials is not merely incidental to the bands' primary use. The court need not decide which use is primary; it suffices that the printing component has a communicative purpose and is thus not merely incidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Production Order P9427\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Production Order P9427 consists of red silicone bands that are 348 mm in circumference and 25.4 mm wide. Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. The bands were ordered by a designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control solutions for the\n   aerospace and industrial markets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The bands are imprinted with the words \"REMOVE BEFORE INSTALLATION\" in white lettering, and the company uses the bands to cover and protect certain aspects of its product during shipment, prior to installation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The sizes were custom-ordered to ensure the bands would fit on the part to be protected during shipment, and the red color was designed to call the buyer's attention to the bands' placement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The printing on these silicone bands is not merely incidental to the products' primary use. Again, the bands in question serve two purposes-to secure certain aspects of the product during shipment, and to convey information. Nevertheless, the printing component has a communicative purpose that cannot be ignored. The bands' red color-and contrasting white lettering-draw the user's attention to the bands' message, i.e., stop and remove prior to installing, thus underscoring the importance of the message being adequately conveyed. Def.'s 56.3 Statement [as clarified by Pl.'s 56.3 Statement] \u00b6 34. Indeed, it is critical that the band be removed prior to installation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 33-34 (noting that the band covers and protects parts of the product prior to installation and that the red color assists in calling user's attention to the band's placement);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Deposition Testimony of Paul G. Berlin, Sr. [attached as Def.'s Ex. 5] at 53, Aug. 2, 2017, ECF No. 49-2 (\"Berlin Testimony\") (noting that the bands convey the critical information to the customer that the bands should be removed prior to installation). Accordingly, the printing component for Production Order P9427 is not merely incidental to the article's primary use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Production Order P9938\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Production Order P9938 consists of red silicone bands that are 609.6 mm in circumference and 25.4 mm wide. Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6 36. The bands were ordered by a video game accessory company to hold together a seasonal special-offer bundle containing gaming accessories and a game product sold through a gaming store.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.

Although the bands serve the utilitarian purpose of bundling multiple items together to be sold in a package, the printing component has the communicative purpose of advertising for the gaming store. Indeed, the bands are imprinted with both the store's name and logo. The color of the bands matches that of the store's logo, and the contrast of the black and white lettering against the red aligns with the logo and draws attention to the bands' message, further illustrating the marketing-and thus communicative-purpose behind the bands. Such detail shows that the bands' printing component was designed not merely as a decorative feature but to communicate a very specific brand message. The printing\n   therefore is not merely incidental to the primary use of the article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Production Order Q1320\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Production Order Q1320 consists of maroon silicone bands that are 431.6 mm in circumference and 15.24 mm wide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.

Entry Diagrams [attached as Def.'s Ex. 3] at 21, Dec. 23, 2017, ECF No. 49-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The printing component on these bands is not merely incidental to their primary use. The bands convey the purchasing company's web address and its slogan, which alert users to the nature of the company's business and provide advertising for the brand. The bands again serve a dual purpose-to bind together business brochures and documents in a professional way and to convey information. Nonetheless, the purchasing company chose to have the bands imprinted in a way that gave them a communicative purpose. Users of the bands would know the name of the company and where to go to inquire about the company's services because of the printing. The court cannot therefore say that the printing is merely incidental.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Production Order Q1004\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Production Order Q1004 consists of translucent silicone bands that are 215.5 mm in circumference and 15.2 mm wide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. The bands were ordered by a supplier of printed and embroidered garments for the souvenir industry, which uses the bands to bind together a sweatshirt and a hat that are sold together.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [as clarified by Pl.'s 56.3 Statement] \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. The bands are imprinted with one of the following size abbreviations-XXL, XL, L, M, or S-indicating the size of the sweatshirt so that customers need not pull the hat and sweatshirt combination apart to identify the sweatshirt's size, an issue the purchasing company previously encountered. Berlin Testimony at 62-65; Def.'s 56.3 Statement [as clarified by Pl.'s 56.3 Statement] \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The printing component of these bands is not merely incidental to their primary use. The customized bands have a communicative purpose-the bands contain a description of the sweatshirt's size so that customers do not have to pull the sweatshirt and hat apart to identify the sweatshirt's size. Moreover, the information conveyed saves customers the hassle of taking apart the bundled products, saves employees the time they would have spent putting the sweatshirt and hat back together, and prevents confusion because the products remain bundled, thus reinforcing the message that the products are sold together. Accordingly, with a communicative purpose, the printing component of the bands in Production Order Q1004 is not merely incidental to the primary use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Production Order Q2372\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Production Order Q2372 consists of mustard-colored silicone bands that are 431.6 mm in circumference and 15.24 mm wide.

The printing on the bands serves the communicative purpose of advertising for the restaurant. The printing is customized to show the purchasing restaurant's name and logo in unique colors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   By including the restaurant's name and logo on the bands, the bands increase brand awareness for the restaurant.

The bands help \"reduce spinning out and slipping when you're doing exercise with a lot of rotational or sheer force.\" Def.'s 56.3 Statement \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The printing component of these bands is not merely incidental to the bands' primary use. The bands have a communicative purpose because they are imprinted with the product's unique name, as well as the words \"patent pending.\" Including the product's name serves advertising purposes as it communicates the brand message intended by the producer. Further, \"patent pending\" serves a communicative purpose by conveying to the user and the public that the purchasing company is working to obtain a patent on the invention. Although the bands certainly serve a utilitarian purpose-adding grip during exercise-the bands also have a communicative purpose that makes up part of their essence. Accordingly, the printing component of the bands making up Production\n   Order Q2287 is not merely incidental to the primary use of the goods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    8.

The printing on the bands serves a decorative rather than communicative purpose. The bands merely contain a number, and without greater context, it is not immediately discernible what the number signifies. The bands do not alert holders of the bands to any brand, any event, any source for obtaining more information, or any instructions pertaining to a product. Rather, the printing on these bands is designed to present the company's documents in a neat and professional manner.

The bands serve a communicative purpose by describing the type of service provided by the provider in question. Intuitively, the nine-word description of the service-provider is meant to be read. The printing component serves to convey information to viewers of the bands, thus forming part of the essence of the bands. Although the bands serve the utilitarian function of binding an informational booklet, they also serve a communicative purpose.

Incurred casually and in addition to the regular or main amount:\n    <em>\n     incidental expenses\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529583\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/359/1363/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 20 (citing\n    <em>\n     Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language\n    </em>\n    , 1996 Ed).

Finally, Plaintiff suggests \"1 : occurring merely by chance or without intention or calculation 2: being likely to ensue as a chance or minor consequence.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529583\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/359/1363/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 21 (citing\n    <em>\n     Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary\n    </em>\n    , 1976 Ed)). To the extent that Plaintiff's proffered definitions indicate that \"not merely incidental\" includes situations where the printing component is of minor importance or unimportant in relation to something else, the court agrees with Plaintiff's position.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Br. at 21. To the extent that these definitions also suggest incidental means \"accidental\" or \"unplanned\", clearly such a definition could not apply in the context of Chapter 49. Chapter 49 pertains to printed articles. Surely Congress, by including the phrase \"not merely incidental to\" in Note 2 to Section VII, were not attempting to classify printing mishaps. Such an interpretation is overly restrictive and does not align with a reasonable interpretation of the tariff terms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    If the essence of all bands with printing were merely binding, bundling, securing, and gripping, as Defendant suggests,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Br. at 15, it is hard to see why purchasers would incur the additional costs over and above buying simple rubber bands.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The company is [[ ]], and the bands contain a square with the initials [[ ]] and [[ ]] inside the square, separate by a diagonal line.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Entry Diagrams [attached as Def.'s Ex. 3] at 10, Dec. 23, 2017, ECF No. 49-1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The company that ordered these bands is [[ ]].
